Now teabags are set to go plastic-free","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"The war on plastic waste is extending to the UK’s favourite beverage, with a major retailer in the final stages of developing a fully biodegradable paper teabag that does not contain plastic. The Co-op is to make its own-brand Fairtrade 99 teabags free of polypropylene, a sealant used industry wide to enable teabags to hold their shape, and the guilt-free brew is due to go on sale by the end of the year. The scale of the problem is huge. According to the trade body the UK Tea and Infusions Association, teabags account for a whopping 96% of the 165 million cups of tea drunk every day in the UK. Anti-plastic campaigners have been appealing to consumers to use loose tea or “greener” options such as Japanese-style “pyramids” made of 100% compostable corn starch, but these are more expensive than mainstream mass-produced teabags. The Co-op, which sells 4.6m boxes of tea a year (367m teabags) has joined forces with its tea supplier, Typhoo, and Ahlstrom-Munksjö – specialists in sustainable fibre solutions – to develop a method of heat-sealing bags to eliminate the more widely used plastic seal. The biodegradable bag will undergo rigorous testing next month and could be on shelves later this year. It is intended to be rolled out across the Co-op’s entire own-label standard tea range and will be fully compostable in food waste collections. “Many tea drinkers are blissfully unaware that the teabag from their daily cuppa is sealed using plastic,” said Jo Whitfield, chief executive of Co-op Food. “Even though it’s a relatively small amount, when you consider the 6bn cups of tea that are brewed up every year in the UK, we are looking at around 150 tonnes of polypropylene – that’s an enormous amount of accumulated plastic waste that is either contaminating food waste compost collections or simply going to landfill.” But the UK Tea and Infusions Association warned of higher prices for consumers. A spokesman said: “The UK tea industry has been experimenting with non-plastic sealing methods, but those methods are costly. The raw material cost and upgrades to machinery would increase the cost of a bag by about eight times if we were to move to a non-plastic sealing procedure now. We know that a significant price rise would have a severely negative effect on sales and seriously reduce the income of farmers from some of the poorest tea-growing regions of the world.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/29/teenager-drinking-alcohol-consumption-kids","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-29T09:59:09Z","webTitle":"Alarmed about your teens’ drinking?

Maybe it’s yours you should worry about","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The myth that giving your kids an occasional glass of wine or beer will keep them safe from drinking too much has always seemed peculiarly British, and more connected with our complicated relationship with alcohol than with a real understanding of our European neighbours whose habits we believe we are following. And now comes proof that those people who say “Let them try it!” are misguided: research from the University of New South Wales has found that, compared with teenagers who had no access to alcohol, those who are given it by their parents are more likely to admit to later binge drinking or to have other alcohol-related problems. I’m completely unsurprised by the finding, just as I’m underwhelmed by the other discovery, which is that young people are more likely to binge drink as they get older. Far more significant than whether you give your kids alcohol, or allow them to have it at parties on your premises, or encourage them to have a sip when they’re young, is what kind of drinking you as a parent are setting as an example. Parenting, of course, is ever thus: never mind what I say, it’s what I do that counts. And when it comes to drinking, that’s a case of alas, alack. I have a busy and stressful life, like most parents in Britain today, and oh my goodness what I give for a cool glass of white wine at the end of a demanding day. But I’ve also got four daughters who are watching my every move and have been for more than two decades; and when I dive into the fridge and extract that bottle, and proceed to “chill” with my glass as a prop, I am undeniably displaying to them that when you’re a busy woman with a lot on your plate, this is the way to unwind. My daughters will not I think mind too much if I say that, from time to time over the years, there have been events in their lives that have been caused, or exacerbated, or fuelled by alcohol; and some of these events have been scary, and dangerous, and unpleasant for all concerned. But I don’t believe these wild drinking sprees are very much connected to my own or my husband’s drinking: I think having too many shots of vodka is a rite of passage for teenagers these days just as it was in my own day. I have friends who are teetotal, and I have had to scrape their kids up off the bathroom floor during teenage parties just as often as I have the kids of parents who do drink. It’s true, of course, that binge drinking can lead to a dependence on alcohol; but there are always other factors in becoming a person with a drinking problem. We all have complicated lives and complicated backstories, and no alcoholic is where she or he is because of one issue or event or situation. When it comes to being a role model, though, we should be honest about our influence. Too many parents worry about or bemoan external factors in their kids’ lives, factors they have little control over (access to alcohol, the influence of friends, advertising) rather than thinking about the big thing they can influence: their own behaviour. I haven’t given up alcohol: I enjoy it, and I believe that from a health point of view it’s better to drink a little than not to drink at all (although it’s far better to drink nothing, of course, than to drink too much). But I have become more self-aware around alcohol in front of my daughters. Sometimes these days I unwind with a cup of mint or rhubarb tea or a candlelit bath rather than a glass of wine. I drink alone far less often than I used to. I try to see alcohol in my own life as an aid to relaxation, ideally with others, rather than as a means of making it through. I want my girls to enjoy alcohol but not be dependent on it; and I don’t want them to think they “need” alcohol to chill. As usual with parenting, it’s what I do that really matters; and those words “have a sip if you like” are pretty much redundant, like most of the others. • Joanna Moorhead writes for the Guardian on parenting and family life"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"books/2018/feb/04/adulterants-joe-dunthorne-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-04T09:00:47Z","webTitle":"The Adulterants by Joe Dunthorne review – growing pains of a big kid","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/feb/04/adulterants-joe-dunthorne-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/feb/04/adulterants-joe-dunthorne-review","fields":{"headline":"The Adulterants by Joe Dunthorne review – growing pains of a big kid","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"In his third novel, The Adulterants, Joe Dunthorne captures the anxieties that come with being a British man in his 30s with the same accuracy, easy wit and telling detail he brought to his 2008 debut, Submarine. Like Oliver Tate, the teenage protagonist of that book, Ray is struggling with the transition to adulthood. His wife, Garthene, an endlessly patient nurse, is eight months pregnant, but Ray is scraping a living as a freelance tech journalist, churning out listicles for a pittance. Unlike some of the couple’s friends, property ownership remains a distant dream. Ray addresses his issues – insecurities about his marriage, his friendships, his worth in the world, and the impending shift in his responsibilities – by making a number of poor-to-awful choices. Most of these he blames on circumstance, societal pressure and, occasionally, his wife – but never on himself. He contemplates cheating on Garthene while drunk at a party only to end up getting punched in the face when it turns out his friends’ open marriage wasn’t as open as he had thought. He gets himself arrested. He begins to worry that Garthene is cheating on him. But while he has a gift for self-sabotage and is often extraordinarily selfish, Ray remains engaging and relatively sympathetic. Through Garthene’s interactions with him, you get a sense of how swiftly he is unravelling. Like Tom Lee’s recent novel, The Alarming Palsy of James Orr, The Adulterants examines the fragility of masculinity and the primal urge to provide. The novel takes place during the London riots and Dunthorne also touches on gentrification, as well as the economic and psychological gap between generations – Ray’s parents live a comfortable life in Suffolk in a house that has more than one spare room. There’s a particularly timely passage, too, about retribution via social media and public shaming. Dunthorne is a superbly economical writer – he crams an awful lot of plot into 173 pages – and one with a poet’s sensibility: a room is described as “uncle-scented”; a paper plate of baba ganoush is “smooshed” under a shoe. He is also properly funny. There are several snort-through-your-nose moments, including Ray’s encounter with a policewoman, when his every word exacerbates his predicament. But throughout, the novel’s comedy is always balanced by insight and poignancy. • The Adulterants by Joe Dunthorne is published by Hamish Hamilton (£12.99).

First I’ll have to do the angry penguin","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"“It’s a walk, for four steps. It can be a sexy walk, it can be a bit gangster. Doesn’t matter, so long as it’s your walk.” I am late for Ianthe Mellors’ At Your Beat dance fitness class, because I have never knowingly been on time for exercise of any kind, and normally that doesn’t matter: it’s just warming up and listening to someone talk about their knee injury. But today I am critically disadvantaged. I’ve missed the bit where you learn to kick with one foot and land on the other. I’ve also checked my walk repertoire: I have nothing sexy, gangster, or conveying attitude of any sort. I have a stomp, and I have an amble. One other guy, mercifully, is in a similar position; we have already eyebrow-bonded over our lack of a sexy walk. We’re still in the overture to Dua Lipa’s New Rules; we haven’t even started dancing. Mellors talks us through the steps. Some kicking, some arm-flinging, a lot of balled fists as if furious, and traversing of the floor with a chest-puffing motion as if flapping wings. The others are already looking pretty good, but I am focusing too hard to be intimidated, and also I still have that guy: the one who can’t do it, either. Thank God for him. On we go: hit an imaginary enemy with one hand, kick an invisible foe ahead, two decisive sideways steps, four salsa moves. It’s like kickboxing and Zumba, rocket science and running, simultaneously. Funny windmilling motion with the arms, dive to the floor, bounce shoulders up and down thrice (but not like a person stuck down a hole), slide one leg beneath body like a kid from Fame, arrive back at standing position. Whatever headroom I had for the choreography, I’ve reached the max; now try it with the music. “Talkin’ in my sleep at night, makin’ myself crazy / (Out of my mind, out of my mind) / Wrote it down and read it out, hopin’ it would save me / (Too many times, too many times).” Eight bars; what is that, 20 seconds? I thought that was easily enough steps for the whole song, if not an hour. But we’re not even at the chorus. “OK, now this move won’t feel natural, but imagine you’re an angry penguin,” Mellors says. When has a penguin ever been angry? No time for that now. We’re nearly at the third rule: “Three, don’t be his friend / You know you’re gonna wake up in his bed in the morning.” Quick sleep mime, then spin round and “lift your leg and your arse cheek, like you’re getting on a horse” to the climax of, “And if you’re under him, you ain’t gettin’ over him.” The difference between what I think my dancing looks like and what it actually looks like has never been starker. It is outrageously fun, practise-in-secret-at-home fun, fiendishly complicated, as energetic as an aerobics lesson and biochemically energising. I feel like a blob of magnesium dropped into a bowl of water. What I learned There is no such thing as malcoordinated, there are just people who need more practice than others"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"education/2018/jan/30/ofsted-reception-children-michael-rosen","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-30T07:00:12Z","webTitle":"Ofsted forgets our four-year-olds are not GCSE apprentices | Michael Rosen","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/jan/30/ofsted-reception-children-michael-rosen","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2018/jan/30/ofsted-reception-children-michael-rosen","fields":{"headline":"Dear Damian Hinds, Ofsted forgets our four-year-olds are not GCSE apprentices","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Dear Damian Hinds, Welcome to one of the most powerful jobs available to any politician anywhere. You can open and close schools, set up advisory committees, stuff them with whoever you want, sack any committee member and make sure such committees recommend your or your party’s line. Meanwhile, there are no longer any real powers invested in regions to act as a check or balance on whatever it is that you or your party thinks is a desirable thing to try out this year. Yet you don’t have to know anything about education, or to have spent time talking to parents, teachers, researchers, or state school children, or to have done any study that might enable you to assess and query educational research. Like me, you went to a grammar school. If you choose to, you can take your personal experience as the beginning and end of any evidence needed to justify expanding grammar schools and increasing the number of children who fail to get into one. Your powers will enable you to ignore or act upon the Ofsted report that recently landed on your desk: “Bold beginnings: the reception curriculum in a sample of good and outstanding primary schools”. Here’s the report’s second sentence: “For too many children, however, their reception year is a missed opportunity that can leave them exposed to all the painful and unnecessary consequences of falling behind their peers.” Schooling has been increasingly built around the idea that a proportion of children are “falling behind”. There are “falling behind” tables. My children are tested once a week and each set of test results announces the fallen-behinds. But the report holds out, in the midst of setting and streaming, a no-one-falling-behind future. Perhaps you will acquire the special powers to prevent anyone from falling behind anyone else. Apart from children being in an inevitable race to be not-behind, the report also assumes that the most important thing about four-year-olds is that they need to be pump-primed for what’s going to happen next. We’re told by Ofsted that if teachers get reception right, our children will get seven grade Bs at GCSE. I get the message: we should think of our four-year-olds as GCSE apprentices, though the report does give us a glimpse of childhood with two sentences: “[L]istening to stories, poems and rhymes fed children’s imagination” and“[S]ome headteachers did not believe in the notion of ‘free play’. They viewed playing without boundaries as too rosy and unrealistic a view of childhood.” It’s not clear why “imagination” is self-evidently good, while “free play” is “unrealistic”. Anyone who has spent any time thinking and writing about such things could as easily claim that “imagination” is “unrealistic” and “free play” is self-evidently good. However, to have this discussion would require the report to take up questions of children’s emotional, reflective, cognitive and conceptual life – what feeds it, supports it, undermines it and what endangers it. Funnily enough, these are things we parents think and talk about all the time. Perhaps, Damian, before you act on this report, you’ll start a conversation about children and childhood – because the authors of the report seem to think children are units on a conveyor belt.

I could listen to Darren on the touchline, and he knew what he was saying and his players were listening. In the second half, we had the control, more quality and we killed the game. “Alexis is a fantastic addition. The question now is always which one is going to be left out, but it’s not that for us. He has a bit more maturity and experience. And his choice for the counterattack of the second goal is a choice that Marcus is too nervous to make that decision. He will bring us this extra maturity. He was keen to play. I’m happy with his performance.” And with that, goodnight. Thanks for your company. A match report will appear here shortly. Bye! Ander Herrera speaks. “We had to work very hard,” he says. “It’s not easy to come here, these kind of games can be tricky for us but we took it very seriously. We can be very happy, because sometimes these games can be tricky. I think he [Alexis] can play anywhere, he fights for every ball, he runs for everything. We are going to enjoy him. But this is a team, and today we did it very good, all of us.” Jesse Lingard talks. “We had to make sure the attitude was spot on,” he says. “Everybody was ready to make an impact.” United score four in the end, but that was a valiant effort by the League Two side. They certainly did not disgrace themselves, even if it was pretty comfortable for Sanchez and co this evening. But this time, Romelu Lukaku hammers home from close range. That’s his 18th of the season. It’s Marcos Rojo who ends up curling a low ball across the box, on a plate for the United striker to find the net. 90+2 min: Lukaku is in for a moment but James sweeps the ball clear. 90+1 min: After winning the free-kick, Jake Gray plays a floating ball in from the right but Sowumni cannot find the target. He almost got too much on the ball and it bobbles wide. 90 min: Three minutes added time. 90 min: And there’s a birthday smile for Mourinho on his 55th. He travels through the Yeovil defence, with five green and white shirts for company, before firing low beyond Krysiak. That was very easy. 88 min: And Gomes almost scores with his first touches! He jinks inside and out of his marker before drilling the wrong side of Krysiak’s right post. 88 min: Marcus Rashford is replaced by 17-year-old Angel Gomes. 87 min: A neat Yeovil move ends up with Gray scooping over. They have not given up here though. They can take a lot out of this performance. 85 min: James’s short free-kick is played out wide to Dickson. His delivery is sumptuous. It’s high at the back post, but Sowumni nor Zoko can nod it goalwards. Another nice move down the left flank, though. A moment ago, Rashford had another glimpse of goal but James snuffed it out. 83 min: Connor Smith, once on Watford’s books, is on for Yeovil. He replaces Lewis Wing. Smith was on Football’s Next Star, the 2010 series, if anyone remembers that? 82 min: It’s on target but it’s pretty simple for Romero to gather. United storm down the other end but Lingard switches play, with Rashford assuming control of the ball down the left flank. 81 min: James does brilliantly in defence but his pass to Zoko is cut out. The striker was caught a little flat-footed. They soar forward again, though, with McTominay booked for a foul on the Yeovil striker. The Glovers earn a free-kick 25 yards from goal ... 79 min: Rashford has another effort at goal but Krysiak repels his effort. It just keeps coming back at them at the moment. 78 min: Lukaku gets a sniff at goal after good work by Rashford but he can’t quite get to the ball, as it runs out of play in front of the travelling United supporters. They’re enjoying themselves. 76 min: Lewis Wing stings the palms of Sergio Romero. Yeovil, just as they look as though they have nothing left in the tank, give it another real go. Dickson’s cross from the left is dangerous and then Wing drives at goal. It goes without saying but a Yeovil goal could change everything. 75 min: It’s a keep-ball exercise for Manchester United at the moment. Yeovil, whose team is practically an under-23 side bar the odd one or two, look pretty spent. 74 min: Yeovil are struggling a little bit with the pace of the game appearing to get away from them now. Again, as you would expect, really. Lingard and Lukaku are fresh legs on for United. But the hosts are still trying to rally. 72 min: Sanchez’s debut is over, as he is replaced by Jesse Lingard, who played in Darren Way’s testimonial here 10 years ago. Doubt whether he remembers that late substitute appearance, though. 71 min: Sanchez takes it, he punts it out to the edge of the box but it’s straight to Francois Zoko, the Yeovil striker. Can the Glovers get back on the front foot? 70 min: Carrick plays an exquisite ball into Sanchez down the left flank. Then McTominay takes over but Yeovil get bodies back behind the ball. McTominay drives forward again, snaking behind the Yeovil defence to win United a corner. They lead 2-0 at Huish Park. 69 min: Yeovil are readying another change, with Alex Fisher coming on. He only met his manager 90 minutes before kick-off after arriving from Motherwell this afternoon Jordan Green is coming off for the hosts. 67 min: United are falling like flies. Rashford is down and then Alexis Sanchez looks in trouble for a moment but he slowly gets back to his feet, that was after another crunching challenge. Mourinho’s incensed. 66 min: United look very, very comfortable now. They’re doing the minimum, really. 63 min: United have the ball in the net ... but it’s offside. Darmian with a brilliant low ball and Mata taps home from about one yard out. That’s the Spaniard’s last involvement, with Lukaku coming on to replace him. Ah. 62 min: Zoko involved again, the ball is parachuted into him and he tries some acrobatics to divert the ball goalwards. Valiant effort, and it almost came off for him. But United sniff it out. Meanwhile, Romelu Lukaku is readying himself to come on. Zoko goes up the other end and wins a corner for Yeovil ... but Shaw clears, before feeding Mata. Sanchez then finds Herrera and he lashes the ball from an acute angle with his left foot. A killer counterattack by Manchester United. 59 min: United have a flurry of chances, with Luke Shaw striking at goal before Rashford’s attempt, but Yeovil eventually clear. The ball just keeps coming back at them. This will be a big 10 minutes or so for the Glovers. Zoko comes deep to collect, and dig them out of a hole. 58 min: Mata is chopped down in central midfield by Lewis Wing. Carrick knocks it to McTominay and here comes another long spell of United possession. They’re beckoning United to come on to them. 57 min: United look a lot more comfortable on the ball, they’re keeping hold of it much better this half but Yeovil aren’t going quietly. 56 min: Yeovil tweak personnel: Rhys Browne, whose father played for the club, replaces Jared Bird. 54 min: Lindelof jumps so high he climbs right over the top of Surridge. That’s about the third rash challenge made by the United defender tonight. 53 min: Dickson’s left-footed cross almost finds Surridge but it’s headed clear by United, via the Bournemouth loanee’s forehead. A great searching ball in, but the chance has gone. 52 min: Yeovil suddenly look a little lax, understandably so in many ways. Gray momentarily looks as though he might be able to thread through Surridge but United cut it out. You can’t fault Yeovil’s application. 50 min: Rashford goes very, very close to his and United’s second. He has the Yeovil defence backpeddling, before driving low and just wide of goal. It’s deflected, and from the resulting corner, United shave the bar. 49 min: Darmian floats in a cross in the hope of finding Sanchez but it’s overhit and the Chile forward can’t get there. Next time. 48 min: Sergio Romero boots the ball straight out of play. Lovely stuff. 46 min: United are nonchalantly knocking the ball around the back before Sanchez is on the receiving end of another thudding challenge, this time from Omar Sowumni. Meanwhile, a lovely analogy to describe that Rashford goal, courtesy of John Delaney on email. “I’m a United fan but currently on crutches,” he says. “The goal reminds me of an experience I had on Wednesday morning on my way to work on crutches. There I was, ready to get on the train ... on crutches ... the door slides open. I was taking my time to adjust myself and get on the train when some rich arsehole barged past and jumped on before me.” Yeovil have a quick team huddle and the second half is under way. In the other FA Cup match this evening, Sheffield Wednesday lead Reading 2-0 in the all-Championship clash at Hillsborough. Jolly green giant, the Yeovil mascot, is having a whale of a time out there as the teams ready themselves for the second half. That will be upon us before we know it. Half-time signing klaxon: Yeovil have announced the signing of Ryan Seager on loan from Southampton until the end of the season. The 21-year-old, though, is not on the bench for tonight’s match. Half-time reading: Who to watch out for this weekend? And an interview with the Posh owner: Marcus Rashford’s goal four minutes before the interval is the difference at the break. Yeovil have been brilliant, barring that one moment of madness inside their own box. They’re still very much in it, though. 45 min: One minute of added time to be played at Huish Park. 45 min: Mourinho is itching to head down the tunnel, leant up against the away dugout. 44 min: Yeovil fly down the right and find a bit of joy through Jake Gray. His cross is blocked, though, and United look to close out the half. 42 min: James looks close to tears in the Yeovil defence – he’s distraught. But, he’s had a brilliant game up until then too. Ryan Dickson looks to have put his arm around his shoulder. That feels like a real killer for Yeovil. His indecision inside the box, with Krysiak unknowing as to what his defender was doing, as he was shepherding it closer and closer to goal. And then Rashford punishes them in the only way possible. United lead at Huish Park. Sanchez drives forward, plays it inside to Rashford but just as it looks as though the chance has gone, Tom James hesitates to clear and Rashford nips in to welly it home. And the inquest begins in the Yeovil defence. 40 min: Sanchez drags a shot wide from just inside the box. 38 min: Shaw looks for the overlap but Sanchez’s pass is cut out. Then Mata goes it alone down the right. Don’t want to speak too soon, but United have been pretty dreadful here so far. 37 min: Tom James strikes it with his laces, and it’s powerful but relatively straightforward for Romero to punch clear. Then Bird strikes at goal, before Yeovil again pump it into the box. The League Two side are causing United problems, that’s for sure. 36 min: A long ball downfield sees Zoko and Lindelof in pursuit of it. But there’s only winner, with the Yeovil man outmuscling the United defender and driving down the touchline. Great work. And now Carrick clips Jared Bird. Yeovil earn yet another free-kick. It’s in a lovely position, 20 yards out. Can they? 34 min: Sanchez is suddenly in acres of space at the back post. For a moment, the next bit looks inevitable but Tom James gets back at his man, who dinks a cross to the back post. Rashford can’t do anything with it and Yeovil hoist it clear. 33 min: Sanchez plays a nice give-and-go with Darmian. His cut-back is cleared by James, and it falls to Herrera. His effort is always rising though and that’s that. So far, so good for Darren Way and Yeovil Town. 32 min: Sanchez’s pass is wayward, and cue the “what a waste of money” chants. “Only here for the United,” comes the riposte from away supporters. 31 min: Jake Gray whips in right-footed but it’s straight down Sergio Romero’s throat. That was poor, especially considering they have already twice shown that they can get at United at set-pieces. 30 min: It was on target, his right-footed effort, but there’s not enough power on it to trouble Krysiak, who smiles as he smothers the ball. Yeovil fly forward up the other end, and win a free-kick themselves. 29 min: Nathan Smith clatters into Alexis Sanchez, and he gets a booking for it. That’ll be one to tell the grandkids. Sanchez bounces back up, to join the queue to take it. He stands over the ball, centrally, 20 yards from goal ... 27 min: Tom James this time launches a long throw from the right. Sowumni is again the target but he can’t connect. Down the other flank, Dickson surges forward but United nab the goal-kick. A decent start by Yeovil, and they certainly are doing themselves justice so far. 26 min: Superb defending from Tom James, just as Sanchez and Mata play a lovely one-two. Great stuff by the young Yeovil defender. 25 min: Yeovil suddenly seem to be treating the ball like a hot potato, booting the ball upfield in vain. Way is roaring his players on from the touchline. Mourinho? He’s rather more considered. 24 min: The Huish Park faithful make themselves known to Mourinho, just as United pour forward. It’s their best move of the match, and it results in McTominay drilling low, forcing Krysiak in a fine save low down to his right. That was easily United’s best, if their only chance so far. 22 min: Sanchez plays in Rashford, but the England striker overruns the ball, just as Krysiak looks to go to ground. The Yeovil goalkeeper pulls out at the opportune moment and they win the goal-kick. Meanwhile, Way is barking away, urging his players not to gift the ball to the opposition inside their own half. 21 min: Darmian’s cross is headed away by Welshman Tom James. Yeovil then look to go on another move upfield, with Middlesbrough loanee Lewis Wing driving through the middle. 20 min: United swing the ball in but it’s all bit hit and hope. They look to kickstart another move from midfield through McTominay. Underwhelming so far from Mourinho’s men, but you sense they will only need just one sniff of goal. 19 min: Now Lindelof fouls Zoko. He clatters the Yeovil captain, but gets away without a booking. Zoko, given a yellow card inside 60 seconds, seems a bit miffed. 18 min: Surridge v Rojo is already an intriguing duel. The Yeovil striker wins another foul and the United defender can have few complaints. Coming back to that Yeovil chance, it was Luke Shaw who Sowumni totally got away from to nod at goal. 17 min: United seek to gain some kind of control by knocking about in defence. They’ve flattered to deceive so far. 15 min: Great chance for Yeovil! Gray whips the ball in with his right foot, Omar Sowumni ghosts in unmarked but his free header is easy for Romero to deal with. A great chance, but he lacked conviction when it mattered. 14 min: Surridge buys a foul out of Marcos Rojo. Clever work from the Bournemouth loanee, although it brings a shake of the head from Mourinho. James pumps the ball back in towards the box and now Green wins another foul from Darmian. Yeovil will swing it in from the left, 25 yards from goal ... 13 min: No problem for Krysiak. And he whacks it back upfield, with Zoko the obvious target. Yeovil look to go again. 12 min: “What a waste of money,” is the chant from Yeovil supporters in the direction of a Mr Alexis Sanchez. United patiently move the ball from right to left, with McTominay heading back across goal before Sowumni boots the ball away for a corner. Sanchez will take ... 11 min: Jake Gray whips in a decent ball, with Sowumni the target but nobody can nudge it goalwards. United make a mess of it really but eventually clear. Another positive move from the hosts. 10 min: Jordan Green is finding lots of joy against Matteo Darmian. Yeovil win a corner out of the Italian right-back ... 9 min: Romero again forced to collect, after Tom James’s devious ball takes a couple of United defenders out of the game. Front-foot stuff from Yeovil and United have been sluggish out of the blocks. 8 min: United play a cross-field ball but Mata can’t get it under control. And now Yeovil win back possession. Encouraging start for the Glovers. 7 min: Green tests Romero! Surridge slides it through for him but he fails to get any real conviction on it. That was a real glimpse of goal for the hosts. Darren Way will be delighted with this start. United haven’t got going – not yet anyway. 6 min: Darmian whips in a ball from the right but Artur Krysiak, who was left on the bench when these sides last met here three years ago, comes out to collect. That’ll be a nice little confidence-booster. Yeovil have started pretty well here. Now Ryan Dickson readies a long throw from the left ... 4 min: Surridge and Zoko link well before Green is again busy, raiding through a couple of red shirts. United seize back the ball, and take back control on halfway. 3 min: Sanchez gets his first real touch, whacking the ball across to Matteo Darmian on the right flank. Now Green is fouled by the Italian and Yeovil earn a free-kick inside their own half. 2 min: Lindelof is put under some early pressure by Bournemouth loanee Sam Surridge. But the Swede hoofs it up into the air and clear. Yeovil have started with a real tempo, with Jordan Green – who worked nights in Waitrose until only three years ago – lively down the left. 1 min: Marcos Rojo is rolling around early on, after being caught by Yeovil striker and captain Francois Zoko. The Ivorian picks up an early yellow card. Maybe that’s a little harsh. Marcus Rashford gets us under way in Somerset. Knocking the ball back to Victor Lindelof. First, a minute’s applause for Jimmy Armfield. Huish Park is absolutely rocking, with the lowest-ranked team left in this competition about to host Manchester United. The handshakes are out of the way and kick-off is imminent. Sanchez embraces Carrick, who is making only his second appearance of the season while Sergio Romero, the goalkeeper restored here, adjusts his gloves. The teams are in the tunnel, Manchester United out nice and early, led by Michael Carrick. Here they come ... Mourinho talks. “He [Sanchez] had a couple of sessions with us,” he says. “We think the best way for him to adapt to us is to play. He wants to play, he loves to play so let’s see. Tonight is not just about Alexis, but about the FA Cup, and making sure it has an incredible tomorrow but not tonight. The Manchester United manager has just bumped into Bristol City boss Lee Johnson, a good friend and former team-mate of the Yeovil manager, in the tunnel. City knocked United out of the Carabao Cup last month at Ashton Gate. “I didn’t know they were big friends,” says the Portuguese. “I said is he coming to give some tips?” Of his new, extended contract, he adds: “It was a really easy decision. This is where I want to be, where I love to be and I’m really happy.” The BBC’s Dan Walker then promptly hands Mourinho a bottled cider. He looks baffled, because he’s “never tried” the Somerset’s finest export. Darren Way speaks. “It’s a great opportunity for our players to go up against one of the best teams in the world,” he says. “I think it’s important that we get in their faces, force mistakes and hopefully generate confidence. Yeovil include new signing, striker Alex Fisher on their bench. He’s driven nine hours down from Motherwell today, vrooming down the M1 before rocking up in Somerset. “He’s only just got out of the car,” Way says. Ten changes for Manchester United, with Carrick back in following that heart scare. I genuinely wonder what Alexis makes of Huish Park? It’s a proper old-school football ground, with wonderful green carpet in spots. Yeovil have not exactly rolled out the red carpet, but they did at least give the away dressing room a thorough once over and clean sweep. It is José Mourinho’s birthday, and also his 100th match in charge of Manchester United. The Portuguese turned 55 today. Will he mark the occasion with a victory in the West Country? He has already received an early present in the shape of a whopping new deal, until at least 2020: Alexis Sánchez’s inclusion from the off is the headline team news. He will wear the No7 for Manchester United tonight, playing presumably from the left in a front three of him, Marcus Rashford and Scott McTominay. There is a start of Luke Shaw while Ander Herrera makes his 150th appearance for the club this evening. For Yeovil, they are without former United trainee Otis Khan, who is serving the first game of a five-match ban for shoving the referee, Kevin Johnson, against Chesterfield last weekend: Good evening! Can they do it? It’s going to be helluva challenge for Yeovil Town but isn’t that, as they say, what the magic of the cup is all about. Darren Way’s side have struggled in League Two, so José Mourinho’s side ought to cause them all manner of problems. Only, it doesn’t always work like that. They have a knack for giant-killing, and although not quite the same, they knocked out third-tier Bradford City in the previous round. Alexis Sánchez will make his Manchester United debut at Huish Park this evening, while Michael Carrick and Marcus Rashford also feature.

It’s not the first time soaps have taken a risk with plotlines that went too far, went on for far too long – or both. EastEnders’ mystery bit on the side Sex’s answer to “Who shot Phil?” took up months of EastEnders in 2012: who was enjoying closet coitus with Kat? Theories abounded as she heaved lubricious glances at every Albert Square male. Aeons after everyone got bored, cigar-sucking wrong’un Derek Branning was revealed to be the lucky guy. By way of apology, the show killed him off days later. Brookside’s incestuous siblings Brookie loved to smash taboos, but some are more breakable than others. A lesbian kiss in 1995: hurrah! A 1996 plot with a brother and sister at it: whoa there. The suspiciously posh Simpson clan – insisting on red wine with lamb and so on – were indeed different, in that their grownup kids Nat and Georgia were rejecting sex with scousers and keeping it in the family. After months of viewers barfing angrily, N&amp;G left Liverpool … together. Emmerdale’s ill-timed plane crash It is a double NTA-winning soap heavyweight now, but in 1993 Emmerdale was quaint and slow compared to the competition. The solution: set fire to everything. A plane crashed into the village, turning all the dullest characters to ash. Job done. Plenty of viewers felt, however, that airing the landmark episode a week after the five-year anniversary of its clear inspiration, the Lockerbie disaster, was a stunt too far. EastEnders’ baby swap A proper, serious outrage, with complaints to Ofcom and a panicked, conciliatory statement from BBC director general Mark Thompson, followed the New Year 2011 episodes in which Ronnie Branning discovered her newborn son had died. The story of her stealing fellow new mum Kat’s child was meant to run all year, but overwhelming criticism from charities and campaigners prompted producers to resolve it months early. Coronation Street’s fraud conviction Soaps used to be able to hit a sweet spot where the controversy was immense, but nobody really got hurt. So it was in 1998 when all-time Corrie great Deirdre Rachid was jailed after falling for a fraudster. “Free the Weatherfield One” T-shirts were printed and phone lines were jammed for weeks. But with no rape or murder involved, everything was put right again before long, and Deirdre’s brief prison interlude turned out to be fun.

They brought her joy. I’d spent many peaceful hours in her garden room, keeping her company, watching the nuthatches, woodpeckers, goldfinches and siskins at her bird table during these recent years of illness patiently borne. She died in the last minutes of the old year, at the age of 88. A woodland burial was arranged at Boduan Sanctuary. Waxy-white clumps of snowdrops reflected in the hearse’s paintwork as she left her home for the last time. At the sanctuary wood’s car park we lifted her into a sturdy rustic cart with iron-rimmed wheels. On the narrow path into the wood, one of these ran over my foot. I imagined the quip this lively, humorous woman would have lanced my way, and changed position to push from the back. We held straps to lower her into the grave, and as we did so the sun’s barred rays threaded through the trees, traversed her wicker coffin, and illuminated the moss and the pale trunks of the silver birches. Twm Morys, musician and poet, played slow Welsh airs on his telyn farddol (poet’s harp). Her daughters spoke their eulogies at the graveside. Bramblings flitted among a rain-pearled delicacy of branches. Buzzards mewed overhead. Ravens chuckled to and fro on an opposite hillside. A priest officiated, through humanity and kindliness, eschewing dogma. Our friend had spent her last 40 years looking out to the hills above the birch copse where her corpse now lies. Years ago a Gaelic poet, Aonghas MacNeacail, told me that “in profound grief there is profound joy”. That insight is now tempered with a further understanding: that peace is attained through acceptance of the natural cycle, and death itself can become a celebration of life; while nature is the mirror and foundation for every resurrection myth. What a rightness, then, in the end, to be put to rest in nature. For my dear old friend’s daughters, the solace of this birchwood glade as place of retreat and communion, where their mother can become the trees, the flowers, all that draws sustenance from them, all the sweetness they give to the air. No amens here, only blessings.

The five parks, spanning 10.3m acres, were signed into law on Monday by Chile’s president Michelle Bachelet, launching a new 17-park route that stretches down the southern spine of Chile to Cape Horn. McDivitt Tompkins, the former chief executive of the outdoors company Patagonia, handed over 1m acres to help create the new parks. The Chilean government provided the rest in federally controlled land. McDivitt Tompkins has spent 25 years working on land conservation in Chile with her late husband Doug, who founded North Face and Esprit. Doug Tompkins died in a kayaking accident in Chile in 2015. “This is not just an unprecedented act of preservation,” said Bachelet, who flew to this remote Patagonian valley on Monday to receive the donation. “It is an invitation to imagine other forms to use our land. To use natural resources in a way that does not destroy them. To have sustainable development – the only profitable economic development in the long term.” The creation of the parks marks the latest in a flurry of environmental protection laws which have brought Chile to the forefront of worldwide conservation efforts. Last month, Bachelet – who leaves office in March – completed a five-year negotiation with residents of Easter Island to form one of the world’s largest Marine Protected areas, which will protect some 720,000 sq km of the Pacific Ocean. “President Bachelet is leaving behind a bold legacy of environmental protection,” said Maximiliano Bello, an advisor to the Pew Bertarelli Ocean Legacy program. “This is more impressive because Chile is still a developing country, with a long history of development and exploitation of resources – in most cases over-exploitation. If Chile can take these huge environmental steps, there are few reasons why developed nations can’t act as well.” After moving to Chile from California in the early 1990s, the Tompkinses spent hundreds of millions of dollars to purchase and “rewild” swaths of land. The approach hasn’t been without controversy: some locals bristled at what they considered a clumsy American land grab. Loggers and ranchers complained that valuable land was taken, and the couple were also criticized for successfully agitating to prevent a huge hydroelectric scheme. Relations have improved in recent years, with the handover of hundreds of thousands of acres to the Chilean national park service. McDivitt Tompkins has touted the ecotourism potential of a region of stunning beauty, with glaciated fjords, roaring rivers, snow-capped mountains and coastal volcanoes. In the windswept Valle Chacabuco, the couple transformed a rundown sheep ranch into the world-class Parque Patagonia. First, they removed an estimated 25,000 sheep, then removed 240 miles of fencing and retrained former ranch workers as conservation workers. “All of us who love the earth can see how the threats to wild places and creatures are growing,” said Tompkins. “This is crucial work – it’s the work we’ve been doing for decades.” Argentine’s centre-right president Mauricio Macri has praised the Tompkins model of conservation, which preserves wild land while bringing in tourists and related business to try to promote sustainable local development. In December 2015, Macri accepted a donation of approximately 370,000 acres from the Conservation Land Trust and McDivitt Tompkins, and announced his support for the planned Iberá national park, a 1.7 million-acre wetland that is home to hundreds of bird species, giant anteaters and wild macaw parrots and includes a breeding program to re-introduce jaguars. But opposition to conservation efforts remains strong in Chile’s controversial farmed salmon industry, which has been fighting efforts for greater regulation. Last year, local ranchers briefly occupied one of the Tompkins’ parks in protest against what they see as the removal of productive lands from the local economy. Patricio Ulloa, the mayor of Cochrane, the closest town to Parque Patagonia, rejected an invitation to the launch of the new park. “They have erased our history and there is no pardoning that,” he said. “That’s what we who were born and raised in this land of pioneers feel. They have never shown any evaluation that truly shows how this is going to benefit the community.” President Bachelet’s conservation measures are one part of her progressive legacy that is likely to survive the country’s looming change of government. Incoming president Sebastian Piñera – a billionaire businessman supported by an extreme rightwing coalition – has indicated his intention to reverse efforts to loosen the country’s draconian abortion laws and provide free university education to more students, but he is a keen supporter of the Tompkins conservation model. In 2004, Piñera purchased an estimated 250,000 acres of wild lands on the Chilean island of Chiloe, which he converted into Parque Tantauco – inspired, he said, by the Tompkins example."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/jan/30/the-smiths-reunion-mike-joyce-craig-gannon-morrissey-johnny-marr","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-30T13:58:17Z","webTitle":"I started something I couldn't finish: the Smiths reunion that wasn't","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jan/30/the-smiths-reunion-mike-joyce-craig-gannon-morrissey-johnny-marr","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/jan/30/the-smiths-reunion-mike-joyce-craig-gannon-morrissey-johnny-marr","fields":{"headline":"I started something I couldn't finish: the Smiths reunion that wasn't","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"There’s no panic on the streets of Salford, but there is something in the cold Monday morning air. A few days earlier, keen fans spotted something intriguing on former Smiths drummer Mike Joyce’s social media: a series of images bearing a musical note and Joyce’s surname, along with those of bassist Andy Rourke and short-lived “fifth Smith”, guitarist and sometime bassist Craig Gannon. Was it possible? A Smiths reunion in the offing? Albeit one with no mention of Morrissey or lead guitarist Johnny Marr. The news was formally announced in the early hours of 22 January: three-fifths of one of the most influential bands in British pop history were reuniting for a series of classical concerts, reinterpreting the Smiths’ hits alongside an orchestra. Come lunchtime, Joyce and Gannon were going to spill the beans. But, of course, this is the Smiths, a group unfamiliar with the concept of plain sailing. Bands live and bands die, but few do it quite as publicly, and Classically Smiths was already set to implode. The Smiths were formed in Manchester in 1982 by Steven Patrick Morrissey and guitarist Marr. They recruited Andy Rourke on bass and were casting about for a drummer when a mutual friend put them in touch with Mike Joyce. Joyce, 54, sits in a corner of a Salford Quays restaurant with Gannon, 51, and recalls his recruitment – playing hooky from his other band, Victim, to try out with the newly minted group. “I had a listen to their cassette and thought, ‘Wow, that sounds really good.’” They offered him the job and, after some soul-searching about leaving Victim, Joyce joined. He knew he’d made the right decision from the first time they played their 1983 debut single, Hand in Glove. “When we were rehearsing, it sounded great, but I’d never heard it properly because all I could hear was my drums. When I heard it through the speakers for the first time, I was like, ‘Wow, what exactly is this?’ People were asking me what we sounded like, and I didn’t really know how to explain it.” Gannon came to the Smiths much later, in early 1986. The release of their third studio album, The Queen Is Dead, had been dogged by legal disputes with label Rough Trade. Morrissey had sacked Rourke over his heroin use. Gannon was brought in to replace him – on guitar, he says, rather than bass – but Rourke was reinstated a couple of weeks later, and Gannon stayed in the band until October 1986. The posthumously released live album, Rank (1988), demonstrates the band’s pumped-up muscle, he says. “Me being there freed Johnny up a lot to embroider his guitar parts.” Despite the Smiths’ punishing schedule – five studio albums in five years, plus intense global touring – and their very public crash and burn in 1987, Joyce mostly remembers the good times. “You only had to look at the numbers of people who came to the gigs, at the amount of records we were selling, the reaction of the people when we played live, to know this was something special. It was 365 days a year, and I wouldn’t have wanted it any other way. The idea of having two or three weeks off – what for? How could it get any better? When you’re young, you think that’ll last for ever.” Which, of course, it couldn’t. In summer 1987, Marr called a band meeting in a Kensington fish and chip shop and told them it was over. He was leaving. “I was shocked,” says Joyce. “We all were, apart from Johnny. I didn’t see it coming. It wasn’t as though there’d been a big breakdown in communications or people hadn’t been speaking to each other for six months. I thought it might blow over, that it was a blip and we might just take six months out, but it soon became pretty obvious that wasn’t the case.” The Smiths were over, but there was worse to come. In 1989 Joyce and Rourke began legal action against Morrissey and Marr when it became apparent that the latter had each received 40% of the profits compared to Joyce and Rourke’s respective 10%. It was a messy, public spat. Rourke settled early; Joyce pushed on and it took until 1996 for a high court decision in his favour, with the judge calling Morrissey “devious, truculent and unreliable” in the way he withheld the real profit-sharing ratio from Joyce and Rourke. “I regret that it had to happen,” Joyce says. “I don’t regret that I went through with it. I was hoping to have dealt with it prior to going into court, but that wasn’t the case, unfortunately. But obviously I felt vindicated. Of course it hurt, being in a court room with three guys I’d spent five years with and for it to end up like that. It was difficult for us all.” Which brings us back to Salford and the prospect of these shows with the Manchester Camerata Orchestra. The plan: to play the hits, plus material from Strangeways Here We Come, the final album, which was never toured due to the split. Joyce and Gannon are brimming with enthusiasm. Manchester promoter Joel Perry pitched them the concept. “I thought, that sounds like a fantastic idea,” says Joyce. “I embraced it straight away. There were no second thoughts.” “A big part of it for me was that me, Mike and Andy would be playing together again,” says Gannon. “I mean, we last played together 31 years ago.” A week prior to the announcement, Gannon and Joyce got together in the basement of Joyce’s house in Altrincham and played There Is a Light That Never Goes Out, followed by How Soon Is Now. “It just sounded absolutely fantastic,” Joyce says, grinning, “and if it sounds that good with two of us …” Rourke lives in New York now, and wasn’t over for the Classically Smiths press launch on Monday. He’d been working on a new project with Cranberries singer Dolores O’Riordan prior to her sudden death. But he’s as up for it as Gannon and Joyce, presumably. A press release quotes him as being “thrilled and excited”. Joyce says nothing, and Gannon adds: “Well, I’ve not spoken to him recently. But there’s been a lot of email contact, and I’m sure he’s as excited as we are.” Perhaps that’s when alarm bells should have started ringing. Within hours of the interview in Salford, things had taken a very Smiths-like turn. Rourke issued a press statement saying it had been “erroneously reported” he was participating in the tour: “At no time did I give my consent for anyone in connection with this Classically Smiths project to act on my behalf or my name and nothing was ever confirmed, approved or contracted by me or my team.” His representatives stated that all parties were aware of this, and that the press conference and press release were scheduled and serviced to the media without Rourke or his team’s knowledge or approval. I tried to get back in touch with Joyce, and was told that this was an “incredibly stressful time”. He released a statement that said he now wasn’t taking part in Classically Smiths, either. It intimated that he had known Rourke wouldn’t be participating, but wasn’t authorised to say so on the morning of the press conference and had attempted to skirt the issue of his involvement in interviews. He concluded: “After much deliberation and soul-searching, I have decided that without Andy, an integral part of why I agreed to take part in the first place, I have come to this difficult decision. I still believe the shows and concept to be a fantastic idea and wish them all the success they deserve.” By Tuesday, Gannon had posted on Facebook – “with regret” – that the shows were off. (The post has since been deleted.) He claimed that the core trio had confirmed their involvement five months ago, but that Rourke’s alleged last-minute withdrawal came too late to amend the marketing materials. “It also meant that we were under obligation yesterday to go ahead with the press launch, which Mike and myself did, but were told we couldn’t mention anything about the situation with Andy. That’s unfortunate as the last thing we wanted was to mislead anyone.” (Neither Morrissey nor Marr have commented publicly.) The shows were being organised by Bad Production, a company run by Joel Perry, based in Manchester, and Elliot Marks in California. Perry was at the Salford press launch with Joyce and Gannon, but after it emerged that the gigs were collapsing, he responded to requests for an interview with a one-line statement: “In response to recent comments in the press, the planned Classically Smiths events will now no longer be taking place.” Perry and Marks ignored repeated appeals from the Guardian for clarification; Perry’s phone appears to have been disconnected. The reunion that never was died before it even got off the ground: a farcical second ending to a band whose legacy has already been tarnished by that court case, not to mention Morrissey’s pronouncements on race and Brexit. With Rourke saying he was never officially involved, and Joyce and Gannon maintaining that he pulled out at the last minute, this, too, could run and run. “I started something I couldn’t finish”; “I was bored before I even began” – the Smiths wrote their own epitaph plenty of times before this mess."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"money/2018/jan/27/savings-wheres-the-best-place-to-put-30000-plus","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-27T16:58:00Z","webTitle":"Savings: where's the best place to put £30,000-plus?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/jan/27/savings-wheres-the-best-place-to-put-30000-plus","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2018/jan/27/savings-wheres-the-best-place-to-put-30000-plus","fields":{"headline":"Savings: where's the best place to put £30,000-plus?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Every week a Guardian Money reader submits a question, and it’s up to you to help him or her out – a selection of the best answers will appear in next Saturday’s paper.

The prime minister, who spent part of her visit viewing a British initiative to remove tiny particles of plastic from the Yangtze river, stressed the importance of the Paris climate change agreement in her meeting with the Chinese leader, whom she had earlier given a box set of the BBC’s hit series Blue Planet II. In the meeting on Thursday the two leaders discussed the situation in Hong Kong, raised by May, amid growing concerns about the deterioration of free speech and democracy. No 10 said Xi and May agreed to reaffirm their commitment to “one country, two systems”, but Xi appeared to give no concrete assurances. “The PM and president agreed the importance of having frank conversations in areas where the two countries do not see eye to eye,” Downing Street said after the meeting as May flew on to Shanghai, where she will spend the last day of her tour. “They looked forward to further deepening their ties in the ‘golden era’, including in areas such as culture and education.” May also stressed the growing trade links between China and the UK but struck an overall positive note in a brief outline of the meeting, praising China as an “outward-looking country”. May and her husband, Philip, later took part in a traditional tea ceremony with Xi and his wife, Peng Liyuan, after the 80-minute bilateral meeting. When the British visitors were served Lapsang Souchong tea, Philip May exclaimed it was the same tea that the couple drank in Downing Street, telling Peng: “We drink that.” The pair met for talks at the Diaoyutai state guesthouse in Beijing on the second day of May’s first bilateral trip to China, which covered foreign affairs and security, as well as trade and cultural links. “As we both sit together as permanent members of the security council of the United Nations, there are global challenges which we both face, as do others in the world,” she said. “As you say, there are areas in which we can work together. I’m very pleased to be able to be here in China, to take further forward the global strategic partnership that we have established.” The prime minister opened the talks praising the “golden era of UK-China relations” – a phrase first used by David Cameron and George Osborne during Xi’s state visit to the UK in 2015. “Since then I think we have indeed achieved a great deal in enhancing the links between our two countries, both in terms of people links and also trading links – we now see trade valued at nearly £60bn [with] 600,000 visas issued to Chinese visitors to the United Kingdom,” May said, seated across the table from Xi and backed by the British and Chinese delegations. “I welcome the investment that has been made in the United Kingdom but also the growing trade links that we have between our two countries.” May said the visit had been “very successful” for the large business delegation that accompanied her. “But as you say the links between us go beyond trade. I’m very pleased with the people-to-people links we have been able to build on in education and in culture, too. Also as you say, we are both significant players on the world stage of outward looking countries.” Earlier in the day, May visited the Forbidden City and hosted a business reception at the British embassy. In an interview with Chinese television, where she delivered a New Year message, the reporter revealed Chinese commentators online had given her a nickname “Auntie May”. “A lot of Chinese people would affectionately call you, in Chinese, ‘Auntie May’, the interviewer said. “That’s really a kind of a call for Chinese – you’re one of the members of the family. Do you like that?” “I’m honoured by that,” May said. “Thank you.” Earlier on Thursday, the international trade secretary, Liam Fox, said the Chinese had a positive image of the prime minister, contrasting it with her struggles with the Conservative party at home. Fox said that was not the image Chinese leaders had of May. “They are looking at performance, they are looking to see what the UK is doing and they look at the prime minister in a different way than some of, let’s say, the internal tea room discussions in the UK do,” he told the BBC. “I sometimes wish that first of all people could see the prime minister the way that she’s seen in other countries in terms of the vision that she’s put forward for Britain and, secondly, I wish they could see Britain in the way that the rest of the world sees us and not the some of the internal commentators in the UK.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/feb/01/britain-must-retain-veto-over-new-eu-laws-tory-eurosceptics-warn","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-01T17:56:58Z","webTitle":"Britain must retain veto over new EU laws, Tory Eurosceptics warn","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/feb/01/britain-must-retain-veto-over-new-eu-laws-tory-eurosceptics-warn","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/feb/01/britain-must-retain-veto-over-new-eu-laws-tory-eurosceptics-warn","fields":{"headline":"Britain must retain veto over new EU laws, Tory Eurosceptics warn","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Eurosceptic Conservative MPs have warned Theresa May that maintaining a veto over laws that the EU might enact during the transition period after Brexit is a “red line” for negotiations. In a meeting with the chief whip, Julian Smith, on Tuesday, members of the European Research Group (ERG) also expressed concerns that the EU could try to impose taxes on the City. Britain is seeking a special “good faith” provision in its Brexit transition deal, fearing that the EU might exploit its position to impose new rules on the UK. The EU’s draft negotiating directives say that Britain will have to accept EU law as if it were a member state during a transition period. This has been interpreted by ERG members, who are ardent Brexiters, as a suggestion that there will be little flexibility. The meeting in Downing Street was called by MPs within the group to propose “red lines” to Smith, sources said. It appears to be further evidence of the influence that the group, led by Jacob Rees-Mogg, has over Theresa May. A source said: “The chief whip was in listening mode. The point is that we need some protection that amounts to a veto if the EU attempts to impose legislation during the transition period that is detrimental to the UK. “We can’t be in a position where are leaving and they can introduce anything on our country, including taxes. “It was put to the chief whip that we would not stand for a financial transactions tax. We want to keep the City ahead of the rest of the EU,” the source added. It follows calls by the European commission to open up an inquiry into British law to stop corporations from shifting profits to offshore subsidiaries. The ERG has been described as the most powerful opposition force in British politics, organising through a Whatsapp group with “a sense of discipline”. Senior Conservative ministers including Sajid Javid, Andrea Leadsom, Penny Mordaunt and David Gauke have helped fund the ERG, which has been accused of trying to oust the chancellor, Philip Hammond. Last week Rees-Mogg told parliament the EU might “find an incentive to move quite quickly” to legislate to regulate the City and impose a financial transactions tax. EU directives say that the UK could be consulted during the transition period on UK-related issues, but this would be on a “case by case basis.” Eurosceptics say they are concerned that the UK government will have no vote. Plans for a financial transactions tax across the EU have been proposed for many years but have faced major stumbling blocks around implementation. The second phase of Brexit talks, which will begin in March, will be dominated by discussions over the transition period. The UK will continue to abide by EU law for roughly two years after leaving but not have a role in any decision-making institutions. The UK will leave the EU on 29 March next year. The Labour party said last year it would raise at least £4.7bn a year through a new financial transaction tax. Labour’s proposals are separate from the financial transactions tax being discussed by EU member states. Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, promised a “reckoning” for those responsible for the financial crisis. Smith declined to comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2018/feb/01/elon-musk-sells-out-boring-company-flamethrowers-fire","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-01T10:58:23Z","webTitle":"Elon Musk sells all 20,000 Boring Company 'flamethrowers'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/feb/01/elon-musk-sells-out-boring-company-flamethrowers-fire","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/feb/01/elon-musk-sells-out-boring-company-flamethrowers-fire","fields":{"headline":"Elon Musk sells all 20,000 Boring Company 'flamethrowers'","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Elon Musk’s fire sale of his Boring Company “flamethrowers” raised $10m, selling out all 20,000 units, despite warnings from the Home Office and US politicians. The tech billionaire chief executive of Tesla, Space X and the Boring Company, tweeted on Thursday morning that all the $500 flamethrowers were sold out and that “all flamethrowers will ship with a complimentary Boring fire extinguisher”. The flamethrower success follows Musk’s sale of 50,000 Boring Company baseball caps at $20 a piece. Unsurprisingly, the sale of flamethrowers was not without controversy. Musk insisted that “obviously, a flamethrower is a super terrible idea” warning people to “definitely don’t buy one … unless you like fun”. He said that the flamethrower did not shoot flames further than 10ft so it was “A-OK” with the US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, leading some to speculate that it was a fancy version of a blowtorch, rather than a flamethrower. A Boring Company spokesperson told CNET that its flamethrower is “safer than what you can buy right now off-the-shelf on Amazon to destroy weeds. Much like a rollercoaster, this is designed to be thrilling without danger. Dangerous flamethrowers are already regulated and require a permit to own in California.” Regardless, the Home Office warned that flamethrowers were a prohibited weapon and that it was illegal for those under 18 to buy any imitation firearm. Musk also faces criticism from the US, with Democrat Miguel Santiago attempting to block the sale of the flamethrower within California saying that “if this is real, I’m outraged and you should be too. If this is a joke, then it’s a terribly insensitive one given that we’re coming off of the worst wildfire season in history. Either way: NOT FUNNY. NOT GONNA HAPPEN.” But with another sales milestone passed for his company that was established as a “personal hobby” to dig transport tunnels, for Musk it’s onwards and upwards. The South African business magnate teased that his next Boring company stunt sale might be another weapon out of the fantasy villain’s playbook.

He lived in Finsbury Park, north London, about 400 yards from the mosque he had attended for the past 25 years, located in Muslim Welfare House. On a warm June evening last year, Ali walked, through pain and with the aid of a stick, to join late-night prayers. It was Ramadan, an especially holy time for Muslims. Ali’s faith guided a life that saw him raise four daughters and two sons, and feel pride in seeing two of the eldest children reach university. Those who knew him knew a man who demonstrated the values of a model British citizen, despite hardships with health and money that would lead others to make excuses and embrace the worst values. Ali, 51, was about to come across one such person. In the weeks before that day, Darren Osborne had found a warped belief system, styling himself as an extremist rightwing “soldier”. On 18 June 2017, he left his home in Cardiff in a rented van and drove to London, looking for Muslims to kill. He scoured the centre of London for an Islamic pro-Palestinian march, and then moved on to the south in search of a mosque. By 11.30pm, he found a target in the north of the city. Having reached the Finsbury Park area, Osborne asked for directions to the mosque, and left his van to walk there, police believe, to carry out reconnaissance ahead of his attack. Just after midnight, prayers ended. As worshippers headed home, Ali fell to the floor, unwell, on a cul-de-sac off Seven Sisters Road. He was breathing, speaking barely audibly, but still alive. Other Muslims rushed to Ali’s aid, offering him water and help. For Osborne, the crowd, some of them wearing Islamic clothing, was the target he sought for his hatred. He was driving a rented white Citroën, which veered left across Seven Sisters Road, across a bus lane, and then across the pavement. Osborne was driving at 16mph (26km/h) as his van slammed into the crowd. It was the fourth terrorist attack in Britain in three months, but this time, the ideology behind it was not Islamist. Ibrahim Benaounda described the impact as like “being on a rollercoaster, spinning round and round. I felt everything. I felt my bones breaking”. Mohammed Geedi was also knocked to the ground. When he got up, he said he saw people “splattered all over the place”. Adnan Mohamud had called 999 for help for the stricken Ali. He was still on the phone when the van hit. Mohamud shouted: “Someone’s just come and run over a whole lot of people … People are dying, man.” One witness described a limb being stuck under the van’s wheel. Waleed Salim said he and others tried to lift the van to get his cousin, Hamdi Alfaiq, out from underneath it. Alfaiq, who suffered extensive injuries and needed months of rehabilitation, was one of 12 people wounded. The front van’s offside wheel ran over Ali on the upper right side of his chest, leaving a tyre track across his torso. Within an hour, he died, struck down 100 yards from where he lived. Watching were some of his family, who had been alerted that Ali had fallen ill. Toufik Kacimi of Muslim Welfare House said: “His daughter saw the van hit her dad.” Osborne fled the van. Despite his claims to the contrary at the trial, where he said he had been changing his trousers in the footwell while someone else drove, CCTV footage showed he was alone. He tried to escape, shouting “I want to kill more Muslims”. The Muslim people Osborne had tried to murder captured him, then saved him. Mohammed Mahmoud, the mosque’s imam, shielded Osborne from the crowd. He told Woolwich crown court: “I shouted ‘No one touch him’ [and] told people to get back, and said: ‘We are handing him in unscathed to the police’. “He should answer for his crime in a court, and not in a court in the street.” In the van, Osborne had left a note, which he had written 24 hours before in a Cardiff pub, from which he was ejected after making racist and anti-Muslim remarks. The note gave voice to what was inside him, and showed the attack was premeditated. “Why are their terrorists on our streets today? We’ve had three recent terror attacks …” Osborne wrote. It referenced the Rotherham sexual abuse scandal, which involved gruesome attacks by men from a mainly Pakistani, and therefore Muslim, background. It had led to claims that surfaced in mainstream media debate that there was something in the men’s heritage that made them target white girls. The note railed against the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, and the London mayor, Sadiq Khan. It mentioned the Islamist terrorist attacks on London and Manchester between March and June 2017. It echoed the talking points of extremist propaganda. Osborne launched into further diatribes while in police custody. But in contrast to some other committed violent extremists, he started to ramble about losing control of the van, rather than claiming the attack as a deliberate act of which he was proud. Commander Dean Haydon of Scotland Yard’s counter-terrorism command said: “He is a devious, vile and hate-filled individual.” Despite his violence, Osborne had not been a hardcore, long-term ideologue. Unlike Thomas Mair, who murdered the MP Jo Cox in 2016, he did not have a longstanding interest in extremist rightwing propaganda. Some of his behaviour in court was jarringly mundane. In the dock as the prosecution started its case against him, Osborne turned to one of his guards. She was young, female and black. Osborne smiled and winked at her. She smiled back, then turned her head out of his view and let the disgust show on her face. Sarah Andrews, his estranged partner, told detectives that Osborne was radicalised into a terrorist murderer in three weeks. Friends and family say there were no previous signs of racism or extremism. The catalyst, police believe, came three weeks before the attack, when his attitudes began to metastasise after he watched Three Girls, a BBC TV drama about the Rochdale grooming scandal. He also read extremist rightwing propaganda online that left him “brainwashed” and a “ticking timebomb”. Paul Gill, a terrorism expert and senior lecturer at at University College London, said radicalisation can be rapid, making it almost impossible to detect. “It is rare, but violent extremism can occur quickly,” he said. “Brusthom Ziamani was a Jehovah’s Witness three months prior to his arrest for an Isis-inspired plot. It is usually expedited by primitive attack plans and a history of criminal activity and violence.” Andrews, for her part, said she believed Osborne had become angry “about seeing young girls exploited” and developed his fixation with Muslims from that point. “In recent weeks, he has become obsessed with Muslims, accusing them all of being rapists and being part of paedophile gangs,” she said. Osborne gorged on social media postings by the former EDL leader Tommy Robinson, as well as members of the far-right group Britain First. Like much of the modern British far right, it rails against multiculturalism and Muslims. Osborne had not worked for a decade and had mental health issues, as well as problems with alcohol and drug abuse. He had convictions for violence, once serving a two-year jail term, and had an unpredictable temper. Haydon confirmed that none of the material Osborne viewed from the extreme right crossed the line into being either criminal or breaking terrorism laws. “We are concerned about the role the internet played in this case,” he said. Some see the pathway to Osborne’s extreme rightwing views being smoothed by some mainstream media opinion allegedly demonising all Muslims for the atrocities and violent extremist views of a small minority. Harun Khan, the secretary general of the Muslim Council of Britain, said: “Osborne was motivated by anti-Muslim groups and Islamophobic tropes not only prevalent in far-right circles, but also made acceptable in our mainstream. The case tells us that we must all exercise caution when tempted to stigmatise any group of people.” Security officials fear Osborne may be more than a one-off. They are concerned about extremist rightwing attacks being incited in the same way as Islamist violence: insidious propaganda cast out wide online, only needing some people to be infected by it to believe they should carry out violence. The consequent effects on society would be, to put it mildly, destabilising. One senior counter-terrorism source told the Guardian that extremist rightwing activity was on the increase and a growing threat to national security. But there were also concerns that violence from Islamists and white terrorists would become symbiotic, citing the fear of each other to bolster support for their calls to terrorism. The government has banned three far-right groups, and counter-terrorism sources say operations targeting the extreme right are increasing. Haydon said 30% of referrals to Prevent concern domestic extremism. Gill said: “If you’ve got nothing else going on in your life and experience personal grievances, then rightwing propaganda helps turn your sadness from something personal into something much bigger.” Osborne’s rage came as his life had stalled, and the hatred from extremist propaganda spoke to, then exacerbated, his existing demons. It was a tragedy for Ali’s family that Osborne found his voice only in such dangerous and destructive language."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/feb/02/edward-hoppers-night-windows-evoking-voyeurism-and-intrigue","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-02T09:59:40Z","webTitle":"Edward Hopper’s Night Windows: evoking voyeurism and intrigue","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/feb/02/edward-hoppers-night-windows-evoking-voyeurism-and-intrigue","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/feb/02/edward-hoppers-night-windows-evoking-voyeurism-and-intrigue","fields":{"headline":"Edward Hopper’s Night Windows: evoking voyeurism and intrigue","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Modern life… Edward Hopper’s paintings have defined our idea of the modern urban world.

Women Who Work was conceived, its author has said, after she appeared on The Apprentice years ago and received “a flood of letters from young women asking for guidance”. This made her realise “the need for more female leaders to speak out publicly in order to change the way society thinks and talks about ‘women who work’”. Unfortunately, it seems that not that many people wanted to listen. According to Forbes, the book sold 31,900 copies between publication in May 2017 and the end of the year. Crunching the numbers, Forbes says this means the book has earned around $1.1m (£772,000), of which the publisher will have received $566,000. But it paid an estimated $787,500 advance, with a second advance instalment to follow. Forbes estimates that this means Portfolio – which has yet to comment - has lost “at least” $220,000 on the book. Publisher Melville House puts the sum higher, speculating that Portfolio might be down as much as $500,000, and adding that “the upshot of all of this is the observation that Ivanka has mastered her father Donald’s greatest skill: convincing people to take on absurd amounts of risk, while paying for the privilege”. Ivanka can, perhaps, comfort herself by looking at the august company in which she now finds herself. TV presenter Anthea Turner was paid £400,000 by Little, Brown for the honour of publishing her life story back in 2000. Fools Rush In (“the story of what it’s really like to live on ‘Planet Fame’ and the price its inhabitants often have to pay”) sold 451 copies in its first week and entered the bestseller charts at No 531. Pippa Middleton also landed a rumoured £400,000 advance for her party-planning book Celebrate; it sold around 2,000 copies in its first week. Middleton was later reported to have been dropped by her publisher because of its poor sales. Julian Assange, meanwhile, was paid an advance of £412,000 for his so-called “unauthorised” autobiography. Amid fallings out with his publisher (which put the book out against his wishes), the book sold just 644 copies in its first three days on sale. In 2006, Wayne Rooney was paid £5m by HarperCollins for five books over 12 years. According to the Daily Mail, his second title, My Decade in the Premier League, sold just 6,000 copies in six weeks. Arnold Schwarzenegger made a reported seven-figure advance for his autobiography, Total Recall. It sold 21,000 copies in its first week – but that figure dropped to 6,000 by the second, said the Hollywood Reporter. Forbes calculates that Ivanka would have to sell more than 200,000 copies of Women Who Work in order to earn out her advance – the point at which she would start being paid royalties. Perhaps she might consider taking a tip or two from Michael Wolff, whose insider account of the Trump White House, Fire and Fury, sold more than 324,000 copies in the US last week – and is, according to Mother Jones, on track to eclipse even The Art of the Deal."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/feb/01/may-move-restrict-new-eu-migrants-after-brexit-long-planned-policy","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-01T13:49:51Z","webTitle":"May's move to restrict new EU migrants after Brexit is long planned | Alan Travis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/feb/01/may-move-restrict-new-eu-migrants-after-brexit-long-planned-policy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/feb/01/may-move-restrict-new-eu-migrants-after-brexit-long-planned-policy","fields":{"headline":"May's move to restrict new EU migrants after Brexit is long planned","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Theresa May’s sudden demand that new EU migrants to Britain after March 2019 lose their right to settle in the UK has been greeted as a surprise spanner in the works of the Brexit negotiations. But in fact, as the details of a Home Office draft Brexit immigration paper leaked to the Guardian in September show, it has been a long-planned policy designed to ensure that for all but the mostly highly skilled the role of European migrants in post-Brexit Britain is to be limited to that of a temporary workforce. May’s references in China to the need during the two-year Brexit transition period for new EU migrants to get mandatory residence permits, possible restriction on access to benefits and services for those who don’t and the loss of any long-term right to settle in Britain shows that ambition is very much alive. Downing Street tried to dismiss the Home Office leak at the time as a “very early draft”, implying that much had changed since September. But it spells out in very clear detail how a system of two-year temporary residence permits for all but the most highly skilled might work. The leaked document makes clear how “freedom of movement” will initially be maintained, allowing any EU citizen to come to Britain to work or study on a temporary residence permit – five years for the highly skilled and two years for all other workers – but once they expire after full Brexit day in March 2021 the game will change. As the Home Office put it, temporary residence permits would be required – as they are in many other EU countries – for those who wanted to stay beyond the first three months. “They will be able to do so from within the UK [and we will look into registration from abroad if there is sufficient demand]. If eligible, we will issue them with permission to stay (temporary leave to remain), evidenced by a residence permit. Once that registration period has expired, EU citizens will need to apply for further leave under the rules in force at that time under the future system for EU nationals,” it says. The Home Office argues that it can “build on the free movement directive” by requiring applicants to produce evidence of a job offer and pass a minimum earnings threshold to secure a residence permit. They concede, however, that banning jobseekers or the unemployed would not be consistent with the free movement directive. As for the longer term, the Home Office plan includes offering professionals and the highly skilled who come during the transition period five-year permits with the right to settle longer with their families in Britain. The options for all other European migrants, especially the lower skilled, suggest they would lose the right to settle, as May has now publicly suggested. “We will seek views on the settlement rights for other EU citizens but there will be no expectation of settlement for those arriving during the implementation period who are not in a designated settlement category such as highly skilled workers,” it states. The other options canvassed by the Home Office include a stronger resident labour market test for vacancies to ensure priority for British workers, banning EU migrants who come to Britain without a job offer and want to look for work, and imposing a cap or a salary threshold on the numbers of lower-skilled workers. Similar proposals were floated this week by the centre-right thinktank Policy Exchange, which went as far as suggesting that priority visas should only be given to low-skilled EU migrants willing to work at night or other antisocial hours. It is no wonder that EU negotiators thought a deal had been done on citizens’ rights after the UK conceded that freedom of movement would continue until March 2021 as well as the jurisdiction of the European court of justice. The prime minister may be relying on the claim that she is maintaining freedom of movement for all EU citizens during the two-year transition period but is not willing to guarantee any further rights beyond that. It may or may not work, but it shows that her “hard Brexit” immigration proposals detailed in that Home Office document are very much alive."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development/2018/feb/02/hundreds-of-millions-of-children-in-school-but-not-learning-world-bank","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-02T07:00:45Z","webTitle":"Hundreds of millions of children in school but not learning","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/feb/02/hundreds-of-millions-of-children-in-school-but-not-learning-world-bank","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2018/feb/02/hundreds-of-millions-of-children-in-school-but-not-learning-world-bank","fields":{"headline":"Hundreds of millions of children in school but not learning","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"More than 260 million children worldwide are out of school, yet more than half of those in education are not learning, the World Bank has warned. The global push to ensure free primary and secondary education by 2030 has helped fuel a “trade-off of quality for quantity”, whereby children are spending several years in school yet remain unable to read, write or do basic sums, according to Jaime Saavedra, who leads the global education practice at the bank. “This is a learning crisis, and we call it a crisis because we need to recognise the magnitude of the problem: it is extremely large,” Saavedra told the Guardian. “We are in deep trouble, because we are extremely far from where we should be. We have hundreds of millions of children who are in school who are not learning. “If you take the average [figures] from developing countries for which we have data, about 56% of the kids who are in school are not learning. In sub-Saharan Africa, the number is about 90%. It’s an overwhelming problem.” On Friday, a high-level education financing conference will convene in Dakar, Senegal, with the aim of raising $3bn (£2.1bn) to support the education of 870 million children in the 89 countries where 78% of the world’s out-of-school population live. The Global Partnership for Education – a multilateral organisation comprised of governments, foundations and private donors – is also expected to push poorer countries to increase their domestic education expenditure to 20% of national budget. Despite a universal pledge to ensure free primary and secondary education by 2030, governments are largely failing to address adequately key issues associated with learning, such as the cost of uniforms, transport to and from school, and lodging, activists claim. The cost of food, clothing, stationery and books means families are often unable to afford to send their children to school even if tuition is free, said Lucy Lake of the Campaign for Female Education (Camfed), a Cambridge-based organisation dedicated to the education of girls and young women in Africa. Lake said: “The notion of free secondary education can overshadow some of the costs that are still very real for the most marginalised children – especially girls – and unless there are targeted mechanisms to ensure those needs are met, those girls will continue to be excluded from the system, or, if they are in the system, marginalised within the system.” Children’s lack of access to school, the failure of schools to retain their students, and the “learning crisis” are key problems that the global community needs to address to meet educational targets, say campaigners. According to Unesco, 264 million children are out of school for the third year running. “Low-income countries have made meaningful progress in ensuring primary education, but secondary education still remains out of reach for millions of children,” said Elin Martínez, children’s rights researcher at Human Rights Watch (HRW). “Countries that have pledged to provide free secondary education should make good on these promises and those that have not, should follow suit.” Only half of all developing countries have the metrics to measure learning at the end of primary and lower-secondary school. Without those tools, it is nearly impossible to chart schools’ progress or rate national policy on education. Experts have warned that the “learning crisis” is widening social gaps instead of narrowing them, as young adults emerge from school without basic life skills. Senegal, which is co-hosting the funding conference with France, provides free education for children aged between six and 16, yet research by HRW found that government secondary schools were charging annual fees of more than 50,000 francs (£67), forcing many students to drop out. All governments attending the conference should make a legally binding pledge to support free education, said Martínez. “Governments serious about meeting their education commitments for all children will need to show how they plan to make fully free primary and secondary education a reality.” Last year, the international development committee pushed Britain to tackle the global learning crisis by boosting its spending from 8% to 10%. Evidence presented to the committee showed the average spend on each child in low- and middle-income countries to be less than $10 a head annually. New research shows that for every $100 spent on girls’ education through the Camfed programme, the impact is equivalent to two extra years in school. The programme, which is supported by the Department for International Development, focuses on secondary schooling for girls from marginalised communities in Tanzania. Bursaries aimed at helping students in key areas play a crucial role in getting and keeping children – particularly girls – in school, said Lake. “We need to develop targeted financing mechanisms for these [everyday] costs, such as decent clothing, just for a girl to be able to walk through the school gates and participate in class without feeling ashamed, which puts her on the back foot.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/feb/01/dany-cotton-london-fire-chief-sexist-abuse-over-firefighter-sam-campaign","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-01T11:41:07Z","webTitle":"London fire chief tells of sexist abuse over 'firefighters' campaign","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/feb/01/dany-cotton-london-fire-chief-sexist-abuse-over-firefighter-sam-campaign","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/feb/01/dany-cotton-london-fire-chief-sexist-abuse-over-firefighter-sam-campaign","fields":{"headline":"London fire chief tells of sexist abuse over 'firefighters' campaign","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The head of the London Fire Brigade has said she was bombarded with abuse and had hate mail sent to her workplace after launching a campaign to encourage people to refer to “firefighters” rather than “firemen”. Dany Cotton, the first female commissioner of the LFB, said the campaign was about allowing both boys and girls to follow whatever path they wanted, but the backlash she received had made her feel isolated. “The backlash I’ve had – the vitriol, the spite, the unpleasantness – truly horrified and shocked me. And it showed me we’ve got a long way to go,” she said. “For a little while it made me want to back off and hide in a cave because it was shocking. I had letters of hate written to me at work.” Speaking at a event entitled “Gender Equality: will it take another 100 years” organised by the Young Women’s Trust, Cotton revealed the sexism she has faced throughout her 30-year career at the LFB. Asked whether she supported quotas in industries dominated by men, she warned that women promoted during quota periods could suffer because of positive discrimination. “For every single rank promotion I’ve got I have been told, every single time, that I’m going to get the job because I’m the only woman on the panel – even the job I’ve got now. Which is quite bizarre, really,” she said. Cotton said that she had received abuse after suggesting that Fireman Sam should be renamed Firefighter Sam as part of a campaign to encourage more women to consider a role in the fire brigade. “I have nothing against him. I don’t want to kill him,” she joked. “Secondly, he is not real. He is not a person, he is a cartoon – I just want him to join us and call himself a firefighter ... But by saying that people [were] so full of this craziness that it made me think we have to do this together.” Cotton, who still heads up a women’s network within the fire brigade, said it was time for women to stop apologising for wanting equality. “We all have a part to play and one of the first things we have to do is stop apologising for it. Stop being sorry for being women. Stop being sorry for wanting fairness, equality and rights. Because it isn’t something we need to apologise about,” she said. Cotton has 102 fire stations, 4,800 uniformed firefighters and 800 other staff under her command and is responsible for frontline response to emergencies in London. Last year she spoke publicly about speaking counselling after the Grenfell fire, saying she had been unable to sleep. Cotton urged the women at the event held at City Hall to “reach out and support” each other. “Because I felt quite lonely for a while when I started doing that, [...] and people said why aren’t you concentrating on more important matters,” she said. “But equality is important. It’s about how life should be, not about obtaining it in 100 years, it’s about us doing it now, doing it collectively in small areas working together and standing up for what is right and what should be happening.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2018/feb/01/readers-travel-photography-competition-february-win-an-amazing-trip-to-greenland","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-01T11:13:04Z","webTitle":"Readers’ travel photography competition – February: win an amazing trip to Greenland","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/feb/01/readers-travel-photography-competition-february-win-an-amazing-trip-to-greenland","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2018/feb/01/readers-travel-photography-competition-february-win-an-amazing-trip-to-greenland","fields":{"headline":"Readers’ travel photography competition – February: win an amazing trip to Greenland","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Whether you took it in Paignton or Patagonia, enter your best travel shot in our monthly competition.

The Bucks bantersaurus was pretty much unknown back then. Sure, he’d acted in Fat Friends and The History Boys to some acclaim, but he showed no sign of becoming the cultural equivalent of chlamydia, Brexit or ads for Graze boxes. It was Gav’n’Stace that propelled Corden to intergalactic domination. Even though he was neither Gav nor Stace. Co-created with Ruth Jones, the Anglo-Welsh sitcom’s secret was that it was never really about the titular twosome. Sure, they gave the story its Billericay-meets-Barry premise but they were also smugly dull in that way loved-up couples can be. They were ITV material, not Bafta-winning BBC gold standard. Instead, it was scene-stealers such as sarky goth Nessa (Jones), ultra-lad Smithy (Corden) and tragicomic Uncle Bryn (Rob Brydon) who turned the series into a 00s phenomenon. And any show that can casually reel off Alison Steadman, Sheridan Smith and Julia Davis among its supporting cast has got to be something special. And for a couple of series back there, Gavin &amp; Stacey was very special. As well as its stellar cast and cute set-up, it was gorgeously written: well-observed and instantly charming. It blended the beige romance of Tim and Dawn from The Office with The Royle Family’s domestic warmth and the romcom twists of a Richard Curtis flick. It teemed with loving details. The serial killer surnames (Shipman, West and Sutcliffe). How Nessa hinted at a dark past of sexual acrobatics with celebrities. The bantz of the Essex boys, with their catchphrases, curries and greeting of “Gav-lar!” “Smithster!” before breaking into a robo-dance. The nicknames of their posse: Dirtbox, Deano, Fingers, Jesus, Swede and, of course, Chinese Alan (“Someone order a Chinese?”). Over two series, Gavin &amp; Stacey rose from word-of-mouth BBC Three hit to primetime BBC One. Ratings grew from a humble 543k to a hefty 10.25m. Sadly, it was during the third and final run that G&amp;S J’ed the S. The debut series barrelled along with the momentum of a burgeoning romance, from first date to wedding. The second saw Stacey move to Essex, marital strife and Nessa having Smithy’s baby. The third repeated itself: Gav moved to Wales this time, there was another wedding (Nessa to Dave Coaches), another pregnancy (Stacey’s). It was still very good, just not great any more. Wider success meant the show lost its tight focus. There were charity singles, Smithy’s Sport Relief sketches, crowbarred-in cameos from Noel Hear’Say and John Prescott. It worked better as cult gem than mainstream juggernaut. Jones and Corden have wisely resisted all temptation to revive it. While his three co-stars – Jones, Joanna Page and Mat Horne – settled into low-key careers, Corden went on to transatlantic ubiquity.

I’d been to see the GP before the holidays, who confirmed I was suffering from stress. I was reluctant to go to the doctor, but my family and colleagues had commented that I wasn’t myself. My GP suggested I rest over the break and return for another appointment after Christmas to see if things had improved. Unfortunately, that was unlikely to happen. My GCSE students had recently sat their mock exams, leaving me with more than 170 papers to mark. Each paper takes around an hour, meaning I didn’t have much of a Christmas break. Instead of spending time with my family, I was trapped in my office, correcting the same spelling mistakes and spliced commas on each and every paper, the pain in my back building as I sat hunched over the desk for five, six, seven hours at a time. It seemed as though the end would never come. I felt ill, overworked, and powerless to change my situation. I stopped doing the things I loved: watching my local football team at the weekends, seeing my close friends in the evenings, and doing regular exercise to keep myself fit. It was clear that I’d been consumed. The deadline came, and I still hadn’t completed the papers. I had to make my apologies to the school leadership. “I won’t be able to get these done,” I confessed, ashamed. I knew my colleagues from other departments had completed theirs on time. But I was also angry. The volume of work I had, due to my subject, was much larger. Even within my department, I’d been allocated more work than other staff because I teach more kids. And despite raising my concerns about getting everything done in time before the holidays, I’d simply been told, unsympathetically, to do my best. The response to my tardiness was similar, even weeks later: “Well, you need to get them done. I’ll give you an extra week.” It was something that looked like compromise, albeit still undoable. The week passed. Despite putting in 20 hours of work over the weekend, on top of all of the usual jobs teachers are expected to do, I was still nowhere near reaching the revised deadline. In the end, in desperation, I called in sick to give me time to finish the marking. The kids wouldn’t have their teacher in their lessons, but I believed a cover teacher could do just as good a job as I would do in my current state. I felt lethargic and couldn’t sleep. I spent three days, working 10 hours a day, to clear the backlog. I went to see my GP again and they offered to sign me off for a couple of weeks to get my head back together. I said no. I would feel too guilty – I know more absence would put extra pressure on my colleagues and disrupt my students. And I didn’t want to become another one of the 3,750 teachers on long-term sick leave. But something had to give. Determined to deal with my stress better, I made several visits to the school’s HR manager. They were shocked I regularly work more than 15 hours over the weekend – they’d never been a teacher – and said they’d see what could be done, but nothing transpired. I haven’t spoken to anyone else about my problems. My pile of exam papers are marked now, but the celebration and freedom that I should have experienced once they were finished was absent. I know there are more reports to write around the corner, more marking to do, more emails to reply to, more parents’ evenings to attend. The part of the job I enjoy – spending time in the classroom, educating young people – is at the bottom of my list of priorities. The constant assessment cycle has only made this worse. Everything is swept up into spreadsheets of meaningless data – the detail into which we have to go when marking would sound fictional to those outside the profession. Teachers are doing the work of three or four people; it’s no wonder we find ourselves at breaking point. My students will do well. It’s a good school and I will always do my best to ensure they reach their potential. But those close to me argue that the consideration of my own health should come before my students and I’m wondering whether it’s too late to change careers. I don’t know what else I would – or could – do. Yet I don’t know how long I can sustain this. Teaching is something I’ve wanted to do since I was 11 years old, but I can’t ignore the anxiety in the pit of my stomach as I pull into the car park at 7am.

An eternity in pop – Taylor Swift was still a country singer, Miley Cyrus was still Hannah Montana and Gaga’s early singles battled it out with Duffy and the Ting Tings at the top of the UK charts. But it’s evident from the first British date of her world tour – postponed from last year as a result of the singer battling fibromyalgia, a chronic pain condition – that if pop music has changed since then, so has Lady Gaga. It’s a noticeably different beast to the live shows she staged at the turn of the decade, in which blood was spurted, sofas apparently made of meat were sat on and the singer made her entrance via a giant vagina. You’d struggle to call it understated – it involves umpteen costume changes, four stages accessed by bridges that descend from the ceiling and a giant grand piano filled with multicoloured lights – but the weirdness that was once her calling card has been considerably scaled back: it’s reserved largely for the video interludes, in which Gaga appears sporting large horns growing out of her nose and forehead, and inhaling apparently hallucinogenic gas via an oxygen mask she clutches with talon-like hands. The sense that what you’re watching resembles a bit of demented downtown New York performance art unaccountably given a multimillion dollar budget is absent, unless you count the hint of Leigh Bowery about her backing dancers’ costumes. Instead, you get something far closer to a straightforward US pop show, replete with ballads sung in a Stetson while toting an acoustic guitar: rather winningly, Gaga’s technique on the instrument is so rudimentary as to make her great rival Madonna look like Julian Bream. It’s in keeping with the way her career has subtly repositioned in recent years. Presumably rattled by the relative critical and commercial failure of her 2013 album Artpop (a sparkling performance of Applause underlines that it’s a substantially better record than its reputation suggests), she’s shifted herself ever closer to American entertainment’s mainstream: making albums of standards with Tony Bennett, establishing an acting career, and announcing a Vegas residency. It’s hard not to feel something has been lost along the way, although it’s clearly not her ability to knock out striking pop songs, as evidenced by recent numbers A-Yo and Perfect Illusion, and you’d have to make a concerted effort not to be entertained by what’s happening on stage, floating bridges, pyrotechnics and all. The crowds meanwhile, are still devoted enough to treat Gaga stopping the show and repeating a song in its entirety – for the purposes of the concert film she’s making – as a bonus rather than intrusion. Moreover, their devotion to her is clearly of a different and deeper hue than most arena-packing pop stars get. The show’s unexpected emotional climax comes not with the solo piano performance of The Edge of Glory, which provokes a vast, heartfelt singalong, but when someone throws a crumpled ball of paper at the stage. It’s a message from a teenage boy in the front row, who’s travelled to the gig from Belfast: a grim, familiar saga of loneliness and being bullied at school, thanking the singer for making his friendless lunch breaks bearable through her music. She reads it out, then clambers into the crowd to speak to him off-mic, halting the show so he can take selfies with her. It’s a curious, slightly awkward moment that is genuine and heartfelt, a world away from pop music’s usual tendency to give between-song lip service to celebrating individuality and difference while promoting a perfectly styled conformity at all other times. Standing in the middle of the audience, Lady Gaga still seems as unique a star as pop has produced in recent years."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"public-leaders-network/2018/feb/03/oldham-suffragette-votes-gender-equality-local-government-pay-gap","type":"article","sectionId":"public-leaders-network","sectionName":"Public Leaders Network","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-03T10:03:17Z","webTitle":"My suffragette great-grandma would be proud and cross at councils | Gill Steward","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2018/feb/03/oldham-suffragette-votes-gender-equality-local-government-pay-gap","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/public-leaders-network/2018/feb/03/oldham-suffragette-votes-gender-equality-local-government-pay-gap","fields":{"headline":"My suffragette great-grandma would be proud and cross at today's councils","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Tuesday 6 February marks 100 years since the passing of the Representation of the People Act that paved the way to universal suffrage – and many of us will be reflecting on the progress made on gender equality over the past century. I am the great-granddaughter of an Oldham suffragette called Harriet and I think she’d be proud to know I am now the chief executive of a local council in London. She would also be delighted to know that two women now run Oldham – Jean Stretton and the fabulous Carolyn Wilkins, the leader and the chief executive of the council, respectively. There is so much to celebrate – but I think my great-grandmother would also agree there is still work to be done in the name of women’s equality. Last week we were reminded just how far we still have to go when the talented and committed Claire Kober quit as leader of the London borough of Haringey, citing the sexism and bullying she experienced. Like lots of women, this made me furious – and it would have made my great-grandma furious too: 100 years on, people are still being attacked on the basis of their gender. I can’t tell you how important stories of Harriet and the other strong women in my family were to me growing up. Like most of the women in my family, my great-grandmother worked in the cotton mills of Oldham. She would have worked alongside my all-time heroine, Annie Kenney, a fellow suffragette and the only working class woman to reach the top of the Women’s Social and Political Union. There is a campaign to fund a statue of Kenney in Oldham Parliament Square. These brave and principled women were not women of privilege. Kenney started work in the cotton mill when she was 10 years old. My great-grandma started work when she was 12. They did dangerous jobs. Kenney lost one of her fingers and Harriet had terrible hearing due to the noise of the machines in the mill. It’ s not surprising they passionately believed things had to change. Like many suffragettes, my great-grandma went out of her way to help those less fortunate. She was prone to bringing home “waifs and strays” for a good meal. Meanwhile, in the little spare time she had, Kenney taught other women to read. They were generous women who believed in social justice and doing the right thing. Growing up, I had these stories to fortify me – and I was surrounded by women who often earned more than their husbands, who were strong, resilient, funny and uncompromising. The confidence that gave me has served me well. Over the past 25 years I have been a chief executive of a police authority, held five executive director roles and been the chief executive of two councils, including Bexley. For the past two years it’s been a privilege to work in London, where half of the council chiefs are women. They’re all doing cracking jobs and there is a lot of camaraderie and support among us. There is so much for women to be proud of. The police and fire brigade in London are both headed up by women. I work with a female politician who has been the leader of Bexley council for 10 years. Our neighbouring borough Greenwich has a female chief executive and a female leader, both amazingly talented. With all this in mind, we could kid ourselves that things have changed and that we have gender equality in local government. But this is not true. Research from the Fawcett Society shows that just a third of chief executives and just 30% of councillors are women [pdf]. And there is still a gender pay gap which, at current rates, will take 62 years to close. So let’s remember the sacrifice those women made 100 years ago – but let’s bring that same grit to doubling our efforts to make sure that this year is the year when things change: for good.

Jean Research shows that people can get more work done if they have more screen area available, and using multiple monitors is a simple way to double or triple your workspace. However, that doesn’t mean having three screens is the best option for you or anyone else. The final decision depends on the way you work, the programs you run, the amount of desk space you have available, and how much you are willing to spend. Some jobs, such as programming and professional video editing, seem to benefit from using multiple screens, and city traders may need more than three screens. Writers might be better off with one big screen, which reduces distractions. In fact, thanks partly to the side-by-side snap feature in Windows, I’ve reverted to using a single screen, and it’s not even that big. In general, if you need to see a lot of information at once, or at a glance, then it’s better to have multiple screens. The time you would otherwise spend moving or resizing windows is time wasted. If you usually work on one thing at once, then you can Alt-Tab to switch between windows on a single screen. Switching between three or four virtual desktops is another option. Travel According to your email signature, you work for a travel agent. I’m not familiar with TA workflows, but I imagine you need to be logged on to at least one booking system, that you need extra screen area for web research, and that you also have to track incoming emails and messages. It does sound as though three screens would make you more productive. However, the best people to tell you are other travel agents. Try asking many screens they use, and why. In the UK, staff in most high-street travel agents seem to have a single screen, and usually it’s a small one. I assume this is because they prioritise face-to-face contact with customers. Three big screens would form an impenetrable barrier. In this case, the best solution might be to add a large screen at the side, on an L-shaped desk. If you don’t work in a customer-facing situation, two or three identical screens might be better. Either way, multiple screens have been around long enough for people doing different jobs to have evolved their own best practices, and large companies may provide multiple screens as standard for roles where they are most effective. Evolution continues as some people try new approaches while others get hired by different companies and take their established preferences with them. Decent 24in monitors are widely available for £100 to £200, so cost is hardly a barrier. The gains in productivity (PDF) more than cover the costs. Screen area matters In the old days – 20 years ago – flat screens were small and expensive. When Apple introduced its first 15in Studio Display, it had a maximum resolution of 1024 x 768 pixels and cost $1,999 (or $3,000 in today’s money). As prices came down, it made sense to use two 12in or 14in flat panels side by side, working as a single monitor. The extra screen area really did make you more productive even if there were a couple of thick bezels right in front of your nose. One widescreen would have been better, but they weren’t available at the time. Now they are. Today, there’s less need to use two screens side by side rather than one big screen. You get too much extra width, which necessitates neck movements, and not enough extra depth. A 27in to 30in monitor with a resolution of up to 3840 x 2160 pixels (4K) may well be the equivalent of four older LCDs, or two smaller screens side-by-side. Either way, there’s no doubt that you can be much more productive on a big screen than a small one. Just use a 24in or 27in monitor for a while then switch to a 10in laptop and you will feel the pain. Two or three? Multiple screens come into their own when you have different tasks, or one task with very different aspects. While editing, for example, you could have one screen for controls and another for image displays. Some people might find a second screen useful for keeping half an eye on communications feeds such as emails, Slack, Teams or Twitter, and so on. Other users might want news feeds, share price updates, video streams or whatever. If you multitask, it makes sense to have two screens side by side, and you can buy suitable mounting brackets. If you have one screen for core work and a second screen for monitoring purposes, have the main screen in front of you and the other at an angle by the side. If you have the desk space, you can move up to three screens, like Bill Gates and Al Gore. This is certainly attractive if you play flight simulation or racing games, where three screens provide a more immersive wraparound effect, and it would be good for showing holiday destinations. In my experience, it’s best to buy two or three identical screens for the job. If they are from a good supplier, they will provide near-enough the same brightness, colour rendering and reaction speed (or latency). I’ve tried adding odd “spare” screens but the differences in rendering soon become annoying. YMMV. Screens or windows? How big do you like your program windows? Alternatively, are you one of life’s switchers, or are you a resizer? In the early days of personal computing, screens were small and screen resolutions were low, perhaps 640 x 480 or less. It made sense to run programs full screen. If you used multiple monitors, you would have a different program on each screen, and they would all be running full screen. It was easy to switch your attention between them. But you probably don’t want to run programs full screen on a 25in or larger monitor with a resolution of 1920 x 1080 to 2560 x 1600 pixels. There are exceptions such as graphic arts, architecture, design and editing programs, and some people have very large spreadsheets. However, most people with big screens end up resizing and moving windows around, with two or more programs often overlapping. Think about how much screen area you need for your main program(s)? Would having a really big screen allow you to enter data or read timetables without scrolling? That’s a time-saver. Would you be able to use several programs side by side, perhaps tiled so they fill the whole screen? (This is what Snap Assist does.) If you want to switch your attention between several programs, does each one need its own screen? If you’re a switcher, I’d tend to go for two or three smaller screens, perhaps around 20in to 24in, with a different program on each. If you’re a resizer, you might prefer one big 27-30in screen. To pick the best option, you’ll need to think about the software you use and how you use it. Only then can you decide how many screens would suit you best. Have you got a question?

Bushnell was due to receive the Pioneer award at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco in March, recognising his 40 years of involvement in the industry. Together with Ted Dabney, he set up Atari in 1972, developing the seminal arcade machine Pong, before manufacturing the Atari 2600, one of the first home video game consoles. However, after the decision to award Bushnell was announced on Tuesday, the news provoked an outcry on social media, as games industry members pointed to examples of Atari’s sexist culture. In the book The Ultimate History of Video Games by Steve Kent, Atari employee Al Acorn remembered Bushnell holding company meetings in a hot tub and attempting to coax a female employee to join him. Acorn recalled: “Nolan needed some papers and documents so he called his office and said, ‘Have Miss So and So bring them up.’ We were in this tub [when she arrived] so he proceeded to try to get her in the tub during the board meeting.” In a 2012 Playboy profile of Atari, Bushnell stated that prototype machines were named after attractive female employees, with the home version of Pong codenamed Darlene after an employee who “was stacked and had the tiniest waist”. When author Tristan Donovan spoke to ex-Atari executive Ray Kassar for his video game history book, Replay, Kassar is quoted as stating, “When I arrived [at Atari] on the first day, I was dressed in a business suit and a tie and I met Nolan Bushnell. He had a T-shirt on. The T-shirt said: ‘I love to fuck.’ That was my introduction to Atari.” After the awards announcement on Tuesday, games industry employees began to vent their anger at the decision in the wake of the #MeToo and Time’s Up campaigns. Game designer Elizabeth Sampat wrote: “This is not the year to fete a man who pressured female employees into topless hot tub parties and code-named Pong after the hottest woman in the office.” Others followed, using the hashtag #notnolan, with Gillian Smith, a computer science professor at Worcester Polytechnic Institute tweeting: “While other industries are distancing themselves from the abusive and sexist behaviors of powerful men, GDC is giving a pioneer award to one of them.” According to technology news site Verge, GDC organisers initially claimed not to have known about the reports of Atari’s sexist culture, promising to “look at them more closely”. Within hours, the event, which attracts more than 25,000 games industry employees every year and hosts an internationally regarded awards ceremony, had rescinded the Bushnell honour and posted a statement on Twitter. Following the decision by the GDC, Bushnell took to Twitter with a statement, praising the decision and stating: “If my personal actions or the actions of anyone who ever worked with me offended or caused pain to anyone at our companies, then I apologize without reservation.” The controversy follows a string of allegations and protests in the movie and music industries over institutional sexism, misogyny and harassment. Over recent years, the video games sector has been criticised for its poor record on diversity and representation. Annual surveys by the International Game Developers Association have found that 75% of game development staff are male, and only 3% of top earners identify as women. Many of those using the #notnolan hashtag have argued that giving the award to Bushnell would send a message to young women and gender minorities that they’re not welcome in the industry. There have also been tweets and articles in defence of Bushnell. Some claimed the veteran figure, often regarded as the father of video games, should not be punished for a workplace culture that existed 40 years ago. Others have suggested the GDC decision could be regarded not as a punishment for Bushnell, but as a recognition that the industry needs to modernise. But game designer Nick Bermes countered on Twitter: “This is not the time to turn a blind eye and say, ‘Oh, things were different then, it was a different time. If it’s in fact a different time now, then why are we rewarding someone who’s behavior is now deemed inappropriate and unacceptable?” In this context, the decision reflects the evolving nature of the #metoo campaign, away from calling out abusers and toward establishing new norms of behaviour. In a recent Guardian piece, feminist writer Jessica Valenti wrote: “Right now, women are asking for more than the bare minimum they’ve been taught to expect. They’re asking for a standard of behavior that sees them as full human beings rather than sexual objects.” In recognition of the MeToo era, several developers suggested female industry veterans who would be eligible for a Pioneer award, including Roberta Williams, co-founder of adventure game studio Sierra On-Line, and Carol Shaw, who designed Atari’s Super Breakout game and the later Activision classic, River Raid."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/feb/01/four-inmates-arrested-fatal-stabbing-wormwood-scrubs","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-01T07:58:36Z","webTitle":"Four inmates arrested after fatal stabbing at Wormwood Scrubs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/feb/01/four-inmates-arrested-fatal-stabbing-wormwood-scrubs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/feb/01/four-inmates-arrested-fatal-stabbing-wormwood-scrubs","fields":{"headline":"Four inmates arrested after fatal stabbing at Wormwood Scrubs","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Four men have been arrested on suspicion of murder after an inmate of Wormwood Scrubs prison was stabbed to death, police have said. Metropolitan police were called to the prison in Shepherd’s Bush, west London, at about 3.19pm on Wednesday after reports of a stabbing. A man, later named by Scotland Yard as 25-year-old Khader Saleh, was found with stab wounds and pronounced dead at the scene, despite efforts by paramedics to save him. A murder investigation was launched and inquiries are continuing. Next of kin have been informed. Four men aged 20 to 23, all inmates at the prison, were arrested on suspicion of murder and remain in police custody. The fatal stabbing follows a recent decision to draft extra patrol dogs, body-worn cameras and CCTV into Wormwood Scrubs because of the high levels of serious violence, with more than 90 attacks on staff within six months. There were three murders of inmates in England and Wales in 2017 as violence inside prisons reaches levels not seen for 25 years.

Debra Frances was originally brought into Aunty as a consultant to work on the restructure of the organisation but Guthrie was so enamoured of her skills she brought her in-house, giving her a staff card and the newly created title of “head of transformation”. But just two months into the project – which will see the old TV, radio and news divisions broken up – another exec, Anne Milne, is stepping up to complete “the execution phase of the restructure”, according to an email to the executive team from finance chief Louise Higgins. “As you know, the ABC has done a significant amount of work in shaping its Content Team Redesign proposal,” Higgins said. “With this work largely complete I wanted to let you know that Debra Frances will be leaving the organisation from today and will be pursuing other opportunities. I would very much like to thank Debra for her hard work and wish her all the best for the future.” The sound and the fury The high-profile departure comes before the inaugural ABC annual public meeting at Ultimo headquarters next Friday. The public event will include keynote addresses from chairman Justin Milne, Guthrie and Higgins, as well as information about programming and a Q&amp;A session with questions from the public. One of the questions uppermost on the public’s mind may just be the dismantling of the ABC’s sound and reference libraries. PM presenter Linda Mottram branded it “ripping the heart out” and insiders tell Weekly Beast the move is “premature” as so little is digitised and would mean specialist music was no longer be easy to find. Protests appear to be in vain. The culling of the libraries is already well under way and management is digging its heels in. Jana drama In the 1980s and 90s many aspiring journalists wanted to be Jana Wendt, the “perfumed steamroller” who ruled the TV screen in the 1980s and 90s. From 60 Minutes to A Current Affair, Seven’s Witness program and later to SBS and the ABC, Wendt was widely admired not just for her telegenic presence but for her tough, take-no-prisoners style and her record of standing up to sexism. At her peak she assumed almost movie star status and was the highest paid person on television. When she famously walked off the ACA set at Channel Nine, refusing to introduce a story about topless shop assistants, she won a legion of female fans and was hailed a feminist hero. So it came as a considerable shock to read Wendt’s rambling thoughts on the #MeToo movement published in The Spectator’s Australian edition under the heading Public Shaming. We’re a bit late to the piece but a comment by Andrew Bolt that Jana was “sensational on #notmetoo” piqued our curiosity. “The whole [Harvey Weinstein] affair came as a terrible shock to the rest of us since the idea of casting couches and trading parts of one’s body for better parts on screen was previously unknown,” she said sarcastically. “There were Hollywood sirens who had not spoken for decades but who rose from their beds to give voice to condemnation of Weinstein.” Wendt went on to question the bona fides of those who spoke up about sexual harassment and the use of the acronym LGBTI and to reveal that she was contacted by a journalist who thought she too might have been a victim. “With a surprising degree of confidence, the friendly reporter suggested the alleged roll call of victims included me.” Wrong, says Jana, “the man had never touched me… #NotMeToo”. Mitchell’s mantra Chris Mitchell, the former editor-in-chief of the Australian, doesn’t want to change the date of Australia Day. No surprises there. But in his media column this week he mounted a spurious argument to say Indigenous Australians were in favour of the status quo, you just had to find the right ones to talk to. It’s the “self-identifying mixed heritage Aboriginal activists” who claim it is offensive to celebrate on that day, Mitchell says, going on to scold the ABC for giving a platform to Indigenous people who favour a change. And what is Mitchell’s evidence for this claim? “A friend of mine intimately connected to the Aboriginal world gave me his one-sentence assessment, and it again sails close to Section 18C. ‘As everyone in the NT knows, the extent of an Aboriginal person’s engagement with the Australia Day debate is in inverse proportion to their genetic Aboriginal ancestry.’” Financials reviewed Fairfax Media announced – in a six-paragraph “exclusive” on page 29 of the Australian Financial Review on Thursday – that the downsized newspaper company was moving at the end of 2019 to new digs in the CBD. The 950 journalists and other staff based at the Pyrmont HQ, near Star casino and not much else, breathed a sigh of relief that the plug on the 20-year lease had been pulled early. They have been wanting to leave the “wasteland” of Pyrmont ever since they reluctantly moved there from Darling Harbour almost 10 years ago. As Google grew bigger and Fairfax shrank, the tech company has been leasing more and more floor space from Fairfax, leading the Maserati-driving Fairfax boss, Greg Hywood, to concede he should move out and give the whole 9,000 square metre lease over three floors to Google. “We’re excited to start the search for a new Sydney headquarters for Fairfax Media,” a spokesman said. “After a decade in our current Pyrmont offices, moving to new fit-for-purpose workspace in or around the CBD from late 2019 will be welcomed by staff and reflect our modern media business.” The spacious, fancy fit-out at Pyrmont never suited the journalists who wanted access to courts, parliament, food and a train station, not to mention a pub. Swimming against the stream When News Corp took over Foxtel and announced it would merge the pay TV company with Fox Sports, the battle was on to decide which chief executive would prevail: Foxtel boss Peter Tonagh or Fox Sports CEO Patrick Delany. This week Delany came out on top to lead the merged Foxtel-Fox Sports when the deal is finalised next month. Foxtel is going through a turbulent period with no less than three CEOs in three years in the tough television market. Tonagh stepped up in March 2016 after the departure of Richard Freudenstein, who had led the company for four years. With more viewers opting for cheaper streaming products such as Netflix and Stan, Foxtel’s premium offering of $120 a month is a hard sell. Late last year Tonagh introduced a new branding for Foxtel along with a cheaper streaming version called Foxtel Now for as low as $15 a month and an Apple TV style box for $99. Delany is going to have to do even more to keep Foxtel firing."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/feb/01/bert-van-marwijk-vows-to-do-it-his-way-as-socceroos-coach","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-01T06:56:40Z","webTitle":"Bert van Marwijk vows to do it his way as Socceroos coach","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/feb/01/bert-van-marwijk-vows-to-do-it-his-way-as-socceroos-coach","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/feb/01/bert-van-marwijk-vows-to-do-it-his-way-as-socceroos-coach","fields":{"headline":"Bert van Marwijk vows to do it his way as Socceroos coach","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Any Australian football fans retaining hope the new Socceroos coach, Bert van Marwijk, might continue on Ange Postecoglou’s philosophical football journey will have been left disappointed after the Dutchman, making his first appearance in Australia since taking the job, asserted he will do things his own way. Van Marwijk’s appointment last month was greeted with murmurs of discontent within some parts of the Australian football community. A perhaps simplified reputation precedes him – a pragmatic approach to football, physicality and a focus on results over style – but his debut performance in front of Australian media on Thursday did little to suggest a departure from that. In many ways, Van Marwijk’s approach is the antithesis of what Postecoglou – and Football Federation Australia, given they appointed him four years ago – stood for. But both Steven Lowy and David Gallop, flanking Van Marwijk at FFA headquarters in Sydney, insisted the 65-year-old – their No1 target from the outset – was the right man for the job at this time. Gallop sought to play down FFA’s apparent U-turn in philosophy and even claimed it was too early to speculate whether the style of play employed by Postecoglou would be consigned to the scrap heap, but there were indications from Van Marwijk that it would. “I have respect for the former coach [but] I do it my way,” he said. Those words highlighted their tactical differences, but at the same time they also showed he and Postecoglou do share something in common; Postecoglou was never one to take a backward step either, and both walked away from their jobs having guided their teams to qualification for June and July’s finals in Russia. That may be where the similarities end though. Whereas Postecoglou was at times criticised for encouraging a style of football his players were not technically attuned for, Van Marwijk appears set to very much play to within Australia’s means. “I’m a realistic coach,” the former Saudi Arabia coach said. “I like creative football, I like to have the ball, but I also like to win and that’s the most important thing. It’s important that we play in a way that fits the players and also the coach. You cannot play in a way the players cannot do, and when they don’t like to play in a way you want to play, then you make a mistake.” Van Marwijk knows something of Australia’s means, having had a chance to run the rule over those Socceroos who played under Postecoglou in the qualifying campaign. He acknowledged that, from what he saw over the two games, they could play football, but also that their biggest asset was their physical strength. And tellingly he admitted his greatest challenge will be to let them play in a way that gives them the best chance of winning. If that means channelling the spirit of 2010-era Mark van Bommel and Nigel de Jong then it appears that is a road Van Marwijk is willing to go down. For some, that will be a bitter pill to swallow after four years of worshipping at the church of Postecoglou. For others, achieving the Dutchman’s main aim of getting out of a group containing France, Denmark and Peru will far outweigh any philosophical aspirations. He has little time to forge a team capable of doing so. He knows of the European-based players, but has little knowledge of those flying just under the radar in Australia. To that end, he aims to watch as much A-League as possible this weekend but with just two friendly dates fixed in the diary before the first game in Russia against France on 22 June, “surviving the group”, as he put it, will not be easy. Guaranteeing any kind of success before a ball has been kicked on a training pitch is clear folly, but if Van Marwijk were not confident of achieving that goal, he said he would not have taken the job. And what is certain along the way is that he will remain true to his beliefs, regardless of how that is received. Like it or not, and in much the same way as his predecessor, he will do it his way."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/feb/01/king-tide-driven-by-super-blue-blood-moon-inundates-torres-strait-island","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-01T02:09:04Z","webTitle":"King tide driven by super blue blood moon inundates Torres Strait island","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/feb/01/king-tide-driven-by-super-blue-blood-moon-inundates-torres-strait-island","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/feb/01/king-tide-driven-by-super-blue-blood-moon-inundates-torres-strait-island","fields":{"headline":"King tide driven by super blue blood moon inundates Torres Strait island","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Yam Island in the Torres Strait has been inundated by a king tide, driven in part by the super blue blood moon overnight. A video posted to Facebook shows water surging through homes in a social housing complex as residents plead for help. People living at the complex in Mabuiag Point – known by locals as “the tin sheds” – say their homes are flooded every year but repeated pleas for assistance have not been answered. “See what we have to put up with every year? It’s crap,” resident Latisha Gaiden says in the video. “Can you see what’s happening? Can somebody help? We need help. This is unbelievable.” The homes are built next to mangroves on the island and sea-level projections forecast the area will be consistently underwater in coming decades. The tide on Yam Island, which is part of Queensland, peaked just after midday on Wednesday at 3.84m. Thursday’s peak is forecast to be even higher – at 3.87m at 12.46pm. Yam Island lies in the Torres Strait, about 100km north of the tip of Cape York. Low-lying, and just two square kilometres in size, it is home to a little more than 300 people. Other nearby islands have also been hit by king tides this week, exacerbated by torrential rain and strong swells. A $24.5m sea wall built on Saibai Island, near Papua New Guinea, largely succeeded in holding back the waves of a storm surge, although one valve in the wall popped open, allowing water in. One house on the island was inundated. A tide of 4.5m was recorded at Boigu Island, while, on Horn Island, a jetty was submerged and a fishing trawler was swept away before being washed ashore. Australia’s environment department has flagged the Torres Strait Islands as some of the places most vulnerable to rising sea levels caused by climate change. “Some Torres Strait communities are affected under current king tide conditions and even very small levels of sea level rise are likely to have a major impact on these communities,” a report written in 2009 said. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has also identified the Torres Strait as being at risk and has warned communities they may be forced to relocate. Last year, the Oxfam Australia chief executive, Helen Szoke, visited the Torres Strait at the invitation of the Torres council mayor, Vonda Malone. Szoke said the people of the strait had contributed almost nothing to the causes of climate change but were being “hit first and hardest by its impacts”. Leaving their ancestral home was a last resort for the people of the Torres Strait, Malone said, but they were “seeing their land washed away”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/feb/01/new-zealand-child-abuse-state-care-royal-commission","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-01T03:14:35Z","webTitle":"New Zealand announces major inquiry into child abuse in state care","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/01/new-zealand-child-abuse-state-care-royal-commission","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/feb/01/new-zealand-child-abuse-state-care-royal-commission","fields":{"headline":"New Zealand announces major inquiry into child abuse in state care","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"New Zealanders who were abused in state care have been granted a royal commission of inquiry, following the lead of similar inquiries in Australia and the UK, and the recommendation of the United Nations. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said the inquiry would last for at least her entire term in office, and was tasked with investigating historic abuse of children and adults by state-run institutions between 1950 and 1999. The inquiry – which comes after years of campaigning – would include youth detention centres, psychiatric hospitals and orphanages, as well as any government care services contracted out to private institutions. The royal commission will be chaired by former governor-general Sir Anand Satyanand and is likely to be the largest royal commission ever held in New Zealand. It is expected to cost about NZ$12m a year. It will not investigate abuse in religious or sports institutions, a scope that was criticised by some. Tracey Martin, the minister for children, told RNZ if a child was abused in a religious institution or school where the state had placed them and was ultimately responsible for their care, that would come under the purview of the inquiry. However she went on to say if the commissioner’s initial inquiries found evidence the royal commission should broaden its scope, the government would be open-minded. “What we have tried to focus on is the person not the institution. Any one individual in the care of the state, regardless of where they were placed when harm happened to them, will be inside of scope of the inquiry,” Martin said. “We would be silly to ask Sir Anand to go out to consult if we weren’t prepared to listen when he came back. The draft terms of reference are as I described ... but I am very committed to making sure the survivors don’t get lost in some hunt for an institution. If vulnerable people were hurt in our care, they are in scope.” Ardern said: “Any abuse of children is a tragedy, and for those most vulnerable children in state care, it is unconscionable. “This is a chance to confront our history and make sure we don’t make the same mistakes again. It is a significant step towards acknowledging and learning from the experiences of those who have been abused in state care.” The move was welcomed by the Human Rights Commission, the children’s commissioner and survivors, who said it was long overdue. The children’s commissioner, Judge Andrew Becroft, said: “Survivors of abuse in state care will have the deep hurt they experienced investigated and acknowledged by this new inquiry.” Martin added the royal commission would have lots to learn from the six-year Australian inquiry, recently concluded. “We must aspire to a higher quality of care for all of our children ... we must do all we can to ensure that these sad circumstances can never be repeated. As the lessons emerge, they need to be applied to the changes that are already underway in our statutory care and protection system.” At any one time there are up to 5,000 New Zealand children in state care, the prime minister said. Martin said the commission would investigate the impacts of abuse , particularly for Māori, who were taken from their families at far higher rates than Pakeha children (those of European descent), sometimes for transgressions such as truancy. Last year, 61% of children in state care were Māori. More than 100,000 New Zealanders children and adults were held in state institutions between the 1950 -1990s, and many suffered serious sexual, physical and psychological abuse.

Asked for a response by the paper, Henry is reported to have explained West Ham wanted to limit their number of African players because “they have a bad attitude” and “cause mayhem” when they are not in the team. Lord Ouseley, the chairman of Kick It Out, described an email that Henry allegedly sent to another West Ham official and an agent regarding an inquiry about a player of Cameroonian descent as potentially unlawful. Henry is thought to have written that West Ham did not want any more Africans in their squad. Pressed by the paper, he suggested the policy was supported by senior management. Henry also denied the policy was racist. He told the Mail: “It’s nothing racist at all. It’s just sometimes they can have a bad attitude. We had problems with Diafra Sakho. We find that when they are not in the team they cause mayhem. It’s nothing against the African race at all.” West Ham, who did manage to complete the £8m signing of Jordan Hugill from Preston North End before the window shut, have seven players of African descent in their first team. However, they experienced problems with Diafra Sakho before selling the Senegalese striker to Rennes this week and felt they had no option but to allow André Ayew to return to Swansea City for an initial £18m on Wednesday after the Ghanaian forward made it clear he wanted to leave. Sakho had not played since 16 December because of a knee injury and Ayew, who joined West Ham from Swansea for £20m 18 months ago, had been out since 16 January with a hamstring problem. West Ham questioned the seriousness of those injuries after both players passed medicals at their new clubs. The furore capped off a messy end to the window for West Ham, who are four points above the bottom three. David Moyes had made the acquisition of a top midfielder a priority and there were hopes Dendoncker would arrive for £20m. Having allowed Reece Oxford to return to Borussia Mönchengladbach on loan, West Ham were cautiously optimistic about signing Dendoncker, the 22-year-old Belgian international. They knew the player wanted to join. But while initial talks were positive, talks broke down when Anderlecht pulled out. This leaves West Ham with only two fit, senior central midfielders. Pedro Obiang is expected to miss the rest of the season with a knee injury and Edimilson Fernandes is out with an ankle injury. Despite bringing in João Mário on loan from Internazionale last week, West Ham also found it hard to improve their options in attack. Attempts to sign Islam Slimani on loan ended when Leicester City’s owners refused to negotiate with them and FC Krasnodar’s Fyodor Smolov turned them down. But their search for a striker led them to Hugill, who has scored 10 goals in all competitions for Preston this season."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/jan/31/i-am-overachieving-with-chelsea-claims-antonio-conte","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-31T23:45:16Z","webTitle":"I am overachieving with Chelsea, claims Antonio Conte","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/31/i-am-overachieving-with-chelsea-claims-antonio-conte","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jan/31/i-am-overachieving-with-chelsea-claims-antonio-conte","fields":{"headline":"I am overachieving with Chelsea, claims Antonio Conte","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Antonio Conte said he was overachieving as Chelsea’s manager but, after seeing his side suffer their heaviest home defeat in almost two years, admitted he was concerned about the champions’ ability to finish in the top four. Bournemouth wrecked Chelsea’s eight-match unbeaten league run with three goals in a 16-minute spell to leave Chelsea only two points above Tottenham Hotspur in fourth place, draining all the optimism generated by the £18m signing of Olivier Giroud earlier in the day. Conte’s team remain in the Champions League and FA Cup but this was an untimely defeat given recent murmurings of discontent at the club’s transfer policy. The manager said he had predicted this would prove a “difficult night”, with preparations disrupted by Michy Batshuayi’s departure for Borussia Dortmund but refused to cite excuses. Asked whether he and his players have been overachieving of late to compete, until recently, on four fronts, he replied: “Yes, I think we are doing more. We are doing more, yes. But we must be worried [about finishing in the top four]. It won’t be easy, and we have to fight. I’m ready to do that and I think the players are starting to understand that this season we have to struggle for a position in the Champions League. “The players, until now, have been great with their commitment and their behaviour. If they hadn’t done that, our place in the table would be worse. If we want only to dream and not see the reality … in this case, I can tell you now we can fight to win the title this season. Rather, it will be very important to look at the reality and know that, if we are able to reach a place in the Champions League, it will be a great success for us.” Chelsea have sacked managers in February and March under Roman Abramovich’s ownership, those managers being Luiz Felipe Scolari and André Villas-Boas. Asked whether the hierarchy at the club were dreamers or realists, Conte replied: “I don’t know. But my task is to try to be more realistic and try to transfer this to the players, because the players, if they know and understand the danger … The pressure is normal. It’s normal if you are Chelsea’s coach and I’m trying to do my best. “We are doing everything and I’m exploiting this squad at the maximum level. But, if someone doesn’t agree about this, I’m here. I have to accept every situation. I’m very relaxed about this. I know I’m doing a great job, a great work, me and the staff and the players.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/feb/01/its-not-okay-how-clueless-donald-trump-is-about-climate-change","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-01T11:00:36Z","webTitle":"It's not okay how clueless Donald Trump is about climate change | Dana Nuccitelli","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/feb/01/its-not-okay-how-clueless-donald-trump-is-about-climate-change","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/feb/01/its-not-okay-how-clueless-donald-trump-is-about-climate-change","fields":{"headline":"It's not okay how clueless Donald Trump is about climate change","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Donald Trump has decimated all presidential norms to such a degree that it’s now difficult to feel alarmed or outraged when he inevitably breaks another. It was difficult to raise an eyebrow when the story broke that Trump paid off a porn star to remain silent about their affair, which happened just after his third wife had given birth to his fifth child, because it’s Donald Trump – of course he did. Likewise, when Trump made a number of grossly ignorant and wrong comments about climate change in an interview with Piers Morgan last week, my first reaction was ‘it’s Donald Trump – of course he did.’ But that’s not okay. Donald Trump is the leader of the country most culpable for the existential threat that we’ve created by rapidly changing Earth’s climate. His administration is alone in the world in declaring that we need not worry about that existential threat. We need to hold him to account for his ignorance on this critically important issue and demand better. Trump’s ignorant climate comments Trump’s climate comments in the interview were so ridiculously misinformed that even late night comedians were able to debunk them: They’re claims you might expect from a YouTube troll, not the leader of the country that produces some of the best climate science research and data in the world. It would be easy to laugh them off as Trump’s usual buffoonery, but he should be held to a presidential standard. So, to briefly debunk each of these myths: There has been no recent cooling. Global temperatures have risen rapidly over the past 50 years, and the past four years have been the four hottest ever recorded. The phrase ‘climate change’ (or the variant ‘climatic change’) has long been used, including in a 1956 paper, and of course in the very name of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, formed in 1988. In fact, it was Republican strategist Frank Luntz who infamously advised conservatives to change the phrase because he felt “‘Climate change’ is less frightening than ‘global warming’.” My colleagues led by Peter Jacobs even published a book chapter debunking this myth, and Jacobs delivered a Denial101x lecture on the subject: Trump is correct on one point: the polar ice caps are at a record level. Of course, he probably didn’t mean that global sea ice is at record low extent. In fact, Arctic sea ice is in such a rapid long-term decline that climate scientists have described it as a “death spiral.” As climate scientist Michael Mann noted, ice sheets are likewise melting faster than predicted. In his State of the Union speech this week, Trump didn’t even mention climate change. His only related comment was that “we have ended the war on beautiful clean coal.” It’s another completely nonsensical statement. There was arguably a ‘war on coal’ (which coal lost), but there’s near-universal support for ‘clean coal’ technologies (those which reduce and capture coal’s various pollutants, most notably carbon dioxide). Does Trump understand the difference? It’s Donald Trump – of course he doesn’t. Trump’s art of withdrawing from great deals Trump’s misinformed comments in the Morgan interview extended beyond climate science into the realm of climate policy: I believe in clean air. I believe in crystal-clear, beautiful … I believe in just having good cleanliness in all. Now, with that being said, if somebody said go back into the Paris accord, it would have to be a completely different deal because we had a horrible deal. Trump may “believe in” clean air and water, but his EPA has taken countless steps to weaken regulations of air and water pollutants. Regardless of what he believes, his administration’s actions are creating dirtier air and water. As for the Paris accord, it could not have been a better deal for America. In the agreement, the US committed to reduce its carbon pollution at approximately the same rate it was already declining. To meet that pledge would simply have required following through with existing American climate policies. Instead, Trump and his EPA administrator Scott Pruitt decided to take every possible step to undo those climate policies. Not only did they repeal the Clean Power Plan – America’s most robust effort to tackle climate change – but they even went so far as to erect posters at EPA buildings gloating about it: However, even if Trump and Pruitt succeed in increasing American carbon pollution, there would have been no penalties for missing the Paris targets. The agreement was non-binding. In short, America could easily have met its pledges had the Trump administration so desired, but failing to do so carried no concrete consequences. How can a deal get any better than that? The answer is that Paris was a great deal, but Trump campaigned on bluster that every deal entered by the Obama administration was the worst in world history (also see the Iran deal), and thus essentially forced himself to withdraw from those deals. Trump’s claims that he may re-enter the Paris agreement if America gets ‘a better deal’ are nonsensical. This is not okay While this is all behavior that we’ve come to expect from Donald Trump, that doesn’t make it okay. He may be America’s worst-ever president, but he’s still the leader of one of the world’s most powerful countries, with some of the world’s best scientific resources at his disposal. That his science advisor is effectively Fox News, as Andrew Freedman put it, is unacceptable and dangerous. Americans clearly made a terrible mistake in electing him president (though 61% of voters did realize Trump is unqualified for the job), but it’s a mistake they won’t be able to remedy until 2020. Congress could act as a co-equal branch and pass climate legislation, but Americans put Republicans in charge of that institution as well, and with the exception of the party’s 34 Climate Solutions Caucus members, they’re also content to ignore the existential threat of climate change. However, Americans will have the opportunity to remedy that mistake this November."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/feb/01/as-australian-muslim-women-we-dont-have-to-be-told-what-we-can-wear","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-01T05:20:01Z","webTitle":"As Australian Muslim women we don't have to be told what we can wear | Lydia Shelly","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/01/as-australian-muslim-women-we-dont-have-to-be-told-what-we-can-wear","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/01/as-australian-muslim-women-we-dont-have-to-be-told-what-we-can-wear","fields":{"headline":"As Australian Muslim women we don't have to be told what we can wear","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The rise of “modest fashion”, both in Australia and overseas, is part of a larger fashion revolution which understands the economic incentives of diversity. CoverGirl features hijabi beauty vlogger Nura Afia as their model, while Mariah Idrissi became the first model wearing a hijab for H&amp;M in 2015. It is a lucrative market. The modest fashion empire is set to be worth over $368bn by 2021. It’s a market that holds untapped opportunities for Australia’s cotton and clothing industries, industries that would welcome growth. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Dfat) recently issued a press release highlighting that they had facilitated an Australian fashion exhibition focusing on modest clothing in one of south-east Asia’s major consumers of modest fashion. There was swift criticism by those who continue to hold ill-informed and poor understandings of terrorism and radicalisation, by those who lack a basic understanding of soft power and diplomacy, by the prejudiced and those ignorant of intersectional feminism (in some criticisms, all four were apparent). Former prime minister Tony Abbott, urged Dfat to “focus on mainstream Australia”. This is the same man who politicised national security and not only ignited, but poured gasoline on the relationship between Australian Muslims and law enforcement (one which is still being rebuilt). The photograph of the 14 young, smiling and beautiful Australian women issued as part of Dfats’s press release was soon appropriated and splashed on the front page of a mainstream newspaper with the catch cry that it “does not represent us”. The criticisms perfectly demonstrate how there is an incessant fetishisation of Muslim women in Australia; how multiculturalism is now viewed as a dirty word. The “war on terror” has made what Muslim women wear a constant accusation of misogyny and violent extremism as instrumental in orgies of violence and terror. It’s an accusation that despite what mainstream media and self-elected community leaders demand, Muslim women have no onus to defend or explain. It has been painful to watch the various public performances acted out by Australian Muslims as a means to demonstrate their humanity: date a Muslim, hug a Muslim, wear a hijab and dress as a Muslim, handing out roses and sausage sizzles. The accusation that religious garments are a precursor to radicalisation or violent extremism is one that has no grounds in the extensive body of terrorism literature. Respected terrorism experts have found that there are no links between modest clothing and violent extremism or terrorism; indeed, that religion is not a sole or major contributor to violent extremism. The fact that this is so widely believed and espoused by politicians and other stakeholders reveals just how pervasive the politicisation of national security has become, risking the continued use of national security policy being a political play thing or a way to raise revenue for mainstream publications. This is dangerous, divisive and frankly unacceptable. If religion is believed to be the precursor for radicalisation and terrorism and adopted as a policy by security and law enforcement agencies, it would result in discriminatory practices. Arguably, Australian Muslims are already at the receiving end of such practices. Australian Muslim women live in a country where national security policies intersect and collide with feminism with increasing regularity. Our bodies and clothing are a form of currency and radicalisation indicators, traded for countering violent extremism grants and the sale of newspapers and votes. Australia has many faces that we show to the world. It is increasingly becoming one of racism; where “whiteness” is seen to be in peril, in danger of being diluted or driven to extinction. It is common for female public figures in Australia to build their careers and their egos off the backs of Muslim women. Where they talk of liberation while being silent on Nauru, Manus or even Yemen or Syria. Where they talk about the public display of violence, but are silent about our country exporting arms. Where they talk of being enlightened, but are silent about the noose being placed around the neck of press freedoms in our country. Where they talk of the liberation and freedom of Muslim women, but are silent on Ahed Tamimi. We know that this exclusive brand of white mainstream feminism isn’t really about an all-inclusive sisterhood. It is also increasingly common for Muslim women to point the finger at more conservative Muslim women in the community, so eager are they to be seen as “one of the good ones”, as an example of how it is possible to be both Australian and to wear the veil. We know that for these feminists, the only acceptable Australian Muslim woman is one where her “Muslimness” is erased. Australian Muslim women have done very well without being told what they can wear, “from day dot”, as Caroline Overington puts it in her opinion piece. And indeed, it is because Australian Muslim womanhood is “robust, hands-on, shoulder to the wheel”. We are resilient and savvy in negotiating political waters. Fashion has always been avant garde. When does fashion represent a far more inclusive and collaborative face of Australia than its social and political institutions? In 2018, apparently. • Lydia Shelly is a lawyer and student in terrorism and security studies"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sport/live/2018/feb/02/carlton-v-collingwood-aflw-season-two-opener-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-02T10:33:22Z","webTitle":"Carlton defeat Collingwood in AFLW season opener – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2018/feb/02/carlton-v-collingwood-aflw-season-two-opener-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2018/feb/02/carlton-v-collingwood-aflw-season-two-opener-live","fields":{"headline":"Carlton defeat Collingwood in AFLW season opener – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Blues bank the first four points of the AFLW season, in a match that was a scrappy arm-wrestle sort of affair. They led at every chance, but never by more than a goal and a bit. That proved to be a substantial enough margin though, as Collingwood struggled to find a way through Carlton’s defence. It was a lack of polish in disposal that meant the Pies couldn’t put together chains of possession that were smooth enough. An unconvincing display from the Maggies, but Carlton did have some of that polish when required, and defended staunchly while producing some lovely bits of play amongst the grind. Vescio had a couple of moments, Hope was very quiet, but it’s no surprise that each team’s disposal count was led by defensive marshals, Molloy for Collingwood and Davey for Carlton. Steph Chiocci was probably Collingwood’s brightest light, while Amelia Barden battled hard, and for Carlton we saw a lively night from Georgia Gee and Jess Hosking, with influential interventions from Tayla Harris. And with the champagne thoroughly smashed on the prow, we declare the AFLW season 2018 underway! God bless all who sail with her. Goodnight. 4th quarter, 0:00 left: Carlton 3.4.22 v Collingwood 2.2.14 Edwards with a shot after a chain of handballs, but smothered with a minute left. That was Collingwood’s last chance, you’d think. A few more scrambles in front of goal, and the clock runs down... 4th quarter, 2:00 left: Carlton 3.4.22 v Collingwood 2.2.14 Molloy pushing forward late, gathers in the pocket but sprays her shot on the run. Not her best possession, but it was her 19th for the night, the most on ground. 4th quarter, 4:00 left: Carlton 3.4.22 v Collingwood 2.2.14 Chloe Molloy has been magnificent for the Pies tonight, under pressure in the forward line. She keeps her cool again, twisting and turning to evade the lightly-framed Georgia Gee. Gets Collingwood back up the ground again. Desperate need of a goal. No way through. 4th quarter, 6:00 left: Carlton 3.4.22 v Collingwood 2.2.14 Just a matter of who’s got the fitness now, to keep running and make space. Darcy Vescio does, tracking all the way back to half back to create an option and get her team out of trouble. Then her very presence around the pack a minute later draws a free kick for holding. Those two possessions help Carlton get back down into their forward line. Collingwood can’t get clear. 4th quarter, 9:00 left: Carlton 3.4.22 v Collingwood 2.2.14 Back and forth it goes, forward 50 to forward 50, with Grant finding space for Collingwood, then Moody challenging and winning it back for Carlton. Barden should have given up a shot on goal for holding the ball, but the Carlton gang-tackle is high. Down the other end, the Pies should be through to an open goal, twice, but fumbles at the key moments cost them. Kuys eventually gets on the end of a mark after running hard into the hole at full forward, but her set shot is up-and-under, and misses left. 4th quarter, 13:00 left: Carlton 3.4.22 v Collingwood 2.1.13 Barden attacks the centre bounce with ferocity, but Breann Moody responds with a couple of crunching tackles. Imposing herself on the contest after each ruck tap. Three ball-ups to start the quarter. Hosking gets loose for Carlton, bangs forward, then it comes back and Sarah D’Arcy nearly takes a pack mark. The ball is buried again. Tough start. Sarah D’Arcy got reported. 3rd quarter, 0:00 left: Carlton 3.4.22 v Collingwood 2.1.13 Desperation from Jaimee Lambert, who attacks the contest at Collingwood’s 50 after the Pies put great pressure on the kick-in. Got the ball, chipped a pass to Sarah D’Arcy, but her set shot misses from about 40. She should have another chance a moment later, but a free kick going her way is reversed after she loses patience and kicks out at her opponent after being smashed to ground. Not a great look, though I think D’Arcy was really just trying to get a Carlton body off her and pushed out with her legs. The chance goes, and after a last late scramble in front of goal, the Blues get to three-quarter time without conceding. 3rd quarter, 4:00 left: Carlton 3.4.22 v Collingwood 2.1.13 Katie Loynes tackling hard at half back, but the Pies send it back inside 50 looking for Hope. She fingertips it in the left pocket but can’t hang on. A scramble for this ball outside 50, a couple of ball-ups. Hosking tries to run away from the contest for Carlton but is dragged down. Tayla Harris gets on the end of the kick up the wing, The ball comes inside 50, where Gee runs down Emma Grant of the Pies, picks up the loose ball, but her kick is touched on its way to goal. Carlton doing it in points. 3rd quarter, 8:00 left: Carlton 3.3.21 v Collingwood 2.1.13 Livingstone back on the field for Collingwood, so good news that her shoulder injury wasn’t too bad. She’s hassled out of possession in the centre of the ground at this stage. Lauren Brazzale runs onto the ball at half forward, pumps it long towards goal, Vescio knocks it clear, Sophie Li goes off the ground but hits the post. 3rd quarter, 10:50 left: Carlton 3.2.20 v Collingwood 2.1.13 The speed of Carlton’s forward line is the hallmark of this third quarter. Georgia Gee toepoking forward, beating a couple of pursuers, getting the ball inside 50. Then Darcy Vescio running down Iilish Ross for a holding the ball decision near the 50. Goes inboard, Harris marks in front, but tugs the set shot wide for a point. 2nd quarter, 0:00 left: Carlton 3.1.19 v Collingwood 2.1.13 A ding-dong battled on Collingwood’s right forward flank, as two sets of players refused to give in - Barden busting through tackles again, Davey keeping composure, a chain of possessions for the Blues just trying to find safety while the Pies hassled them relentlessly. Great football with 90 seconds left to half time. The ball eventually crosses over to the left flank, goes back to centre wing, and then Chloe Molly for the Pies sends a raking pass forward that ands right on the chest of Christina Bernardi. She would have to cover 50 metres after the siren though, and her kick is smothered as she searches for the extra distance. The gap remains one goal at the long break. 2nd quarter, 4:30 left: Carlton 3.1.19 v Collingwood 2.1.13 Amelia Barden finally gets the goal for Collingwood! Some scrambling, some fumbling, then the handpass comes through to Barden in traffic inside 50, and she slams the ball on the boot to send a low tumbling punt just inside the right-hand post. 2nd quarter, 5:45 left: Carlton 3.1.19 v Collingwood 1.1.7 Steph Chiocci breaks free for Collingwood, streams forward, but pushes her kick from the right forward flank across the face. One point. 2nd quarter, 8:30 left: Carlton 3.1.19 v Collingwood 1.0.6 They’re just mired in their defensive 50, the Magpies. Scrambling the back pocket with Vescio circling again. Finally they break free, get to half forward, Garner and McIntosh combining, but eventually Bri Davey takes a relieving defensive mark for Carlton. 2nd quarter, 13:00 left: Carlton 3.1.19 v Collingwood 1.0.6 What a grab! Alison Downie, former basketballer, uses all of her 180 centimetre frame to take a strong grab in the goalsquare, after the pass came in from the boundary line following a last-touch free kick for out of bounds. Slots the goal. Carlton with the first blow in this quarter, and the Pies must find a way back fast. Carlton set up their structure and it started to hold sway after Collingwood’s early flurry. Adelaide Strikers are 1 for 65 in the 9th over in the BBL semi-final, if you’re wondering. 1st quarter, 0:00 left: Carlton 2.1.13 v Collingwood 1.0.6 Brilliant offensive tackle! Maddison Gay, a former star netballer, relishes the chance to get involved in a contact sport. Smashes down a tackle in front of goal, but hits the post from about 35 out after winning the free for holding the ball. A minute later Georgia Gee has a chance on the run from the pocket, but is smothered, and Sophie Li has a post-siren shot from the 50 after the Pies are pinged for a throw. That’s quarter time. 1st quarter, 3:30 left: Carlton 2.0.12 v Collingwood 1.0.6 Back it comes, and Katie Loynes gets a free after being landed on flush in the middle of her back. Her kick from deep in the pocket is skewed, but Tayla Harris runs across the face of goal with the flight and pulls down a sensational mark! Under pressure, but hauled it in, goes back, and slots the tight-angle goal. Her first for the Blues, and Carlton lead! 1st quarter, 4:30 left: Carlton 1.0.6 v Collingwood 1.0.6 Harris with a couple of intercepts for Carlton across half-back, but the second time she tries to go forward the kick rolls out in the pocket. So we see the yee-haw signal from the umpire that indicates it’s a turnover. The ball heads to the far pocket where it’s buried under a pack. Eventually the free goes to Sarah Hosking from Carlton for a hold. Pumps it to the goalsquare but Collingwood stand firm to clear. 1st quarter, 7:30 left: Carlton 1.0.6 v Collingwood 1.0.6 Pressure inside Carlton’s 50, with Vescio snapping around the loose ball, but Collingwood find a way out through Mo Hope... 1st quarter, 9:30 left: Carlton 1.0.6 v Collingwood 1.0.6 And Kate Shierlaw slots it! Drew the free for some contact off the play in the forward pocket, went back and nailed the set shot. Livingstone is down the race, and was tagging Tayla Harris before going off. Plenty of feeling in this already, some pushing and shoving as the ball goes over the boundary, and a couple of big hits in the contest for the ball. Stacey Livingstone has popped her shoulder out, by the looks, and runs from the field as Tayla Harris waits with the ball. Had it wrenched in a marking contest. But as the ball goes inside 50 there’s a free kick for Carlton... 1st quarter, 13:30 left: Carlton 0.0.0 v Collingwood 1.0.6 Twice in a row! Jasmine Garner kicked the first ever AFLW goal last year, and she kicks the first of the season this year. Found safely in the forward pocket, and slots it from 30 out.

Brianna Davey leads the Carlton Blues out onto the ground. In late golden sunlight, they do their laps and the club song is played, the banner is torn, and the crowd is cheering. The stands are pretty full already, and there are live sites outside the ground with big screens for people to watch. Rule changes for this season: five players on the bench, and the last player to dispose of a ball before it goes out of bounds is penalised, unless it hits another player on the way without them taking possession. Sixteen players on the field, and two minutes of stoppage time per quarter.

The second season of the AFL Women’s competition is about to get underway, after such a joyful breakout success the first time around, and a lot anticipation in the build-up to this moment. The old firms, the old rivalry, in a new incarnation: Collingwood v Carlton from Princes Park, on a beautiful Melbourne summer night. Could not be better. Geoff will be here shortly. But there’s still time to have a read of this lovely piece of writing from Kirby Fenwick:"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/28/observer-view-cloning-primates-macaque-monkeys-shanghai-scientists-exact-copies-humans","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-28T00:03:22Z","webTitle":"The Observer view on cloning | Observer editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/28/observer-view-cloning-primates-macaque-monkeys-shanghai-scientists-exact-copies-humans","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/28/observer-view-cloning-primates-macaque-monkeys-shanghai-scientists-exact-copies-humans","fields":{"headline":"The Observer view on cloning","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"With their huge eyes and spindly limbs, the two cloned macaque monkeys, whose births in China were announced last week, made irresistible front page fodder. Created by scientists at the Institute of Neuroscience in Shanghai, the animals, Hua Hua and Zhong Zhong, certainly looked cute. Cuddled together, they displayed an almost human vulnerability, a connection that was not lost on headline writers: “One Step Closer to Human Clones,” claimed one front page. It is only 21 years since the Observer revealed to the world that scientists in Scotland had created the world’s first mammalian clone, Dolly the sheep. Now this triumph has been followed up with a pair of cloned macaques, creatures that are much closer to Homo sapiens in genetic terms than sheep. The suggestion that a similar trick would soon be carried out on humans was therefore too tempting to ignore. We should be cautious before reaching such a dramatic conclusion, however. For a start, there was a crucial difference in the procedures adopted to create Dolly and those involved in bringing Hua Hua and Zhong Zhong into the world. The latter were cloned from a cell taken not from an adult macaque but from a macaque foetus. In contrast, Dolly was cloned from the cell of an adult ewe. The Chinese team did try to emulate this process and did indeed create – with considerable difficulty – two baby macaques from embryos cloned from adult cells. However, both died: one from impaired body development, the other from respiratory failure. Thus the Shanghai scientists still fell short of the achievement of Dolly’s creators who took an adult cell and from this created a viable foetus. For good measure, it should also be pointed out how inefficient were the procedures used in creating Hua Hua and Zhong Zhong. They involved implanting a total of 79 embryos into 21 surrogate mothers, and from these a mere six pregnancies were established. Hua Hua and Zhong Zhong were the only live births that survived these pregnancies. As several geneticists have since observed, the creation of the two genetically identical macaques actually shows that the cloning of primates remains a highly inefficient and unsafe business and that the idea of humans becoming the focus of such work is still a far-off prospect. To be fair to the team responsible for creating Hua Hua and Zhong Zhong, it was not their intention to develop techniques that could make it possible to clone human beings. “We cloned macaques to produce animal models useful for medicine, for human health. There’s no intention for us to apply this method to humans,” one project scientist told journalists last week. Instead, their work is directed at gaining new awareness of diseases such as Alzheimer’s, they argued. If they could set up a pool of genetically identical primates it should then be possible to study their DNA in order to understand how neuro-degenerative ailments progress. This kind of research is undoubtedly worthy. Nevertheless, by involving primates, the scientists – unavoidably – reopened the debate about human reproductive cloning. Work on such a goal is already banned in many countries, including the UK, and, as we have seen, it remains a remote prospect. Yet the idea that one day it may be possible to create an exact copy of a person – a deceased loved one, for example – continues to obsess writers and columnists. It is a delusion. Even if it did become possible to create a clone of an individual, that person would still be a very different entity. Changes in gene expression that occur in the womb, a process known as epigenetics, as well as nutritional variations and other random events, would produce a person who might look achingly familiar but who would behave quite differently to that lost loved one. Far from providing succour, a clone is far more likely to cause unhappiness and distress. In short, human cloning is neither practical at present or desirable in the long term. We should cherish the variety that is inherent in our species instead."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"technology/2018/jan/27/denmark-teenage-facebook-sex-video-row-widens","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-27T22:00:01Z","webTitle":"Denmark split as row over teenage Facebook sex video widens","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jan/27/denmark-teenage-facebook-sex-video-row-widens","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/jan/27/denmark-teenage-facebook-sex-video-row-widens","fields":{"headline":"Denmark split as row over teenage Facebook sex video widens","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"The two teenagers at the centre of the Facebook sex video case dividing Denmark are deeply unhappy at a police decision to revisit the offence, their lawyer has said. A video shot without permission of the teenagers engaging in sexual acts at a party three years ago, when both were 15, was shared by Danish teenagers on social media in 2015 and early 2016 before gradually falling out of circulation. But since 15 January, when police announced that they planned to charge 1,004 of those who shared the video on Facebook for distributing child pornography, interest in the video has surged. “You could say, ‘Aren’t they happy that the police are finally doing something?’,” Helle Hald, a partner at the Sirius law firm in Copenhagen, said. “Well, no, they’re not at all happy. Of course, this affects the victims because people, once again, are talking about this video. I don’t think any of the rest of us can imagine how awful it is.” Superintendent Flemming Kjærside, who leads Denmark’s cyber-related sexual offences unit, said: “The most important thing is the victims ... They will suffer from this for the rest of their lives.” The news that teenagers and young adults across 11 of Denmark’s 12 regions and in Greenland face child pornography charges, despite most of them being 15 or 16 at the time they shared the video, received extensive coverage in Denmark and abroad. Those found guilty are unlikely to receive a prison sentence but, if convicted of distributing child pornography, it will remain on their records for at least 10 years, preventing them from obtaining the “children’s certificate” required to work as a teacher, scout leader, sports coach, police officer or in other roles involving minors. “It’s the world’s dumbest thing,” Mira Bech, 19, one of those being charged, told Denmark’s TV2 channel. “There are so many who have had this video who have not been called in for questioning. My friends wonder why it’s only me who’s been questioned. It’s ridiculous.” Preben Bang Henriksen, who speaks on legal matters for the governing Liberal party, told the Politiken newspaper that he would consider moves to change the law if the teenagers were prosecuted for child pornography. His proposal has won the support of at least three other parties, with only the opposition Social Democrats supporting the law as it stands. “A lot of parents are complaining, and I guess I would have done the same if someone from my family was involved,” Kjærside said. “But I can’t stop an investigation because I feel sorry for those involved. By law, we are obliged to investigate.” After the girl in the video went to the police in 2015, the two teenage boys who filmed and shared it were prosecuted and fined 2,000 Danish kroner (£235), making them immune from charges under the police’s Operation Umbrella. Helle Hald said that in 2016 she had tried to push local police in the area north of Copenhagen, where the offence took place, to investigate and charge other teens who had shared the video, but had not succeeded, despite providing evidence of the video being shared. Police revived the case late last year, when Kjærside’s unit was contacted by Europol and handed data collected by Facebook detailing all the Danish citizens who had shared the video. Facebook detected US citizens sharing the video and passed the data to the US National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, who passed it to the Department of Homeland Security, who contacted Europol. Kjærside said this was the first time in Europe that police had made a concerted effort to tackle the widespread and growing problem of teenagers sharing sexual videos and pictures of each other, often without permission. “This is not only a Danish phenomenon. It’s also known in the UK, Germany, Italy,” he said. “Everybody has this problem, but none of them, so far as we know, has made such a big effort as we’re doing.” He welcomed the media attention that the operation has brought, saying that it was finally getting through to teenagers that sharing sex videos without the consent of those filmed is a crime. “We are running campaigns all the time about this, but nobody listens,” he said. “This time we’ve really got their attention.” The first 10 cases, selected to represent different levels of severity of offence and likelihood of conviction, are expected to go to trial next week."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2018/jan/28/medieval-history-robert-halfron-cabinet-ministers","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-28T00:04:24Z","webTitle":"Is medieval history really bunk?

Not if you’re a cabinet minister","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Historians have been ridiculed since Herodotus, the “father of history”, was mocked by his Athenian contemporary, Thucydides, as a mere storyteller. So it was with some weariness that medieval historians took to their keyboards last week to respond to the latest slur against their discipline. Robert Halfon, who chairs the Commons select committee on education, is no Thucydides, but he echoed complaints down the ages when he singled out medieval historians as undeserving of public funding. The former skills minister called for discounts on student fees for degrees in subjects that address skill shortages: healthcare, coding, construction or engineering. Not medieval history. “If someone wants to do medieval history, that’s fine,” Halfon told the Times. “You still take out your loan and pay it. But all the incentives from government and so on should go to areas the country needs and will bring it most benefit.” At Cambridge, which has one of the largest concentrations of ancient and medieval historians in the world, there was some surprise at Halfon’s implication that history graduates do little to benefit the country. Three of the current cabinet have history degrees: Amber Rudd, the home secretary, Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, and David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister and de facto deputy prime minister, who completed his PhD at Cambridge on medieval court practices. John Arnold, professor of medieval history at King’s College, Cambridge, pointed out that few cabinet ministers in the past 30 years have had degrees in science, technology, engineering or maths. “They mostly did PPE [philosophy, politics and economics] and history, and seem to have prospered with that background. Halfon’s comments seem part and parcel of how successive governments have wanted to turn higher education from a public common good into a privatised commodity. This is not something we find in most other successful economies.” It’s not hard to find events in medieval times that resonate today. The 1294 financial crisis prompted Edward I to seize his bankers’ assets, only to be forced to pay far higher rates of interest to other moneylenders. Climate change in the 14th century – better known as the little ice age – and the black death saw a dramatic population decline, which led to investment in technology and higher wages. As living standards rose, the ties of feudalism loosened. “As it’s the 14th century, you might think it has no bearing or relevance to the challenges we face today,” said Chris Briggs, a lecturer in medieval British social and economic history. “Medieval history encourages rigour and seriousness about how you handle your sources and distinguish truth from fiction, which in today’s world we could with a bit more of.” Analysing documents, archaeological artefacts and paintings was a pathway to a huge variety of careers, according to Miri Rubin, professor of medieval history at Queen Mary University of London. “What’s really exciting is to show that so many of our debates today, debates about pornography, debates about women’s rights, debates about the relationship between rich and poor, were all studied by a lot of smart people then as well,” Rubin said. “One can play a game of utilitarian arguments. One can also play another game, maybe not as fashionable, which is one of values, human knowledge, the sheer exercise of learning and testing yourself, and coming back a richer, better, more tolerant, better informed person.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jan/27/third-man-charged-with-of-london-model-harry-uzoka","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-27T09:42:48Z","webTitle":"Third man charged with murder of London model Harry Uzoka","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jan/27/third-man-charged-with-of-london-model-harry-uzoka","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jan/27/third-man-charged-with-of-london-model-harry-uzoka","fields":{"headline":"Third man charged with murder of London model Harry Uzoka","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A third man has been charged with the murder of a 25-year-old London model who was fatally stabbed. Merse Dikanda, 23, of no fixed abode, was to appear at Westminster magistrates court on Saturday accused of killing Harry Uzoka. He is also charged with possession of a bladed or pointed article. Uzoka, who was signed to Premier Model Management, which helped launch the careers of Naomi Campbell and Claudia Schiffer, was found injured in Shepherd’s Bush at about 4pm on 11 January, the Metropolitan police said. Scotland Yard has said it believes he was attacked outside Ollgar House, a block of flats in Ollgar Close, before staggering to the nearby street. Officers and a London air ambulance crew attended the scene but he was pronounced dead shortly after 5pm. George Koh, 24, and Jonathan Okigbo, 23, both from north London, have already appeared in court charged with his murder. Koh was also charged with possession of an offensive weapon. Tributes were paid to the model after his death, with the singer, MNEK, tweeting: “SHOCKED. i met him various times and thought he was always so cool. my heart goes out to his family. RIP.” Uzoka was described by one of the companies he worked for as a “wonderful model but, even more so, a good person and a pleasure to work with”.

The US president has been criticised as uniquely divisive on issues ranging from tax cuts to immigration. On Friday he used Twitter to mock the Democratic minority leader in the Senate as “Cryin’ Chuck Schumer”, who, he said, took “a beating” over last weekend’s government shutdown. But two years after Barack Obama used his final state of the union address to express regret over growing rancour and polarisation in Washington, Trump will seek to portray himself as a unifier presiding over a successful economy. “I’d say to Congress the tone will be one of bipartisanship,” a senior administration official told reporters on Friday. “It will be very forward-looking.” The official added: “In a sense, every state of the union is about where we are, where we’re going, what kind of country we want to be and certainly this will have a dimension of that which of course transcends party differences.” The theme of the speech, the official said, will be “building a safe, strong and proud America”. It will cover five principal issues: the “roaring” economy, a trillion-dollar infrastructure plan, immigration reform, fair and reciprocal trade with other countries and national security, which includes “returning to clarity about our friends and our adversaries”. The White House could not specify whether the threat of climate change would feature in the speech or whether Trump would acknowledge female members of Congress planning to wear black to support the #MeToo movement against sexual harassment. Whereas immigration reform and border security remain bitterly divisive, the massive effort to rebuild America’s crumbling infrastructure is seen as having potential to get Democrats on board. “It’s clearly something that the president believes has large bipartisan support,” the official said. In the same spirit, Trump – whose approval rating is at record lows with women, African Americans and Latino people – will seek to broaden his appeal. “The speech will make clear that all groups are benefiting under this presidency,” the White House official said. “I think you can expect that the president is going to show that it’s great for America that all income groups, all people, every background are being lifted up by these policies.” Trump has been condemned as vulgar, sexist and racist, for example after recent alleged comments dismissing Haiti and African countries as “shitholes”, and his impulsive tweets at all hours are notorious for upending policies and diplomatic relations. His address to a joint session of Congress last February, however, showed a more restrained side and optimistic vision. On Tuesday, the president is likely to strike a triumphalist note, claiming credit for the stock market reaching record highs and unemployment hitting a 17-year low – achievements that critics say have been accompanied by attacks on workers’ rights. The invited audience will include beneficiaries of last month’s tax cut and reform legislation as well as what the White House called “heroes” of the effort to combat the opioid crisis. The senior administration official added: “The president will be talking about several of his record-setting accomplishments for his first year, how the policies of his administration are lifting all Americans, which is setting the foundation for building a safe, strong and proud America. “You can expect the president will be speaking from the heart. It will be a speech that resonates with our American values and unites us with patriotism and also unites us with the greatly expanded opportunities that is lifting up all Americans. “People will be reminded - in some cases surprised - about how much President Trump has accomplished in his first year for all Americans.” Congressman Joe Kennedy III of Massachusetts – grandson of Bobby Kennedy and grand-nephew of John F Kennedy – will deliver the Democratic response to the address. The pornographic film actor Stormy Daniels, who reportedly had an affair with Trump in 2006, will appear on Jimmy Kimmel’s show on ABC later that night."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/live/2018/jan/27/melbourne-stars-v-hobart-hurricanes-big-bash-league-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-27T08:25:12Z","webTitle":"Melbourne Stars beat Hobart Hurricanes in the Big Bash League – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2018/jan/27/melbourne-stars-v-hobart-hurricanes-big-bash-league-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2018/jan/27/melbourne-stars-v-hobart-hurricanes-big-bash-league-live","fields":{"headline":"Melbourne Stars beat Hobart Hurricanes in the Big Bash League – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"So, a disastrous result for the Hurricanes, who had the chance to lock in a top four spot. A three-wicket defeat means they must now rely on the result of Brisbane Heat-Melbourne Renegades game at the Gabba this evening. Kevin Pietersen’s 46 was thrilling, and a fitting way for him to bid farewell to the Stars – perhaps a reminder of better times, after a season from hell for his side. Thanks for joining me today, until next time. 20th over: Melbourne Stars 7-186 (Gulbis 19, Worrall 9) Four off six balls is the equation before the final gets under way, to be bowled by Christian. Worrall cuts.... for four! And that’s that, settled on the first ball! 19th over: Melbourne Stars 7-182 (Gulbis 19, Worrall 9) Mills, amazingly, is given the ball. Just singles off the first couple of balls and then a rare dot ball! Excellent now from Mills but then Gulbis sends him back over his head for six! And with just four needed now, that could be that. Mills finishes with figures of 2-56 and we’re heading into the final over. 18th over: Melbourne Stars 7-174 (Gulbis 12, Worrall 8) Archer’s given the ball and initially it’s a good decision – just three singles off the first three balls – but then he beams Worrall, who deflects the ball down to the third man boundary for four! Five in total, and an extra ball to bowl! At least the free hit is well bowled and no run is taken. But then Gulbis smashes a six back over his head! And it’s a no ball! That could well be the turning point of this match. Gulbis is caught out, but he’ll survive because of the free hit and he has the strike! Twelve to win off 12 balls now. Disastrous for the Hurricanes! 17th over: Melbourne Stars 7-157 (Gulbis 3, Worrall 2) Worrall’s up and running early on, and a few more are added. It’s in the balance now – 29 off 18 is doable, but with three wickets left? 17th over: Melbourne Stars 7-153 (Gulbis 1, Gotch 16) Gotch attempts a huge slog sweep but he’s trapped lbw by Rose! Plum, no questions asked. Not looking so rosy for the Stars now, that’s a big wicket. 16th over: Melbourne Stars 6-152 (Gulbis 1, Gotch 16) Gulbis gets off the mark immediately and the Stars need 34 off four overs. 16th over: Melbourne Stars 6-151 (Pietersen 46, Gotch 16) Oh dear, it’s Mills back into the Hurricanes’ attack. And KP is excited at that prospect. Back-to-back boundaries off the first two balls before he adds a third on the next! A six to follow? Yeah, go on then, why not? KP’s going out with a bang! And then he really does go! A brilliant catch from Mills sends KP back to the sheds and out of BBL cricket! 15th over: Melbourne Stars 5-133 (Pietersen 28, Gotch 16) Gotch now takes Boyce to task before KP attempts a reverse sweep on the final ball – it’s not his finest effort though, but he still picks up a single. The Stars need 53 off 30 balls now. 14th over: Melbourne Stars 5-124 (Pietersen 25, Gotch 10) Archer tries to change deliveries up this over but it doesn’t pay off. Gotch is fortunate on the final ball of the over as KP live commentates while running through for two. Seriously. 13th over: Melbourne Stars 5-115 (Pietersen 24, Gotch 3) Christian bowling, KP motoring along nicely. 12th over: Melbourne Stars 5-107 (Pietersen 17, Gotch 1) Boyce nearly has his head taken off as KP smashes the spinner’s first delivery back past him. It’s a single only. A couple of dot balls follow before Gotch gets off the mark. 11th over: Melbourne Stars 5-104 (Pietersen 16, Hastings 20) Mills dollies his first ball down the leg side – that’s a wide – and then KP launches him over mid-off for a six! Not great from the Englishman (Mills, not KP) and a full toss later, which KP smacks away to the boundary, plus another wide and another single to Pietersen, the Stars reach 100. It doesn’t get any better either, with another full toss dispatched to the boundary by Hastings. But finally, on the final ball of an expensive over – he goes for 17 – he picks up the wicket of Hastings, who edges behind! 10th over: Melbourne Stars 4-87 (Pietersen 5, Hastings 16) Hastings runs around Boyce’s next ball, makes plenty of room and it’s four! He backs that up with a six, smacked hard, and low. And then another! This time he gets plenty of air on it, back over Boyce’s head and that’s turned into a decent over for the Stars! 10th over: Melbourne Stars 4-71 (Pietersen 5, Quiney 11) Confusion reigns for a while as we wait for a decision on a run out. Wade doesn’t know if he had the ball in his gloves when the bails came off, or wether it was his gloves that knocked them off. The decision goes his way though, and Quiney is on his way! Ninth over: Melbourne Stars 3-70 (Pietersen 5, Quiney 10) Here we go, Quiney takes Short to task with a low-trajectory six, back over the bowler’s head first up this over. Pietersen survives a big lbw shout a few balls later... it’s a close one, but no reaction from the umpire. He then thick edges and the ball races away to the boundary and an umanned third man. Eighth over: Melbourne Stars 3-59 (Pietersen 1, Quiney 3) Quiney knocks a single and KP will get his first look at Boyce. He nudges through on the on side and he’s up and running in his final Stars game! Eighth over: Melbourne Stars 3-56 (Faulkner 16, Quiney 1) Boyce now tasked with making inroads into the Stars batting lineup and he does so after just two balls as he tempts Faulkner into going for the boundary. Easy take for Malenko in the end. And here comes KP. Seventh over: Melbourne Stars 2-56 (Faulkner 16, Quiney 1) Faulkner booms a six as Short is brought back down to earth on the final ball off the over. Quiney off the mark too. 130 off 78 balls needed now. Seventh over: Melbourne Stars 2-46 (Faulkner 7, Dunk 30) D’Arcy Short is brought into the attack and he makes an immediate impact, as Dunk pops one up for an easy catch taken by Rose! Sixth over: Melbourne Stars 1-46 (Faulkner 7, Dunk 30) Archer again, and he’s frustrated as Dunk pushes one to mid-off but it drops inches short of the fieldsman! Just four off the over and that’s the end of the power play with the Stars on 1-46. Fifth over: Melbourne Stars 1-42 (Faulkner 6, Dunk 28) Mills is brought into the action and before too long Dunk hoiks him over mid-wicket for a huge six. He then attempts a slower ball, but Dunk sees it early and tickles off his pads for four. The Stars are going well and now need 148 off 90 to win. Fourth over: Melbourne Stars 1-30 (Faulkner 5, Dunk 17) Christian lopes in again, and the new batsman Faulkner, bumped up the order a bit today, finds the fielder at mid-off. Faulkner’s off the mark the next ball as a punch through the off side trickles to the boundary. And he picks up another single on the last ball of the over to keep the strike. Fourth over: Melbourne Stars 1-25 (Handscomb 7, Dunk 17) Handscomb tries to go big on Christian’s first ball, but his timing’s not really been there today, and it’s easily claimed by Malenko. Third over: Melbourne Stars 0-25 (Handscomb 7, Dunk 17) Handscomb attempts a slog sweep but he misses it, as does Wade behind the stumps, and that’ll be one run. On the next ball, Dunk hits a maximum, measured at 89m (metres, not miles), the first of this innings. He goes again for the same shot a few balls later, but this time the connection isn’t quite as sweet and he has to settle for a boundary. A very solid start. Second over: Melbourne Stars 0-12 (Handscomb 6, Dunk 6) Archer into the attack but Dunk and Handscomb continue amassing singles before Dunk opens up a bit on the fourth ball, and picks up another two. By the end of the second over, there’s a nice symmetry to the scorebook, if you’re into that kind of thing. First over: Melbourne Stars 0-6 (Handscomb 3, Dunk 3) The shadows are lengthening across the MCG turf as Dunk, opening the batting as well as the Stars bowling, and Handscomb walk out to the middle. Clive Rose first up for the Hurricanes, and Handscomb gives himself some room on the off side on the opening delivery to get things up and running. A succession of singles follow and that’s a decent start for the Stars. 20th over: Hobart Hurricanes 7-185 (Archer 7, Boyce 0) And there it is! They run a bye on the final ball of the over, and Melbourne Stars will have to make 186 to win this one. Back in a tick for the Stars’ innings, don’t go anywhere. 20th over: Hobart Hurricanes 7-184 (Archer 7, Reardon 32) Archer digs out his first ball, and picks up two before Handscomb spills the throw back to the stumps and there’ll be four overthrows! Six on his first ball! Reardon is then easily run out as Hastings scoops the ball up cleanly off his own bowling before scampering back to the stumps and taking the bails off with Reardon not even close to getting there. 20th over: Hobart Hurricanes 6-177 (Christian 56, Reardon 32) Hastings will bowl the last over, and he’s immediately cracked to the boundary over mid-off by Christian. And it’s called a no-ball, to make matters worse. Christian picks up a further two off the free hit before Hastings is called for a wide. He recovers on the next ball though, as Christian gets a thick edge and is caught behind! 19th over: Hobart Hurricanes 5-169 (Christian 50, Reardon 32) Here’s Gulbis, tasked with limiting the Hurricanes’ total with just two overs left. The bowler tries to bounce Christian but he’s equal to it and hooks for six before he cracks a four past mid-off on the next ball! He reaches his 50, his first this season, and that’s that this over. One over left. 18th over: Hobart Hurricanes 5-155 (Christian 37, Reardon 31) Reardon goes again, and that’s another big six, back over the head of bowler Hastings! Reardon then puts Hastings’ very life under threat as he hammers the ball back towards him, narrowly missing the bowler’s head! It’s a four and they go on to put 15 runs on the board this over. 17th over: Hobart Hurricanes 5-140 (Christian 37, Reardon 16) A ninth wide, this time from Worrall, and here’s KP again. “Story of the season,” he says, of all these first ball errors from his team-mates. Reardon then ups the ante a bit, crashing a boundary before plundering a huge six! “We’ve nothing to lose,” continues KP. “so we’ll just go out there and have a donk.” Which reminds me of this ridiculousness. 16th over: Hobart Hurricanes 5-127 (Christian 36, Reardon 5) Christian has looked good for his total so far. He picks up another two with a middled drive to the off side, which is brilliantly collected by Gotch. But that’s not a bad over from Faulkner. 15th over: Hobart Hurricanes 5-122 (Christian 32, Reardon 4) “Catch it” cry the Stars, but there’s no chance of that as the ball lands nowhere near a fielder in green. Likewise the next ball, but for different reasons, as Christian lofts Bowe for a magnificent six! Just over 19,000 inside the MCG today. 14th over: Hobart Hurricanes 5-112 (Christian 24, Reardon 3) Reardon gets up and running on his second ball before he adds a third run to his tally with a turn off his hips down to fine leg. 14th over: Hobart Hurricanes 5-107 (Christian 23, Milenko 4) Milenko absolutely smites Faulkner on the first ball of the over, ever so slightly in the air, and it’s brilliantly caught low down by Hastings! A world away from the missed chance last over! 13th over: Hobart Hurricanes 4-107 (Christian 23, Milenko 4) Oh my goodness me! Milenko misjudges a shot, the ball rockets straight up into the sky, the bowler Gulbis is under it.... but on its return to earth, he completely misses it! As it, he doesn’t even get a hand on it. That’s hilarious. And he affords himself a wry smile. Five singles from the over. Tim again. “KP seems to be permanently auditioning for something,” he writes in. “He’s a cricketing Yosser Hughes. He’s certainly a character on C9, clearly missing the memo not to talk about the BBL.” 12th over: Hobart Hurricanes 4-102 (Christian 21, Milenko 1) Good flight from Bowe on his first ball to Milenko, who fends it off well before he gets on the mark on the next ball. And that’s over. 12th over: Hobart Hurricanes 4-101 (Christian 21, McDermott 21) More spin from Bowe but Christian doesn’t stand on ceremony, getting to the ball before it pitches and smacking it for four to bring up the 100. A single follows before Bowe traps McDermott lbw! There’s a huge shout, the umpire considers it for an age, and then finally gives it! 11th over: Hobart Hurricanes 3-96 (Christian 16, McDermott 21) McDermott, with a beautifully controlled shot, hits Faulkner for four on the new bowler’s first delivery and a couple of balls later he finds the opposite boundary. This pair end up putting on another 12 this over, and they’re beginning to open up a bit now. The current run rate is 8.68 10th over: Hobart Hurricanes 3-84 (Christian 15, McDermott 10) Great fielding on the boundary to deny McDermott four runs. Still, he runs three before a wide is called on a Gulbis bouncer. A few other singles this over take Hobart to 84 halfway through their innings. Ninth over: Hobart Hurricanes 3-76 (Christian 13, McDermott 5) McDermott catches a top edge on a sweep shot off the bowling of Bowe, but it lands safe. And KP is still talking, now about his relationship with some of the Stars’ younger players – he makes Gotch get his drinks on nights out is the big take home. Eighth over: Hobart Hurricanes 3-70 (Christian 9, McDermott 3) Hastings flings down a bouncer and it’s called a wide. KP on the mike: “It’s been a mixed bag. A mixed bag of a season. The head space and confidence is not where it should be.” And then he has a big chat with the commentators about the IPL auction. Is he concentrating on the game or what? Meanwhile, the runs tick over for the Hurricanes. Seventh over: Hobart Hurricanes 3-63 (Christian 5, McDermott 1) Here goes Liam Bowe and, stone the crows, his first ball isn’t a bad one! A couple of singles before Bowe has Christian in some of trouble with one that turns but on the next ball it’s the batsman’s turn to gain the upper hand, cracking a four through the covers. Sixth over: Hobart Hurricanes 3-57 (Christian 0, McDermott 0) Hastings completes his first over, and a decent one it was too. “Hello Mike,” writes in Tim. “Welcome to the BBL party! I’ll be at the Perth Stadium on Thursday and can’t wait to follow your ball by ball from the stands. All the best for today, and Thursday. Don’t you forget now.” So, you’re saying we should OBO the semis, Tim? Sixth over: Hobart Hurricanes 3-57 (Wade 17, McDermott 0) Hastings into the attack, and his first one is, of course, not great. But then on his second he claimed the scalp of Wade, who is caught in the deep by Gotch! Dan Christian strides to the crease. Fifth over: Hobart Hurricanes 2-53 (Wade 13, Bailey 32) Gulbis now into the attack, what can he do with his first ball? He’s down the leg side and it’s flicked away for four by Wade, so not really much better than his team-mates to be honest! Bailey then has to be quick getting back for two, but such is the size of the MCG field, he has the time to make it. But he slashes on the off side soon after and he’s caught by Worral, who does well to hang on! McDermot Fourth over: Hobart Hurricanes 1-44 (Wade 8, Bailey 28) Dear me, this is an awful start from Jackson Coleman, who, like Dunk and Worrall, delivers a stinking first ball. But he goes one, and then two better, by bowling two more on his next two deliveries, down the leg side. Three wides in total. Then an error by Worrall on the boundary sees the ball hit squeeze past him and to the ropes for four leg byes. Bailey smashes Coleman through point for four before he chalks up another boundary, this time thanks to a pull shot, and that’s a pretty good over for the Hurricanes. Third over: Hobart Hurricanes 1-28 (Wade 8, Bailey 20) Bailey takes the game by the scuff of its neck now. He attacks Dunk on the first ball, lifting him over the covers to pick up three before he dances down the track to smack the ball straight back past Dunk for a boundary a few balls later. And then a six, an 86m one, to round off an expensive over for Dunk, who goes for 16. Second over: Hobart Hurricanes 1-12 (Wade 5, Bailey 2) Worrall starts at the other end and Bailey adds another single to the tally before Wade does likewise. Bailey finds the middle of the bat on the next ball but his cover drive is straight to a man in green. He then pulls and they run two. Bailey pulls again next ball but it’s just one this time. Short goes for a golden duck! The ball raps his back pad on its way through and he’s given out! Bailey’s the new man in. First over: Hobart Hurricanes 1-3 (Wade 1, Bailey 0) First over: Hobart Hurricanes 0-0 (Wade 0, Short 0) Ben Dunk opens the bowling for the Stars and his first effort is awful. A wide is called and the Hurricanes are up and running. A nurdled single through the off side follows before Darcy Short takes guard for the first time... OK, a couple of minutes until we begin. Here’s KP, who’s miked up as the Stars take to the field, to bowl first. The women’s match at the MCG has just finished up, and we have this, courtesy of AAP: The resurgent Melbourne Stars cruised to an eight-wicket win over the Hobart Hurricanes in their WBBL clash at the MCG. Chasing a modest 108 for victory off their 20 overs and with both sides playing solely for pride with finals out of the equation, the Stars sailed home with ease, achieving victory with 12 balls remaining. Opener Katie Mack (42) was adjudged player of the match after leading the Stars’ steady chase and was well supported by England international Georgia Elwiss (28). Nicola Hancock (2-18) produced her best WBBL spell with the ball but the Hurricanes were caught short with the bat due to a combination of haphazard running between wickets, sharp Stars fielding and tight bowling from the home team. Hobart started well enough with West Indian Hayley Matthews (34) and wicketkeeper Georgia Redmayne (20) laying a solid foundation. A 5-12 collapse which included two run outs and two nifty stumpings from the fast hands of Stars keeper Nicole Faltum caused the Hurricanes’ innings to grind to a crawl. Alana King (2-23) and captain Kristen Beams (1-11) were the pick of the bowlers, helping the seventh-placed Stars to their third win from their past four starts. Hello and welcome! It’s a big day of Big Bash cricket today, the final day of the home-and-away season in the men’s competition. The Hurricanes head into this fixture at ‘G knowing victory will secure a finals berth, but lose and door opens for Brisbane Heat, who would still have a chance to sneak into the top four when they play the Melbourne Renegades later in the day. Today also marks the end of Stars star Kevin Pietersen’s personal big bash in Australia. He departs on what is being termed Rhino Day, as the England batsman moves into the next stage of his life, in conservation. Good on him, sure he’ll get a decent send-off from the Melbourne crowd. Anyway, we’ll be under way soon enough. Stick with us. In the meantime, feel free to get in touch with an email for tweet on the details above."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jan/27/last-resident-at-sydneys-sirius-given-fond-farewell","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-27T04:30:03Z","webTitle":"Last resident at Sydney's Sirius given fond farewell","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jan/27/last-resident-at-sydneys-sirius-given-fond-farewell","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jan/27/last-resident-at-sydneys-sirius-given-fond-farewell","fields":{"headline":"Last resident at Sydney's Sirius given fond farewell","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Myra Demetriou, the last resident in Sydney’s Sirius building, is preparing to leave the social housing complex, paving the way for its $100m sale by the New South Wales government to developers. Demetriou, legally blind and immobile, became an unlikely activist and the public face of the fight to save the Sirius complex. The building – a striking and well-known example of brutalist architecture on Sydney’s harbour – is one of several inner-city social housing properties being sold by the state government. The sales are designed to fund cheaper and more accommodation elsewhere, in the hope of easing the state’s huge waiting list for public housing. It has variously been described as “heartless”, a form of aggressive social cleansing, and short-sighted. Demetriou held out with unerring defiance. The state government first told the building’s 400 residents in 2014 that they would need to leave. The decision prompted a fight that has lasted four years and included a controversial decision not to place the building on the state heritage register in July 2016. The building slowly emptied, leaving Demetriou as its sole remaining occupant. “Someone told me that in other states, in social housing, once you’re over 65 they can’t move you out,” she told the Guardian last year. “Not here.” On Saturday morning, Demetriou was farewelled at a morning tea attended by deputy opposition leader Tanya Plibersek and Sydney lord mayor Clover Moore. Demetriou was described as “the glue that held her community together”. Plibersek condemned the NSW government’s “heartless” decision to move residents, saying it would transform Sydney into a more homogenous, less diverse place. “Myra is the sort of person that makes a suburb turn into a community,” she told the crowd on Saturday. Guests paid tribute to Demetriou’s tenacity and generosity, and said she was always willing to help neighbours. Moore lashed out at the state government’s “ideologically-driven” decision on the building. “Sirius will continue to be a symbol of the state government’s shocking inaction on providing affordable housing,” she said. “From every point of view – social, environmental, heritage and community – what is happening here is wrong.” Sydney MP Alex Greenwich vowed that the campaign to save the building would continue beyond the next state election in 2019. “What it represents is too important to Sydney to ever let go of this campaign,” he said. Greenwich also revealed that Demetriou would become the 2018 Sydney electorate woman of the year. “It is women like Myra that make the city so great and so strong,” he said. The building was put on the market for about $100m in December and the Save Our Sirius group has vowed to keep fighting to save it. It has also registered an interest to buy it from the state government. – with contribution from AAP"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/jan/27/scotland-good-enough-to-take-on-any-team-says-coach-gregor-townsend","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-27T22:14:00Z","webTitle":"Scotland good enough to take on any team, says coach Gregor Townsend","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jan/27/scotland-good-enough-to-take-on-any-team-says-coach-gregor-townsend","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jan/27/scotland-good-enough-to-take-on-any-team-says-coach-gregor-townsend","fields":{"headline":"Scotland good enough to take on any team, says coach Gregor Townsend","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Will Scotland be kingmakers or contenders in the Six Nations? The answer will be clearer on Saturday when they travel to Cardiff in the opening round. Scotland won the last Five Nations, in 1999, but since then their record in the tournament has rarely risen above the average and has too often been dire. They have won 24 of their 90 matches, 11 against Italy, and only twice have they won more games than they have lost, in 2006 and last year. Other than in Rome, they have recorded two away victories in 18 seasons, in Cardiff in 2002 and against Ireland at Croke Park eight years later. While last year’s home and away victories over Australia and a narrow defeat to New Zealand have seen them backed to finish at least in the top three, they have gone into past Six Nations campaigns armed with victories over major southern hemisphere nations – only to barely fire a shot. A difference this time is that Scotland, who a few years ago struggled to score tries, now bubble with daring and pace behind, conducted by Finn Russell at fly-half, a master at scenting opportunity in broken play. While last season’s captain, Greig Laidlaw, has recovered from injury to return to the squad, it may be a signal of Gregor Townsend’s intentions as head coach that John Barclay will lead the side against Wales, freeing the spontaneous Ali Price to continue in the No 9 jersey. “Energy is an important word that we use a lot,” says Townsend, who took over from Vern Cotter in the summer. “We want to bring it to our team meetings, have it in training and ensure that our players have the maximum levels of energy when we start the game in Cardiff. We have to build on what we achieved in the autumn, especially our last couple of games [against Australia and New Zealand] which will be fresh in our minds and which we have reviewed with the players. “We have to be ambitious. We believe we are good enough to take on any team in the world and we will have to be good with the second- and third-ranked teams in the world in the Six Nations [England and Ireland], along with Wales, who have won the tournament a number of times.” Unlike his recent predecessors, Townsend took over at a time when foundations had been laid and a leaky roof repaired. Cotter was statistically Scotland’s second-most successful coach, behind Sir Ian McGeechan in his first stint in charge, and their past two Six Nations campaigns have been the only ones when they have scored more points than they have conceded and the two when they have reached a century, 122 both years. “It is good that there are higher expectations on us,” says Townsend, who is without eight front-rowers for the Wales match. “When the players can reach them in certain games they get the belief that what they do on the field can lead to results. “The championship has changed since I was a player: it is huge, a proper world event and the best yearly tournament we have. Teams are looking to play faster rugby. Wales had the most passes of any team in the world in November so they are trying to move their game forward. The Scarlets have been comfortable playing rugby based on aggressive defence, trying to win the ball back and moving it from wherever. You have to adapt to whatever game the opposition puts in front of you.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/jan/27/warren-gatland-wales-england-six-nations-poor-premiership-club-form-rugby-union","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-27T22:01:17Z","webTitle":"Warren Gatland raises Wales stake by playing club card against England","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jan/27/warren-gatland-wales-england-six-nations-poor-premiership-club-form-rugby-union","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jan/27/warren-gatland-wales-england-six-nations-poor-premiership-club-form-rugby-union","fields":{"headline":"Warren Gatland raises Wales stake by playing club card against England","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Warren Gatland has ensured a high temperature for Wales’s second match, against England at Twickenham, by suggesting Eddie Jones’s defending Six Nations champions may suffer for the poor performances of Premiership clubs in the European Champions Cup this season. Only Saracens made it to the quarter-finals, with the holders claiming the final place because Ulster lost at Wasps. Northampton, Leicester and Harlequins finished bottom of their pools and only Sarries and Bath won more matches than they lost. All the English clubs were beaten at least once at home. “I look back on the form of English clubs in Europe and think that when they have five teams in the quarter-finals, you are looking at a pretty strong England squad,” said Gatland at the Six Nations launch. “You look now and they have one club, which qualified in eighth place. “There starts to be some question marks from my point of view and, I hope, my players. It gives you a bit of confidence and self-belief. We have a number of players from the Scarlets who became the third team to qualify for the quarter-finals after losing their first two matches, outstanding in Bath and then showing character against Toulon. They came into the squad with a spring in their step and that filters through to everyone else. “I can understand it from Eddie’s point of view because players are probably quite happy to get away from their clubs because they are coming back into an environment in which they are used to winning. They can mentally park their club form.” Dylan Hartley disagreed with Gatland. “We are at the launch of the Six Nations, not the Champions Cup,” said the England and Northampton captain. “We are an international side whose form is good and we want to be a better team than we were in November. We need to kick on and improve.” Hartley was backed by the England scrum-half Ben Youngs, whose club, Leicester, also won one of their five Champions Cup matches, having reached the semi-finals two years ago. “English clubs may not have had the best of seasons in Europe but that is not a reflection of where we will be internationally,” said Youngs. “You cannot make the comparison. The Champions Cup is a great tournament but so tough to win and it is showing just how strong rugby in Europe is. “What we have in England is huge strength in depth. We are a team that is about far more than 15 players, 23 or 32. I am just one of 100 who hopes to be involved in the World Cup next year. The Six Nations is a fantastic test of your squad as well as your resolve.” Jones said the form of the Premiership clubs in Europe was irrelevant. All that mattered to him was the response of his players, who went into camp in Portugal at the start of last week. “If they come into camp and are enthusiastic, wanting to work hard, that is what we are looking for,” he said. “Good players have good responses. Average players have average responses. Bad players have bad responses. We think we’ve got good players and will have a good response. The Champions Cup is irrelevant. Everything is about how you respond.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"gnm-archive/2018/jan/28/robert-kennedy-at-the-oxford-union-28-january-1967","type":"article","sectionId":"theobserver","sectionName":"From the Observer","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-28T00:05:30Z","webTitle":"Observer picture archive: Robert Kennedy at the Oxford Union, 28 January 1967","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/gnm-archive/2018/jan/28/robert-kennedy-at-the-oxford-union-28-january-1967","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/gnm-archive/2018/jan/28/robert-kennedy-at-the-oxford-union-28-january-1967","fields":{"headline":"Observer picture archive: Robert Kennedy at the Oxford Union, 28 January 1967","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"This news report, Kennedy: ‘Signs of peace in Vietnam’, was published in the Observer on 29 January 1967 Senator Robert Kennedy said at Oxford yesterday that the next three or four weeks could be “critical” in the attempt to achieve peace in Vietnam.

Fousseni Diabaté, making his debut, suggested he may be the next to follow in the footsteps of N’Golo Kanté and Riyad Mahrez with a man-of-the-match performance in this comfortable FA Cup victory. Signed for £2m from the Ligue 2 side Gazélec Ajaccio two weeks ago, the 22-year-old started wide right in a Leicester team featuring 10 changes from the side that beat Watford last Saturday. It was a selection that prompted questions of Claude Puel before the match. No one was quibbling by the end, however, and after a brace and an assist the Leicester fans were singing Diabaté’s name. “He played second division in France but I’ve followed him a lot and I thought he could become a good opportunity for Leicester,” Puel said of Diabaté. “I think he has good attributes to play in the Premier League: pace, a good engine. He can make good penetration but also good combinations with his team-mates. It was a good game for him to show his quality and step by step we will see if we can give him some game time in the Premier League.” Kelechi Iheanacho also scored twice, with Wilfred Ndidi rounding off the scoring and Puel was clear the changes he had made had not shown the competition any disrespect. “I am responsible,” he said. “It’s important to keep a good ambition in the Cup, it is an objective for us. But it is also the case that we want to improve the squad, to give them an opportunity to improve. Also to develop young players. Sometimes there’s a risk but for me it’s important to do this.” The team Puel sent out still featured two title winners in full-backs Christian Fuchs and Danny Simpson and also £50m of summer recruits in the shape of André Silva and Iheanacho. Alongside Diabaté there was also an opportunity for the England under-20 star Harvey Barnes, but whatever the names on the teamsheet the attitude from the first whistle showed the combination of strength and confidence necessary for the occasion. Diabaté opened the scoring in the ninth minute. After Peterborough misplaced a throw-in Silva seized possession and slid in Diabaté with a blind pass. Surrounded by defenders, Diabaté still had a lot to do but managed it comfortably, spinning past his marker and cushioning the ball into the far side of the net with the outside of his left foot. It was controlled, confident stuff and three minutes later City doubled their lead. Again the home side contributed to their undoing, Chris Forrester giving the ball away in the middle of the park. It was forced forward to Iheanacho on the edge of the box, with options left and right. The Nigerian opted to ignore all of them and, again, a controversial decision was vindicated as he finished low into the net from 25 yards. Iheanacho doubled his tally on the half hour. Demarai Gray and Fuchs enjoyed a sharp exchange of passes that set the full-back free on the left-hand side. The Austrian had time to size up his cross and whipped a beautiful ball to the far post, where Iheanacho volleyed home. The former Manchester City striker has struggled to make an impression in the Leicester first team since joining last summer but he has four goals in his last two Cup games. “I said one month ago we would try to give him some more game time,” Puel said. “He has taken his chance.” A half-time intervention from Grant McCann rallied Peterborough and they pulled back a goal on the hour through Andrew Hughes after a corner. This only served to refocus the visitors. They regained control of the game through the addition of Ndidi and Marc Albrighton to the field and might have scored more before finally closing out the game in the final knockings. Diabaté made it four in the 86th minute, firing into the roof of the net after Jonathan Bond had failed to hold on to Gray’s shot after a long run straight through the Peterborough defence. The scorer then turned provider, cutting in from the right and teeing up Ndidi for his own powerful finish. “We’ve done well to get to this point but we’re under no illusions,” said McCann. “We gifted them two goals and the match was over after 10 minutes. I thought Leicester were outstanding on the day but we were well below par. The big difference for me was the concentration levels in possession; every time they got the ball they had a picture of what to do next. It was a steep learning curve for us, but we’ll take tremendous benefit from today.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/jan/27/football-league-10-man-bristol-city-back-on-track-with-win-over-qpr","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-27T18:12:12Z","webTitle":"Football League: 10-man Bristol City back on track with win over QPR","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/27/football-league-10-man-bristol-city-back-on-track-with-win-over-qpr","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jan/27/football-league-10-man-bristol-city-back-on-track-with-win-over-qpr","fields":{"headline":"Football League: 10-man Bristol City back on track with win over QPR","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Championship Bristol City won 2-0 despite being reduced to 10 men just after the half-hour mark against QPR when Nathan Baker was dismissed for a late challenge on Josh Scowen. Even though they were a player light, Famara Diédhiou opened the scoring in first-half injury-time, heading home a Ryan Kent corner. Bristol City went on to double their lead after their break through Joe Bryan, who was first to react to a rebound. Lee Johnson’s side move up to fourth after ending a run of seven winless games in all competitions. Wolves took advantage of their closest rivals, Derby, not playing by beating Ipswich 1-0. Matt Doherty headed in the only goal of the match after good work from Alfred N’Diaye. The win leaves Wolves 12 points clear of the Rams who currently sit second. Fulham left it late to complete a 3-1 win over Barnsley as Kevin McDonald and Ryan Sessegnon both scored in second-half injury-time. Liam Lindsay had put Barnsley ahead in the 31st minute but they were in trouble from the point Dimitri Cavaré was dismissed on the stroke of half-time. Fulham regrouped through Sessegnon’s equaliser before two strikes in time added on completed the turnaround and moved Fulham into the top six. James Maddison once again showed why he is attracting interest from Premier League clubs by scoring the only goal in Norwich’s 1-0 win over Brentford at Griffin Park. The midfielder nutmegged an opponent before hitting a wondrous strike. Results: Barnsley 1-3 Fulham, Brentford 0-1 Norwich, Bristol City 2-0 QPR, Ipswich 0-1 Wolves. League One Southend fans will be hoping manager Chris Powell’s first game in charge was a sign of things to come after they witnessed a thrilling 3-2 victory over Scunthorpe, culminating in a 92nd-minute winner from Michael Turner. Powell’s team recovered from an early Tom Hopper goal to take the lead thanks to goals either side of half-time from Michael Kightly and Stephen McLaughlin but Kevin van Veen made things level in the 56th minute. As the points were set to be shared, Turner was the first one to react after a free-kick bounced into his path, allowing him to slide the ball home. Play-off hopefuls Bradford were humbled 4-0 at home by AFC Wimbledon. Jimmy Abdou set the visitors on their way in the 14th minute, laying the foundations for Andy Barcham and two Cody McDonald goals to put them out of sight at Valley Parade. Shrewsbury moved within two points of leaders Wigan after James Bolton scored the winner from close-range in the 1-0 win at Portsmouth, who had Adam May sent off late on. The Shrews are back up to second in the table after Blackburn were held at home by Northampton, with Danny Graham cancelling out John-Joe O’Toole’s opener for the visitors. Gillingham were boosted by an injury-time winner when Tom Eaves struck to see off Fleetwood 2-1. Bristol Rovers eased their way to a 3-1 victory at Doncaster, despite going a goal down in the fourth minute. Plymouth held on to defeat Oldham 2-1 at Boundary Park.

Marc Richards and Timi Elsnik scored twice each for Swindon, while Crewe’s advantage was earned through two from Callum Ainley and Ryan Wintle before they fell apart. There was some positives for Crewe as their relegation rivals either lost were not playing, as Forest Green were defeated 1-0 at Carlisle. Grimsby were on the wrong end of the same scoreline as they hosted leaders Luton. It was the same story for strugglers Chesterfield, as Stevenage netted the only goal of the game. Bottom club Barnet drew 1-1 at Cheltenham.

The charity has closed; Labour’s Lord Mendelsohn has been turfed off the party’s frontbench; Tory minister Nadhim Zahawi is under scrutiny; there are calls for a further investigation and so on. It almost counts as light relief to imagine the gender roles reversed. Visualise, if you will, a woman-only charity gala, where the waiters (hired for their looks, instructed to wear tight shorts) are forced to earn their money getting sexually harassed by the drunk, entitled, pawing, genital-flashing female guests (“Gerra load of my labia!”). It seems unlikely. Not because women are incapable of behaving badly – the Chippendales weren’t exactly performing to quiet, respectful crowds. However, this wasn’t a strip joint or a stag party, it was a fundraising gala. Nor was it an event that “got out of hand”. The behaviour of the guests was not only indulged, it was factored in, planned for, to the point of the hostesses being compelled to sign non-disclosure agreements (NDAs). Otherwise, what were the organisers so scared of them revealing – that the canapes were a bit cold? It was built into the evening that some of the hostesses would be treated as subhuman, sexy props. This attitude brings to mind quite another kind of service industry – turning the everyday occupation of waiting at tables almost into a form of unofficial prostitution. What else could you call it when the waitress-guest interaction goes from being a dining/social experience to a (one-sided) quasi-sexual deal? And while some might say that part of the job is to interact with customers in a friendly manner, there’s a world of difference between that and the enforced bacchanalia going on at the Presidents Club. Given that there’s a longstanding ladies who lunch charity culture, if something comparable had happened at female-dominated functions we’d have heard about it by now. The fact that it isn’t may say something about superior female self-control in such situations; also about issues of dignity. For most women, it would feel extremely humiliating to have somebody “hired” to pretend to fancy you. It’s reminiscent of those male chuggers (charity muggers), who often target older women because presumably they’re more grateful for flirtatious attention. Well, guess what? We’re not. I’m not anyway. No offence, but I’ve got better things to do than engage in excruciating leaden “bants” with some clipboard-brandishing student outside a branch of Lush. For powerful businesswomen, presumably the same would go for waiters at charity functions. Maybe this partly accounts for the unlikelihood of a female version of the Presidents Club fundraiser. Which leads to another thought: perhaps many men, even ones who were at the dinner, also find it humiliating dealing with people who have been hired to flirt with them. But there’s too much herd-pressure in those kinds of macho, dick-swinging circles for them to feel able to opt out or speak up. How about it, men – “Me too”?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2018/jan/28/north-korea-graphics-london-show-unique-insight-into-everday-life","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-28T00:05:25Z","webTitle":"Made in North Korea – a unique glimpse of life inside a closed society","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/28/north-korea-graphics-london-show-unique-insight-into-everday-life","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jan/28/north-korea-graphics-london-show-unique-insight-into-everday-life","fields":{"headline":"Made in North Korea – a unique glimpse of life inside a closed society","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Glimpses of normal life in North Korea, something few outsiders ever sample, are to go on show in a London exhibition next month, including many items on display for the first time outside the communist republic. The House of Illustration exhibition, Made in North Korea: Everyday Graphics from the DPRK, is to offer an unprecedented insight into the look of common objects, such as posters, sweet wrappers and stamps, all collected by Nicholas Bonner, author of the book Made in North Korea (Phaidon) and a guide who has led tours to the country for 25 years. Bonner’s collection of ephemera reveals a graphic tradition that, although not entirely uniform in style, has developed in near isolation inside a closed society. It also sheds light on the daily activities of North Koreans, from buying food to going to school or watching sport. “Graphic design in North Korea is state-approved, but this hasn’t resulted in a singular approach to design,” said the exhibition’s co-curator, Olivia Ahmad. “Visitors to the exhibition will see a huge range of material – from minimal iconography to elaborate hand-drawn images in vivid colour.” The work in the exhibition runs from 1979 to around 2005 and covers examples of a range of different disciplines, including typography, sign painting, photography and illustration. “It’s likely the pieces in the exhibition represent the work of a significant number of illustrators and designers, but we don’t know who these individuals are – the work is unsigned and anonymously produced,” said Ahmad. “There are a number of state-owned studios where graphic designers work in North Korea, [one of] the largest being the Mansudae art studio in Pyongyang.” Among the stars of the show will be original hand-painted poster designs that are photographed for reproduction and have not been exhibited before. They will be displayed next to domestic product packaging and posters and more than 100 comics, including action and adventure stories – some of which reflect international tensions. Labels and packaging for North Korean-made beers, canned foods and cigarettes are frequently strikingly different from modern western designs. Bonner’s pieces also include new year greetings messages, souvenir postcards and programmes collected at cultural events, such as revolutionary operas, the Arirang Mass Games and the National Pyongyang Circus. Born in Britain, Bonner started his career as a countryside ranger in the north-west of England before becoming a lecturer in landscape architecture at Leeds Metropolitan University (now Leeds Beckett University). In 1993 he set up his travel company, Koryo Tours, taking tourists from all over the world to visit North Korea. He has also worked on documentary and feature film productions in the country, picking up interesting visual documents on his travels. The show runs in the main gallery of the House of Illustration, King’s Cross, London, from 23 February to 13 May"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/28/cant-drive-wont-drive-why-young-shun-cars","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-28T00:04:24Z","webTitle":"Can’t drive, won’t drive: why the young shun cars | Barbara Ellen","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/28/cant-drive-wont-drive-why-young-shun-cars","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/28/cant-drive-wont-drive-why-young-shun-cars","fields":{"headline":"Can’t drive, won’t drive: why the young shun cars","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Department for Transport figures report a sharp decline in young people driving. Almost half of 17-20 year olds could drive in 1992-4, but figures from 2014 show just 29%. Slightly older drivers, aged 21-29, had also decreased, from 75% to 63%. As the factors included finances (as well as prolonged immaturity and a generational preference for digital interaction), this is unfortunate on many levels. It would seem that the cost of learning to drive, and of owning a car, has been putting young people off in the era of tuition fees/zero-hour contracts, leading to the loss of a life skill and a decreased sense of independence. However, it’s not all doom and gloom. I never tried to learn to drive – I just took it for granted that I’d be both nervous and dangerous. (You’re welcome.) It didn’t stop me being independent in youth – I hitched everywhere, all over the country, even sometimes alone. (Yup, a really risky thing to do.) This turned me into a natural walker, someone who’s more than happy to go by foot whenever possible, and my children are walkers too. I know that I have to be organised about longer journeys and also not to panic when travel arrangements become complicated. I also tend to see life unfolding at a normal walking pace, instead of whizzing by through a window. There are times when it’s a giant pain. And you end up getting quite a few cabs and having to cadge lifts from proper grown-ups. However as much as I’d prefer that young people didn’t have not driving forced upon them by issues such as cost, there are upsides and not just environmentally speaking.

Freedom of information requests reveal that the Foreign Office and the Department for International Trade have been championing the interests of British American Tobacco. This is despite the government being forced to draw up new guidelines for UK embassy staff after it emerged in 2012 that the UK ambassador had been lobbying the Panama government on behalf of BAT. The disclosures reveal that in the past four years FO and DIT staff met with British American Tobacco nine times to discuss a long-running tax dispute with the Bangladesh government. In Hungary, in March 2015, a UK government trade adviser was seconded “for a few days” to BAT HQ in Budapest and subsequently to its office in Pécs. In December 2014 the then ambassador wrote to the Hungarian economy minister about the “proposed health contribution concerns” of BAT, a reference to a tax on tobacco companies based on their turnover, which BAT regards as “discriminatory”. In April 2015 the then ambassador met the minister for foreign affairs “and raised BAT’s concerns about government tobacco policy impacting their further investment plans in Hungary, following BAT’s request to him [in] March 2015”. In Panama there were six meetings between BAT and embassy staff, including two BAT “receptions”. The international trade department also had 25 meetings involving BAT Venezuela, mostly via the board of the Venezuelan and British chambers of commerce. Three contacts were disclosed in Poland, one with the ambassador and two with the acting DIT director. The notes of one contact reveal that “BAT … were specifically interested in organising a meeting with Polish government stakeholders dedicated to implementation of the Tobacco Directive” and “shaping the excise policy in relation to e-cigarettes. The company was keen to be involved in creating the regulatory framework which will allow for effective excise tax collection”. And in Laos, the general manager of Lao Tobacco, which is owned by another British tobacco giant, Imperial, sits on the British Business Group and the European Chamber of Commerce and Industry, with which British embassy staff “have regular contact”. The released information raises questions about the government’s approach to tobacco control. The UK has invested £15m in funding the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control which promotes raising taxes on cigarettes in low- and middle-income countries that are now targeted by big tobacco because smoking rates are declining in developed states. “Britain is a world leader in implementing tough and effective measures to regulate and control the tobacco industry, and as a result our smoking rates have plummeted,” said Deborah Arnott, chief executive of the health charity Ash (Action on Smoking and Health). “The government has publicly committed support to help poorer countries to follow our example. But behind the scenes our embassies are still helping UK-based tobacco manufacturers to promote their lethal business and to resist government regulation. “The word hypocrisy hardly does it justice. We are saving lives at home and promoting death abroad.” The embassies’ approach is consistent with a 2011 coalition government strategy that pushed for them to do more to promote UK business interests abroad. With Brexit opening up the possibility of new trade deals, health campaigners believe that embassy staff may come under pressure to do more to help promote the tobacco industry – which makes billions for the exchequer. However, a government spokesman said it took its obligations to protect public health policies in relation to tobacco very seriously. “Interactions with the tobacco industry are only permitted where necessary, and we do not allow our staff to encourage investment in the tobacco industry, or provide any assistance in helping tobacco companies influence local business policies like taxation to their advantage.” This article was amended on 29 January 2018 to clarify the source of a statement from the government."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/live/2018/jan/27/simona-halep-caroline-wozniacki-australian-open-womens-singles-final-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-27T11:47:49Z","webTitle":"Caroline Wozniacki beats Simona Halep to win Australian Open women's title – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2018/jan/27/simona-halep-caroline-wozniacki-australian-open-womens-singles-final-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2018/jan/27/simona-halep-caroline-wozniacki-australian-open-womens-singles-final-live","fields":{"headline":"Caroline Wozniacki beats Simona Halep to win Australian Open women's title – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"And that is very much that. A great final ends with a new champion and a new world No1, Caroline Wozniacki returning to the top of the rankings after a six-year gap. It’s been a blast. Bye! Caroline Wozniacki takes the Daphne Akhurst Memorial Cup and gives a little speech of her own: I’m just taking a second here to hug Daphne. To be here today is a dream come true. It’s a very emotional moment. The fans have been incredible all week, thanks everybody for coming out and supporting us. It’s been an incredible two weeks. Thankyou. I also want to congratulate Simona. I know today is a tough day. I’m sorry that I had to win, but I’m sure we’ll have many matches in the future. It was an incredible match, an incredible fight, and again I’m sorry. I also want to thank my fiancee (NBA ace David Lee). I was a nervous wreck this morning but you managed to calm me down. Simona Halep accepts the runners-up plate, and gives a gracious speech: It’s not easy to talk now but first I want to congratulate Caroline, she played amazing. It’s been a great tournament for me. I started not very well with an ankle injury, but I just wanted to give my best every match, which I did. Of course I’m sad I couldn’t win today, but Caroline was better than me. But of course I’ll fight, and I have many years to go so hopefully I will face another challenge like I did today. Thankyou guys for supporting me every day in this tournament. It’s always nice to play in front of you and hopefully I’ll see you next year, in the same position. The match took two hours, 50 minutes and two seconds. Total points tally: Wozniacki 110-108 Halep. Halep hit six aces to Wozniacki’s two, one double fault to Wozniacki’s six, 59% of her first serves in to Wozniacki’s 55% and 40 winners to Wozniacki’s 25. And she lost. What a fine match that was. Absolutely gripping from first to last. Third set: Wozniacki 7-6, 3-6, 6-4 Halep* (*denotes server) At 30-15 Halep serves her first double fault, and at 30-30 we get another fabulous point, a long rally full of potential winners that neither player would give up on. 45 seconds of drama and guts and brilliance. Eventually, though, Wozniacki wins it with a forehand power volley, and has a championship point - and Halep hits a backhand into the net to end it! Third set: Wozniacki* 7-6, 3-6, 5-4 Halep (*denotes server) She is a fighter, is Halep. At the end of the last game she was almost doubled over, using her racket as a crutch. Never in the history of this tournament has any woman spent as long on court as she has this year. But she’s still in this match, fighting, brawling. Wozniacki, despite the recent medical time out, seems very slightly but possibly decisively fresher. Despite another double fault, her sixth of the match (Halep is still at 0), she holds to 30 and Halep will serve to stay in it. Third set: Wozniacki 7-6, 3-6, 4-4 Halep* (*denotes server) At 0-15 three brilliant shots decide the point, a forehand crosscourt by Wozniacki, a fabulous forehand down the line by Halep when the point seemed to have gone, and then a backhand crosscourt to make sure this time it did. This game is a massive improvement, with rallies long enough for fortunes to swing one way and then the other before someone finds the killer blow. Wozniacki has a break point a 30-40, and another soon afterwards, and this one she takes. A sixth break of the set! Now Wozniacki has the trainers on court. She’s complaining about something on her left leg, which is being taped up just below the knee. Third set: Wozniacki* 7-6, 3-6, 3-4 Halep (*denotes server) At 0-15 Wozniacki drops a second serve straight into Halep’s hitting zone, and she slams it down the line for a clean winner. At 40-30 she does it again, on the same side, and this time Halep’s shot goes crosscourt, but is equally effective. So we end up at deuce, from which point Wozniacki serves two lets and then into the net, a weak second serve, into the net and a weak second serve, all of which ends with Halep, remarkably a break up! Third set: Wozniacki 7-6, 3-6, 3-3 Halep* (*denotes server) A player holds serve! A game doesn’t go to deuce! And Halep seems to have rediscovered her inner reserve of power and focus. Third set: Wozniacki* 7-6, 3-6, 3-2 Halep (*denotes server) And having won four points on the spin on Halep’s serve, Wozniacki loses the first two on her own serve, and the fourth as well, before surrendering her advantage with a forehand hit well wide, under little pressure. Obviously it’s extremely hot, and we’re nearly two and a half hours into the final, and the psychological pressure on two players yet to win a Slam must be intense, but in the last 20 minutes the quality has dipped significantly. Third set: Wozniacki 7-6, 3-6, 3-1 Halep* (*denotes server) Before this game starts, Halep is 87-88 ahead on total points won and the players have had 10 break points each. Wozniacki moves ahead on both metrics here, the first game in which Halep hasn’t really competed at all, which ends with her being broken to love. Third set: Wozniacki* 7-6, 3-6, 2-1 Halep (*denotes server) At 15-30 Halep hits a fine return, Wozniacki’s backhand down the line lands just wide, and there are two break back points. One is saved, Halep unable to return a fine forehand hit deep into the corner, and so is the second, Halep hitting her service return long. There are more break points to come and Halep eventually wins, or rather is given, the sixth of them, as Wozniacki double-faults to surrender the game. In the first two sets combined only two games went to deuce; in this set so far all three have. This one alone has six deuces. Third set: Wozniacki* 7-6, 3-6, 2-0 Halep (*denotes server) Halep comes to the net and hits a couple of poor volleys, while Wozniacki hits two poor attempted passing shots and a poor attempted lob, which sets up her opponent for an overhead winner. That point aside, despite the heat and Halep’s issues, whatever they may be, the quality remains extremely high, Wozniacki winning points with the accuracy of her groundstrokes, and Halep with the power of her own. At deuce there’s a long rally which ends with Halep hitting a crosscourt backhand six inches wide (she challenges anyway, presumably to give herself a bit of a breather), and then Wozniacki’s smart return gives her the game! Third set: Wozniacki* 7-6, 3-6, 1-0 Halep (*denotes server) Wozniacki starts slowly, allowing Halep to win the first two points against serve, but improves from there. The game is briefly disturbed by the cawing of some very noisy birds. They sound like crows, but with this being Australia they’re probably pink, with spines on their backs and their babies in pouches. Nope, Halep was out already, but hadn’t yet been shown on TV. Wozniacki has returned. Still no sign of Halep. Which Halep, presumably, will be very grateful for. Wozniacki’s first serve percentage in that second set was 43%, down from 72% in set one, and she’ll need to sort that out if she’s to win this. There will be a 10 minute break now, with the heat rule in effect. Second set: Wozniacki 7-6, 3-6 Halep* (*denotes server) Wozniacki goes 0-30 up and her return at the next point hits the top of the net when it looked a likely winner. Still, she takes the next to earn two beak points. Halep saves the first with a serve out wide and a backhand crosscourt, and the one after that with a forehand down the line. Then she takes control of her first set point, only to hit a straightforward winning forehand long. It doesn’t slow her down long: she takes her third set point, and we’ll go to a decider! Second set: Wozniacki* 7-6, 3-5 Halep (*denotes server) Halep wins a point to go 15-30 up and immediately clutches her left leg. Wozniacki ends the next point with a forehand into the net and Halep limps away - but then wins the next point with a fine forehand, to go a break up! Halep may be hurting, but she’s still landing her punches. Second set: Wozniacki 7-6, 3-4 Halep* (*denotes server) At 40-15 Halep hits a backhand that was on its way out before it clipped the net cord and spun to the right; Wozniacki reaches it but hits into the net. Second set: Wozniacki* 7-6, 3-3 Halep (*denotes server) Another double fault from Wozniacki - her fourth; Halep has yet to produce one - makes it 15-30, but from that troublesome point the server wins three points on the spin, with, perhaps significantly, Halep engaging in no rallies of any great length. Or significantly unwell, and very good at hiding it. There’ll be no medical time out, though, so perhaps Halep is just slightly unwell. Whatever the issue with Halep is, it isn’t muscular. Two medics come to court, but instead of pounding her legs they take her blood pressure and check her pulse. Second set: Wozniacki 7-6, 2-3 Halep* (*denotes server) Another swift game, but perhaps there is a reason for the abbreviated points: at 40-15 Halep asks for a physio to be called. Second set: Wozniacki* 7-6, 2-2 Halep (*denotes server) From 40-0 Wozniacki gives away one point, double faults the next, and only then seals the game. An almost totally different game to the last. Second set: Wozniacki 7-6, 1-2 Halep* (*denotes server) Phwoar! Surely the best shot of the match so far, another Wozniacki backhand, this time angled across court, wins the first point. In due course she gets a break point, but once there a net cord sends a decent forehand spinning slowly into the air, allowing Halep to take control of the point. The Dane gets another chance but hits her return long, and then a third, when her return, from a second serve, was poorly directed, and a fourth - after another fantastic rally and brilliant backhand winner - saved with a brutally clubbed crosscourt forehand. And, finally, a brilliantly entertaining game ends in Halep’s favour. Second set: Wozniacki* 7-6, 1-1 Halep (*denotes server) At 15-0 Wozniacki hits a perfect second serve, landing it on the back of the line, and then wins the point with a perfect and similarly precise backhand. The depth of her groundstrokes has been pretty consistenly phenomenal, I think. She goes on to hold to love. Second set: Wozniacki 7-6, 0-1 Halep* (*denotes server) That was the 16th set played by these players, and the first tie break. Halep hit 15 winners in the set, to Wozniacki’s nine, but still lost it. She goes 40-0 up here before a couple of good returns get Wozniacki back in the game, at which point another strong first serve wins it. First set: Wozniacki 7-6 Halep (*denotes server) The first point is a cracker, taking Wozniacki back to the early-set era as she moves Halep around the court before moving in to strike a killer blow. When she wins the next point against serve, and - an ace later - both of those on her own serve, she’s 4-1 up. The next point is won by Halep, about five times - Wozniacki’s defence is absolutely fabulous, but she can only keep it up for so long - but the Dane plays the tie break brilliantly, again and again hitting on or close to the line, and finally she serve-volleys her way to a 6-2 lead and four set points. She takes the first! First set: Wozniacki 6-6 Halep* (*denotes server) At 40-15 Wozniacki hits the perfect return from a limp second serve, but that point aside every first serve was in and strong, and Wozniacki had no answers. This set will be decided on a tie break. First set: Wozniacki* 6-5 Halep (*denotes server) The game starts with a 19-shot rally, transformed by a single shot from Wozniacki, deep to Halep’s backhand, which turned a point in which she had been on the defensive into one she took control of and won. And from there, she too holds to love. First set: Wozniacki 5-5 Halep* (*denotes server) At 15-0 Halep hits her first ace of the night, and then she immediately hits her second, helping this to become her easiest and briefest service game so far. First set: Wozniacki* 5-4 Halep (*denotes server) An unforced error from Wozniacki gives Halep the first point, and hope. Then the Dane approaches the net and Halep hits another fine forehand, down the line this time, to win the point, and another unforced error, a forehand that sails long, gives Halep three break points. The first is saved; an ace deals with the second, but another unforced error - a backhand hit long this time - surrenders the game. She needs to stop hitting quite so often to the Halep forehand, as she keeps getting punished for it. First set: Wozniacki 5-3 Halep* (*denotes server) At 15-0 Halep improvises a fine crosscourt forehand passing shot, which Wozniacki gets her racket to but can’t send over the net. Wozniacki’s approach wasn’t as deep as it might have been, but Halep did well enough to reach it, let alone hit a winner from it. She started the match poorly, but both her accuracy and her aggression has improved since. Can she still save the set? First set: Wozniacki* 5-2 Halep (*denotes server) What a point! At 30-30 Wozniacki wins a 17-shot rally which both players at different times seemed to have lost but hadn’t (yet). Wozniacki does brilliantly to run down another fine forehand from Halep, who with her opponent apparently stranded then tries a drop shot, which Wozniacki somehow reaches. Halep then hits a poor lob, from which Wozniacki hits a poor overhead, but Halep sends her next shot into the net. First set: Wozniacki 4-2 Halep* (*denotes server) When it clicks, Halep’s forehand is such a great weapon, and she repeatedly uses it to bludgeon Wozniacki out of this game. Even before this game, Halep was 6-3 up on forehand winners. First set: Wozniacki* 4-1 Halep (*denotes server) A second double fault of the match, though this one doesn’t hurt too much, given that Wozniacki was already 40-0 up by then, and then took control of the next point as well. First set: Wozniacki 3-1 Halep* (*denotes server) Halep very nearly loses the first point from a position of total authority, unnecessarily approaching the net and then hitting two poor volleys, the second of which was at least deep enough to trouble her opponent, though not really enough to explain her hitting the ball into the crowd, and it’ll go down as an unforced error. From there, Halep wins her first game of the match to love. First set: Wozniacki* 3-0 Halep (*denotes server) Now that might help. From 15-0 Wozniacki serves a double fault, and then Halep wins the next point with a fine, powerful angled forehand, her best shot of the match so far. That’s as good as it gets, though: Wozniacki is playing just fabulously at the moment - serving well (double fault excepted, obviously), hitting cleanly, moving her opponent around and taking her chances clinically. First set: Wozniacki 2-0 Halep* (*denotes server) A reversal from game one: this time there are lots of rallies, and Halep loses most of them. Wozniacki streaks to a 15-40 lead and eventually wins the game to 30, Halep’s two points coming from her one genuinely troubling first serve, and an unforced error. First set: Wozniacki* 1-0 Halep (*denotes server) Halep won 100% of the rallies, but then there was only one of them. Wozniacki landed three great serves on the deuce side, only one of which was returned, and no first serves on the other side. Of the second serves, one was returned into the net, the other sparked a fine rally that Halep eventually won with a volley. The warm-ups are over, and the players are ready for action. Let’s do this. The coin has been tossed. Wozniacki has won it and chosen to serve. The players are presented with bouquets of flowers as they had out. This strikes me as being the wrong time to give someone flowers. For a start, they’re not going to get them in water for hours. And it’s 32C out there, so not exactly cut-flower friendly. Really, they should rethink that. And they’re on their way! The players are on their way to court, and are currently hanging out in the little concrete holding pen where they are forced to wait before they are introduced and head out. On court right now: the crowd is having the Australian anthem sung at them. Morning/evening/afternoon/whatever else it might be world! Welcome! This should be fun, right? Amazingly, this is the first time in the Open era - that is, in the last 50 years - that both finalists at a grand slam have both had to save match points on their way there. I find that astonishing, but there you go. Facts are facts. I understand that it might be very unusual, but would’t expect it to be quite that unusual. Wozniacki of course produced a ridiculous comeback from 5-1, 40-15 in the final set against Jana Fett in the second round, while Halep and Lauren Davis battled through a marathon third set in round three, which lasted two hours and 23 minutes and was eventually won by the Romanian, 15-13. Because that set went so long she has had to play a lot more tennis than Wozniacki, so you’d expect her to be well ahead on all absolute stats; instead she’s surprisingly lagging on some, for example Wozniacki has hit more backhand winners, albeit with a slender 42-40 advantage.

For all the overblown shemozzle of Alexis Sánchez’s long goodbye from Arsenal, the dizzyingly tedious debates over net cost, balance of the deal, the artfully shot piano-plonking video cut, one thing has remained unaltered. Sánchez is a wonderfully pure footballer, a multimillionaire athlete who, as José Mourinho said before kick-off at Huish Park, really does just love to kick a ball around. Sánchez was busy, full-blooded and in flashes quietly brilliant during his first hour as a Manchester United player. Before this FA Cup fourth- round match there had been the usual drooling rags v riches talk, a modern version of The Magic Of The Cup that tends, in this most materialist of ages, to focus on the finances, the Alexis-Sánchez-could-buy-the-whole-of-Somerset schtick. It is a part of football’s enduring strength that this stuff still melts away, that the world’s richest club against one struggling to stay in the league is still the same old game between the same human parts. On a cold, boisterous night Yeovil Town provided brusque and muscular opposition, a credit to the enduring strength of the Football League. Sánchez simply played the ball, the day, the game, setting up United’s first two goals, riding assorted heavy challenges and even handing some back in return. Even watching United come out to warm up had provided a moment of gawping fascination. Before the game Mourinho had compared Sánchez to a prized juicy orange at the top of the tree. In this current United team he is more a baby clementine among the grapefruits, a centimetre shorter even than Juan Mata, who started here, fresh from addressing the reptilian illuminati overlords of the Davos World Economic Forum. Instead Sánchez is all concentrated presence, the most imposingly power-packed footballing half-pint in the league. And as he waved to the crowd at the edge of the pitch something odd happened. Even in a magenta bib doing shuttle runs between some cones, he really does look like a Manchester United player. The Chilean started on the left of United’s attack, staying wide, braving the ire of the Screwfix Stand, which rang with one or two gentle pantomime boos. His first significant act was to pull the ball out of the air and nutmeg the nearest opponent. The away end roared. “You’ve dropped a tenner Alexis,” someone yelled. He did look rusty at times. With nine minutes gone Sánchez turned inside and punted a cross-field pass that was easily intercepted. And he did give the ball away a bit, misplacing five of his first 10 passes as a United player. But then this is a part of his game. He does ferret constantly after weak spots, improvising rather than playing the patterns. It is not hard to see a slight disjunct with Pep Guardiola’s tactical ideals. He sprinted through the middle then did that thing where he just stops, instantly, like a cartoon mouse spinning on its heel and watching a pair of galumphing cats slide past, legs flailing. In the Screwfix there was a burst of nervous laughter at this guilty treat. OK. Fine. We’ll give you that one. Five minutes before half-time Sánchez had a hand in the opening goal, carrying the ball inside, feeling the spaces open up around him and playing a nice pass into Marcus Rashford. He was allowed to carry the ball a bit too far by a dithering defence and finished neatly. Early in the second half Ander Herrera added the second, helped by Sánchez’s pass, the best part of which was the sight of both him and Rashford haring off on a break with genuine, surging power, another sign of understanding between the two. More of this please, José, not less. As there will surely be. For some reason there has been a debate about whether Sánchez represents value for money. In reality value has no room in this discussion. Value is what Arsenal were after, value is fourth place year after year. Sánchez is too wild, too desperate to win to worry about value or good sense. He is, on the face of it, perfect for Mourinho too, a manager who loves high-impact bolt-on parts; who has found in Sánchez the perfect addition, a ready‑made nitroglycerin injection of a footballer, who began here as he means to go on."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"film/2018/jan/27/hollywood-film-latinos-representation-diversity-oscars","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-27T10:00:47Z","webTitle":"Hollywood basks in diversity praise but Latinos ask: are we invisible?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jan/27/hollywood-film-latinos-representation-diversity-oscars","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/jan/27/hollywood-film-latinos-representation-diversity-oscars","fields":{"headline":"Hollywood basks in diversity praise but Latinos ask: are we invisible?","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Hollywood was tingling with relief and pride. Instead of being castigated for ignoring black actors and harassing female ones, the film industry basked in praise for diversity and inclusion. This week’s Oscar nominations rewarded black and female film-makers and themes of social justice, continuing an awards season trend towards addressing the #OscarsSoWhite and #MeToo controversies. “After years of criticism, the hashtag for this year’s Oscar nominations could be #ItsAboutTime,” applauded the Los Angeles Times. “The motion picture academy seems to be lurching toward real and consistent progress.” Or maybe not. The feelgood lasted just a few hours before another constituency alleged systematic underrepresentation, misrepresentation and racism. “Hollywood continues to be challenged by gender and ethnic diversity,” the National Hispanic Media Coalition said in a statement, which announced a protest campaign. “Our upcoming demonstrations are only the first of what will become increasingly aggressive wake-up calls to Hollywood studios to end institutionalized racism against Latinos. By targeting the Academy Awards, we’re serving notice to the motion picture industry that we’re not asking for equity any more. We’re demanding it.” The group promised a protest on 5 February at the Academy’s annual Oscar nominees luncheon and another on 3 March, the day before the Oscars, at a time and location to be announced. An industry built on sequels perhaps should not be surprised that after #OscarsSoWhite and #MeToo there is now #LatinosLeftOut. Latinos, after all, have mobilised against the Trump administration’s immigration policies and seized the reins of the Democratic party, and government posts, across California and other states. It remains to be seen whether the protests will sour Hollywood’s self-congratulation. The addition of nearly 1,500 new, demographically inclusive members to the academy, which votes for the Oscars, is partly credited with nominations for Get Out, a horror satire about race, including for its director Jordan Peele and star Daniel Kaluuya, and for Mudbound, a Jim Crow-era race drama. Denzel Washington was nominated for his performance in Roman J Israel, Esq. The academy also nominated a female cinematographer (Rachel Morris for Mudbound) for the first time in its 90-year history and a female director (Greta Gerwig for Lady Bird) for just the fifth time. Most of the nine films nominated for best picture are led by female characters. Women were among the producers on six of the films. “Oscars send clear message on diversity in race and gender,” said the entertainment site The Wrap. To which Latinos responded: ojalá. If only. Elusive on screen The film industry, they say, has hardly evolved since Eli Wallach, the son of Polish immigrants, played sweaty Mexican villains in The Magnificent Seven and spaghetti westerns. Only 3% of speaking characters in 2016′s top 100 films were Latinos, according to a University of Southern California study, even though Latinos comprise 18% of the US population. The number of African American and Asian speaking characters approximated their share of the population, respectively 13% and 5%. Latinos have made breakthroughs behind the camera, notably the cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki and directors such as Alejandro González Iñárritu (Birdman, The Revenant), Alfonso Cuarón (Gravity) and Guillermo del Toro, whose The Shape of Water leads this year’s Oscar race, with 13 nominations. And some talent has made it on screen. Oscar Isaac, who was born in Guatemala, stars in the latest Star Wars trilogy. Disney’s animated film Coco uses a Latino cast to tell the story of a Mexican boy stuck in the Land of the Dead. But Latinos tend to be elusive on screen. The last Hispanic actor to win an Oscar was Penelope Cruz in 2009 for her supporting role in Vicky Cristina Barcelona. No Latina has ever won for a leading role, and only one man has done so – José Ferrer for Cyrano de Bergerac in 1951. For Jonathan Jakubowicz, a Venezuelan who wrote and directed the 2016 boxing biopic Hands of Stone, Latino absence has political as well as cultural consequences. “It shows how invisible Latinos are in the media and in American society in general,” he said. “When Hands of Stone came out, I asked studio executives who are my friends which other movie they have ever seen with a Latino lead that is not a criminal, and they honestly couldn’t answer.” In a 2016 magazine article, Jakubowicz noted that Hollywood’s depiction of Mexicans as drug dealers, criminals and rapists gave Donald Trump a readymade xenophobic caricature. Also, the industry was not trying to generate more Latino content, said Jakubowicz, who made his name with the kidnap thriller Secuestro Express. “It’s not even part of the diversity conversation.” He urged Latinos to emulate African American activists. “They not only make their voices heard, they also support their own. And that’s what’s lacking in the Hispanic community. I however don’t necessarily think the problem is the awards. How can a Latino be nominated for best actor if there is barely any Latino actor in a leading role? The focus should be content. Once content is made, the awards will follow.” Salma Hayek, in a recent New York Times essay detailing sexual harassment by Harvey Weinstein, recalled her initial – and ultimately successful – attempt to get studio backing. “It was unimaginable for a Mexican actress to aspire to a place in Hollywood.” Chris Rock made similar points in a 2014 essay for the Hollywood Reporter. “Forget whether Hollywood is black enough. A better question is: is Hollywood Mexican enough? You’re in LA, you’ve got to try not to hire Mexicans.” For the National Hispanic Media Coalition, which is organising the protests, the salt in the wound is that Latinos comprise 18% of the population but 23% of film ticket-buyers. “Enough is enough. It’s time to end the whitewashing and put Latinos in front of and behind the camera.” Ordinary Latinos seem to agree – at least according to a straw poll of families this week in MacArthur Park, a gathering point for Mexicans and Salvadoreans in downtown LA. “Name a Latino or film star? Hmm, let me think,” said Victor Barrajas, 64, a plumber. He frowned, then brightened. “Sofia Vergara!” Asked to name a leading man, Barrajas frowned again and seemed about to give up. “Whatshisname, Zorro!” He meant Antonio Banderas. Raymundo Flores, a 50, a restaurant worker, professed himself a film buff but could not name any Latino actor other than stars of old Mexican films. “That’s not good. When kids go to the movies they should see people who look like them up on the screen.” Freddy Hernandez, 27, also a restaurant worker, and clearly not a fan of Zorro, Frieda or other Latino-led films, said he had never seen a Latino protagonist on the big screen. “That’s not right.” A 30-year-old Salvadorean who gave his name only as Jason was a dissenting voice. “I don’t know what they’re chirping about. There’s plenty of movies from Mexico. I don’t see why Hollywood needs to suddenly start hiring Hispanics.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2018/jan/28/saudi-arabia-players-spain-world-cup","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-28T12:01:34Z","webTitle":"Arabian flight: why are nine Saudis playing in Spain before World Cup?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/28/saudi-arabia-players-spain-world-cup","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jan/28/saudi-arabia-players-spain-world-cup","fields":{"headline":"Arabian flight: why are nine Saudis playing in Spain before World Cup?","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Sporting Gijón’s welcome tweet to greet a new signing on 21 January got the name of the player – Abdullah al-Hamdan – mixed up with the name of the club he arrived from: al-Shabab. Perhaps the Spanish team were just so excited about their new Saudi Arabian import or perhaps they did not really have any idea who he was. Just like the simultaneous arrival of alien spaceships above various global cities – provoking curiosity and confusion – there were similar deals being announced on social media all over Spain, as nine Saudi Arabian players joined clubs in the top three tiers on loan until the end of the season. From having virtually no players in action overseas, there is now almost an entire starting Saudi XI for fans at home to keep an eye out for. That is the reasoning both in Riyadh and in Spain, where there is a desperation to get Saudis watching Spanish football. With the World Cup looming, the Saudi Arabian Football Federation (SAFF) and the country’s General Sports Authority (GSA) were acutely aware that none of the squad play outside the kingdom, making a group containing Russia, Egypt and Uruguay that little bit harder. While friendlies against good opposition is a start, playing in La Liga would be the perfect build-up, if selected. Not all the nine will be in Russia. Levante’s Fahad al-Muwallad, full of pace and flair and whose goal secured qualification, will be there, as will Villarreal’s Salem al-Dawsari. Yahya al-Shehri, now with Leganés, will get the call, too. Those that do not can still benefit and perhaps inspire others. “There are some good players here and it will be a great experience for them,” Mike Newell, now director of football at al-Shabab, told the Observer. The former Everton and Blackburn striker admits it will not be easy. “It will be a big shock for them in many ways as Saudi players don’t usually go overseas but, if just one of them is a success, then it will be massive for Saudi football.” It is a big if, almost as big as the jump from the Saudi Premier League to La Liga. The man behind the move is the GSA head, Turki al-Alshaikh, who wants his players “to learn what it is to be real professionals, gain experience and represent Saudi Arabia abroad. I have infinite faith in the ability of our players. It is our role, all of us, to back them in this experience, which will be the beginning of many more transfers to Europe.” Alshaikh has called on the clubs to understand the needs of the national team. Yet benefits for Saudi Arabia, even theoretical ones, are more apparent than they are at the Spanish end. As well as sponsorship, clubs are getting a free player for half a season as the salaries will be paid from Saudi Arabia but, with coaches free to select them or not, many think it will be the latter. One leading Saudi official was scathing: “They are not going to play at all and that is going to be a problem at some point. Everyone knows Saudi players need to start going overseas but this is not the way.” Nor is it the time. “This is the middle of the season and clubs are losing some of their best players.” There is the matter of standards, too. Many Spanish scouts attending a Saudi training camp in October in Portugal were just not interested. La Liga is also keen to expand its appeal in the Middle East. Too much so, according to the Spanish players’ union. “This new business model,” it said in a statement, “prioritises the economic aspect over the sporting one, sacrificing the essence of this sport and favouring business over the promotion and development of our footballers.” It is also a risky commercial strategy. Park Ji-sung helped expand Manchester United’s appeal and profits in South Korea, and to a lesser extent, Asia. The flip side of that coin bears the likeness of Park Chu-young, the striker who played only seven minutes of league action for Arsenal from 2011 to 2014. Initial interest fades quickly when a star does not feature and resentment can result. When an Arsenal visit to Korea was floated in 2012, the local reaction was largely negative. That summer the Gunners made it to Kuala Lumpur, Hong Kong and Beijing but not Seoul. How welcome certain Spanish teams will be in Saudi Arabia in the future depends on events over the next few months. If some of the country’s best players are left cooling heels in the run-up to Russia, disquiet among Saudi fans may match the confusion among their Iberian counterparts."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"environment/2018/jan/29/national-parks-repair-backlog-grand-canyon-zion","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-29T11:00:22Z","webTitle":"Rotting cabins, closed trails: why we're shining a light on US national parks","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/29/national-parks-repair-backlog-grand-canyon-zion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/jan/29/national-parks-repair-backlog-grand-canyon-zion","fields":{"headline":"Rotting cabins, closed trails: why we're shining a light on US national parks","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"At Zion national park, a popular trail has been closed since 2010. At the Grand Canyon, a rusting pipeline that supplies drinking water to the busiest part of the park breaks at least a half-dozen times a year. At Voyageurs, a historic cabin collapsed. The National Park Service is the protector of some of America’s greatest environmental and cultural treasures. Yet a huge funding shortfall means that the strain of America’s passion for its parks is showing. Trails are crumbling and buildings are rotting. In all there is an $11bn backlog of maintenance work that repair crews have been unable to perform, a number that has mostly increased every year in the past decade. “Americans should be deeply concerned,” said John Garder, senior director of budget and appropriations at the National Parks Conservation Association (NPCA). The National Park Service, he argued, is hamstrung by a lack of resources and is in “triage mode”. Today the Guardian is announcing a major expansion of This Land is Your Land, our series investigating the threats facing America’s public lands. National parks are just one part of an unparalleled system, managed by the government and held in trust for the public, and spanning over 600m acres of forests, deserts, tundra and glacier-covered peaks, as well as historical sites such as the Lincoln Memorial and Washington Monument. They are integral to American life: an ancestral home for Native Americans; a retreat for vacationers, sportspeople and hunters; a source of grazing; and an economic engine. Yet their future is uncertain. Earlier this month 10 members of a National Park Service advisory board, which had promoted issues such as encouraging more minority visitors, quit en masse, complaining that the new administration was unwilling to meet with them and was not prioritizing the parks. The Trump administration has signaled that it thinks protected areas are too expansive, and recently shrunk two national monuments created under Barack Obama and Bill Clinton – Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante in Utah. Meanwhile advocates have raised concerns that the Department of Interior, which oversees many federal lands, is staffed with lobbyists for the energy industry. Even absent such issues, climate change, privatization and energy extraction risk changing the face of the country’s public spaces forever. The Guardian will report intensively on these protected places, covering the threats they face, the diverse people who use them, and their critical environmental and economic role in American life. National parks recorded 331m recreational visits in 2016 (the highest ever), boast an estimated economic value of $92bn, and have totemic significance in the national imagination. Yet signs of deterioration are evident across the park system. At the Grand Canyon, a 1960s-era pipeline that transports all drinking water to the park’s thronged South Rim, and is also intended for fire suppression, is 20 years past its design life. It breaks anywhere from a half-dozen to over 20 times a year, requiring repair crews to helicopter in for repairs that can take days. The cost to fix each breakdown is as much as $25,000, and officials say it may take $124m to replace it. At Harpers Ferry national park, which has civil war associations and was the location of an abolitionist uprising, officials have been unable to restore an 1848 building that they acquired decades ago. A base hospital during the war and later a school for former slaves, it is a solid-looking brick structure with tidy white verandas. Yet inside, it appears as if someone has taken a hammer to it. There was “massive disrepair”, said Garder of the NPCA, who visited it in 2016. “The stairways were unsafe, there was water damage, the plaster was decaying and falling off the walls.” And at a striking and exposed point at Voyageurs national park in Minnesota, overlooking the water, the former site of the Ingersoll Lodge is now bare. The historic building was reduced to rubble in 2014, probably after heavy weather disastrously combined with uncompleted maintenance work and existing structural weaknesses. The remains of the cabin are currently stored off-site as officials debate whether to rebuild it. “You’re sad but you’re also frustrated,” said Christina Hausman, head of the Voyageurs National Park Association, a not-for-profit partner of the park. “We continually do not give the National Park Service the resources they need to protect these places.” In this and other cases, visitor experience is directly impacted. At Zion, a trail leading to the Emerald Pools, a complex of waterfalls and ponds, has been off-limits since a 2010 landslide, and it is hoped that a philanthropic grant will allow it to reopen in 2020. Meanwhile increased visitation has led to broken toilet seats and doors in bathrooms “not designed for the volume of numbers we have now”, said the park’s superintendent, Jeff Bradybaugh. The park is not always able to tend to them immediately because of its stretched purse strings. While these issues sound minor compared with a collapsed cabin, “it’s like seeing trash on the sidewalk: you feel like it’s not cared for, and that no one cares, and that’s not at all what the park service wants to convey”, said Rob Smith, an NPCA regional director who complained of worn and illegible interpretive signs and “out of order” notices on rainforest trails and at a visitor center at Olympic national park, west of Seattle. Much of the backlog dates to the era of Mission 66, a massive infrastructure push in the 1950s and 1960s that resulted in notable structures like the Wright Brothers National Memorial visitors center in North Carolina and the Blue Ridge Parkway, which winds through North Carolina and Virginia. Projects from this period are now at the end of their lifespans. Roads account for about half the maintenance backlog, and there are even $183m of repairs overdue for employee housing. The interior secretary, Ryan Zinke, has said deferred maintenance at parks is a priority, and has proposed raising ticket prices, from around $30 per vehicle to $70 at 17 of the most popular parks, as a way to deal with the issue. Yet critics note that this might only produce an additional $70m a year, or less than 1% of the current backlog, with a possible side effect of discouraging those on a budget. “What we’re doing is we’re trying to narrow the gap,” said parks spokesperson Jeffrey Olson. The park service’s problems are also having a knock-on effect on public lands policy at large, because the White House has used the repairs backlog to justify not investing in the acquisition of new public spaces. A spokesperson for the Department of the Interior did not provide responses to a request for comment. Tony Knowles, the former Democratic governor of Alaska and the head of the park service advisory committee whose members resigned, said the backlog was a continual worry among his former board members. He thinks it’s a missed opportunity. “At a time when unity is something that is so lacking in all of the discourse and political actions, if there’s one subject that really brings Americans together of all parties, all parts of the country, all standards of income, all backgrounds and cultures and races, the one thing is a love of the concept of the national parks.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/jan/26/aymeric-laporte-manchester-city-athletic-bilbao-club-record-transfer-deal-57m","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-26T21:28:45Z","webTitle":"Manchester City agree club-record £57m deal for Aymeric Laporte","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/26/aymeric-laporte-manchester-city-athletic-bilbao-club-record-transfer-deal-57m","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jan/26/aymeric-laporte-manchester-city-athletic-bilbao-club-record-transfer-deal-57m","fields":{"headline":"Manchester City agree club-record £57m deal for Aymeric Laporte","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Manchester City have agreed a £57m deal for Athletic Bilbao’s Aymeric Laporte, with the defender set to arrive next week. The 23-year-old is expected to sign a five-year contract at the Etihad Stadium after City met the centre-half’s release clause and he will travel to Manchester early next week for a medical. Laporte was removed from the Bilbao side that drew 1-1 with Eibar on Friday night, fuelling speculation that a deal was done. After missing out on Virgil van Dijk and Alexis Sánchez in this transfer window so far the City head coach, Pep Guardiola, will welcome the defensive reinforcements with persistent injury doubts over Vincent Kompany. Laporte, who has yet to win a full cap for France but has made almost 200 appearances for Bilbao since making his debut in 2012, is also predominantly left-footed and has been earmarked as a long-term partner in central defence for John Stones while also being able to fill in at left-back. City lost Benjamin Mendy to a ruptured anterior cruciate ligament earlier in the season and Fabian Delph has been forced to fill in with Danilo looking decidely uncomfortable at times. City were also linked with West Brom’s Jonny Evans but that deal now looks unlikely with Laporte set to become City’s record signing, eclipsing the £55m paid for Kevin de Bruyne in 2015. The Belgium midfielder signed a new contract with the Premier League leaders this week that runs until 2023. Earlier in the day Guardiola was tight-lipped over his prospective signing. “He’s a player for Bilbao. It’s the same as other players in the clubs, I didn’t speak about previous players.

Dulce Matuz, an electrical-engineering major at Arizona State, ran to find her professor. Bursting into tears, she told him something she had only ever shared with her closest friends. She was undocumented. “It felt good to tell my story,” she told the Guardian this week. “It was like a weight had been lifted.” The law meant Matuz would have to pay the out-of-state tuition rate, which she could not afford. But the next day, her professor gave her a flier advertising scholarships for “people in your situation”. Matuz had thought she was the only undocumented student on one of the largest campuses in the country. She was wrong. At an informational meeting, she met dozens of young people with stories similar to hers. Their discussion grew into a statewide coalition, the students rallying with organizations across the US to declare themselves “undocumented and unafraid”. One by one they shed their anonymity, in effect daring law enforcement to target them. It was a risky move, especially in a state which was then a cauldron of anti-immigrant sentiment. But the students weren’t alone. Thousands of young immigrants came forward to demand a future in the country where they were raised. Each had a name and a story. Itzel. Irving. Allyson. Justino. Ivy. Yuridia. Luna. Jhoana. Jesus. Osmar. Christian. Indira. Karen. Reyna. Sheridan. Concepcion. Angelica. Greisa. Adrian. Collectively, they are known as Dreamers, young people without immigration status who were brought to the US as children. Over the last decade, they’ve gone from the “shadows” to the center stage of US politics, and their fate now dangles before an irascible president and a gridlocked Congress. ‘Trump Dreamers’ In September, Donald Trump ended Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca), an Obama-era program that lifted the threat of deportation for Dreamers. The administration argued that Obama had overstepped his authority. But Trump did give Dreamers a six-month grace period and called on Congress to pass legislation. “If the Dreamers are able to lead a fight that results in a radical, nativist administration signing into law their freedom, it would be a testament only to how much moral and political power the Dreamers have built,” said Frank Sharry, a long-time advocate of immigration reform and executive director of America’s Voice. Conservatives suggest Trump is uniquely qualified to succeed where predecessors have failed, to achieve immigration reform, precisely because of his credibility among fierce opponents of illegal immigration. At a meeting earlier this month, for example, Trump promised to “take the heat” if Republicans passed legislation. “President Obama tried and couldn’t fix immigration, President Bush tried and couldn’t do it,” said Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina who is pushing bipartisan immigration reform. “I believe President Trump can. Today’s Daca recipients can be tomorrow’s Trump Dreamers.” Polling has consistently shown that a large majority of Americans – 87% in one recent survey – support protections for Dreamers. But general anti-immigrant fervor has stalled efforts to pass legislation and conservatives remain divided over whether Dreamers should ever be allowed to be citizens. Rounds of negotiations have yielded no solution, only a brief shutdown of the federal government during which Democrats tried to force lawmakers to extend legal status to the Dreamers. Depending on the day, lawmakers and the president are either on the verge of striking a deal or as far apart as ever. Trump was elected after championing hard-line immigration policies but he has demanded both a “bill of love” and a border wall. This week, the White House released a proposal that offered a pathway to citizenship for up to 1.8 million undocumented young people – in exchange for a $25bn “trust fund” for a border wall, a crackdown on undocumented migrants and changes to the migration system. The offer did not go down well, either with Trump’s base or with progressives ranged against him. Immigration hardliners crowned Trump “Amnesty Don”. Advocates for reform rejected the offer as an attempt to seal America’s borders. In a statement issued on Friday, Chris Murphy, a Connecticut senator, called the offer “a total non-starter” that “preyed on the worst kind of prejudice”, using Dreamers “as a bargaining chip to build a wall and rip thousands of families apart”. Trump, meanwhile, tweeted that Daca reform had “been made increasingly difficult by the fact that [Senate minority leader] Cryin’ Chuck Schumer took such a beating over the shutdown that he is unable to act on immigration!” Dreamers say the fight is only beginning. Matuz became a US citizen in 2016, a decade after she “came out of the shadows”. But she still identifies strongly with her fellow Dreamers. “We still haven’t achieved what we set out to achieve,” she said. ’They’re speaking up’ The Dreamer movement came of age during the Obama administration. But legislation to build a path to citizenship was introduced to Congress in 2001. Two senators – Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, and Orrin Hatch, a Utah Republican – introduced the first Dream Act in August that year, a month before 9/11. But after the attacks, as concerns over national security and terrorism dominated public life, the immigration debate shifted sharply. The bill stalled. It was reintroduced several times, without success. Nonetheless, the Dreamers continued to galvanize public support. They escalated their tactics, staging sit ins and actions that risked arrest. “There was a time when they used to be very quiet,” Durbin said recently at a rally. “Not any more. They’re speaking up and we’re proud that they are.” The Dreamers’ fight for citizenship, Durbin has said, is the “civil rights issue of our time”. In December 2010, the Dream Act was brought to the floor. It failed again. In 2012, months before the presidential election, Barack Obama established Daca. Recipients had to have entered the US before their 16th birthday, which means the oldest beneficiaries are now 35. The most common age of entry to the US was three while the median age was six, according to a report by the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning think tank in Washington. Eight hundred thousand people qualified, the vast majority of them Latino, according to data from US Citizenship and Immigration Services. Nearly 80% were born in Mexico. The largest numbers of recipients now live in California and other border states such as Texas and Arizona. They are more likely than their ineligible counterparts to hold a college degree and a higher-skilled job, according to an analysis by the Migration Policy Institute. “What you’re seeing in the Dreamers is a reflection of the American ideals,” said Daniel Garza, president of the conservative Libre Institute, a free-market Latino advocacy group founded by the Koch brothers. “When one breathes freedom it manifests itself. And now that these kids have a shot at directing their own future or setting a path toward their own future, let’s remove those barriers and allow them that opportunity.” ‘I’m not alone’ Over the last several months, Dreamers have been in Washington, walking the halls of Congress. They wear light orange shirts with a comic book POW! bubble with the words: “Clean Dream Act Now.” They sleep on church floors and friends’ couches; a few missed final exams to join protests in December, when there was a flicker of hope that legislation might receive a vote. Greisa Martínez Rosas, 29, has been among them, leading members in song at rallies on the lawn in front of the capitol building, in between meetings with members of Congress. She was eight when she and her father staked out a spot on the Rio Grande river and crossed from Mexico into Texas. She laid seashells to mark the place. The next day, her family swam into the United States. Martínez Rosas grew up in a Hispanic neighborhood of Dallas and attended Texas A&amp;M University. But the life she was building begin to unravel when her father was deported. Her mother died in 2016. Fighting for a Dream Act has given her purpose, she said, and she is now advocacy and policy director at United We Dream, a national organization that campaigns for migrant rights. She has three younger sisters, one of them also undocumented. “I am really lucky to be doing this,” she said. “It gives meaning to a lot of the pain and helps me deal with a lot of the trauma growing up undocumented. “The reality is that I’m not alone. My story isn’t special. That’s why it’s so important that we wage this fight.” The Dreamers rejected Trump’s latest proposal, even though it would allow a pathway to citizenship for more than twice the number of Daca recipients. “We are not willing to accept an immigration deal that takes our country 10 steps back no matter how badly we want reprieve,” Martínez Rosas said. “That’s how much we love this country.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/jan/28/danny-mcguire-lad-conflicted-leeds-hull-kr-super-league","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-28T10:01:32Z","webTitle":"Danny McGuire: ‘My lad is conflicted.

He still wears his Leeds hat to school’","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"For the first time in almost two decades there is an unusual sense of pressure on Danny McGuire’s shoulders. One of the most successful players in Super League history, his 20-year association with his hometown club, Leeds, coincided with one of the most dominant periods of the game in recent history. Now, aged 35, he starts a season with a club whose last Super League season ended in relegation via the 2016 Million Pound Game. Since joining the Rhinos at the age of 12 McGuire had known nothing else. His early years with the club were lean and character-forming but in the next 15 eight Grand Final victories followed. No club has won more – nor will they for quite some time, even if Leeds stop here. But midway through last year McGuire made a decision few could have imagined ever materialising: it was time for a change. At the time Hull KR were still in the Championship, plotting their return to Super League, a mission they would ultimately accomplish with some ease in the Qualifiers. Even then, though, McGuire knew they were the club for him. “It’s like being back at school for the first time in a long time,” he says. “At Leeds everyone knew what you were capable of. It gives me a spring in my step; I’ve got to go and impress new people at the age of 35 – which is exciting for me. The club as a whole has huge potential. I already know it was the right move.” It is back at home in Leeds where the greater pressures lie for McGuire, in convincing his family of passionate Leeds supporters, including his four‑year‑old son, to switch allegiances. “My little lad is a bit conflicted,” he says. “He’s only four and he still wears his Leeds hat to school most days. But he’s got a Hull KR kit and I’m trying to get it on him as much as possible. He knows the Hull KR songs, though, and once I get playing, he’ll hopefully be converted. He’s Daddy’s biggest fan so he doesn’t have much choice. All my family came to every Leeds game, they all love Leeds and are passionate fans, so it’s a big change for everyone. We’ll all get used to it, though.” His family do not have much time to adjust, as Hull KR’s return to Super League begins on Friday with a Yorkshire derby against Wakefield. It is inevitable many have tipped his new side to struggle; some believe just making the top eight would be success for the Robins. Unsurprisingly, McGuire does not see it that way. “I don’t want to set unrealistic targets but you’ve got to aim high,” he says. “Simply surviving is not enough for me; it doesn’t fit with my ambition and that’s why I signed here.” McGuire is the fifth Leeds big name in three years to leave the club after winning a Grand Final. The other four – Kevin Sinfield, Jamie Peacock, Kylie Leuluai and Rob Burrow – all called time on their rugby league careers. Was McGuire ever tempted to follow? “Never,” he says. “In 2016, when I had a few injuries and Leeds were struggling, it did cross my mind to finish. But last year I knew I was playing well and I knew I still had something to offer the game. There was never any doubt about carrying on. It’s just the decision to move, that was the big challenge. But starting afresh is reinvigorating.” Given the respect he commands, it was inevitable McGuire would receive plenty of offers when word spread he would leave Leeds at the end of last season. He has always remained coy about where those offers came from – until now. “There were a couple of discussions with Toronto but it never got too deep or advanced,” he says. “I spoke to Brian Noble [the Wolfpack’s director of rugby] but it would have never worked where I was and what I was wanting to do. I don’t think I wanted to move my children out of school in Leeds and uproot the family. This is the perfect move for me; the club are ambitious – like myself – and we’ve got the potential to surprise a few people. I’ve used the word a lot but that chance to prove people wrong excites me.” McGuire does not have to wait long for his return to Leeds as their round two game takes place at Elland Road, home of McGuire’s beloved Leeds United. But who will his biggest supporter be cheering for on the night? “He’ll probably have a Hull KR kit with a Leeds Rhinos hat,” McGuire says, laughing. “It’s only a fortnight away … but I am working on him.” 2018 kick-off Round one of the new Super League gets under way this week: Thursday 1 Feb Warrington v Leeds 7.45pm* Hull FC v Huddersfield8pm Friday 2 Feb Salford v Wigan 7.30pm St Helens v Castleford7.45pm* Hull KR v Wakefield8pm Sunday 4 Feb Widnes v Catalans3pm *Live on Sky Sports"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jan/29/australia-days-date-will-not-change-while-im-prime-minister-turnbull-says","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-29T07:21:20Z","webTitle":"Australia Day’s date will not change while I’m prime minister, Turnbull says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jan/29/australia-days-date-will-not-change-while-im-prime-minister-turnbull-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jan/29/australia-days-date-will-not-change-while-im-prime-minister-turnbull-says","fields":{"headline":"Australia Day’s date will not change while I’m prime minister, Turnbull says","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Malcolm Turnbull says the date of Australia Day will not change as long as he is prime minister. Turnbull gave the assurance to News Corp columnist Miranda Devine in a broad-ranging interview on Monday in which he also dampened expectations for income tax cuts, which he described as a “priority” that was secondary to budget balance. Responding to a Greens push earlier in January, Turnbull said he was “disappointed” in the proposal to move the date of Australia Day from 26 January, because a “free country debates its history, it does not deny it”. On Friday Labor’s shadow infrastructure minister, Anthony Albanese, reinvigorated the debate by calling for two referendums to be held on Australia Day in 2019 on whether Australia should become a republic and whether to recognise Indigenous Australians in the constitution. On Monday Albanese told Radio National that 26 January was “a day of great sadness for Indigenous people” but his proposal “would change the meaning, rather than change the date”. Turnbull questioned why the government should be “bullied” by “a tiny minority” of people who want to change the date. “The overwhelming majority of Australians want to keep Australia Day on the 26th of January and agree with the patriotic sentiments we’re expressing,” he said. Asked if there would be “no change” under his leadership, Turnbull replied: “I can give you that assurance.” While many polls suggest that most do not want a change of date, a recent poll by the Australia Institute found that, when the question was asked the other way around, most were not concerned if the day were moved. Turnbull lauded the fact the Australian economy had added 1,000 jobs a day, three-quarters of which were full-time, describing it as “the highest level of jobs growth since records began”. He said it was “fantastic” that ratings agencies had confirmed Australia’s triple-A credit rating last week but warnings about budget repair were “very real”. “We are on track to bring the budget back into balance in 2020-21,” he said. “We’re not going to miss that achievement, that goal, that is absolutely critical.” Asked about personal income tax cuts, Turnbull noted the government had already lifted the threshold for the second highest tax bracket from $80,000 to $87,000. He said the government’s next priority was “middle-income tax relief” but the goal was secondary to bringing the budget back to balance. “The timing of that, and the extent of it, is going to depend on the state of the budget because we’re not going to sacrifice our return to surplus, that is the top priority,” he said. “We want every Australian to understand that our priority here in 2018 is to put more money into the pockets of hardworking Australian families and businesses.” Labor has ridiculed the suggestion of income tax cuts, labelling it a thought bubble and noting the government increased tax rates on those earning more than $21,000 in the last budget. Turnbull noted the International Monetary Fund had lifted its global growth forecasts in part because of the Trump tax plan. The head of the IMF, Christine Lagarde, has also warned the Trump tax cuts could destabilise the global economy. “Donald Trump is delivering on economic leadership, that’s for sure,” Turnbull said. Turnbull said he had read Michael Wolff’s account of the Trump Whitehouse, Fire and Fury. The prime minister described it as “sensational” – in the pejorative sense of the word – but suggested he did not want to get into “book criticism”. Asked about subsidies for “clean coal”, Turnbull said there was “no need to” because “there is plenty of capital in the energy sector”. He said he believed the national energy guarantee would reduce wholesale electricity prices “significantly over the next decade”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/grogonomics/2018/jan/30/are-trumps-tax-cuts-really-a-model-for-australian-growth","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-29T17:00:58Z","webTitle":"Are Trump’s tax cuts really a model for Australian growth? | Greg Jericho","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2018/jan/30/are-trumps-tax-cuts-really-a-model-for-australian-growth","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/grogonomics/2018/jan/30/are-trumps-tax-cuts-really-a-model-for-australian-growth","fields":{"headline":"Are Trump’s tax cuts really a model for Australian growth?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Last week the IMF upgraded its projections for global economic growth based mostly on estimated impacts of Donald Trump’s tax plan. But the growth is set to be short lived and is more about policies that increase growth now at the cost of growth later, rather than better ongoing economic performance. In its October world economic outlook, the IMF projected world GDP this year would grow by 3.7%; last week however it revised up this forecast to 3.9%. It was a significant increase and came mostly from the improved performance of advanced economies – especially the USA. The upgrades also carried over into 2019, with the prediction for USA’s GDP growth up from 1.9% to 2.5%. The rather siezeable boost in the USA economy comes due to the expected impact of the Trump tax cuts, “in particular the reduction in corporate tax rates and the temporary allowance for full expensing of investment”. Not surprisingly, Australia’s treasurer, Scott Morrison, quickly used the upgrades to talk up the need for our own company tax cuts. However within the upgrades comes little sense that the company tax cuts are a sensible way to improve growth, nor a particularly solid one. As a general rule, a stronger US economy is something Australians should welcome. Regardless of our increased dependence upon China, the reality is when the US economy is doing well, the world economy is usually doing well, and given our small open economy, that usually means Australia is doing well: Since the early 1980s, the only time Australia’s GDP growth has not closely followed the USA’s was during the GFC – a performance that truly does not get the credit it deserves. And given the budget-projected US GDP growth for this year and the next at 2.25% rather than 2.7% and 2.5%, it means that our economy should perform better over that time than anticipated. But we should not be too quick in lauding Trump’s company tax cuts and equally desiring our own. For a start, the IMF is not really crediting the company tax cut for the upgrades. Yes, it notes “in particular the reduction in the company tax rate”, but it also notes that the “associated fiscal stimulus” is “expected to temporarily raise US growth.” And yet the tax cuts are permanent. So why is the stimulus only temporary? It’s because the big driver of growth according to the IMF is the “the temporary allowance for full expensing of investment”. This is where businesses are allowed to deduct the cost of depreciable assets over one year rather than amortise it over a number of years. But this only applies for purchases made before the middle of 2022. In effect, the policy is trying to get companies to invest in things now rather than later. And it thus often doesn’t create new investment; rather it creates earlier investment. And as a result, the IMF notes that “due to the temporary nature of some of its provisions, the tax policy package is projected to lower growth for a few years from 2022 onwards”. This is not much of a tick for the benefits of a company tax cut, if they are so feeble that the improvement in growth is swamped by the removal of another temporary measure. It aligns with the analysis from credit agency, Moody’s, last week, which noted of the company tax cuts, that “with the US economy close to full employment” (its unemployment rate is currently 4.1%), “the extent to which any fiscal stimulus can substantially increase growth is limited”. It also noted that “we do not expect corporate tax cuts to lead to a meaningful boost in business investment.” Not exactly a ringing endorsement. The reason the tax cut from 35% to 21% is not expected to drive investment is that many US firms are taking advantage of the lower tax rate to buy back shares rather than invest in new equipment or buildings. This fact is so clear that the rightwing Cato Institute, rather than suggest it is not happening, is now instead trying to suggest that it is no big deal and probably a good thing. Within the IMF’s analysis is also some warnings of the impact of the tax cuts. First, it notes that the improvements in growth come because overall the tax cuts and others measures are unfunded – ie they are basically pumping money into the economy. The IMF assumes the drop in tax revenue “will not be offset by spending cuts in the near term.” And that is a big assumption given the speaker of the House of Representatives, Paul Ryan, has already begun talking about cutting social security and Medicare funding in order to “tackle the debt and the deficit”. Doing so would only serve to exacerbate America’s inequality problem – a problem already worsened by the tax cuts themselves, which the IMF notes, will “reduce the average tax rate on upper income US households relative to those in the middle and lower segment.” And it sounds a warning that growth founded on policies that increase inequality “increase pressures for inward-looking policies” (ie nationalistic, protectionist policies). And Trump is already moving towards higher tariffs and greater protectionist policies – all of which will reduce economic growth in the long term. As the IMF noted in a note to the G20 meeting last year, “high and persistent inequality can undermine the sustainability of growth itself” – a position the Trump policies seem determined to achieve. The IMF’s upgrade of the US’s economic growth is in no way a cause for those in favour of company tax cuts to declare victory. If anything, it reinforces how little tax cuts improve the economy and increase the risk of higher inequality – thus reducing economic growth in the long run.

The University of Sydney report, titled Mind the Gap, warns problems with the NDIS’s handling of serious mental health issues could leave many without proper support. The authors interviewed 58 stakeholders in the mental health sector and found that people with a psychosocial disability are having significant difficulty accessing the scheme. The latest figures show just 6.4% of NDIS participants have a primary psychosocial disability, less than half the number expected. About 81.4% of those who requested NDIS support for psychosocial disability were accepted, compared with more than 97% for people with cerebral palsy, autism or intellectual disability. The scheme, at full rollout, is designed to cover about 64,000 people with psychosocial disability. That is well below the total number of people who require ongoing support for severe mental illness in Australia, which the government estimates at 230,000. The report casts doubt on the government’s figure, saying its basis is unclear, given there are an estimated 690,000 Australians with a severe mental illness. The federal government has repeatedly stated the NDIS is designed to complement, not replace, existing mental health services, and is only for those who have a permanent, or likely to be permanent, disability caused by a mental health issue. A National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA) spokeswoman said the scheme was never intended to replace other government support systems, such as the mental health system. “The mainstream mental health system continues to be responsible for the broader group of people who require community based psychosocial supports outside the NDIS,” she said. But report author Jennifer Smith-Merry, of the University of Sydney, warns the NDIS risks leaving gaps in support services. She said existing support services were being closed and their funding withdrawn on the assumption that they will be replaced by NDIS-funded supports. “What is significantly worrying is that at full rollout the scheme is only designed to meet the needs of 64,000 people with severe mental illness, yet existing services are being closed and funding moved into the NDIS,” Smith-Merry said. “This means that many people are going to miss out on the services they need.” Late last year, the NDIA began working on dedicated pathways to accessing the scheme for those with severe mental health issues. It also pledged to curb the use of phone interviews to plan an individual’s NDIS-funded supports, a practice that had drawn the ire of a broad range of disability advocates. “Work is also underway to develop tailored pathways to ensure the NDIA has the right response for all participants, including people with psychosocial disability, children, people from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, those from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds and people with more complex needs,” the spokeswoman said. But the report identifies deeper problems with the NDIS’s treatment of psychosocial disability. It warns that knowledge of the NDIS is low among many people with a psychosocial disability and that individuals are either not applying for support or withdrawing their applications. The scheme’s need for participants to prove “permanence” of disability is alienating those with mental health problems, who are treated on the basis that they can and will recover, the report said. Support for those from Indigenous or culturally diverse groups is poor, the report finds, particularly for those in remote locations. The quality of NDIS assessments of mental health is also described as “poor”, due to a lack of understanding among assessors. Families and service providers are prevented from contributing in the NDIS planning process, the report said, and expert assessments are often ignored. Participants are not given an opportunity to review their support plan sufficiently before it is signed off. The report warns the NDIS transition is having significant ramifications for groups providing mental health services. Organisations specialising in psychosocial disability are “collapsing, merging and selecting not to engage with the NDIS” because the government’s costing structure is unworkable. “Organisations are losing staff with expertise in psychosocial disability because the level of funding provided by the NDIA for instances of care does not match the cost of employing trained staff or providing training and supervision to new staff,” the report warns. The Community Mental Health Association vice-president, Kerry Hawkins, said the report reinforced that those with psychosocial disability were not engaging or applying for the scheme and that the NDIS eligibility criteria were creating significant barriers. “The solutions highlighted in the report include a separate stream for psychosocial disability with recovery-orientated language and practice, high-level leadership on psychosocial disability within the NDIA and alternate funding models for those not eligible for the NDIS,” Hawkins said. “These would be a good start.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/29/pill-testing-is-proven-i-am-hardstyle-shows-how-much-we-need-it","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-29T00:09:35Z","webTitle":"Pill testing is proven.

I Am Hardstyle shows how much we need it","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The hospitalisation of multiple people at the I Am Hardstyle rave in Melbourne over the weekend after consuming what they probably believed were ecstasy pills has caused understandable concern, and reports that the pills may have contained the dangerous compound paramethoxyamphetamine or PMA have reignited the debate around pill testing at nightclubs and festivals. Sadly, this is not new territory; last year pill-related overdoses in Melbourne led to three deaths and there have been many other lives lost in similar circumstances. This sense of familiarity merely adds to the frustration for those of us who take a scientific approach to this problem – because if pill testing was available at the event, perhaps this disaster could have been avoided. The recent debacle with Spilt Milk festival shows how challenging it is to implement any sensible policy in this area. Safety Testing and Advisory Service at Festivals and Events (STA-Safe) were ready to conduct the first trial of pill testing at the Canberra event but the organisers backed out at the last minute – claiming they had failed to provide the necessary paperwork. STA-Safe vehemently refuted this allegation while the (curiously-titled) Liberal party claimed this as a victory for their hardline stance on drug taking. Further evidence, if any was required, that the battle lines remain clearly delineated in the longstanding, and ultimately futile, “war” on drugs. The benefits of pill testing are well-documented; as well as alerting consumers when they contain dangerous substances, it facilitates a subtle process of quality improvement and provides an opportunity for education. These benefits have also been borne out in real world examples where dangerous substances have been identified and lives have undoubtedly been saved. So why are we exposing party-goers to unnecessary risks? Opponents of pill testing argue that it “sends the wrong message”, ie people should not be taking pills at all so the government cannot allow testing as it might suggest a degree of flexibility. However, thousands of festival attendees and clubbers take ecstasy and MDMA powder (the active component in ecstasy pills) each week around the country and will continue to do so, even in the absence of testing facilities. And the most recent National Drug Strategy Household Survey found that about one in nine people have used in their lifetime, which is most likely an underestimate since people are generally unlikely to disclose information on an illegal act. So whatever message the government is trying to deliver, it is clearly not connecting. The validity of this message is also worth questioning – in a seminal study conducted by the addictions psychiatrist David Nutt, a group of experts scored the relative harm inflicted by various drugs on individuals and others. Alcohol was found to be the most harmful overall followed by heroin and crack cocaine, with ecstasy featuring much lower down the list (17th out of 20). MDMA is less addictive than many other drugs – you won’t catch people taking frequent breaks from work to consume it in the way that people take cigarette breaks, nor do the feelings of euphoria and love precipitated by it lend themselves to violent crime in the way that the effects of alcohol might. And although any death is of course a tragedy, there are very few in relation to the numbers of people using actual MDMA. In fact Professor Nutt once famously noted that taking MDMA was statistically safer than horse riding. Although pill testing is most definitely a step in the right direction, it is in some respects a legal and scientific half-way house. If MDMA was legalised, its quality could be controlled and the number of deaths from contamination could potentially be reduced even further. Funds raised from taxation could be used for public education programmes about how to consume these drugs safely and the police would have more time and resource to focus on harder drugs like ice and heroin. The comparison with alcohol is a good one – during the Prohibition era in the US, manufacture was pushed underground which led to numerous deaths from contaminated, poor quality moonshine. Legalisation led to quality control and people stopped dying from drinking wood alcohol. Drug policy is of course far from simple – with so many drugs out there, how do we determine which ones should be illegal? An evidence-based approach would make sense; criminalising any addiction (which is a medical illness) is draconian, but the manufacture and supply of drugs which are highly addictive or highly dangerous even in small quantities, should be restricted. MDMA is neither of those – the gravest danger is from contamination. This debate has been raging for decades, but the time to act is now.

The leak comes amid intense scrutiny in Israel of Sara Netanyahu, who was last year ordered to pay tens of thousands of pounds in damages to two former domestic workers who accused her of bullying. She faces a third lawsuit from an employee who alleged staff were treated like “slaves”. The Israeli site Walla! News published the tape in which Netanyahu, a child psychologist, is heard screaming at an aide who had reportedly placed news of her fundraising activities in a 2009 column. The piece had mentioned how the premier’s wife was “obligated” to public service. “I’m doing it. As a professional, as an ed-u-cated woman. A psy-cho-lo-gist,” Netanyahu can be heard shouting, exclaiming each syllable. “BA, MA,” she screams, referring to her bachelor and master’s degrees. “But it says in the first sentence that you’re a psychologist,” the publicist replies. Netanyahu responds sharply, ordering him to reprimand the editor. “This prime minister’s wife does public service every day,” she shouts, the audio crackling. “In her professional capacity.” Benjamin Netanyahu defended his wife on Facebook, saying everyone “gets angry and says a few words that he didn’t mean”. He said the media had for decades ignored his wife’s public activities, which included helping children with cancer, bereaved families, and Holocaust survivors. The family have faced a barrage of accusations from employees during the past few years. In the most high-profile civil case against Sara Netanyahu, a former chief caretaker of her residence, Meni Naftali, successfully sued her for wrongful dismissal, alleging verbal and emotional abuse. Naftali told a labour court of an “atmosphere of fear among the employees, who were afraid of being victims of minor incidents that would escalate into difficult, rage-filled outbursts, especially after she would drink large amounts of alcohol that I and others would bring to her room daily”. He later won around £20,000 in damages for unpaid overtime and poor treatment. Naftali has since become a key figure in police investigations against Sara Netanyahu that allege she diverted tens of thousands of pounds of state money for meal expenses. The prime minister has denounced the accusations as baseless. In October, an unnamed 24-year-old ultra-Orthodox Jewish woman who worked as a cleaner alleged in a lawsuit that Netanyahu had verbally abused her. The lawsuit alleges that the prime minister’s wife regarded employees as “slaves” and preferred highly religious women who she believed were more introverted and harder working. The Netanyahus have vehemently denied the allegations. The Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth, which is critical of the prime minister, ran a column by Sima Kadmon on Monday saying the leaked recording had exonerated Sara Netanyahu’s “victims”. “For those disenfranchised, paralysed people who were branded as liars – at long last this golden piece of evidence,” the column said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2018/jan/30/abc-dismantles-sound-libraries-and-axes-staff-to-improve-budget","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-29T22:55:21Z","webTitle":"ABC dismantles sound libraries and axes staff to improve budget","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/jan/30/abc-dismantles-sound-libraries-and-axes-staff-to-improve-budget","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2018/jan/30/abc-dismantles-sound-libraries-and-axes-staff-to-improve-budget","fields":{"headline":"ABC dismantles sound libraries and axes staff to improve budget","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The ABC is dismantling its historic sound and reference libraries across the country and making 10 specialist librarians redundant to free up floor space and save on wages. Radio National, Classic FM, JJJ and all the other ABC programs rely on the Sydney, Adelaide, Melbourne, Perth and Hobart libraries, which are packed full of CDs and vinyl as well as books and journals after 85 years of collecting. The librarians know the collection intimately and suggest music for documentaries and other programs. The libraries will be “culled and packed” to reduce duplication and to “align with production requirements”, according to the staff announcement. A single “consolidated” library will survive in Melbourne with a skeleton staff who will digitise a fraction of the collection. A small classical music collection will remain in Sydney for Classic FM. Last year all but one of Radio National’s music programs were decommissioned and eight specialist broadcasters were made redundant, turning RN into a talk-only station. Staff fear the downgrading of music will affect the quality of Radio National and reflect the watering down of specialist content across the ABC in recent years. Library sources say they believe only between 5% and10 % of the collection will be digitised into the Broadcast Music Bank and only 700 of the more than 100,000 CDs have been digitised so far. They fear the reduction in choice and expertise will “homogenise” the music heard on the national broadcaster. Staff were told that the 373,000 vinyl records “will be dealt with following the transfer of CDs”. No changes have been announced for the ABC’s archives of film and tape. The future of a specialist world music collection in Perth looks bleak. “Given the size of the current world music collection in Perth, and that its use is now minimal, this part of the collection will be subject to further analysis, along with the vinyl holdings, to determine the future of these CDs,” management said. The memo said: “Sydney will be the priority to free up floor space followed by the other states and territories with the CD work completed by May 2018.” The musician and former ABC broadcaster Lucky Oceans, whose 25-year-old show The Daily Planet was axed last year, said he was shocked by the speed at which the libraries were being dismantled. “The theory behind it is that people aren’t using hard copies and that it’s all digitised,” Oceans told Guardian Australia. “But you know it’s those same people who were saying that vinyl is dead. It’s short-sighted in that way. You walk into a library and you look through the racks and you find a programming idea. And I don’t think it’s good enough that it will only be in Melbourne. “The Perth library was very lucky because when they sold their vinyl collection they found a buyer but I would say that that is less likely for the CDs, which aren’t in favour at the moment.” Oceans said while digitisation was inevitable, the ABC should retain the librarians “who are such an integral part of the ABC going back when the ABC produced so much more music”. One former sound librarian said the extensive collections in Adelaide and Sydney would all but disappear, along with all the skill and knowledge of the library staff. “This is yet another ‘death by a thousand cuts’ inflicted on all music resources in the ABC,” he said. Staff were told the changes were to “better align our operations with the ABC’s strategic aims”. “With digital technology now available, we can move our sound and reference libraries from operations based on multiple physical collections of information and music, to more efficient digital services which can be accessed by content makers anytime, anywhere,” a staff email said. A spokeswoman for the ABC told Guardian Australia the number of CDs to be digitised would be determined by “the needs of the content makers”. “Under this proposal the sound library collection would be centralised in Melbourne and librarians there would continue to provide expert knowledge to assist content makers around the country,” she said. “With the closure of the other physical libraries, the roles there would not be required. “The new digital Broadcast Music Bank service has only been operating since late 2017 and CDs have been digitised into it as requested by content makers. “The reference library services are currently based in Sydney and Melbourne, and book loans have reduced dramatically. We are not planning to digitise the books. Under the proposed changes we would move to a digital delivery model using e-resources, such as journals, e-books and databases.” The section secretary of the Community and Public Sector Union, Sinddy Ealy, said the plan was irresponsible. “The ABCs decision to sack specialist staff supporting journalists and program makers before the ABC has even bedded down the new content restructure is irresponsible – not only will it undermine the editorial quality of ABC content audiences rely on, but it is likely cost the ABC and taxpayers more money than it saves.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jan/28/incredible-protest-planned-for-trump-visit-to-uk","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-28T23:25:16Z","webTitle":"'Incredible protest' planned for Trump visit to UK","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/28/incredible-protest-planned-for-trump-visit-to-uk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jan/28/incredible-protest-planned-for-trump-visit-to-uk","fields":{"headline":"'Incredible protest' planned for Trump visit to UK","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Protesters are readying themselves for the “most incredible protest in our history” to coincide with Donald Trump’s planned visit during the second half of the year. After a meeting between Theresa May and Trump at the World Economic Forum in Davos, it was confirmed that the US president would visit “later this year”. A Facebook event set up to organise a large-scale protest already boasts of 20,000 attendees and a further 61,000 who are interested in attending. In the description of the event, organisers, who are using the placeholder date of 1 October, said: “It’s just been announced: Donald Trump is coming to Britain on a visit later this year. We don’t know when. But let’s be ready – and be prepared to take to the streets in the most incredible protest in our history.” Plans for a large-scale protest have been underway since May first invited Trump to a state visit within days of him being sworn in as president. The proposed visit sparked the creation of the Stop Trump Coalition which is co-organising the protest and which is backed by musicians, MPs, activists and comedians including singer Lily Allen and former Labour leader Ed Miliband. “It is our duty as citizens to speak out,” the group has said. “We oppose this state visit to the UK and commit ourselves to one of the biggest demonstrations in British history, to make very clear to our government, and to the world, that this is not in our name.” Plans for the visit failed to materialise in 2017 but a planned trip to London in February to open the new US embassy was called off by Trump, which was thought to be due to the prospect of unrest. Trump, however, tweeted to say he had cancelled because of his displeasure about the new embassy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/jan/29/leeds-rhinos-mikolaj-oledzki-super-league-poland","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-29T08:39:06Z","webTitle":"Mikolaj Oledzki: 'A rugby league player from Poland?

This isn't really heard of'","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Gdansk is one of the last places you would think of when it comes to rugby league, yet a small community in Poland’s sixth-biggest city will be paying close attention when Leeds Rhinos begin their Super League title defence at Warrington on Thursday. “I send my grandad the results of all our games and post him clips of the games and the highlights,” says Mikolaj Oledzki. The 19-year-old is the latest product of the Rhinos’ revered talent pathway – a programme which has crafted some of the finest players in Super League history. But Oledzki’s story is different to the rest. “I was born and bred in Gdansk. I moved to England when I was about nine but it was a tough start for me because I couldn’t speak English and all my friends were left behind in Gdansk. I had to have translators in school to help me understand what we were doing in lessons. It was a really difficult start to life and it was easy to miss home.” Oledzki’s family settled initially in Corby. A talented sportsman, he began to excel at swimming, appearing for Northamptonshire’s county team from a young age. But when they moved closer to his uncle in Leeds, he discovered rugby league. “I just didn’t enjoy swimming enough and when we came up north, the opportunity to get into a team sport and play rugby came up. It provided me with the chance to make some friends, face different challenges every day and I fell in love with it as soon as I started. It was good for me, who went from not having any friends to clicking with loads of people.” Of course, it helped that Oledzki took to rugby league like the proverbial duck to water. Having always cut an imposing figure among his peers, he instantly stood out, joining the highly rated amateur side Hunslet Warriors before being brought into Leeds’ Academy structure four years ago. His progress is all the more incredible given that he has been a full-time professional for only a matter of months. Yet as early as last season, Oledzki made his debut for the Rhinos’ senior side and after a loan spell at the then Championship side Bradford, he is expected to feature much more prominently for the Rhinos this season. “I was at college until July so I didn’t actually begin training full-time until midway through last year – that’s given me a real taste for it this year,” he says. “Bradford was huge for me. I learned more there, being thrown in at the deep end at a club who were in desperate trouble, than being somewhere and winning every week. My main goal is just to be a better player than I was last year, no matter how many games I play in 2018.” Even now, though, with a whiff of a Yorkshire accent in Oledzki’s voice and several England Academy appearances already under his belt – he is regarded as an international star of the future by many within the sport – home will always be Poland for the young forward, so much so that he is actually keen to help spread the growth of the game in the country. “I’m very proud to be Polish – so proud. This isn’t really heard of, a league player coming from Poland. There are people back home messaging me to do interviews and asking me about rugby – who knows, maybe the sport is moving forward a little bit in Poland. I’d love to help get it started properly if I could. “I scroll down Twitter sometimes to see what’s happening in Poland, and you see more and more teams involved. I saw a few Polish celebrities; there’s a strongman called Mariusz Pudzianowski and he actually played in one of the games. He’s a superstar in Poland so that’s incredible.” Oledzki is not the first Polish-born player to appear in Super League – that honour is reserved for Grzegorz Kacala, who made a handful of appearances for the ill-fated Paris Saint-Germain side of the late-1990s. If Oledzki’s career continues on this trajectory, though, it is likely the people of Gdask will know far more about him sooner or later."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"music/2018/jan/28/stan-francis-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-28T17:53:36Z","webTitle":"Stan Francis obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jan/28/stan-francis-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/jan/28/stan-francis-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Stan Francis obituary","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"My friend Stan Francis, who has died aged 91, was a pioneering Liverpool guitar maker and folk musician. In 1960 Pete Seeger, then one of the leading figures in the US folk music revival, was seeking a powerful 12-string guitar. He was impressed by a guitar made by Stan, and came to Liverpool to order one. The new guitar (Stan’s No 10), with its distinctive triangular sound-hole and large black scratch-plate, became part of Seeger’s public persona. Stan’s parents, George, a lorry driver, and his wife, Louisa (nee Baxter), a confectioner, moved from Manchester to Liverpool when Stan was five. George was a skilled engineer and woodworker, who read widely and played the banjo. Stan inherited all these skills and interests. After attending Alsop school, Stan became an apprentice at Camell Laird shipbuilders, then worked as an engineer in the merchant navy and for companies in Liverpool before retraining in his early 20s as a draughtsman at English Electric. He married June Love, a nurse, in 1950, and had two daughters, Andrea and Pam. Stan enjoyed singing and playing the banjo and guitar, and became a participant in the Liverpool folk music scene. He met Tony Davis and Mick Groves of the Gin Mill skiffle group in 1957, and joined them and Tony’s wife, Beryl, in the original lineup of the Spinners folk group, which went on to a long and successful career. Stan soon realised this life was not for him, and left after a few months. But he remained a regular figure in Liverpool clubs, and put in another serious stint as a performer with the Liverpool Fishermen, led by the author Brian Jacques, who appeared frequently all over the north west in the late 1960s and early 70s. In the mid-50s Stan also developed his interest in making instruments, beginning with a guitar-shaped mandolin, completed in 1957. Then came several six- and 12-string guitars. At the time, demand for good-quality acoustic steel-strung guitars exceeded supply in the UK, and Stan soon had a waiting list, which included Lonnie Donegan, Tommy Gilfellon, Brian Jones of the Rolling Stones, Tom Springfield and Seeger. Stan’s main interest lay in instrument technology. He did all his work in his garden shed, and made no effort to develop his guitar-making as a business, or repeat successful models. Thus when Seeger ordered a further 12-string in 1966, Stan produced an experimental guitar with an ingenious but untested system of internal bracing. It had a round sound-hole and bore little resemblance to the No 10. He started making mandolins again in 1966 (he made 18 altogether), and completed a total of 71 guitars, the last in 2009. Stan retired as a design engineer at Unilever in 1993. He had no interest in celebrity and preferred the company of his many colleagues, local musicians, friends and collaborators, among whom he was greatly valued. June died in 2014. He is survived by Andrea and Pam."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/28/brexit-passions-tory-theresa-may","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-28T18:55:51Z","webTitle":"Mount Tory is ready to blow over Brexit – and May can’t stop it | Polly Toynbee","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/28/brexit-passions-tory-theresa-may","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/28/brexit-passions-tory-theresa-may","fields":{"headline":"Mount Tory is ready to blow over Brexit – and May can’t stop it","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Today’s great Tory schism has been brewing for decades. The virus began with a handful of oddballs long ago who made “Europe” the catch-all cause of all ills, and Brexit the miracle cure. Now the party is infected, spreading the disease across half the country, mainly to their voters. Doughty Tory anti-Brexiters battle to rescue the body politic, but so far they have lost at every stage. The volcano is ready to blow. Images of mayhem pepper political commentaries. She may be hapless, hopeless and friendless, but Theresa May is not to blame. There is no leader who could bridge the yawning ravine between Jacob Rees-Mogg and Anna Soubry. Time was when the Tory party always knew one big thing: how to put power above everything else. No longer. Brexit passions run deeper than mere party loyalty, and rightly so with the country’s future in the balance. Try this thought experiment: devise a deal that satisfies the crash-out-now Brextremists, the Binos (“Brexit in name only”) and the stay-ins. No wonder every government speech has been fantasy written on gossamer, dreaming of a Brexit made of thin air – frictionless borders but no free movement, perfect free trade but no legal oversight of rules by the European court of justice, a cake-and-eat-it cherry-picking picnic. They block their ears to Michel Barnier and Angela Merkel, repeating wearily yet again last week that there is no pick-and-mix, only hard choices. No wonder May has just called off her promised speech on what she really wants: her Brexit vision, her plan. But she hasn’t got one. Instead there is a two-year transition to nowhere, implementation of nothing. Nothing she could say would bridge the divide, so it’s best to say nothing. As the Brexiteers suspect behind the scenes, as reality blows away fantasy, she knows the hard choices. She’s not stupid. Mandarins are “forcing May into Brexit betrayal”, blasts the Sunday Telegraph front page, blaming the cabinet secretary and Oliver Robbins, the chief negotiator, for making her face the facts. Theresa Villiers accuses her of betrayal by “dilution”. Grant Shapps, the former party chairman, calls for May to name the day of her departure. Some want her to go now – letters from MPs calling for a no-confidence vote are mounting up. Others say let her finish Brexit, before they finish her. But for Tories, Brexit will never end. No deal will mollify both camps – so there may be no deal for a “meaningful” vote in October. The Tory party will rankle and wrangle over this for ever. While every contender was polishing their sabre, the upstart Gavin Williamson tripped over his shoelaces before he was out of the gate. GCHQ is reportedly “furious” at the new defence secretary leaking secret information on Russian cyber threats, as a smokescreen to cover an embarrassing story about his past. His “friends” – if he has any – say all this is “black ops” by other contestants. The leadership betting is startling: Rees-Mogg has led for months, Boris Johnson second. Rees-Mogg says no to any transition as rule-taking “vassals” of the monster Brussels; wanting an immediate crash-out makes him a kind of destructo-anarchist. Anyone who contemplates either man as leader suggests a party that has taken leave of its senses, devoid of a will to win. Johnson promises a speech soon laying out his “liberal” case for Brexit with a “buccaneering” spirit, unlikely to ease his party’s woes. His demand for £5bn for the NHS was as transparently vote-grubbing as Michael Gove’s comical new green and puppy-saving enthusiasm. Amber Rudd is moving up the table a little – but it would take the transformation of her party and its toxic press for anyone normal like her to stand a chance. The warring Brexit war cabinet committee meets on Monday, unlikely to “come together in a spirit of mutual respect”, as Cabinet Office minister David Lidington pleaded on Sunday. On Tuesday, the Lords set to on the EU withdrawal bill, likely to force the government into serial climbdowns over Henry VIII powers and devolution. Some peers will press hard for that second referendum, encouraged by the Guardian/ICM poll showing a 16-point lead in favour. Oddly, a murmur among some Tories ponders whether that might be an escape from their own dilemma: let the people decide. But what would the question be? Accept the deal or crash out? Accept the deal or stay in? If remain won and Brexit was reversed by a small majority, think of the ferocious, everlasting political fallout. Referendums make everything worse. “Bring it on,” Jeremy Corbyn told Andrew Marr on Sunday, not about a referendum but relishing the prospect of May’s toppling causing an election, as any opposition leader would. Labour’s divide looks no more than business-as-usual, compared with the Tory split. Anti-Brexiters may have taken heart at his new tone of warmth for staying close to the EU. In a confident outing on the Marr show, for the first time he sounded completely positive about staying as close as possible to the single market and customs union. Strongly influenced by Labour’s pro-EU young voters and by the big unions’ deep anxiety about Brexit, those close to Corbyn say he has travelled a long way, reassured that nothing in his manifesto is prevented by EU state aid rules. Keir Starmer, visiting Belfast on Monday, regards the Irish border as the linchpin. Writing in the Belfast Telegraph, he points out that the prime minister’s phase one of the EU agreement promised unreservedly no hard border, “including any physical infrastructure or related checks and controls”. There is no way that can be done, he says, except by cleaving to single market and customs union terms in the final deal. Ireland holds the key – and that’s why the anarcho-Brexiteers duck mentioning this anvil on which the final deal will be struck or founder. Meanwhile, for our entertainment, Tory whips have summoned ministers to warn them they face an annual appraisal, judged on the following tests: their new ideas, engagement with colleagues, teamwork and passion. Presumably the whips knew their leader would fail every one, allowing the great axe to fall. • Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sport/2018/feb/01/a-philadelphia-super-bowl-victory-would-counter-two-centuries-of-us-history","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-01T15:14:42Z","webTitle":"A Philadelphia Super Bowl victory would counter two centuries of US history","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/feb/01/a-philadelphia-super-bowl-victory-would-counter-two-centuries-of-us-history","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/feb/01/a-philadelphia-super-bowl-victory-would-counter-two-centuries-of-us-history","fields":{"headline":"A Philadelphia Super Bowl victory would counter two centuries of US history","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Philadelphia is a city where sports mean a little too much. So you can imagine the sensation around town with the Eagles back in the Super Bowl, one tantalizing win away from the snakebitten team’s first title in 57 years. When they last won the NFL championship in the winter of the Eisenhower administration, football was hardly the cultural behemoth it is now, still an afterthought to baseball, and even boxing, in the national consciousness. It was a full six years before the NFL title game was even called the Super Bowl, which to some means it may as well have never even happened. It’s hard to articulate to an outsider what it would mean for the city if the Eagles upset the New England Patriots on Sunday night. There’s reason to believe they will. All year long the team has overcome injuries to key players, left tackle Jason Peters, running back Darren Sproles, middle linebacker Jordan Hicks and special teams ace Chris Maragos, without a hitch. A season-ending injury to second-year franchise quarterback Carson Wentz in December was meant to be the death knell, but they’ve not lost a meaningful game since as understudy Nick Foles has shone in relief. So could this be the year it finally happens? If you’ve spent longer than 15 minutes in my hometown you surely know the answer: Of course not. Being a Philadelphia sports fan is to forever expect a kick in the teeth. A lifetime of rooting for teams that always let you down has taught many Philly natives how to lose. Like in life. This is not a historical trend so much as it’s encoded in the civic DNA. Compound it with the city’s historic inferiority complex and you’ve got something worse than fatalism: it’s the perverse sense deep down that we don’t even deserve it. Philadelphia at the end of the 18th century was the political and commercial epicenter of the young United States, a seat of art and fashion and intellect, the largest and most important city in America. The brightest minds of the day were drawn there by the overarching tolerance of dissent and opposing views engendered by the city’s Quaker roots, making it an critical hub for new ideas. But one by one those mantles of national leadership were stripped away, its international preeminence waned and the wounds persist to present day. Philadelphia lost the national capital to the newly formed District of Columbia upon completion of the White House and US Capitol building in 1800. That had been the plan since the Compromise of 1790, but still stung the city that had served as the traditional meeting place of the Founding Fathers, the signing place of the Declaration of Independence at the Second Continental Congress in 1776 and the Constitution at the Philadelphia Convention of 1787. Commercially, New York City had been an afterthought to Philadelphia, its growth stunted while under British occupation for most of the American Revolution. But the geographic advantages of the Hudson River, which thanks to a tidal estuary didn’t freeze over like the freshwater Delaware, helped New York’s port surpass larger counterparts in Charleston and Boston and ultimately eclipse Philadelphia as the nation’s leading importer and exporter by 1803. In the quarter-century after winning the race to the country’s interior with the completion of the Erie Canal in 1825, New York’s exports tripled while its population quadrupled. Whatever symbolic claim to financial supremacy Philadelphia maintained was buried for good in 1836, when the city was rejected by the rest of the country with the failure to renew the charter of the Second National Bank. “The nation had rejected the leadership of Old Philadelphia; very well, Old Philadelphia rejected the nation. Henceforth let vulgar Washington take over politics and vulgar New York take over finance,” Nathanial Burt wrote. “Philadelphia gentlemen would at least remain Philadelphian and gentlemen.’’ In many ways Philadelphia has never recovered from these twin declines in political and commercial influence, which have fostered a cynicism and negativity that lives on. Suddenly, Philadelphia’s greatest achievements were the many US firsts on the historical ledger – first library, first hospital, first stock exchange, first medical school, first penitentiary – a looking-back which contributed to the city’s decline as an intellectual hub. The backward-facing attitude was best summed up by Mark Twain: “In Boston, they ask: ‘What does he know?’ in New York, ‘How much does he make?’ In Philadelphia, ‘Who were his parents?’” Over time it came to alter the character of a city and would have a profound effect on the attitudes and worldviews of Philadelphians that persists to this day: a city of losers. Philadelphia’s sports teams have done little to counter the perception, battering the region’s collective psyche at least as much as the Erie Canal, Biddle and the Bank did and lending to their reputation, partially earned, of a famously surly fanbase. The city’s baseball team, the Phillies, entered the National League in 1883. Not until their 97th season did they finally win a championship, the first of two in the club’s 135-year history. They’ve since become the first team in the history of professional sports to amass 10,000 losses. By contrast, the Philadelphia Athletics were highly successful – essentially the Yankees before the Yankees were the Yankees – so naturally they skipped town. The NBA’s 76ers are the third winningest team in NBA history, but have won a scant two titles in Philadelphia and have been shoved to the margins in history by the Boston Celtics (17) and Los Angeles Lakers (16). The NHL’s Flyers won Stanley Cups twice in the 1970s, but have tripped at the final hurdle seven times since. But it’s football that’s always united this blue-collar burg like none of the others, which is why an NFL championship would just mean more here. After all this time it just seems so unlikely. Only a megalomaniac would believe a sports team is cursed, but there’s a palpable tension and nervous energy around Philadelphia teams when the lights burn brightest that has a way of spilling onto the field. There’s no other way to explain why in the big games our wide receivers can’t catch and our jump-shooters can’t shoot. Maybe Foles can do the unthinkable and lead the Eagles to their first championship since 1960. It is, after all, just one game. Anything can happen. But to expect anything but painful defeat and disillusionment would run counter to more than two centuries of American history."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"education/2018/jan/28/edgar-young-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-28T17:10:36Z","webTitle":"Edgar Young obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/jan/28/edgar-young-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2018/jan/28/edgar-young-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Edgar Young obituary","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"My father, Edgar Young, who has died aged 93, was part of an extraordinary postwar intake at Bognor Regis emergency teacher training college in West Sussex. Created to address the severe teacher shortage following Rab Butler’s 1944 Education Act, the college, led by the innovative Roy Macklin, was more concerned with the character and experience of applicants than in formal qualifications. During the second world war, Edgar had worked in a protected occupation as a shipwright in Portsmouth dockyard, but saw a vocation in primary school teaching and shared Macklin’s view of education as a guide for living rather than narrowly vocational or academic. The college provided an intensive 50-week course for mature students, mainly former servicemen and women. Possessing practical skills and often widely travelled, they brought to the classroom a wealth of knowledge denied to colleagues whose life had been spent wholly in the education system. Subsequently heads and school inspectors regarded teachers from this course as particularly talented and effective educators. Son of John and Lilian (known as “Cissie”), Edgar was born in Portsmouth into a family of skilled dockyard workers. He attended the Northern grammar school until the war disrupted his further education. During his first teaching practice in Portsmouth in 1950 he encountered children who had never seen the sea (despite no part of Portsea Island being more than a mile from the water) and others with no shoes. For many years Edgar taught at Horndean primary school in Hampshire, working into the evenings to prepare individual learning cards for each child in the class and taking every opportunity to extend lessons out into the village and surrounding countryside. Very much an integral part of village life, Edgar and his wife, Iris (nee Lott), whom he married in 1950, were keen members of the local Merchistoun Hall community association. In his own time, he studied for a diploma in education. Edgar’s then unfashionable opposition to the 11-plus (along with his union membership) slowed his career development. In 1970 he was eventually appointed deputy head at Wildground junior school in Hythe, adjacent to the New Forest, where, on retirement in 1984, Edgar led guided walks. In 2001, he and Iris moved to a sheltered housing complex in Southsea, where Joyce, his older sister and a former headteacher, was also a resident. He devotedly cared for both of them until their deaths. A lifetime teetotaller and non-smoker, 70 years after leaving the dockyard Edgar was diagnosed with mesothelioma (asbestosis), a scourge of former employees. He was attempting the Guardian quick crossword only hours before his death. Edgar is survived by two sons, Kevin and me, three grandchildren, Ann, Martin and Sam, and a great-granddaughter, Freyja."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/jan/28/newport-mike-flynn-wembley-tottenham-fa-cup","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-28T22:30:05Z","webTitle":"Newport’s Mike Flynn looks to extend Wembley record in Tottenham replay","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/28/newport-mike-flynn-wembley-tottenham-fa-cup","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jan/28/newport-mike-flynn-wembley-tottenham-fa-cup","fields":{"headline":"Newport’s Mike Flynn looks to extend Wembley record in Tottenham replay","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"It said plenty for the evening Mike Flynn had just experienced that his biggest concern involved keeping a proud statistic intact. “I played there in the play-off final for Newport and got us back in the league,” the Newport County manager said of Tottenham’s temporary home at the national stadium, where an FA Cup fourth-round replay now awaits his League Two side. “That’s the only problem – I’ve got a 100% record at Wembley and I don’t want to spoil it.” The match to which Flynn referred took place on 5 May 2013; he patrolled the midfield as Wrexham were beaten 2-0, ending Newport’s 25-year absence from the Football League. It has not been an easy ride since but Saturday’s 1-1 draw – which would have been so much more had Harry Kane not scored a barely deserved late equaliser to cancel out a header from Padraig Amond – can help permanently change the environment in which Flynn’s team, who came within minutes of a return to non-league last season, operate. “It allows us to lay foundations for the future,” he said. “I want to improve the training ground – I would like a new pitch and we need a new building because the old one caught fire [earlier this month]. These kinds of thing are important and I’m sure things will happen.” Flynn estimated that Newport’s Cup run has, to date, earned more than £700,000 for a club whose annual turnover is around £2.2m. He said he “nearly hid under the table” when he saw Tottenham’s starting XI, for which Mauricio Pochettino shuffled his pack but left little to chance with the inclusion of Kane among others, but Newport more than matched their Premier League opponents from start to finish. “It was scary but I was confident in what my players could do,” he said. “I’m glad they had the big names playing because it makes the result even sweeter.” Pochettino said his players “missed a massive opportunity to show that we really want to win some trophies” and admitted they were “not motivated to the same level as Newport”. Other managers might perhaps have sought refuge in the excuse of a patchy, bobbly surface but Flynn clearly appreciated Pochettino’s graciousness and said his players had taken Tottenham to the wire on merit. “The pitch didn’t stop their passing movement, their style of play and quality,” he said. “The way they handled the football was excellent but I thought we were the better team in the first half. I didn’t want to sit back and just invite pressure. My boys weren’t tired [in the second half], it was that Spurs were relentless. They kept going but my boys were brilliant” – sufficiently brilliant to suggest the loss of that Wembley record is no foregone conclusion at all."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jan/28/democrats-immigration-pelosi-manchin-trump","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-28T19:06:40Z","webTitle":"Pelosi's 'make America white again' dig at Trump draws rebuke from fellow Democrat","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/28/democrats-immigration-pelosi-manchin-trump","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jan/28/democrats-immigration-pelosi-manchin-trump","fields":{"headline":"Pelosi's 'make America white again' dig at Trump draws rebuke from fellow Democrat","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The West Virginia senator Joe Manchin on Sunday criticized House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi for dismissing a new White House immigration plan as a way to “make America white again”. “We don’t need that type of rhetoric on either side, from Nancy, [Republican House speaker] Paul Ryan or anybody else,” said Manchin, a West Virginian moderate and a leader of a bipartisan Senate group working on immigration who spoke to CNN’s State of the Union. Senior White House officials outlined the immigration plan on Thursday. It would offer a path to citizenship for up to 1.8 million undocumented migrants who were brought to the US as children. Such people, known as Dreamers, were protected from deportation under an Obama-era program, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) which Trump rescinded in September. The proposal also would curb some legal immigration programs and build a border wall with Mexico. It asks for a $25bn “trust fund” for such measures. The White House described the Dreamers offer as a major concession to Democrats, but the plan was quickly dismissed by leading party figures. Pelosi said it holds Dreamers “hostage to a hateful anti-immigrant scheme” and accused the Trump administration of a campaign “to make America white again”. Late on Saturday night, Trump tweeted: “I have offered DACA a wonderful deal, including a doubling in the number of recipients &amp; a twelve year pathway to citizenship, for two reasons: (1) Because the Republicans want to fix a long time terrible problem. (2) To show that Democrats do not want to solve DACA, only use it! “Democrats are not interested in Border Safety &amp; Security or in the funding and rebuilding of our Military. They are only interested in Obstruction!” On Sunday the South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham, a proponent of immigration reform, told ABC’s This Week: “You don’t need $25bn for a wall … we’re not going to build a 1,900-mile wall but $25bn can be spent wisely.” Manchin announced earlier this week that he will run for re-election this year in a state where Trump trounced Hillary Clinton in 2016. In a separate interview on Sunday on NBC’s Meet the Press, he said he thought the White House plan was “a good starting point”. His comments highlighted the divisions among Democrats ahead of an 8 February deadline for Congress to pass another spending bill and try to reach an immigration agreement that would also protect Dreamers from deportation. Manchin said the bipartisan group led by himself and moderate Maine Republican Susan Collins would meet on Monday evening to examine the White House proposal, adding he expected more details to emerge. The group of more than 20 senators from both parties, which has been called the Common Sense Coalition, helped to end a three-day government shutdown driven by the Dreamers issue last week. “I think we can find a pathway forward, I really do,” Manchin told NBC. Collins, speaking to CBS’s Face the Nation, said the group hoped to influence a proposal that the Senate’s two whips, Republican John Cornyn and Democrat Dick Durbin, are trying to assemble. “If [Cornyn and Durbin] agree, I have a feeling that that will be a bill that can go all the way to the president’s desk, and that’s our goal,” Collins said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/28/tories-motorists-rogue-parking-sajid-javid-cars-road","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-28T18:46:23Z","webTitle":"The problem with cars is not parking - it's that too much motoring is killing us | Hugh Muir","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/28/tories-motorists-rogue-parking-sajid-javid-cars-road","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/28/tories-motorists-rogue-parking-sajid-javid-cars-road","fields":{"headline":"The problem with cars is not parking - it's that too much motoring is killing us","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"I am therefore I drive. Almost 140 years after the unveiling by Karl Benz of the first petrol-propelled car we might recognise, and even in our air-polluted 21st century, this remains a maxim – one that the government, ever more desperate for any populist adhesive, swears by. Thus Sajid Javid, the communities secretary, let it be known today that he too is the motorist’s bestest friend, and will do something to lift the nightmare that is parking. His focus is the privatised – or rogue – parking industry. To that end, he will throw the government’s weight behind legislation proposed by the Conservative MP Greg Knight to penalise operators who unfairly issue tickets. It will do this by blocking their access to driver vehicle records. If the firms cannot match vehicle to owner, they can’t do their jobs and will probably cease to be viable. Javid’s intervention means the bill will pass its second reading this week and probably become law. Boo to the parking highwaymen. Hooray for a communities secretary standing up for the “just about managing”. That, of course, is the narrative the secretary of state would like. Cowboy operators don’t, and shouldn’t, elicit much sympathy. Private firms are issuing 13 times as many parking tickets as they did a decade ago, according to the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency. Many are making hay as well as profits. And certainly there is disgruntlement: Citizens Advice says 10,000 people approached it for help on disputed tickets last year. But there is something perverse about ministers who have made privatisation of anything that might yield a shareholder buck an article of faith, pointing a moralising finger at those who have benefited. In motoring terms, isn’t this something of a handbrake turn? One can see why parking might be singled out by a Brexit-constipated government, keen to reinvent itself as Robin Hood. There is barely a town or city across our nation that isn’t gripped by disputes over the relationship between vehicular use and road space. But Westminster has made these problems worse. Quite apart from the injudicious application of profit-hungry market forces to the stewardship of that relationship, it has starved local authorities of funds, and thus prioritised for them the voracious collection of parking revenues. Ditto hospitals that find themselves desperate for income as a result of underfunding by the state. It is not for national governments to micromanage who gets to stop outside a corner shop in a particular town, or the optimum loading time for deliveries in your local high street. But it is certainly not acceptable for national politics to make those problems more acute. And it is time national government got to the heart of the matter by addressing in a studious fashion our relationship with the car, particularly in the conurbations. There is a simple truth, and ministers know it: we have too many cars, and drive them too much. “Conservatives believe that poor air quality is the largest environmental threat to public health in the UK,” said a party party press release last year. But there has been no sign of action commensurate with that threat. Nitrogen dioxide, emitted mostly by diesel cars, has been above legal limits in almost 90% of urban areas in the UK since 2010, with fumes causing an estimated 23,500 early deaths a year. In April 2016 a cross-party committee of MPs declared a public health emergency. Yet the government’s reaction has been so poor that campaigners have twice won legal actions over its failure to act. It’s now being sued a third time. You would think economics might drive the policy of a profit-loving, market-oriented administration. After all, it is estimated that the congestion caused by cars could bleed £300bn from the economy by 2030. But our economy also needs us to keep buying, or leasing, all those cars. A few days ago the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders reported a 5.7% fall last year in new car sales, but pointed out that demand remains “at historically high levels” – 2016 saw a record 2.7m new car sales, and leasers claimed that over 80% of those new private registrations were financed by its members. So if you’re waiting for decisive action to curb the number of cars on the road, don’t hold your breath. What you will get instead from ministers is fist-shaking at the perfidious private firms – the villains from central casting; vague talk about how driverless cars will solve everything, and entreaties for people to drive less (without the spending on transport infrastructure – including cycling – that would make it possible). All of which reflects the overriding truth that in our hidebound politics, the car is still king. • Hugh Muir is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jan/28/republicans-steve-wynn-donations-sexual-harassment","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-28T17:05:26Z","webTitle":"Republican senators: party should consider returning Steve Wynn cash","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/28/republicans-steve-wynn-donations-sexual-harassment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jan/28/republicans-steve-wynn-donations-sexual-harassment","fields":{"headline":"Republican senators: party should consider returning Steve Wynn cash","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Two Republican senators said on Sunday their party should immediately consider returning contributions from the Las Vegas casino mogul Steve Wynn, in light of sexual harassment and assault allegations against him. Republicans have previously called on Democrats to return contributions from figures including the disgraced Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein. In early October, RNC chair Ronna Romney McDaniel tweeted that if the Democratic National Committee “truly stands up for women like they say they do, then returning Weinstein’s dirty money should be a no-brainer”. McDaniel confirmed Wynn’s resignation in a statement on Saturday, having reportedly discussed the issue with Trump. The RNC did not say immediately if it would return any money donated by Wynn. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina told ABC’s This Week on Sunday money from Wynn should be returned if the allegations against him are found to “have merit”. “We should do ourselves what we ask of the Democratic party,” Graham said. “I don’t think we should have a double standard for ourselves.’ Susan Collins of Maine told CNN’s state of the union that Republicans should return money if they had accepted contributions recently that had not been spent. Collins said she had not received money from Wynn. Wynn led RNC fundraising efforts during Donald Trump’s first year in the White House, helping rake in more than $130m. According to the Federal Election Commission, he personally contributed more than $600,000. He resigned on Saturday after a Wall Street Journal report on allegations of harassment and assault made by several women. One case led to a $7.5m settlement with a manicurist, the paper reported. Wynn denied the allegations and said in a statement: “The unbelievable success we have achieved must continue. The work we are doing to make America a better place is too important to be impaired by this distraction.” Wynn was among the organizers of a Trump fundraiser last week at the president’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, to celebrate the anniversary of the inauguration. The president was unable to attend because of the government shutdown. Wynn also helped put together events in Dallas in October and New York City in December. Wynn has donated to a wide range of political figures, including Nevada senator Dean Heller and the Montana congressman Greg Gianforte. According to federal records, Wynn gave $2,700 to Gianforte the day after the politician assaulted a Guardian reporter, Ben Jacobs, last May. Wynn also donated to Hillary Clinton, the 2016 Democratic nominee for president."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/jan/29/eu-withdrawal-bill-major-rewrites-house-of-lords-committee-brexit","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-29T00:01:32Z","webTitle":"EU withdrawal bill needs major rewrites, Lords committee says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jan/29/eu-withdrawal-bill-major-rewrites-house-of-lords-committee-brexit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jan/29/eu-withdrawal-bill-major-rewrites-house-of-lords-committee-brexit","fields":{"headline":"EU withdrawal bill needs major rewrites, Lords committee says","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The EU withdrawal bill is fundamentally flawed and needs to be rewritten in several ways, peers have said, as the House of Lords prepares to debate the legislation this week. The Lords constitution committee said that the bill as it currently stands risked “undermining legal certainty” and should be substantially changed, even though it has already been voted through the House of Commons. The bill will be subject to fierce debate when it reaches the Lords on Tuesday and Wednesday, with remain-supporting peers expected to vote for a motion of regret that the public is not getting another say over Brexit. Ahead of that battle, the committee recommended major changes that could be debated at a later stage of the bill’s passage through the second chamber. The purpose of the legislation is to transpose EU legislation into domestic law in time for Brexit day at the end of March 2019. But the committee said the task was complicated not only by its “scale and complexity”, but problems with the drafting. “We conclude that the bill risks fundamentally undermining legal certainty in a number of ways,” the cross-party group said. The peers said the method proposed to create a new category of “retained EU law” would cause “problematic uncertainties and ambiguities”. They also criticised the elements of the bill granting ministers power to amend regulations without full parliamentary scrutiny, known as Henry VIII powers, saying they are “overly broad” and there is an “unacceptably wide” emergency procedure for short-term changes. Thirdly, the peers warned that failure to secure agreement from the Scottish and Welsh administrations about the devolution of powers returned from Brussels could have “significant constitutional repercussions”. “The bill is therefore fundamentally flawed from a constitutional perspective in multiple ways,” the report said. Lady Taylor of Bolton, the chair of the committee, said: “We acknowledge the scale, challenge and unprecedented nature of the task of converting existing EU law into UK law, but as it stands, this bill is constitutionally unacceptable.” All the aspects of the bill criticised by the peers have already been challenged in the Commons, but ultimately, the government was only defeated on one issue, as MPs insisted they wanted a guaranteed vote on the terms of leaving before Brexit. Peers will have to decide how far they want to go towards challenging the bill when amendments are debated at committee and report stage in the coming weeks. Labour is planning to support around 20 amendments in the Lords, meaning there is a real chance of government defeats with the support of crossbench and Lib Dem peers. Top of its list of demands are: a role for parliament in the event of no deal; a vote for the UK parliament on the final deal ahead of the EU parliament; a time-limited transitional period on current terms; enhanced protection for EU-derived rights; further limitations on Henry VIII powers; and removing the government’s fixed Brexit day. Angela Smith, the Labour leader in the Lords, who will open the second reading debate for Labour said: “We will work with others around the Lords to change this bill so it becomes an enabling measure for, rather than an obstacle to a transitional period, as is currently the case. This will include seeking amendments relating to ‘exit day’, ensuring the government cannot reduce rights via secondary legislation, and providing greater clarity about the role of the European court of justice and the future status of its case law. “Labour has consistently called for a transitional period based on current terms, including a temporary extension to our participation in the single market and customs union. This would prevent a cliff edge for consumers and businesses in March 2019.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2018/feb/18/starwatch-new-moon-bask-in-earthshine","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-18T21:30:54Z","webTitle":"Starwatch: a chance to bask in earthshine","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/feb/18/starwatch-new-moon-bask-in-earthshine","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2018/feb/18/starwatch-new-moon-bask-in-earthshine","fields":{"headline":"Starwatch: a chance to bask in earthshine","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"This evening’s crescent moon brings with it a good chance of seeing earthshine.

Downing Street sources have confirmed that rather than setting out a fresh vision of Brexit in the spring, as some colleagues had hoped, May will make a more limited speech focusing on security cooperation at a conference in Munich next month. With pro-Brexit MPs in open revolt, senior Conservatives are warning that unless the prime minister exerts firmer leadership over the issue she could be deposed. “She’s as vulnerable as she’s ever been,” one backbencher told the Guardian. “She’s got to make a decision.” Pro-EU MPs were alarmed by the show of strength by Eurosceptics last week, which saw Downing Street disown remarks by Philip Hammond that the UK and EU economies should diverge only “very modestly” after Brexit. Brexit supporters threw their weight behind the prime minister in the wake of last year’s general election, fearing that any alternative candidate might abandon her pledges to ditch the single market and the customs union. But they have become increasingly vocal in recent weeks amid fears that the government’s approach is softening. Both sides are frustrated with the prime minister’s apparent unwillingness to set out her stance in more detail. The former Northern Ireland secretary Theresa Villiers became the latest to go public this weekend, using an article in the Sunday Telegraph to warn that Britain risks remaining in the EU “in all but name”. “Since the prime minister set out a bold vision in her Lancaster House speech, the direction of travel seems to have gone in only one single direction: towards a dilution of Brexit. “If the government goes too much further down that path, there is a real danger that it will sign up to an agreement which could keep us in the EU in all but name, and which would therefore fail to respect the referendum result,” Villiers said. Brexiters have been disturbed by reports that senior civil servants, led by the chief negotiator, Ollie Robbins, have been offering a series of compromises to EU officials, including continued membership of the customs union. One cabinet minister dismissed the reports on Sunday night as “black propaganda from Brussels”, or a misinterpretation of the idea of a “customs partnership” that was floated by the government in a white paper last year. But a senior pro-Brexit Tory said: “It comes back to the fact that no one knows what the prime minister really thinks – everyone’s projecting their worst fears on to her.” Jacob Rees-Mogg, chair of the European research group of pro-leave backbenchers, hinted strongly on Sunday that he would like Hammond to be sacked. “I tend to disagree with the chancellor on many things, but on this issue he seems to be disagreeing with government policy, the Conservative party manifesto and Mrs May’s speeches. This is real trouble for the government. The history of chancellors being in opposition to prime ministers is not a good one or an encouraging one,” he told ITV’s Peston on Sunday. Pressed on whether the chancellor should lose his job, he added: “I’m being as loyal as could possibly be on the policy question, and I am biting my tongue on the personality question.” Meanwhile, a string of headlines about allegations of cash-for-influence, and the personal life of the defence secretary, Gavin Williamson, also caused disquiet among moderate backbenchers, who are concerned about the damage being sustained to their party. Heidi Allen, MP for South Cambridgeshire, tweeted her disapproval of what she called the Conservatives’ “old guard” on Sunday, saying her party needed to, “get a grip and lead”. The backbench MP Johnny Mercer, sometimes touted as a potential leadership candidate, told the Sunday Times that at the next general election Jeremy Corbyn “could well be prime minister if we don’t get our shit together”. Under Conservative party rules, a vote of no confidence would be held if 15% of MPs – 48 under current parliamentary arithmetic – write to the chair of the backbench 1922 committee, Graham Brady. One report in the Sun last week suggested as many as 40 may already have done so. The Cabinet Office minister, David Lidington, urged his rowing colleagues to “come together in a spirit of mutual respect” on Sunday, warning that the Tories remain “neck and neck” with Labour and should focus their fire on the opposition, not each other. “I think what I’d say to all my colleagues is that the Conservative family – left, right and centre, because we’re a broad church – has to come together in a spirit of mutual respect,” he said. With the cabinet’s Brexit subcommittee due to meet this week, ministers privately admit deep differences remain about how much the UK should allow itself to diverge from the EU in future. Lidington said that a future government would “have the choice whether or not to diverge, once we’ve left the supranational legal structures of the EU”. But it is unclear how much leeway Brussels, which will publish its negotiating guidelines for the next phase of the talks on Monday, would be willing to allow Britain while granting the “frictionless” access to EU markets the government is demanding. The foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, plans to deliver a speech on what he calls the liberal case for Brexit in the next few weeks, which could spark fresh discord if it appears to differ from the prime minister’s approach. It also emerged that energy minister Claire Perry had described Leavers angry about the so-called divorce bill as “swivel-eyed”. Perry’s remarks came in a WhatsApp message to a private group of Tory MPs which was obtained by the Telegraph. It was sent last month as Theresa May agreed to pay the European Union a £39bn “divorce bill” as part of efforts to break a logjam in exit negotiations and begin trade talks. Perry was responding to Tory MP Ben Bradley, who said he was “getting some shit from the usual subjects about sell-outs and traitors” over the financial settlement. According to the newspaper, Perry replied: “The ‘sell out traitor mob’ should be ignored. Listening to them means wrecking the economy in the short term and via a Corbyn government delivering a long steady slow decline for the country we love. “I would hypothesise that they are mostly elderly retired men who do not have mortgages, school-aged children or caring responsibilities so they represent the swivel-eyed few not the many we represent.” Responding to the publication of her message, Perry said: “Passions were running high as we all worked to get the Brexit bill through and mine regrettably spilled over.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/blog/2018/jan/28/champions-keep-cool-heat-battle-ferocious-levels","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-28T16:59:24Z","webTitle":"Australian Open: Federer keeps his cool through the fierce heat of battle | Kevin Mitchell","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/jan/28/champions-keep-cool-heat-battle-ferocious-levels","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2018/jan/28/champions-keep-cool-heat-battle-ferocious-levels","fields":{"headline":"Australian Open: Federer keeps his cool through the fierce heat of battle","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"This turbulent Australian Open has been about longevity, endurance and iced towels, three of the defining features of the modern game.

Cilic clocked up 17hr 3min en route. At the end it showed. When the heatwave rolled through Melbourne midway through the first week (and returned like an uninvited guest at the finish), the complaints of the suffering players became the coda to the tournament. Notable was the second-round battle between Novak Djokovic and Gaël Monfils. It lasted only 2hr 45min but the Frenchman said he felt as if he had survived “a small heat stroke for 40 minutes”. Djokovic said he was “right at the limit” of his stamina. His conqueror in the fourth round, the Korean bull Hyeon Chung, would also fall, retiring with a nasty foot blister after two games of the second set in his semi-final against Federer. Nobody, it seemed, was immune – young or old, male or female – except one man: the champion. In the women’s draw the three‑set formula saved most players from enduring too much pain – indeed, a dozen matches did not last an hour and most finished in less than two – but there were exceptions and they hit those players who would feature in the finish. The 3hr 44min of the third-round match between Simona Halep and the young American Lauren Davis might have been as hard to watch as it must have been to play – and the Romanian winner would pay a price for her courage. By the time she reached Saturday’s final against the Danish grinder Caroline Wozniacki, she was red‑lining. That night she spent four hours in hospital, recovering from dehydration. The match had dragged the last drop of commitment and sweat from both of them, Halep needing a courtside health check in the second set after looking ready to topple over; she somehow recovered to level at a set apiece. It proved to be a chimera. After two hours in sweltering heat, Wozniacki brought the crowd to their feet with a volley to end a 23-shot rally in the third game of the deciding set. She was breathing hard – and double‑faulted to drop serve. In 2014 the Dane ran the New York marathon in 3hr 26min – 18min less than it had taken Halep to defeat Davis. There was not a single serve-and-volley point from either player, with the workload spread overwhelmingly across the baseline, where 226 points were won and lost. When she was broken in the seventh game, Wozniacki called for the physio to work on her left knee. It might have been that her entire engine was seizing up. But she outlasted her weary adversary, whose last shot, after many glorious ones, was a lame backhand from mid-court into the net. They had played for 2hr 49min – exactly the time it took Victor Troicki to defeat Alex Bolt over five sets in round one. The last set of the final took 71 minutes – exactly the time it took Halep to beat Karolina Pliskova in the quarter-finals. The 2hr 22min it took Halep to beat Angelique Kerber in the semi-finals was two minutes less than her third set against Davis. The more it matters, the more time becomes irrelevant. Ultimately, though, this is what they train for – as Kyle Edmund pointed out. Even when a hip injury cut him down in his semi‑final against Cilic, he dismissed it as “one of those things”. When asked about the heat, he delivered perhaps the quote of the tournament: “It’s a professional sport. It’s meant to hurt. It’s not meant to be easy.” As a tearful Federer showed after he had subdued a fighting Cilic on Sunday, that is what makes it all worthwhile."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/jan/28/chelsea-newcastle-united-fa-cup-fourth-round-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-28T15:49:14Z","webTitle":"Michy Batshuayi double helps Chelsea saunter past Newcastle in FA Cup","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/28/chelsea-newcastle-united-fa-cup-fourth-round-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jan/28/chelsea-newcastle-united-fa-cup-fourth-round-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Michy Batshuayi double helps Chelsea saunter past Newcastle in FA Cup","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"At the end of a stress-free victory for Antonio Conte’s men, Chelsea had safely navigated a passage into the FA Cup fifth round for the 18th time in 20 seasons and the crowd were standing to acclaim their manager after one of those intermittent periods – such is modern life at Stamford Bridge – when he has come under scrutiny for the apparent crime of not having the Premier League sewn up. Chelsea’s supporters must know the drill by now, after all these years of Abramovich rule, but this was about as comfortable as it gets for Conte’s men and another reminder, perhaps, about the chasm that exists between the teams near the top of the Premier League and those towards the other end. Newcastle were obliging opponents and, if anything, it was a surprise Chelsea did not add more goals to go with the two Michy Batshuayi scored before half-time and Marcos Alonso’s expertly taken free-kick during a second half when the away team displayed a startling lack of self-belief. For Newcastle, that makes it 12 years since they last reached the fifth round and they will have left Stamford Bridge knowing that the next time they play in this competition it will have been half a century since their ribbons fluttered from a trophy of any description. Not too many Newcastle fans remember the 1969 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup and their dissatisfaction could be heard in the form of several mutinous chants calling for an end to Mike Ashley’s ownership of the club. Those chants have become the soundtrack to Newcastle’s season and the unusually large expanse of empty seats in the away end told its own story. The early kick-off will not have helped travel arrangements but, in happier times for Newcastle, it would have been almost impossible to imagine this kind of diminished following for an FA Cup tie against the reigning league champions. The ones who did make it still managed to make a fair old racket but it was a tepid performance from Newcastle and the game followed a familiar narrative bearing in mind Rafael Benítez’s team have managed only one point out of a possible 33 from their league encounters against top-10 sides this season. It felt like deja vu but it was particularly disappointing bearing in mind their inability to find out for themselves why Chelsea have found it such heavy going recently. Conte’s men had won only two of their previous seven fixtures since the turn of the year and one of those was in a penalty shootout against Norwich City in the previous round. Yet this was a breeze for the home side and Newcastle did not have the wit or gumption to do anything about it. Instead, there was an air of inevitability once Batshuayi had followed up his first goal by letting fly just before half-time and finding his luck was in as the ball spun off Jamaal Lascelles to arch over the goalkeeper Karl Darlow and drop into the exposed net. Lascelles was unfortunate after throwing himself at the ball to block the shot but it must have been alarming for Benítez to see how easily his team had been opened up and the disruption in his back four. At least there was a touch of refinement about the buildup to the first goal and, specifically, the curling through-ball that Pedro put behind Newcastle’s defence to leave Eden Hazard with the chance to run, one‑on‑one, at Chancel Mbemba. Hazard flicked the ball inside him to Alonso and the next touch fell invitingly for Batshuayi, six yards out, to fire in from the centre of goal. Batshuayi, the subject of a possible loan move to Seville, could be on his way out of Chelsea if Edin Dzeko joins from Roma. With that deal looking unlikely given that the former Manchester City striker has yet to agree personal terms, Conte, however, has indicated that he would prefer Batshuayi to stay. Benítez spent just as long in the post-match press conference talking about his own potential transfer business – “Our fans are very clever, they know what’s going on,” he said – as he did the match itself, and Newcastle could certainly do with some more talented players. It was a subdued response in the second half and an indictment of Benítez’s team that there was not one period of play when it felt as though they genuinely believed there was any way back. Alonso curled in the third goal from 25 yards for the game’s outstanding moment and Conte made sure to substitute Hazard, N’Golo Kanté and Pedro, keeping them back for more challenging assignments."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"business/2018/jan/29/carillion-mps-accuse-pensions-watchdog-of-failing-to-act","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-29T08:06:43Z","webTitle":"Carillion: MPs accuse company of 'trying to wriggle' out of pensions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/29/carillion-mps-accuse-pensions-watchdog-of-failing-to-act","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jan/29/carillion-mps-accuse-pensions-watchdog-of-failing-to-act","fields":{"headline":"Carillion: MPs accuse company of 'trying to wriggle' out of pensions","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"MPs have accused the Pensions Regulator of failing to act while Carillion racked up debts to pay dividends and executive bonuses, as the business built up a pension deficit that reached nearly £1bn by the time it collapsed this month. The House of Commons work and pensions committee, which is investigating Carillion’s collapse into compulsory liquidation two weeks ago, criticised the Pensions Regulator for allowing Carillion’s pension trustee to defer pension deficit contributions in September in a bid to keep it afloat by enabling more borrowing. The committee’s comments came as it published a letter from Robin Ellison, chairman of Carillion (DB) Pension Trustee Limited, the trustee of six of the company’s defined-benefit pension schemes. Ellison disclosed that Carillion had regular meetings with the Pensions Regulator from 2008 onwards. Carillion collapsed with debts of £1.3bn and a host of unfinished public contracts. There are varying estimates of Carillion’s pension deficit. Ellison’s letter says the trustee valued it at £990m at the end of 2016, while the Pension Protection Fund’s valuation is £800m and the pension liability on a buy-out basis – the estimated cost for an insurance company to buy out the accrued benefits – is “nearer £2bn”. However, the regulator will focus on a figure between £800m and £990m, because no insurer is expected to take on the pension scheme liabilities. Frank Field, chair of the work and pensions committee, said: “It’s clear that Carillion has been trying to wriggle out of its obligations to its pensioners for the last 10 years. The purported cashflow problems did of course not prevent them shelling out dividends and handsome pay packets for those at the top. “This culminated in negotiating deficit contributions away entirely last autumn to enable more borrowing. Remarkably, this was endorsed by the trustees and the Pensions Regulator.” Field said the Pensions Regulator had questions to answer. “They have been sniffing around Carillion – at the trustees’ behest – since at least 2008, though it is not apparent to what effect. When 10 years later the company collapses with £29m in the bank and £2bn in pension liabilities it doesn’t look good for them.” The Pensions Regulator confirmed it had been working with Carillion and the pension scheme trustees for a number of years. “The current regulatory framework attempts to balance the needs of a scheme and its members with the needs of an employer to invest in their ongoing business – this should be reflected in the length and structure of the recovery plan. “The content of Carillion’s recovery plans, and its payment of dividends, did not highlight sufficient concern to justify the use of our powers based on the group’s trading strength as presented at the time in their audited accounts. However, it is clear from the company’s announcements since July that their underlying profitability was significantly weaker than market understanding or the position set out in prior year accounts.” The Pensions Regulator’s powers include enforcing a schedule of pension contributions, appointing independent trustees, banning trustees who are deemed substandard, and issuing improvement notices directing employers or pension schemes to tackle any problems. After analysing Ellisons’s letter, the work and pensions committee said Carillion had been “falling short” of what the trustee expected it to contribute to pension schemes since 2008. The company pointed to cashflow problems in 2011 and 2013 – but paid more than £70m in dividends in both those years. Ellison will be quizzed by MPs from the work and pensions committee and the business, energy and industrial strategy (BEIS) committee as part of their joint inquiry into Carillion’s collapse on Tuesday. Carillion ran up debts and sold assets so it could continue to pay dividends to shareholders between 2012 and 2016, according to a parliamentary paper published last week. It paid out £217m more in dividends than it generated in cash. Its debts surged from £242m to an estimated £1.3bn in the eight years to January 2018. Carillion has 13 UK defined benefit pension schemes with 27,000 members. Its pension deficit is one of the largest among FTSE 350 companies."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/blog/2018/jan/28/mind-games-sports-psychology-kyle-edmund-sean-ingle","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-28T14:00:20Z","webTitle":"Mind games promise a sporting edge but may miss the heart of the matter | Sean Ingle","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/jan/28/mind-games-sports-psychology-kyle-edmund-sean-ingle","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2018/jan/28/mind-games-sports-psychology-kyle-edmund-sean-ingle","fields":{"headline":"Mind games promise a sporting edge but may miss the heart of the matter","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Towards the end of Kyle Edmund’s breakout performance at the Australian Open, his coach Fredrik Rosengren was asked about his great leap forward. The British No 2’s improved serve and fitness had helped, the Swede acknowledged – but there was something else, too. “You have to believe you can do it in tough situations,” said Rosengren, who stressed that Edmund now had the “mindset” to go deep into grand slams. Belief. Mind over matter. Taming your inner chimp. Hang around elite sports people long enough and you will hear multiple variations on the theme. The race to run a sub-two-hour marathon, for instance, is sometimes framed as much in terms of psychology as physiology and technology. Of course, if it was that easy to trick our minds into running much faster, or making the latter stages of major tournaments, we would all be doing it. That said, how the brain affects performance is increasingly a major battleground in sports science, as Endure, a fascinating new book by the scientist and writer Alex Hutchinson, makes clear. Did you know, for instance, that doing mundane mental tasks before exercise can make people underperform? Hutchinson quotes a study by Professor Samuele Marcora where 16 volunteers spent 90 minutes either watching a bland documentary or performing dull tests on a computer before trying to maintain a certain power on a bike for as long as possible. The study found that those who did the mentally draining computer game gave up 15.1% sooner – even though the physical data showed no difference between the two groups. As Hutchinson notes: “The only difference was that, right from the very first pedal stroke, the mentally fatigued subjects reported higher levels of perceived exertion. When their brains were tired, pedalling a bike simply felt harder.” In another study 13 volunteers were paid to ride an exercise bike at a predetermined pace for as long as possible. This time, as they pedalled, a screen flashed rapid-fire images of happy or sad faces at them in 16-millisecond bursts. The cyclists who were shown happy faces rode, on average, for just over 25 minutes – three minutes more than those shown sad faces. Recent research has also suggested that smiling during races can improve running economy, while even positive “self-talk” – such as “feeling good!” – has been shown to improve performance in another cycling-to-exhaustion test: cyclists who used these phrases lasted 18% longer than a control group. Most of these studies have been conducted on amateur athletes but many in elite sport are keeping a tigerish eye on the results. Three years ago I chatted to Sir Dave Brailsford, the Team Sky principal, about his trip to Silicon Valley, which involved talking to scientists about using cranial stimulation to improve endurance capacity. “When the brain goes ‘right, I better close down and stop’, they think the cranial stimulation can override that, and allows you to compete closer to your body’s capability, which is interesting.” Such theories might sound worthy of Dr Frankenstein but they are being put to the test. Hutchinson visited Red Bull’s headquarters in California where several dozen researchers tested elite athletes “by trickling a small electric current through the brain’s motor cortex”. At one stage the triathlete Jesse Thomas had 17 devices stuck to his body and another 30 wires attached to his brain during an all-out four-kilometre cycling time trial. So far these results are inconclusive. But Ross Tucker, a world-renowned sports scientist who also studies how the brain regulates performance and physiology, is sceptical. “Even if stimulating the brain of an elite athlete who is already very near the limit of their physiology does work, it might push the physiological ‘stress’ just that little bit further, over the limit, and eventually the whole system – brain plus body – will make them pay for it,” he says, pointing to research suggesting the body also plays a significant role in the whole performance regulation process. Hutchinson also tried training his brain with Marcora’s “mind‑numbingly boring” tests before running a marathon but the results were not clear as he got injured. Tucker, though, is dubious about the benefits – pointing out that while he has heard of some “very high-profile” Tour de France cyclists trying brain training methods, they are unlikely to work in elites “because they are already at the limit of their fatigue reserves”. The boundless search for an edge also continues in other areas. As Hutchinson notes, the US Olympic BMX racing team have even tried “mindfulness” training, with their coach noting improvements in their race performance – “Their body language is calmer in the gate … they move their hands less on the bars, and they get out a little faster” – but whether such anecdotal evidence will convince everyone seems unlikely. So where does that leave us? As Tucker points out, there is no doubt that psychological factors hold many potential gains, and that belief may be one of them. In fact, you see this most clearly in its absence – a lack of self-belief that prevents an athlete from fulfilling their potential. “But the dichotomy between ‘mind’ and ‘matter’ is, I think, misleading, because ‘mind’ is intrinsically linked to the ‘matter’,” he says. “Perhaps you can say brain matter over body matter, but even that’s false, because one doesn’t function independently of the other.” In Tucker’s view once you understand this, then these simple “tricks” to bypass a regulated, integrated system start to look far less effective. Even so, it’s a surefire bet that scientists will keep pushing to find a fresh mental edge."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jan/28/trump-jay-z-interview-cnn-superbug-racism","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-28T18:26:24Z","webTitle":"Trump hits back after Jay-Z calls president 'superbug' in racism debate","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/28/trump-jay-z-interview-cnn-superbug-racism","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jan/28/trump-jay-z-interview-cnn-superbug-racism","fields":{"headline":"Trump hits back after Jay-Z calls president 'superbug' in racism debate","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Donald Trump duly hit back at Jay-Z on Sunday, after the rapper rejected the idea the Trump presidency has been good for African Americans and called the president a “superbug” in a discussion of his reported racist remarks. Jay-Z, whose real name is Shawn Carter, appeared on CNN’s The Van Jones Show on Saturday night. Asked how he felt when Trump reportedly called African countries “shitholes”, Jay-Z said: “Yes, it’s disappointing and hurtful. Everyone feels anger. After the anger, it’s really hurtful because he’s like looking down on a whole population of people.” The rapper said Trump’s reported comment – which the president has denied – was “how people talk … behind closed doors”. He then compared the remark, allegedly made in a meeting with senators, to a recorded conversation involving the then LA Clippers owner Donald Sterling which cost him control of the NBA team in 2014. Sterling’s public downfall, Jay-Z said, led “all of the other closet racists [to] just run back in the hole”. “You haven’t fixed anything,” he said. “You have sprayed perfume on the trash can. What you do when you do, that is the bugs come. You spray something and you create a superbug because you don’t take care of the problem. “You don’t take the trash out, you keep spraying whatever over it to make it acceptable. As those things grow, you create a superbug. And then now we have Donald Trump, the superbug.” Jay-Z qualified his remark by saying: “I’m being funny, I say that, too.” But he said: “Somewhere along his lineage, something happened to him. Something happened to him and he is in pain and he is expressing it this sort of way.” Jones than asked the rapper about Trump’s claim, made repeatedly on Twitter, to have dropped African American unemployment to record lows. “Does he have a point,” Jones asked, “that maybe the Democrats have been giving us good lip service, but no jobs. He may say terrible things, but putting money in our pockets. Does that make him a good leader?” Jay Z answered: “No, because it’s not about money at the end of the day … money doesn’t equate to happiness. It doesn’t. That’s missing the whole point. You treat people like human beings … that’s the main point.” On Sunday morning, the president tweeted: “Somebody please inform Jay-Z that because of my policies, Black Unemployment has just been reported to be at the LOWEST RATE EVER RECORDED!” The fact-checking website Politifact says claims by Trump and members of his administration including his daughter about African American unemployment are “right on the numbers but leave out economic gains … under Democratic control”. According to government figures, African American unemployment dropped to 6.8%, a historic low, in December 2017. But it did so, like Hispanic American unemployment, having “declined dramatically on Barack Obama’s watch”. Later on Sunday on CNN’s Reliable Sources, Jones, a former Obama adviser, commended Jay-Z and said “we had a very powerful moment there”. He added: “Apparently, Trump missed the whole point and actually walked right back into the trap. “Now it’s trending globally … look, it’s great PR for the show but it’s bad for the country when you have a president who wants to lecture an African American rapper and an African American pundit about African American issues with bad facts and no information about the show.” Trump’s remarks about black unemployment, Jones said, were “not enough to make up for ‘s-hole’ countries. That’s not enough to make up for insulting black football players, saying all of our communities are terrible”. In his interview with Jay-Z, Jones also asked if, given that Jay-Z and Beyoncé’s daughter Blue Ivy visited the Obama White House, would the couple’s new twins, Sir and Rumi, visit Trump? “No,” said Jay-Z. “Not a shot. We won’t be invited, first of all.” To Jones’s suggestion that Trump could be “the first hip-hop president”, because he was “getting beast with people … I like bling … I got a plane”, the rapper demurred. “He [Trump] doesn’t have the struggles, right?” he said. “That’s the key. That’s the key.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/jan/28/rome-return-family-memories-maro-itoje-england-six-nations","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-28T22:00:30Z","webTitle":"Rome return evokes warm family memories for England’s Maro Itoje | Gerard Meagher","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jan/28/rome-return-family-memories-maro-itoje-england-six-nations","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jan/28/rome-return-family-memories-maro-itoje-england-six-nations","fields":{"headline":"Rome return evokes warm family memories for England’s Maro Itoje","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The Six Nations is now a family affair for Maro Itoje but, as he prepares to return to the scene of his England debut to face Italy on Sunday, he has revealed it was not always the case. For one of Itoje’s most vivid memories of winning his first England cap – coming off the bench in Rome in February 2016 – is not his first touch of the ball nor the final words of wisdom from Eddie Jones but the joy it brought his father, Efe, in the crowd. It lingers in his memory because Itoje grew up watching the Six Nations – the first he recalls is 2006 – at boarding school from the age of 11 to 18, first at St George’s in Harpenden, then at Harrow, rather than at home with his family, until that Sunday afternoon in Italy broke the mould. “From the second I walked on that pitch I then became an England player, something I’d been working towards for quite a while,” Itoje said. “It was a surreal moment for me, a great day for myself and my family to enjoy. My dad came to that game and I remember seeing how happy he was. He was probably even more happy than me.” These days, however, Efe and Maro’s mother, Florence, are fully fledged rugby converts. “They absolutely live for the away days, they live for the Twickenham days,” Itoje said. “Their weekends are now built around watching rugby and it has now got to a point where it doesn’t even matter if I am not playing. They go and watch Saracens if I am playing or not. They watch England even if I am not playing.” That 40-9 win in Rome was Jones’s second game in charge of England; the coach had resisted the temptation to blood Itoje, then 21, at Murrayfield in his first. Indeed, back then, Jones repeatedly sought to temper expectations over Itoje, often bemoaning the lack of battle scars he wore, but two years on it is safe to say the Vauxhall Viva analogy has been sent to the scrapheap. Itoje now has 14 England caps as well as three for the British &amp; Irish Lions and he has lost only one Test he has started. A bruised hip has affected his preparations for this year’s Six Nations Championship and his training schedule during the national team’s Portugal camp last week was tailored accordingly. Provided Itoje comes through training this week as expected, however, there is little chance of him spending any time back on the Stadio Olimpico bench. “I probably understand the game better now. I like to think I’ve improved as a player as well,” he said. “I think I’ve matured since then. This is my third Six Nations, that was my first cap. I’ve definitely matured as a player and a person since then. But I like to think I wasn’t submissive when I came on [in 2016]. Going out there it’s about imposing myself on the game as best I can. “My attitude hasn’t really changed. For me it is always trying to push the boundaries, always try to get better and improve my own performances. It doesn’t matter if I have played my first game or whatever game, it is about getting better and trying to push your performances. It is unlikely that every game you will get better but as long as there is an upward trend you can live with it.” Last year against Italy, England found themselves 10-5 down at half‑time at Twickenham, having been ambushed by their visitors’ “no ruck” tactics. Last week, though, the defence coach, Paul Gustard, challenged his side to adopt a “hunting mentality” as they seek a record‑breaking third Six Nations crown. “We want to be the aggressors, we want to take the game by the scruff of the neck, we don’t want to be submissive in anything,” Itoje said. “There was a bit of frustration after the game [last year]. You live and you learn from it but you can’t dwell on it.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jan/28/presidents-club-scandal-bruce-ritchie-residential-land-loses-major-backer","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-28T15:28:48Z","webTitle":"Presidents Club scandal: property firm loses major backer","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jan/28/presidents-club-scandal-bruce-ritchie-residential-land-loses-major-backer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jan/28/presidents-club-scandal-bruce-ritchie-residential-land-loses-major-backer","fields":{"headline":"Presidents Club scandal: property firm loses major backer","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The property company run by a former co-chair of the Presidents Club has lost a major financial backer in the wake of the sexual harassment scandal at an all-male charity dinner. Ivanhoé Cambridge, a Canadian investment group, said it had halted further investments with Residential Land, which is owned by Bruce Ritchie. The property magnate was a trustee and one of two joint chairmen of the Presidents Club until it was disbanded last week, following the Financial Times’s revelations about a men-only fundraising dinner at the Dorchester hotel where hired hostesses were allegedly groped and sexually harassed. Ivanhoé said in a statement: “We are deeply troubled by the events and behaviours as reported by the media; they are clearly unacceptable and contrary to our core values as a global institutional investor. Under the circumstances, we have stopped future investments with the company. We will not make any further comments at this time.” Residential Land, founded by Ritchie in 1991, is one of the biggest private landlords in central London, and owns more than 1,200 homes along with hotels and Mayfair office buildings. Ivanhoé, a property firm founded in Quebec in 1953 and owned by the Canadian pension fund La Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec, was one of Ritchie’s main backers. Its decision to sever ties with Residential Land was first reported by the trade magazine Property Week. Ivanhoé entered into a £650m joint venture deal with Residential Land in February 2015. Assets bought by the fund include Hamlet Gardens in west London and 4B Merchant Square, close to Paddington station in the capital, as well as the Circus Apartments in Canary Wharf. Ritchie describes himself as “a philanthropist and benefactor of many of London’s worthy charitable institutions” on his company’s website. He has refused to confirm whether he attended this year’s Presidents Club annual dinner. Privately educated at Dulwich college, he later went on a management training scheme at Harrods department store in Knightsbridge. While working there as a sales manager, he started trading properties in Hackney in east London. By the time he left Harrods in 1986 he owned 17 properties, some of which he still owns today. When studying at Dulwich, he had been buying and selling cars in his spare time. Ritchie later became a business partner with the celebrity chef Marco Pierre White in the White Star Line restaurant group which includes Mirabelle, Quo Vadis and Criterion.

The Dutch capital last year launched an initiative to curb the number of shops targeting tourists in its historic centre in its latest attempt to reclaim it for residents. In a court case involving the Amsterdam Cheese company – which has a store on Damrak avenue, a partially filled in canal in the centre – the dominant use of English has been highlighted as a problem. The owners say they are “Dutch cheese heads” with a mission to “preserve the traditions of the past while embracing the new” and insist that English is the most accessible language to the majority of Dutch customers. The shop, whose slogan is “Say cheese to life”, was ordered to close late last year, losing their first – but not their last – appeal at the Amsterdam district court this week. The company’s advertising, products, pricing and use of the English language were said by the court to be clear indicators that the shop – one of five in the city – was there for the benefit of tourists rather than local consumers. “The official language in the shop is English,” the judge said in summary. Its owner, Quirijn Kolff, told the Guardian that English is used because it is the easiest way to communicate in the Netherlands, where over 90% of people claim it as a second language. In 2008 a city councillor even suggested that English be recognised as an official second language in official correspondence, as one in 10 of Amsterdam’s residents spoke English but no Dutch. Kolff added that he had taken a 15-year lease on the property before the law on tourist-orientated shops was announced last year. The Amsterdam Cheese company is set to appeal to a higher court, with the support of its suppliers. “If you [are] here, English is the language spoken by most people,” Kolff, said. “We are an international community, especially in Amsterdam. We communicate in English. Maybe that’s globalisation for you but this decision feels like an appeal to nativism, preaching to the base. “We are a high-end shop. We are very sympathetic to the whole discussion on liveability and there are serious issues but it isn’t relevant to us. It feels like they want to use [this] as a test case, to see if they can do this in European law, to discriminate.” While Amsterdam remains the most international of cities, the development comes amid a more general questioning of the growing dominance of English in the Netherlands. With the headline, “Stop English craziness”, the Dutch daily paper, De Telegraaf, on Friday reported comments by Pieter Duisenberg, of the Association of Universities in the Netherlands, who warned that the growing number of student lectures being delivered in English could lead to an over-representation of international students. The chairman of the Dutch National Union of Students, Tariq Sewbaransingh, said: “Except in Utrecht, all psychology studies are in English. We are concerned about the accessibility for the Dutch student, while we have a shortage of Dutch psychologists.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jan/26/ce-nest-pas-normal-french-shoppers-bra-over-discounted-nutella","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-26T11:29:47Z","webTitle":"'They are like animals': French shoppers brawl over cut-price Nutella","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/26/ce-nest-pas-normal-french-shoppers-bra-over-discounted-nutella","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jan/26/ce-nest-pas-normal-french-shoppers-bra-over-discounted-nutella","fields":{"headline":"'They are like animals': French shoppers brawl over cut-price Nutella","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"France has seen nothing like it: supermarket aisles of brawling customers throwing punches, pulling hair and shoving the elderly out of the way. A decision by the Intermarché store chain to offer a hefty discount on jars of Nutella – France’s favourite chocolate spread – caused near riots in shops around the country. Police were reportedly called as fights broke out among swarming customers grabbing 950g jars of Nutella reduced from €4.50 to €1.41, a 70% discount. In one store, a member of staff was punched in the eye while trying to separate warring customers. In another, shoppers cleared shelves in 15 minutes. “They are like animals. One woman had her hair pulled. An elderly lady took a box on her head. Another had a bloody hand,” one customer said. Queues had formed outside many Intermarché supermarkets on Thursday, reminiscent of the first days of the sales, and customers were limited to three pots each. In one Intermarché in the Moselle in eastern France, a member of staff reported: “People were piling in, they knocked everything over and broke stuff. It was an orgy … we were on the point of calling the police.” In another store, staff said they had sold in one go the number of Nutella jars normally sold in three months. “They were fighting over it … at the tills there was only Nutella,” one told Le Progrès newspaper. Until now, this type of hysterical behaviour has been viewed in France as a mostly American Black Friday phenomenon and evidence of the perils of rampant free-market consumerism. Nutella was created by the Ferrero family in Italy in the 1940s. About 365m kg of the hazelnut chocolate spread are consumed around the world every year. The company said it regretted the “promotion and its consequences”, blaming Intermarché for the chaos. In a statement, the supermarket chain said it was surprised the offer had caused battle scenes in its stores and was sorry for the “disagreeable events customers suffered”. Sophie Chevalier, a French anthropologist and specialist in customer behaviour, said the scenes were incredible. “These are unusual in France, except when there’s a particularly exceptional sale, and more what we see in developing countries or where there’s a regular shortage of essential products,” Chevalier told Le Parisien. “Would there be the same reaction to jars of pickles? Certainly not. It’s a question of the kind of product that explains this. Nutella is pure pleasure for children and to offer it at a bargain price obviously attracts lots of customers.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jan/25/trump-mueller-firing-june-white-house-counsel-quit","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-26T09:46:36Z","webTitle":"Donald Trump denies report he tried to fire Robert Mueller in June","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/25/trump-mueller-firing-june-white-house-counsel-quit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jan/25/trump-mueller-firing-june-white-house-counsel-quit","fields":{"headline":"Donald Trump denies report he tried to fire Robert Mueller in June","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Donald Trump has denied a report he ordered the firing of special counsel Robert Mueller last June, but was persuaded against it after the White House counsel threatened to resign. The New York Times, citing four people familiar with the matter, said the president ordered the White House counsel Donald McGahn to fire Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election including possible contacts with the Trump campaign. McGahn refused and said he would resign before carrying out the directive. “Fake news, folks, fake news,” Trump told reporters in Davos, when asked about the report. The report said Trump had outlined a case for why he believed Mueller should be fired, citing three conflicts of interest that disqualified him from overseeing the Russia investigations. First, Trump alleged, a dispute over membership fees at Trump National Golf Club in northern Virginia led Mueller to resign as a member in 2011. Trump saw another potential conflict because Mueller had most recently worked for the law firm that previously represented Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law. Lastly, Trump said Mueller had been interviewed to return as the FBI director the day before he was appointed special counsel. Ty Cobb, the president’s lawyer, said in a statement to the Times: “We decline to comment out of respect for the Office of the Special Counsel and its process.” A spokesman for the special counsel also declined to comment. Trump has repeatedly denied any collusion or obstruction. Senator Mark Warner, the vice-chair of the Senate intelligence committee, which is conducting its own investigation into Russian interference, warned that firing Mueller was a “red line” the president “cannot cross”. “Any attempt to remove the special counsel, pardon key witnesses, or otherwise interfere in the investigation, would be a gross abuse of power, and all members of Congress, from both parties, have a responsibility to our constitution and to our country to make that clear immediately,” Warner said in a statement responding to the story. The report follows developments that the special counsel interviewed attorney general Jeff Sessions for several hours last week. Sessions announced in March 2017 that he would recuse himself from any role in it after it was revealed that he had two meetings with Sergey Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to the United States, during the 2016 campaign. The former Alabama senator endorsed Trump in February 2016 and was a key surrogate during the campaign. It was also reported this week that former FBI director James Comey was interviewed by the special counsel as part of the ongoing investigation into Russian meddling. Trump fired Comey in May 2017, raising concerns that he tried to obstruct the FBI investigation into his campaign’s contacts with Russians. Comey reportedly met last year with the special counsel to answer questions about contemporaneous memos he wrote regarding interactions with the president that concerned him. In one instance, Comey testified, Trump asked him for loyalty and asked him to drop an investigation into Michael Flynn, his former national security adviser. Comey said he evaded those demands and was soon fired. Earlier this week, the New York Times- reported that the special counsel was seeking to interview Trump about the president’s decision to fire Flynn and Comey. Mueller’s reported focus on their firings is the latest indication that the special counsel’s team is zeroing in on potential obstruction of justice issues. Trump on Wednesday told reporters he was “looking forward” to speaking with Mueller, ending months of speculation about whether he would submit to an interview. “I would love to do it,” Trump told reporters in the room, adding that an interview could occur within two to three weeks."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jan/25/kurds-call-on-syrian-regime-to-intervene-in-afrin-battle","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-25T22:55:46Z","webTitle":"Kurds call on Syrian regime to intervene in Afrin battle","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/25/kurds-call-on-syrian-regime-to-intervene-in-afrin-battle","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jan/25/kurds-call-on-syrian-regime-to-intervene-in-afrin-battle","fields":{"headline":"Kurds call on Syrian regime to intervene in Afrin battle","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Kurdish militias fighting against Turkey in the Syrian enclave of Afrin have called on the government of Bashar al-Assad to intervene and protect the area’s borders. The latest development, nearly a week into Turkey’s military offensive, could undermine Kurdish aspirations for self-governance and, if heeded, could set the stage for a direct military confrontation between Ankara and Damascus. It could also create an open alliance between the US-backed Kurdish forces and a government that Washington had sought to unseat for years. “While we insist that we will continue to defend Afrin against rabid external attacks and will confront the Turkish attempts at occupying Afrin, we invite the Syrian state to carry out its sovereign duties towards Afrin and to protect its borders with Turkey from attack,” the autonomous authority governing Afrin said in a statement on Thursday. Ankara launched a military offensive into Afrin spearheaded by its Syrian rebel allies on Saturday in order to oust the People’s Protection Units (YPG) from the Kurdish enclave, which borders Turkey. The government of Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has seethed over the support of the US-led coalition against Isis for the YPG, which led the ground campaign to drive Islamic State from northern Syria. Turkey considers the YPG and its affiliates as the Syrian wing of the Kurdistan Workers party (PKK), a designated terrorist group that has fought a decades-long insurgency against the Turkish state. The Afrin offensive was launched after the US announced it wanted to build a 30,000 strong border guard to patrol Syria’s frontiers that would include members of the YPG, a prospect that Turkey considers a major national security threat. A Turkish foreign ministry official declined to comment on the YPG announcement – or on whether Turkey would fight Syrian government forces if they intervened in Afrin. The Syrian government did not comment, but has condemned Turkey’s intervention as a violation of sovereignty. The Afrin statement is another twist to the Syrian crisis. The YPG and its political arm have long sought to establish an autonomous, self-governing canton in northern Syria, so its calls for a direct intervention by Assad’s government is a setback for those aspirations. The YPG had often publicly positioned itself as anti-Assad, pointing to the rampant discrimination and abuses against the Syrian Kurds by the state, which had long denied them identity papers and other rights. But the militia and its political arms have been accused of cooperating closely with the regime. The call is also an indication of the Kurdish militias’ anger that the US and Russia have been unable to deter Turkey. The US, which has directly armed the YPG and provided the air cover for the ground operations in Raqqa, has done little apart from urging Turkey to exercise self-restraint in an effort to repair damaged relations with Ankara. Moscow, which has occasionally cooperated with the Kurds and often insists that they should have a seat at the table in peace negotiations, allowed Ankara to use the airspace above Afrin to conduct the campaign. It is unclear if the Syrian government will answer Kurdish calls for an intervention, and whether Turkey would halt its operation if that happened or engage in direct hostilities with the regime. However, such a development could lead to a broader crisis that would endanger peace talks and draw in Assad’s allies, Russia and Iran."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/jan/26/bert-van-marwijk-why-has-ffa-again-opted-for-philosophical-opposite-of-predecessor","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-25T22:51:49Z","webTitle":"Bert van Marwijk: why has FFA again opted for philosophical opposite of predecessor? | Ante Jukic","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/26/bert-van-marwijk-why-has-ffa-again-opted-for-philosophical-opposite-of-predecessor","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jan/26/bert-van-marwijk-why-has-ffa-again-opted-for-philosophical-opposite-of-predecessor","fields":{"headline":"Bert van Marwijk: why has FFA again opted for philosophical opposite of predecessor?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Uninspiring, pragmatic, Dutch. These three words have dominated the initial response to Bert van Marwijk’s hire as Socceroos coach for this year’s World Cup. The 65-year-old is all three of those things, granted. Fundamentally, he will be an ideological departure from what Ange Postecoglou sought to implement. Examining Van Marwijk’s recent coaching history has worth in this discussion, but it’s also missing the point to a degree – this doesn’t relate to the fatuous narrative of Football Federation Australia’s Dutch crutch in times of uncertainty and the conspicuously early timing of official statement. What has been lost in the reactionary noise: why did Australian football get here? Why is the Socceroos coach again a philosophical opposite to his predecessor? We must remember, before Postecoglou came Holger Osieck, who was widely criticised by the Australian football media for a prosaic approach by the end of his tenure. Then Postecoglou, initially lauded for his “never take a backwards step” ethos, has ultimately been viewed as too cavalier in the search for attacking balance. Where Postecoglou found trouble on a tactical basis was the nature of Australia’s possession, not possession itself. Tactical discussion descended into counter-productive and scared ideas; reverting to a four-man defence was the most notable among them. The reality remains, despite aesthetic differences between Postecoglou and Osieck, they were both chased out of the door at the first point of wider discomfort. Though potentially short, Van Marwijk’s hire alarmingly reflects the Australian game’s state of perpetual chaos. This impulsive lack of continuity from an ideological standpoint also hints at a misunderstanding of the game itself, because at its core lies risk. In football, attack or defence cannot eliminate the threat of the other, but only attempt to minimise it. Although Van Marwijk might also fit FFA’s financial criteria, with Australia’s group at this year’s showpiece in context, this reversal in ideology becomes all the more perplexing. Speculating on the composition of Australia’s squad in June is futile but what is likely, given the coach’s track record, they will revert to a 4-2-3-1 formation and absorb pressure. This tactical tenet was the basis upon which the Netherlands built a path to the World Cup final in 2010, with battering rams in Mark van Bommel and Nigel de Jong at the base of midfield, bullying both the opposition and Dutch football history. It was little different for Saudi Arabia’s qualification for this year’s edition, despite benefitting from the Socceroos’ blips against Thailand and Iraq earlier in the second group stage. No group is easy at the World Cup and progression to the knockout stages is never a guarantee, but Australia’s group is still a relatively favourable one. Despite Fifa rankings, none of the Socceroos’ opponents could be called the strongest from their respective pots. France have an abundance of attacking talent in Paul Pogba, Ousmane Dembélé and the relentlessly vertical Kylian Mbappé but in Uefa’s qualification phase, they scored the second-lowest amount of goals (18) out of group winners, just ahead of Iceland (16). Les Bleus’ struggles with fluidity have been at times offset by Antoine Griezmann’s movement centrally, but coach Didier Deschamps’ tactical apprehension has benefitted the rigid likes of N’Golo Kanté, Blaise Matuidi and Moussa Sissoko in midfield – at the expense of Corentin Tolisso. Meanwhile, robust striking options in Olivier Giroud and Kevin Gameiro have been favoured as the more dynamic Alexandre Lacazette remains on the outer. Outside of Pione Sisto on the left flank, Denmark are physical and very much reliant on the majestic Christian Eriksen, with Thomas Delaney merely industrious on his best day. Åge Hareide’s switch to Andreas Cornelius and Nicolai Jørgensen as attacking pivots late in the qualification phase – as Yussuf Poulsen shifted wide – has only reinforced this. Although Peru’s return from a 36-year absence at the World Cup is no doubt a welcome one, they’re realistically not a better side than Australia’s most recent incarnation, irrespective of whether Paolo Guerrero plays or not. Overall, the Socceroos have no logical reason to fear their opponents in Russia, but risk could be unnecessarily heightened through Van Marwijk’s fundamentally reactive strategy. The overwhelming pressure that aided Postecoglou’s departure from the Australian national team was rooted in risk-aversion. Consequently, how can risk-aversion be alleviated by shifting to Van Marwijk’s tactical principles, bowing to innately flawed opposition in Russia? If at all? It will suit the Dutchman just fine, but he will eventually be judged on his results over what could potentially be a short reign. There’s not much wrong with that in isolation, but it’s a disproportionately small sample that can impact the future direction of Australian football on a greater scale. With the latter in mind, it is hard to ignore why Van Marwijk was hired to begin with, as opposed to how."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jan/27/protest-set-for-texas-wildlife-refuge-at-ground-zero-of-trumps-border-wall-plan","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-27T12:00:06Z","webTitle":"Protest set for Texas wildlife refuge at ground zero of Trump's border wall plan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/27/protest-set-for-texas-wildlife-refuge-at-ground-zero-of-trumps-border-wall-plan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jan/27/protest-set-for-texas-wildlife-refuge-at-ground-zero-of-trumps-border-wall-plan","fields":{"headline":"Protest set for Texas wildlife refuge at ground zero of Trump's border wall plan","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"As politicians in Washington quarrel over funding for border security, a protest rally is planned for Saturday at the Texas wildlife centre that is set to be one of the first locations of Donald Trump’s wall. This year marks the 75th anniversary of the Santa Ana national wildlife refuge, a 2,088-acre site by the Rio Grande river that is festooned with Spanish moss and a haven for migratory birds, butterflies and ocelots. But campaigners fear the sanctuary will be wrecked if the government builds a giant barrier through it. “It’s one of the most biodiverse refuges in the United States,” said Scott Nichol of the Sierra Club, an environmental advocacy organisation that is one of the groups holding the event in a field adjacent to the refuge. Ocelots – small, spotted wild cats – are endangered in the US because of habitat destruction and Nichol fears that a wall would trap them, not only restricting their movement but killing them if the area floods during a storm. “That basically turns the refuge into a death trap, the waters rise and the animals all drown,” he said. The possible 150ft “enforcement zone” around a barrier would also be disastrous for wildlife, he said, causing vegetation to be cleared and replaced by gravel paths used by US border patrol vehicles and brightly lit at all hours. The Rio Grande valley, home to about 1.4 million people, is by far the busiest section of the south-west frontier in terms of migrant apprehensions by the border patrol, which indicates that it is also the most popular region for unauthorised crossings. In south Texas, the Rio Grande river makes for a natural border, but some parts are also closed off by levees and more than 50 miles of fencing, which often lies far north of the official demarcation between the US and Mexico. The Trump administration intends to expand and fortify that barrier network, with Santa Ana acting as a “pilot project” that would see an 18ft bollard fence, built on top of a concrete wall, to replace an existing levee. But for its most ambitious plans, the government must obtain land itself in some places, and taking private property, through a process known as eminent domain, can be time-consuming and costly for the government. Efrén Olivares of the Texas Civil Rights Project, who is scheduled to speak at the rally, said that of more than 300 cases filed that relate to existing fencing, about 70 have been pending for a decade. The privately run National Butterfly Center, roughly 20 miles west of Santa Ana, also abuts the Rio Grande. It is suing the Department of Homeland Security, alleging that last summer the government clandestinely began preparing to construct a wall through the centre, in violation of property rights and environmental assessment obligations. Building on its own land is a far simpler process for the federal government, though, potentially giving Trump a quick victory as the president seeks to show he is making good on a core campaign promise. “If they had the money for it they technically, legally, could start doing anything because the land already belonged to the federal government, so if they want to destroy a natural reserve they could waive all the laws,” Olivares said. Citing a need to expedite its mission of enhancing border security, the Department of Homeland Security can assert the right to bypass legal requirements such as conducting environmental impact assessments. It used this for barrier projects near San Diego last year, and near El Paso this week. In addition to environmental worries, some Texas activists are worried about the practical and psychological impacts of an increasingly militarised border. They are also disturbed that border funding is being used in Washington as a bargaining chip in the battle over the future of the Daca programme, created by Barack Obama to protect hundreds of thousands of undocumented young people."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jan/26/gunshots-stabbing-sydney-maroubra-police","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-26T22:49:43Z","webTitle":"Police officer in serious condition after Maroubra stabbing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jan/26/gunshots-stabbing-sydney-maroubra-police","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jan/26/gunshots-stabbing-sydney-maroubra-police","fields":{"headline":"Police officer in serious condition after Maroubra stabbing","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A senior New South Wales police officer is in a serious but stable condition after he was stabbed twice by an alleged child sex offender he was attempting to arrest. The 45-year-old officer, named in reports as Detective Sergeant John Breda, was stabbed in the chest and abdomen in the beer garden of the busy Maroubra Junction Hotel on Australia Day afternoon. The man who stabbed him, Nick Newman, was shot by two other police and died at the scene. Newman, 33, was wanted for alleged child sex offences, police say. The officer who was stabbed was rushed to St Vincents Hospital in a critical condition, where he had emergency surgery. Assistant Commissioner Mark Walton said the two other officers who were involved in the incident were “traumatised”. NSW police said they attended the hotel just after 3pm “as a part of an ongoing investigation”. Speaking to reporters on Friday evening, Assistant Commissioner Mark Walton said the officer had been stabbed in the chest and abdomen. He had undergone emergency surgery at St Vincent’s hospital. Walton said detectives had approached Newman in the beer garden of the hotel, and he stabbed the officer as they tried to arrest him. The two other detectives then shot the man, who died at the scene. “This was a relatively routine situation but unfortunately it’s escalated into a serious outcome,” Walton said. He said the senior officer was “very well regarded by his peers” and other officers who witnessed the incident were traumatised. On Thursday police had said they were searching for Newman, who was wanted on an arrest warrant for child sex offences, and was scheduled to appear at Penrith local court on 24 January. Walton confirmed that a critical incident team from the Homicide Squad would investigate the incident, and the investigation would be subject to independent review. Multiple police crews responded to the initial reports from the south-eastern Sydney suburb. Pedro Casemiro was walking to the gym across the road from the hotel when he heard police cars rush past with sirens blaring. He said he walked onto Maroubra Road in time to see scores of police officers running into the pub. “Ten seconds later a lot of policemen started running around the hotel,” he said. “The guys at the hotel said someone is shot, someone is dead.” A nearby business owner said one of his customers heard the gunshots. “One of my customers said someone was shot dead,” he said. Businesses were closed in the immediate area, with parts of Maroubra Road taped off, while dozens of officers remained in place outside the pub. “I was just working ... all of a sudden I hear about four or five gunshots next door,” a witness told radio 2GB. “I look up, I go outside, there’s all these sirens there and I see a guy come out in handcuffs and another guy in a stretcher.” Hamid Farajollahi who lives nearby to the hotel said he heard what sounded like gunshots just after 3pm. “About 10 or 15 minutes later I was walking past the hotel and there were maybe seven or eight police cars directing people to move away. When I asked the locals what happened they said there’d been a stabbing,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/27/how-i-fell-in-love-with-le-sissman","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-26T21:18:30Z","webTitle":"How I fell in love with L E Sissman | Tony Peyser","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/27/how-i-fell-in-love-with-le-sissman","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/27/how-i-fell-in-love-with-le-sissman","fields":{"headline":"How I fell in love with LE Sissman","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"MEN PAST 40 GET UP NIGHTS And look out At city lights, Wondering where they Made the wrong Turn, and why life Is so long. I had this poem – eight lines, 25 words – thumb-tacked to my dorm room wall when I entered UC Berkeley. It’s a tad on the depressing side but I was kind of a forlorn freshman. Nonetheless, this reveals how poems are capable of expressing not just profound thoughts and deep emotions but entire worlds with remarkable brevity. I remember thinking, “If this is what poetry is, I’m in.” It should come as no great surprise that this poem was written by John Updike. Years passed, as they so often do, and I tried to get the nerve to write poems, enter them in competitions and send them to publishers. Along the way, I read every book of poetry Updike wrote. I enjoyed the free verse that hogged the front of these volumes but actually preferred the rhymed, light verse he relegated to the back of the books. Curiously, I never found this poem in any of his collections. By 2009, a few poems of mine had been accepted in some literary magazines. I felt I was on my way but certainly not yet in a big way. This was also the year that Updike died and his last book of poems, Endpoint, was published. These two events meant 1) no more Updike poems, and 2) Updike didn’t write that cherished poem: it wasn’t in this book either. Luckily, at this point in the story, the internet was a viable entity and I turned to it to find the poem’s elusive author. “Turned to” doesn’t do justice to my task: I willed it to get this job done. And it did. It turns out this is part of a three-part poem of short poems called Small Space. The other two aren’t worth mentioning. It is only the first one that shines like neon, which has become known (and loved) by its first three words: Men Past 40. So who wrote it? A guy who wore many hats named LE Sissman. Born in 1928 in Detroit, he was a national spelling bee champion at 13 in 1941. He went to Harvard in his mid-teens, got kicked out but came back and became class poet. In addition to a successful career as a pre-Mad Men ad guy, he wrote for the New Yorker, the Atlantic and his work was also in Harper’s Magazine. A collection of his Atlantic essays (Innocent Bystander: The Scene From the 70s) was published in 1975. Oh, and there were three collections of poems, one of which (Hello, Darkness: Collected Poems) won the National Book Critics Circle Award in 1978. Sissman surely would have written far more if he hadn’t died from Hodgkin’s lymphoma in 1976. The guy who mournfully wrote Men Past 40 never made it to 50. Because of his spelling bee skills, Sissman had an astonishing vocabulary, which was abundantly on display in his poems. Because of his Madison Avenue work, he had a passion for all the things he saw being sold to 20th century Americans. This provides Sissman’s poems with a keen sense of time, place and commerce. Sissman did write about how he died but also about how he lived. One of my favourite lines (from Tears At Korvette’s) is, “Inevitably, in Fifth Avenue/The past comes up to strike me like a rake/Stepped on in innocence.” It’s also worth passing along that one of his biggest fans (and best friends) was the aforementioned Mr Updike.

She’s terrified but, when she admits that to the marine biologist leading the expedition, the scientist says there’s no reason to worry – after all, no one’s died in that vessel for years. Raised on the Canadian prairies by a scientist father and an artist mother, Alanna Mitchell carved space for herself as a storyteller: a science journalist on a mission to marry fact with narrative. She loved the feeling of finding the perfect hook for readers. And when, despite her lifelong fear of water, she fell into an under-reported story about rising ocean temperatures, diminished coral spawning (she calls it “coral orgies”) and global warming, that mission never felt more important. And now she’s testing out her storytelling skills in a new medium – theatre – to see if we can collectively halt the Earth’s imminent mass extinctions of ocean life. She has turned her best-selling 2008 book of the same name into a stage show and she is the star. Being a performer was never Mitchell’s plan – certainly appearing at Sydney festival wasn’t in any version of the future she could foresee. Mitchell never wanted to unlock the secrets of the ocean, either; before she was side-tracked by a marine expedition, she was planning to follow Charles Darwin’s footsteps through the Galapagos Islands, walking the trails and studying the land. But there she is on a Carriageworks stage, starring in a one-woman show. She’s uncomfortable, she says, with being central to this story. It goes against all of her journalistic instincts. But she understands the way stories work: that with herself at the centre, an outsider on a quest for knowledge, we can take that journey with her. After all, a hero’s journey is one of the oldest narrative structures in the world, crossing culture and language barriers, shaping our myths and histories. It’s Jason and the Argonauts; it’s Star Wars; it’s Harry Potter. So here’s another: Mitchell, with her colourful scarf, sensible shoes and self-effacing demeanour, is suddenly thrust into a position of oceanic guardianship. Can she help save the planet’s crucial lifeline from decline and death, through the power of theatre? Rising ocean temperatures and poor marine health, she says, can be mitigated. But we first need to understand how we got to this point. Mitchell speaks only as loudly as she needs to be heard and her presence is droll and refreshingly unpretentious. This isn’t a lecture about the catastrophic repercussions of burning fossil fuels, or a guilt trip about how we’re to blame for the state of the Great Barrier Reef. Instead, it’s an unravelling – an unveiling – of a crisis; a clear-eyed pathway toward comprehension and a knitting together of the important, largely siloed work of marine biologists across the world. Her monologue is lightly theatricalised with ambient sound, lighting and a little chemistry set magic. That’s all we need – along with Mitchell’s knack of delivering fact-heavy science with clarity and colloquial phrasing to help bear the weight – to be mesmerised. Mitchell’s information is compelling, her tone reassuring and her self-acknowledgements wry and empathetic. Can you end a story about a human-made catastrophe with a note of hope? Using the hero’s journey model, Mitchell finds one: the knowledge she’s gained from studying watery dead spots, ancient fish and plankton leads her to leave us with a gentle provocation, a way to break the stubborn human blockage that prevents some of us from admitting that we’ve harmed the Earth. Why don’t we try forgiveness? After all, we have to own what we’ve done in order to be able to fix it. This might be the most pragmatic use of the concept of forgiveness in the world and it could only come from Mitchell: someone who sees the writing on the wall but still believes in the power of a happy ending. • Sea Sick was part of About an Hour, a schedule of short plays that runs at Sydney festival until 28 January"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2018/jan/26/dutch-call-on-indonesia-to-investigate-reports-of-mass-graves-and-war-wrecks","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-26T03:07:02Z","webTitle":"Dutch call on Indonesia to investigate reports of mass graves and war wrecks","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/26/dutch-call-on-indonesia-to-investigate-reports-of-mass-graves-and-war-wrecks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jan/26/dutch-call-on-indonesia-to-investigate-reports-of-mass-graves-and-war-wrecks","fields":{"headline":"Dutch call on Indonesia to investigate reports of mass graves and war wrecks","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Netherlands has pressed Indonesia to investigate reports that the remains of Dutch sailors from illegally salvaged second world war shipwrecks off its coast were dumped in a mass grave. The request comes after reports earlier this month that human remains were recovered from three Dutch shipwrecks, sunk during the decisive 1942 Battle of the Java Sea. The remains were buried in an unmarked grave on eastern Java, according to an Indonesian investigative website. The reports also said the remains of British sailors had been recovered from British wrecks. In recent years a series of huge wrecks have been all but removed from the waters off Indonesia by operators seeking to cash in on the valuable metals on board. The ships that have been dismantled or vanished included the Royal Navy destroyer HMS Electra, on which 119 men perished, HMS Exeter, a 175-metre heavy cruiser on which 54 died, and HMS Encounter, which was scuttled to avoid capture by the Japanese. More than 900 Dutch and 250 Indo-Dutch sailors died during the Battle of the Java Sea, in which the Allied navies suffered a disastrous defeat by the Imperial Japanese Navy. “The unconfirmed information from the recent reports, for instance about human remains ... will have to be investigated further locally,” Dutch Defence Minister Ank Bijleveld said. “The investigation is needed to ascertain whether there’s a link to the three Dutch warships,” she said in a letter to the Dutch parliament, published Thursday. Bijleveld said the Dutch ambassador met Indonesian officials about the issue and would speak to the transport minister. “The Indonesian authorities confirmed they were looking into the reports and will see whether new information comes to light ... and will inform us if it does,” Bijleveld said, adding “it’s too early to speculate about the outcome of an investigation”. Indonesian Navy spokesman Gig Jonias Mozes Sipasulta declined to comment to AFP on the reports. “I have nothing to add on this matter,” he said. Last week, Bijleveld said an initial probe by Dutch and Indonesian experts into the disappearance of the shipwrecks had provided “no definitive answers”. But some angry Dutch parliamentarians fired back that her response left the impression “that the culprits will never be found,” the daily tabloid De Telegraaf reported. Indonesia initially refused to take the blame for the missing ships, saying it had not been asked to protect the wrecks and therefore was not responsible for them, but later agreed to work with the Netherlands. Amateur divers discovered the long-lost wrecks of three Dutch warships in 2002, 60 years after they sank in the major naval clash. But an international expedition that sailed to the site ahead of the 75th anniversary of the battle was shocked to discover those wrecks and others had gone missing. Experts say salvaging operations are rife throughout Indonesia, varying from large commercial operations using cranes and platforms to smaller ventures shipping scrap to dealers along Indonesia’s thousands of kilometres of coastline."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/feb/19/how-we-made-peppa-pig","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-19T18:36:37Z","webTitle":"How we made Peppa Pig","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/feb/19/how-we-made-peppa-pig","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/feb/19/how-we-made-peppa-pig","fields":{"headline":"How we made Peppa Pig","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Phil Davies, producer Animation is a slow, laborious process. I’m way too impatient for it. I want a lunch and a life. So, after studying animation at Middlesex University, I became a producer instead. However, two guys I met there – Mark Baker and Neville Astley – stuck at it. By 2000, things had become very hand-to-mouth for them: they’d make an animated film, pitch another, then make it. So we decided to do something together and Peppa was one of our ideas. I was shocked at how poor some children’s animation was. Not just the production values – the stories didn’t even seem to have a beginning, middle or end. A lot of it was completely incomprehensible and all the girls were either princesses or ballerinas. So we made Peppa a four-year-old child and told the whole series from her perspective. She has a red dress because she has a slightly fiery personality. Parents tell us Peppa is too cheeky – someone in the Australian parliament said she was peddling a warped feminist agenda. But if she was a boy character no one would be saying that. Why is it that a girl has to be an anodyne, sweet, pink thing? We’re lucky that all of us came from stable homes: we remember how the world was when we were four. Anything you could think of could be made into an episode – the first one was about jumping in muddy puddles. They all come from simple ideas: her grandparents have a pet parrot called Polly; she goes on a boat trip; she has a pen pal ... My daughter is an ice skater and we thought it would be fun to have Peppa go ice skating. I used to be a mad pilot, so aeroplanes turn up in episodes every now and again. A friend of Mark’s, Lily Snowden-Fine, voiced Peppa. She was three or four. The recording sessions were very entertaining – I used to come in and find her hiding under the recording desk playing with dolls. We just got her to repeat short lines. Four-year-olds make wonderful mistakes and mispronounce words – my favourite line in the whole series is when Lily/Peppa says to her friend, “I think your heart’s a bit loose, you need to put a plaster on it.” When people with young kids find out I’ve got something to do with Peppa, they get a bit starstruck. You get a small window into what it must be like to be an actor or rock star. Mark Baker, co-creator When Peppa came out, there were a lot of children’s characters that didn’t really have a family, or parents. Our experience was that children don’t like laughing at themselves, but do like laughing at their parents. By having a Mummy and Daddy Pig, we could get humour in without having to laugh at the child character. Animal stories are good for children because they give you licence – a pig is allowed to be messy – and animation works because it’s one step removed from reality, so children feel safe watching it. Everything that went on around us and happened to our children would be sucked up into the stories. In some ways you feel guilty – you’re always listening out. Lily, the four-year-old who voiced Peppa, once had a rash, and was told she shouldn’t scratch it. So she walked to the front door of her house, crouched down, and scratched. Her mother said, “You said you weren’t going to do that,” and she said, “No, it’s OK, I’m doing it secretly.” That child logic – you can’t invent it. We always hoped it would be successful, but at a certain point we got fed up and wanted to do something else. We’d go to meetings with other ideas, but they just wanted 3,000 more episodes of Peppa. It’s like Daniel Craig doing Bond again – he must fight with it, but in the end he does it. The natural thing as an animator is to assume you’ll be broke, so it’s still surprising to go into a shop and see a product we weren’t aware was being developed. It’s odd to think there are people making a living out of Peppa who we’ve never met. We thought we might be creatively successful, but never thought we would be running a proper company, and be responsible for other people’s lives. People having their mortgages paid by our creation – that’s bizarre. • Peppa Pig: My First Cinema Experience is out on DVD."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2018/jan/26/hottest-100-crib-notes-whos-set-to-sweep-the-countdown","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-26T00:28:42Z","webTitle":"Hottest 100 crib notes: who's set to sweep the countdown?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jan/26/hottest-100-crib-notes-whos-set-to-sweep-the-countdown","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/jan/26/hottest-100-crib-notes-whos-set-to-sweep-the-countdown","fields":{"headline":"Hottest 100 crib notes: who's set to sweep the countdown?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"This year, for the first time since 2004, Triple J’s Hottest 100 won’t be held on 26 January. After a long campaign by Indigenous activists and supporters, and a nationwide survey of its listeners, the broadcaster announced in November that the date of its annual countdown would be moving permanently to the fourth Saturday of January. Conservative media was outraged. Triple M, somewhat embarrassingly, launched its own Australia Day countdown. But, by and large, the world continued to turn. Hotly tipped to take out first place in this year’s poll is the US rapper Kendrick Lamar with HUMBLE., the lead single from his widely acclaimed 2017 record, DAMN. In 2015’s Hottest 100, Lamar’s King Kunta was bested only by the Australian group the Rubens; this year, if anyone can beat him, it’ll be Aria champs Gang of Youths. The band’s second album, Go Farther In Lightness, was one of the station’s most-played records of 2017; expect to hear a lot of frontman Dave Le’aupepe’s voice come Saturday. The Hottest 100 has historically been unkind to women but last year’s top five included Amy Shark, Tash Sultana and Montaigne – and in a year when some of the highest profile women of the Australian music industry said #MeNoMore to discrimination and harassment, you could be hearing more female voices in this year’s countdown too. As ever, we’ll be hearing a lot from rising Australian stars. Here are notes on five of them, to help you bluff your way through the barbecue. Methyl Ethel Track: Ubu Perth’s Methyl Ethel broke through to the big leagues early last year with their single Ubu, which, according to the Hottest 100 predictors at 100 Warm Tunas, is a favourite to place in the top 10. Comprised of Jake Webb, Chris Wright, Thom Stewart and Hamish Rahn, Methyl Ethel had a banner 2017, including multiple sold-out shows in Sydney and Melbourne off the back of their second album, Everything Is Forgotten. Ubu is a five-minute piece of psych-pop that hinges on one of the catchiest (or most monotonous, depending on who you ask) Australian pop hooks in recent memory: the phrase “Why’d you have to go and cut your hair?” repeated in a wormy falsetto. The track is one of the weirder songs set to place in the countdown and lives up to the strangeness of its namesake: Alfred Jarry’s 1896 absurdist play Ubu Roi. Key lyrics: “Why’d you have to go and cut your hair?” What’s next: With no shows planned for the immediate future, Webb is already at work on the next record. Camp Cope Track: The Opener The Melbourne three-piece Camp Cope made headlines over new year’s, after calling out Falls festival for not having enough women in key spots on their line-up – while on stage at Falls festival. The trio, comprised of frontwoman Georgia Maq, drummer Sarah Thompson and bassist Kelly-Dawn Hellmrich, make raw, fiery punk music that feels of a piece with our current moment in culture and politics. In many ways, they have become the unofficial faces of the Australian music industry’s fight against sexism. The Opener, the lead single from Camp Cope’s sophomore record, rallies against sexism and misogyny in the industry, taking shots at the men who have dared to question their credibility as a punk band. Much like AB Original’s January 26 last year, it feels like The Opener’s political bent could also attract voters who might not ordinarily listen to music like this. Key lyrics: “It’s another man telling us we can’t fill up the room / It’s another man telling us to book a smaller venue” What’s next: After the March release of their second album, How To Socialise &amp; Make Friends, Camp Cope will tour Australia with US band Chastity Belt. Baker Boy Track: Marryuna (featuring Yirrmal) Known as the “fresh young prince” of Arnhem Land, the Melbourne-based rapper Baker Boy, born Danzal Baker, hit the ground running in 2017 with his tracks Cloud 9 and Marryuna: two tracks uploaded to Triple J Unearthed that resulted in wins at the National Indigenous Music Awards, heavy radio play and a contract with the prestigious booking agency Select Music. Baker, a professional dancer, began rapping when he noticed that there were few Australian hip-hop artists who rapped in language. Marryuna, a collaboration between Baker and his cousin Yirrmal, has racked up nearly 500,000 Spotify plays in little over three months; will his huge fanbase land his first two singles in this year’s countdown too? Key lyrics: “I’m a proud black Yolngu boy with the killer flow / Listen to the yidaki, listen to it blow” What’s next: Baker is set to play the Melbourne edition of Laneway festival next month, before two huge national support slots – opening first for 50 Cent and then Dizzee Rascal. Alex Lahey Track: I Haven’t Been Taking Care of Myself While the Melbourne singer-songwriter Alex Lahey isn’t exactly a newbie (her single You Don’t Think You Like People Like Me placed at 97 in last year’s Hottest 100), she’s due for some big wins this year. Known for her witty, heart-on-sleeve lyrics and pop-calibre hooks, Lahey’s star has risen quite significantly in the past year, with indie bellwethers Pitchfork and Stereogum praising her debut album, I Love You Like A Brother, and Canadian sibling duo Tegan and Sara hand-picking Lahey as support for their European tour. There’s something deeply endearing about Lahey’s music, which doesn’t feel beholden to what’s cool. Instead, her songs can be funny and relatable, or, on a song like I Haven’t Been Taking Care of Myself, kind of devastating. Key lyrics: “I’ve gained weight and I drink too much, maybe that’s why you don’t love me as much” What’s next: Lahey is set to embark on her Huge and True national tour later this year. Angie McMahon Track: Slow Mover The Melbourne singer-songwriter Angie McMahon could be one of the freshest voices in Saturday’s countdown with Slow Mover, her debut single, released just a few months ago. McMahon has a deep, clear voice that’s immediately striking, recalling Angel Olsen and Missy Higgins, and Slow Mover sounds like an Australian classic, likely to appeal to older listeners as well as Triple J’s core demographic. And for a debut single, it’s done great numbers: just under 1.4 million Spotify plays already. She might be just on the bubble’s surface at the moment but, if Slow Mover cracks tomorrow’s top 20, McMahon could find herself squarely in the centre of it. Key lyrics: “What are we doing in the street? / I don’t want to buy fried chicken / I wish that I was going to sleep” What’s next: McMahon is set to play Melbourne Laneway festival, before heading out on a 17-date tour with Angus &amp; Julia Stone through April and May."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jan/26/new-australian-flag-design-gets-rid-of-the-union-jack","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-26T01:05:57Z","webTitle":"Malcolm Turnbull says Australian flag will never change, rejecting new design","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jan/26/new-australian-flag-design-gets-rid-of-the-union-jack","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jan/26/new-australian-flag-design-gets-rid-of-the-union-jack","fields":{"headline":"Malcolm Turnbull says Australian flag will never change, rejecting new design","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Australia’s flag will never change, Malcolm Turnbull has said, dismissing a new design that drops the Union Jack. The not-for-profit group Ausflag released a new design on Friday, telling Australia it was time to “grow up” and shed symbols of British dominance. The group’s executive director, Harold Scruby, rejected criticism of the timing of its release, saying Australia Day was the perfect opportunity for such a debate. “For those idiots who tell us we shouldn’t be debating it on this day, it’s the lowest form of censorship,” Scruby, told Guardian Australia. “On what day should we debate it? Maybe Bastille Day? Or American Independence Day?” The new design makes a simple but fundamental change to the flag. The Union Jack is dropped, replaced with the Commonwealth Star and an enlarged Southern Cross, against a dark navy background. Ausflag described the design as minimalist and “evolutionary”, celebrating egalitarianism over aristocracy, and independence over dominance. Scruby said the current flag symbolised Australia as a British colony. “The first point is we need Specsavers because we, as a nation, have a serious case – the thing is almost incurable – of myopia,” he said. “The emperor stands before us completely naked and no one sees the Union Jack.” He said it was almost beyond belief that Australia was one of only three nations in the commonwealth clinging to such a flag. “It’s almost unbelievable and the minute you bring it up people shout you down almost as if it’s heresy. And I say, ‘Didn’t we change the national anthem in 1984?’” But Turnbull immediately dismissed the campaign, saying he could not see a time when the flag would ever change. Turnbull was once a director of Ausflag, but quit the organisation in 1994. He later joined the Australian National Flag Association, which seeks to preserve the current flag. On Friday, Turnbull said young Australians did not see the Union Jack as representative of another country. “That’s the one they have on their backpacks when they’re travelling overseas, that’s the flag that our soldiers have on their shoulder patches, that is our flag,” he said. “So, I think – I think the Australian flag will be flying over Parliament House long after all of us have shuffled off the stage of history.” The campaign to change the flag has a long history. Twenty years ago, the Indigenous leader Lowitja O’Donoghue said the current flag symbolised a “narrow slice of our history” in which the rights of Indigenous people were overlooked. “For this reason, most of Australia’s Indigenous people cannot relate to the existing flag,” she said. “For us, it symbolises dispossession and oppression. “And it just doesn’t reflect the reality of Australian life in the late 1990s.” Warren Mundine told News Corp he did not support changing the flag. He said it had a “lot of emotion behind it with military people serving and dying under it”. “And I know from this debate we’re having about changing the date that it will be a very nasty and very disgraceful discussion,” Mundine said. But Scruby said the original Australian flag, the Red Ensign, had a red background and was not changed until after the second world war."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/28/cas-mudde-democracy-fascism-trump","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-28T07:00:31Z","webTitle":"It's fashionable to say western democracies are dying.

Don't buy it (yet)","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Don’t get me wrong. I was upset that Trump won. In fact, I still am. I often quip that, as a scholar of the far right and populism, I used to study the political fringe and now I study the mainstream. But there is a risk that outraged liberal commentators are overstating how bad things are. The dramatic, sweeping statements that everything used to be better and all is going to hell are becoming annoying – and counterproductive. From the outset, the liberal response to Trump – or in Europe, Brexit – has been over the top. Godwin’s law, which states that the longer an online discussion goes on, the higher the likelihood of someone bringing up Hitler, has been thrown out of the window. Now, “fascism” is already used before an online discussion has even started. While some serious scholars of historical fascism have pointed out similarities between that era and (the rise of) Donald Trump, the ease with which the term is generally thrown around, and the reality of the situation in the US, makes most fascism accusations far-stretched at best and dishonest at worst. There is now a whole coterie industry of “anti-Trump” pundits, ironically more from the conservative than the liberal side, who on a daily basis write columns and tweets to inform us how bad Trump is, and how feeble the state of US democracy is. Book after book is published with onerous titles like How Democracies Die, On Tyranny or The Retreat of Western Liberalism, which either argue or warn that we are reaching a liberal end times. But many pundits do not only overstate their claim, they also are fairly blind to their own biases and privileges. Several economists have already pointed out the US-centric, or western-centric, bias of the claim that everything is getting worse. Although there is some debate over the best measure, there is no doubt that extreme poverty has been almost halved around the world in the past 30 years. And for all the debate in the US and some European countries, most studies show that “globally democracy is not in decline”. In fact, while there might be growing disillusionment with democracy around the world, the change seems most pronounced in some western democracies, particularly the US. For several years now the (far) right has been criticizing the functioning of US democracy: think of the Tea Party’s critique of “big government” or Trump’s unfounded claims of mass voter fraud. But disillusionment with democracy is also loudly and prominently expressed by leftwing and young Americans. Occupy Wall Street and the Bernie Sanders campaign are two recent examples. Now the Trump presidency has made it current within more established liberal communities, particularly among higher-educated, straight white males. This sentiment is at least in part a consequence of an egocentric bias. There is absolutely no doubt that the economic, legal, political and social situation of non-white, non-straight and non-male people is better today than it was a few decades ago. If anything, the “decline” is fairly recent. The last decade saw strong pushbacks against abortion and minority voting rights, for example. The rise of Trump has finally catapulted the issue of white privilege on to the political and public agenda. White liberals are highly active and visible in the debate but their privilege is seldom the target of their own attacks. And whenever white liberals do critique themselves, it is mostly in a symbolic, self-cleansing kind of way. Similarly, male privilege is dominating the agenda right now, and male liberals are enthusiastically denouncing and shaming the sexist culture of “the entertainment industry” or “the media”, but rarely bring it closer to home, for example reflecting on how they (we, I) have facilitated the sexual harassment of others and profited from the sexist culture at home or at the work place. In the wake of the Trump victory there was even some discussion of education privilege. As the liberal media, simplistically, declared the white working class man the prototypical Trump supporter, issues like the massive income gap between college-educated and non-college educated people were briefly discussed and somewhat criticized. But liberals soon moved on, focusing on the alleged importance of “fake news” and “post-truth” rather than lack of education. Indeed, the fact that student debt was among the key concerns of both Occupy Wall Street and the Sanders campaign shows that education privilege is still largely a blindspot on the left. Even the other privileges, when not used against Trump and his supporters, are often conveniently buried under more convenient liberal and leftwing frames, like “the 99%’ versus “the 1%”. Reflecting the empirical reality that “the richest 1% now owns more of the country’s wealth than at any time in the past 50 years”, all attention is focused on “the corrupt elite”, which implicitly or explicitly is defined as the sole source of (real) privilege. This populist distinction purifies “the people” and largely ignores broader white, male, straight and education privilege. It is time to face up to our own privilege, and not hide behind the even more privileged. This doesn’t mean shaming and ritual public self-incrimination, a long-time favorite within leftwing circles, but acknowledging and problematizing it. Just as sexual assault cannot become so pervasive without a broader sexist culture, the 1% cannot flourish outside of a fundamentally unequal society. It’s more than just the 1% who profit from and sustain that inequality. They include most highly-educated, straight, white, male liberals. It’s time to check our privilege and walk the talk.

This has far-reaching adverse consequences on the functioning of democracy, particularly on the integrity of elections.” In addition to skewing democracy, social media companies “deceive their users by manipulating their attention and directing it towards their own commercial purposes” and “deliberately engineer addiction to the services they provide”. The latter, he said, “can be very harmful, particularly for adolescents”. “The power to shape people’s attention is increasingly concentrated in the hands of a few companies. It takes a real effort to assert and defend what John Stuart Mill called ‘the freedom of mind’. There is a possibility that once lost, people who grow up in the digital age will have difficulty in regaining it. This may have far-reaching political consequences.” Soros warned of an “even more alarming prospect” on the horizon if data-rich internet companies such as Facebook and Google paired their corporate surveillance systems with state-sponsored surveillance – a trend that’s already emerging in places such as the Philippines. “This may well result in a web of totalitarian control the likes of which not even Aldous Huxley or George Orwell could have imagined,” he said. The companies, which he described as “ever more powerful monopolies” are unlikely to change their behaviour without regulation. “The internet monopolies have neither the will nor the inclination to protect society against the consequences of their actions. That turns them into a menace and it falls to the regulatory authorities to protect society against them,” he said. He said Davos was a good place to announce: “Their days are numbered.” He also echoed the words of world wide web inventor Sir Tim Berners-Lee when he said the tech giants had become “obstacles to innovation” that need to be regulated as public utilities “aimed at preserving competition, innovation and fair and open universal access”. During the same speech, Soros also criticised Donald Trump’s leadership, saying he had put the US on course for a nuclear war with North Korea. Soros is the latest high-profile business person to speak out about these internet platforms at Davos. Earlier this week, Salesforce’s chief executive, Marc Benioff, said that Facebook should be regulated like a cigarette company because it’s addictive and harmful. In November, Roger McNamee, who was an early investor in Facebook, described Facebook and Google as threats to public health. In the same month Facebook’s founding chairman, Sean Parker, criticised his former employer: “God only knows what it’s doing to our children’s brains,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jan/25/white-house-gold-toilet-loan-guggenheim-museum","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-26T07:46:50Z","webTitle":"White House asks for Van Gogh loan – but Guggenheim offers gold toilet instead","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/25/white-house-gold-toilet-loan-guggenheim-museum","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jan/25/white-house-gold-toilet-loan-guggenheim-museum","fields":{"headline":"White House asks for Van Gogh loan – but Guggenheim offers gold toilet instead","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Guggenheim Museum has reportedly turned down a White House request to borrow a Van Gogh painting, and has instead offered the Trump administration the use of a golden toilet. The White House had asked the Guggenheim, based in New York, to borrow Landscape With Snow, Van Gogh’s 1888 work depicting a man and a dog walking through a field. But the Guggenheim’s chief curator, Nancy Spector, turned down the request, the Washington Post reported on Thursday. Instead she said the White House could loan an 18-carat toilet – an installation by artist Maurizio Cattelan. The fully functioning toilet, titled America, was installed in the Guggenheim in September 2016. It was available for public use, and tens of thousands of people obliged. But with the exhibition over, Spector saw that the toilet could now potentially serve the president. Spector’s emailed reply to the White House’s request to loan Landscape with Snow was obtained by the Post. The veracity of the email, which was sent on September 15, was confirmed to the newspaper by the Guggenheim. In reply to an inquiry from the Guardian, the museum said: “We have no further information to provide.” Spector wrote that America was available, “should the President and First Lady have any interest in installing it in the White House”. Cattelan “would like to offer it to the White House for a long-term loan”, Spector said in the email. She added: “It is, of course, extremely valuable and somewhat fragile, but we would provide all the instructions for its installation and care.” The Guardian was among the first to use the solid gold toilet in September 2016. “The surface proved forgiving on the rear of the thigh and once the procedure was complete, the flush worked like a charm. The golden toilet was able to handle solids,” our reviewer declared. At the time of America’s installation, Cattelan told the Guggenheim that he had the idea for the toilet before Trump’s political rise, but said “it was probably in the air”. He said the golden toilet was in part a nod to Marcel Duchamp’s 1917 artwork Fountain, which was a urinal."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/jan/26/three-hands-three-legs-vanity-fair-cover-photoshop-fail-sparks-twitter-reaction","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-26T14:52:11Z","webTitle":"Three hands, three legs?

This year, Twitter users are noting that the magazine appears to have thrown in a couple of extra arms and legs. “Well … I guess everybody knows now … I have 3 legs,” tweeted Reese Witherspoon. “I hope you can still accept me for who I am.” Witherspoon’s additional limb is not the only curious feature of the cover, shot by Annie Leibovitz. In another image, Oprah Winfrey appears to be posing with two arms by her side, while a third is gripping Witherspoon round the waist. “I accept your 3d leg. As I know you accept my 3d hand,” Winfrey tweeted at Witherspoon. Vanity Fair conceded that Oprah’s additional arm was a mistake, but said Witherspoon’s extra limb was a visual trick caused by the lining of her dress. Vanity Fair tweeted: “While we would have loved the exclusive on @RWitherspoon’s three legs, unfortunately it’s just the lining of her dress. As for @Oprah, how can we expect her to juggle it all with just two hands? (We are correcting this error online).” Now in its 24th year, Vanity Fair’s annual Hollywood issue has become a significant feature of awards season, bringing together several of the stars in the running for the Oscars. Alongside Winfrey and Witherspoon, this year’s issue features Nicole Kidman, Tom Hanks, Jessica Chastain, Harrison Ford, Michael B Jordan, Zendaya and Gal Gadot. However, one absent star is James Franco, who was removed from the cover in the wake of sexual misconduct allegations. Vanity Fair told the Hollywood Reporter: “We made a decision not to include James Franco on the Hollywood cover once we learned of the misconduct allegations against him.” Franco, who received a Golden Globe for his performance in The Disaster Artist, described the allegations as “not accurate”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/occams-corner/2018/jan/26/children-can-only-aspire-to-the-roles-visible-to-them-time-to-get-into-the-classroom","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-26T11:36:00Z","webTitle":"Diversity starts in schools – children need to see a wider range of careers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/occams-corner/2018/jan/26/children-can-only-aspire-to-the-roles-visible-to-them-time-to-get-into-the-classroom","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/occams-corner/2018/jan/26/children-can-only-aspire-to-the-roles-visible-to-them-time-to-get-into-the-classroom","fields":{"headline":"Diversity starts in schools – children need to see a wider range of careers","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Ask a seven-year-old “what do you want to do when you grow up?” and you’ll get an answer built on very limited experience. But unless children are exposed to a wide range of options how can they know what opportunities exist that might interest them? The lack of awareness of primary school children of the full spectrum of careers is highlighted in a new study, Drawing the Future. Carried out for the organisation Education and Employers, the conclusion is that more of us need to go into primary schools to share our experiences of the world of work. When I was a child, the boys would typically answer that they wanted to be train drivers, and the girls would say nursing. Those were the expected answers and I’m sure I (briefly) complied. Such answers also highlight another problem: even by the age of seven gender stereotyping has kicked in. Few girls, even now, would probably admit to wanting to be astronauts, or boys to be nurses. Judging by this survey, it seems to be a global phenomenon. Children don’t know enough about the world of work to have realistic ideas of what jobs exist, but they have absorbed enough to believe there is “men’s work” and “women’s work”. The study asked children aged seven to 11 years old to draw and describe what they wanted to be when they grew up. Their free text descriptions were coded into one of 69 possible occupations. The results are illuminating if slightly depressing. By the age of seven it was clear that the jobs chosen reflected standard gendered ideas. In the UK, in the area of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM), four times as many boys wanted to become engineers as did girls. Twice as many boys as girls saw science as their chosen future, while girls were four times more likely than boys to want to be vets, and more than twice as likely to want to be doctors. Perhaps those of us in the sector should be encouraged by the finding that STEM careers in general were viewed favourably, with vet being the third most popular choice, and scientist seventh. Nevertheless, nothing in STEM was as well regarded as sport, with boys and girls most likely aspiring to be a sportsman or woman – the most popular option by more than ten percentage points. Regardless of the likelihood of nearly a quarter of our primary school children going on to be sports personalities, these results suggest that genuine diversity across the STEM sector is not likely to be fixed anytime soon. The current situatuion in engineering, for instance, is neatly summed up in the Institution of Engineering and Technology’s phrase “9% is not enough” – the percentage of women in the engineering workforce. If this is to be changed, active steps must be taken. As last summer’s BBC programme No more Boys and Girls: can our Kids go Gender Free? demonstrated, thinking hard about the teacher–pupil interaction can quite rapidly make a difference. Let the girls get their hands on puzzles to encourage their spatial awareness and, unsurprisingly, their ability mentally to rotate shapes increases. But if the teacher chooses to give them dolls or water-play instead, they will remain less competent at such puzzles than boys who get to do the practice. And, if the girls consequently end up less able to visualise things in three dimensions, by the time they make genuine career choices they may well feel engineering is beyond them – a view encouraged by a teacher who spots their weakness in this direction. The main thrust of this most recent report, though, isn’t to have a go at teachers – or parents, nor even the media – for imposing stereotypes. The report’s constructive solution is to enable children to meet people from very different careers. So if, for instance, a female engineer – or a male vet – walks into the classroom and talks about their own work, it can have a very positive effect, changing awareness and expectations. Education and Employers operates both the Inspiring the Future and Inspiring Women initiatives that bring people from all walks of life and at every level of seniority into the classroom, to share their experiences and concrete facts. Such activities can only have a beneficial impact on children’s knowledge and awareness. As a bonus, it may help familiarise teachers with a broader range of career opportunities. If we are to ensure all children get better informed about careers and opportunities from an early age, more such initiatives are needed. You can help by signing up to get involved. Whatever your level of educational attainment, Education and Employers would love to hear from you. The only commitment is a single school visit a year: not a big ask for most of us, but it could make a the world of difference to a future engineer … or astronaut."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/jan/25/rhys-webb-ruled-out-of-wales-six-nations-with-knee-injury","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-25T19:41:17Z","webTitle":"Rhys Webb ruled out of Wales’ Six Nations campaign with knee injury","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jan/25/rhys-webb-ruled-out-of-wales-six-nations-with-knee-injury","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jan/25/rhys-webb-ruled-out-of-wales-six-nations-with-knee-injury","fields":{"headline":"Rhys Webb ruled out of Wales’ Six Nations campaign with knee injury","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Wales’s injury woe before the Six Nations opener in Cardiff next week deepened on Thursday when the Lions scrum-half Rhys Webb was ruled out of the tournament, two days after it was announced that his half-back partner Dan Biggar would miss the first three rounds because of a shoulder problem. The uncapped Cardiff Blues scrum‑half Tomos Williams was called up as a replacement for Webb who, after this season, will be unavailable for his country. He is joining Toulon in the summer and will be the first casualty of a rule coming into force which stipulates any player turning down a regional contract to play outside Wales will be eligible for Test rugby only if he has won at least 60 caps. Biggar, who is joining Northampton, reached that number last month. Webb, who has a knee injury, and Biggar join their fellow Lions players Sam Warburton, Taulupe Faletau, Jonathan Davies and Dan Lydiate on the unavailability list for at least the first three rounds of the Six Nations, while the Saracens wing Liam Williams is doubtful for the Scotland game because of an abdominal injury and the Northampton wing George North has not started a match for three months. In addition, the fly-half Rhys Priestland returned to Bath last week for treatment on a hamstring strain while the Scarlets second-row Jake Ball is expected to miss the entire Six Nations tournament following shoulder surgery. Warren Gatland, the Wales head coach, was in bullish mood at the launch of the Six Nations on Wednesday, saying that he regarded his side as favourites citing as a factor the inclusion of 13 Scarlets in his squad. The region last weekend became the first team from Wales for six years to qualify for the quarter-finals of the European Champions Cup after following up their flowing victory at Bath by fronting up against Toulon, but the Six Nations will test Gatland’s strength in depth to the full."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/feb/09/dont-knock-donald-trump-for-playing-so-much-golf-heres-why","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-09T15:00:11Z","webTitle":"Don’t knock Donald Trump for playing so much golf.

Here’s why","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Spending time in nature, as you’re surely aware by now, is good for your mental health. Like, really, really good. People criticise Donald Trump for whiling away so many hours on golf courses, but they’re wrong: imagine the damage he’d wreak if his rage and repressed self-loathing weren’t offset by the restorative benefits of all that greenery! So there’s nothing intrinsically surprising about a new study, led by Viren Swami of Anglia Ruskin University, in Cambridge, suggesting that natural environments improve people’s body image; after all, they improve everything. What remains debatable is why. One of the most beguiling answers – first given three decades ago by the US academics Rachel and Stephen Kaplan – is also maybe the most pleasingly named concept in psychology. In a world of relentless, aggressive demands on our attention, the Kaplans argued, nature does something different: it exerts “soft fascination”. Soft fascination has two crucial components. First, it’s effortless: you don’t need to “try to focus” on the wind in the trees, or a moor top blanketed in heather. Second, it’s partial: it absorbs some attention, but leaves some free for reflection, conversation or mind-wandering. The result is what the Kaplans called “cognitive quiet”, in which the muscle of effortful attention – the one you use to concentrate on work – gets to rest, but without the boredom you’d feel if you had nothing to focus on. This helps explain why nature’s benefits aren’t restricted to, say, trips to the Grand Canyon or Great Barrier Reef. Those places seize your whole attention, whereas your local park may seize just enough of it to let the rest of your mind relax. Think about attention like this, and it becomes clear how irresponsibly we usually treat our own supply of it. “To concentrate on a task, you need to block out distractions,” as the design and technology expert Richard Coyne has written – and “once that blocking function gets worn down by fatigue, you are more likely to act on impulse, to shirk tasks that prove too challenging [or] to become irritable.” But all too often, we respond to concentration fatigue by trying to concentrate on something different: email, social media, TV – “things that are more engaging but less challenging”. No wonder that doesn’t work: it’s like taking a rest after lifting dumbbells by lifting different dumbbells. Nature, by contrast, lets us switch modes. To quote Frederick Law Olmsted, who designed Central Park, it “employs the mind without fatigue and yet exercises it; tranquillises it and yet enlivens it”. There’s plenty of evidence for the soft fascination thesis. But for me, it’s personal experience that makes it ring so true. To listen to some proponents of mindfulness, you might think the best way to engage with nature is being totally immersed in the scenery. Yet anyone who loves hiking knows part of the pleasure is in pondering other matters as you walk, or in meandering conversations – rambling while rambling. Countless famous thinkers – Darwin, Thoreau, Wordsworth – swore by daily walks in nature.. But they were still thinking as they walked. oliver.burkeman@theguardian.com"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"books/2018/feb/01/yorkshire-by-richard-morris-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-01T09:00:11Z","webTitle":"Yorkshire by Richard Morris review – England's greatest county?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/feb/01/yorkshire-by-richard-morris-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/feb/01/yorkshire-by-richard-morris-review","fields":{"headline":"Yorkshire by Richard Morris review – England's greatest county?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Is Yorkshire England’s greatest county? With an area of nearly 12,000 sq km, much greater than Sussex, Surrey and Kent combined, it’s certainly the largest. Thanks to conurbations such as Leeds, Sheffield and Bradford, it’s also the most populous outside Greater London. And none can match its claim to heavenly dispensation (“God’s own country”). But other aspects of Yorkshire are less great. The proverbial wisdom associated with Tykes – “’Ear all, see all, say nowt; / Eat all, sup all, pay nowt. / An’ if ivver tha does owt fer nowt – / Allus do it for thissen” – celebrates parsimony, narrow-mindedness and self-interest. And then, if you are a remainer, there was Brexit. In June 2016, only three out of 21 Yorkshire districts voted remain; Hull, for instance – once famous as a portal to Europe and for its openness to continental immigration – had a two-thirds majority to leave the EU. Known for being “a continent unto itself”, more like an empire than a county, Yorkshire defies easy definition. As well as being divided into separate Ridings it has varied landscapes: “mountains, caverns, plains, precipices, chalk downs, valleys and vales, estuaries, marshland, peatbogs and upland heath”. It has also seen the loss of its traditional industries (coal, cotton, wool and silk) and changes in its urban population (nearly half of Dewsbury’s inhabitants, for example, are Muslim). No writer can encompass all that in a single volume; those who have tried, whether visitors or natives, resort to caricature. An archaeologist by profession, and historian and composer on the side, Richard Morris gets round the problem by resisting comprehensiveness. What he offers instead is a kind of bio-topography, a whisk through assorted lives (not all of them famous) and the places in which they flourished. “There are different ways to come to Yorkshire,” he says, “in a poem, through an image, on a ferry from Rotterdam, by train.” His own starting point is a family photo depicting his mother, grandmother and great-grandmother posed in a beach photographer’s car. Through impressive detective work – the picture turned up 20 years after his mother’s death – he locates the place where it was taken: Scarborough, even today a popular holiday destination despite its faded grandeur. From Scarborough he proceeds to Carlin How, just along the coast, where his mother grew up and where a man called Alf Myers taught at the Methodist Sunday school she attended. Myers became a conscientious objector during the first world war and served time in prison. Morris gives a fascinating account of the episode (and of the experience of other COs), before moving on, in the same chapter, to discuss railways, coal mines, the Brontës and the recent discovery of the grave of a Saxon princess. A “lyrical history”, his publishers call it, though “fragmented”, “episodic” or even “random” might be nearer the mark. As the author skips back and forth, determinedly banishing any suggestion of Pennine stolidity, it can be hard to follow the logic and keep up. One chapter at the end, in the section on the West Riding, returns to Scarborough, dips into the spas of Harrogate, then moves on to fly fishing, the numbering of trunk roads, and factory Wakes (holiday) weeks. There is a wealth of fascinating information – I’d not known, for example, that the fashion for naming houses “Windyridge” (as both my father and grandfather called theirs) derived from the popularity of a 1912 novel of that title by Willie Riley, which sold more than half a million copies – but you’re never quite sure where you are. Reading the book is like watching the author sift through layers of time: whatever will he turn up next? In the best passages he allows himself to be personal, recalling his torchlit exploration of a Roman culvert in York, a childhood trip to Canada, or the time when he lived close to the A1 and the local farmer would stop the traffic to usher his herd of Friesians across the carriageway. Other sequences score by focusing on a single theme: the Whitby whaling industry, or Amy Johnson’s arrival at Hull Municipal airport after her solo flight from Australia in 1930, or the battles fought by Leeds-born Richard Oastler to abolish child labour and the slave trade. But the structure is confusing, and you start to wish Morris had made more of his family history instead of digging through material already well covered by others, such as the battle of Marston Moor or the draining of marshland by Cornelius Vermuyden. For what’s meant to be a lyrical history, the book has some odd gaps. JMW Turner is there but there’s nothing about David Hockney’s paintings of the Yorkshire Wolds; Philip Larkin and Ted Hughes are there but not Tony Harrison or Simon Armitage; JB Priestley and Winifred Holtby are there but not John Braine, Keith Waterhouse or David Peace. Even so, what the book lacks in cultural contemporaneity, it makes up for in geology and early history. The chapter comparing the early warning radar system at Fylingdales RAF station, the coastal chain of observation posts established by the Romans and a church window depicting Armageddon is worth the price alone. • Yorkshire: A Lyrical History of England’s Greatest County by Richard Morris (W&amp;N, £25).

This week the Financial Times published an exposé of sexual misconduct at the male-only Presidents Club Charity Dinner in London. Held at a swanky hotel and attended by the business and media elite, the dinner is ostensibly meant to raise money for good causes but seemed more like an exercise in bad behavior. Around 150 scantily clad hostesses were paraded in front of the men and reportedly subject to groping and sexual harassment. One of the particularly Handmaid’s Tale-esque details of the party was that a security guard was apparently positioned outside the women’s toilets to ensure none of the hostesses were away for too long. The FT report was a reminder that business is still very much a boy’s-only club. But it was also a reminder of the power of journalism to change things. In just 24 hours, the President’s Club, which has held this dinner for 33 years, folded. I would like to welcome all of its former members to 2018. Glass half-full The gender pay gap is a lot worse for black women. On average women in the US are paid 80% of what men make; but for black women that figure is 63%. If we’re going to do something to fix that then people with privilege need to flex their privilege to help others. This week, Octavia Spencer revealed that Jessica Chastain has done just that –helping Spencer negotiate a higher pay package on a film the pair are starring in by tying their pay negotiations together. Now that is the true meaning of allyship! More stories like this please.

And a Turkish series called 20 Minutes on Netflix. One of the brilliant things about Netflix is that it gives you access to international TV, so you can pretend you’re not procrastinating but, rather, learning a foreign language. How outraged I am I’m at a 3/10. This piece in the Guardian by Ashley “Dotty” Charles, an amazing BBC Radio 1Xtra presenter, sums up a lot of my recent feelings about the ubiquity and futility of modern outrage. “If outrage is currency then think of your expression of outrage as an investment. It is emotionally draining to be truly outraged.” Taking a bit of an outrage break this week. How I’m making it through this week Lots of tea. Which is how I make it through most weeks.

Hull have one win in their past 15 league games, the appointment of Nigel Adkins having not halted their slide. The FA Cup might provide respite, but there is a chance Adkins will make changes with a crucial Championship game against Leeds on Tuesday. A number of players, including Will Keane, Evandro and Fraizer Campbell, have recently returned from injury, so this could be a chance to get some game time.

He will also be looking to avoid a repeat of last season’s fourth round when another west Midlands club, Wolverhampton Wanderers, won at Anfield as Klopp’s rotation policy backfired. West Bromwich Albion secured a merited goalless draw at Liverpool last month and have shown signs of recovery of late under Alan Pardew. Albion have also won four of the seven previous FA Cup ties between the clubs.

Middlesbrough won – albeit narrowly – at the Riverside with Brighton losing out in the play-offs. With Tony Pulis anxious to earn his new Boro side a play-off place and Chris Hughton desperate to keep Brighton in the Premier League, neither manager is likely to be left heartbroken by defeat. Neither will want a replay.

Neil Harris’s side are likely to be confident after their epic 4-3 win against Leeds last week and Rochdale’s record of one win from their past six games, in all competitions, will further boost their hopes of making the fifth round.

Micciche was not in charge then, though, and as such will hope his first game in charge can provide fresh influence and continue their Cup progress. Coventry are fairing much better in League Two, sitting sixth, and may consider their route back to League One of much greater importance.

Flynn should have Joss Labadie and Matty Dolan available again, both having been absent for the midweek draw with Morecambe. Tottenham will hope to avoid being pushed as hard by League Two opposition as they were at this stage of the FA Cup last season, when they required an 89th-minute goal from Dele Alli to secure a 4-3 home win against Wycombe.

As he did in the third round, Claude Puel is almost certain to rest most of his first-choice players, which will give Kelechi Iheanacho a rare run-out, while new signing Fousseni Diabaté should play up front. The Peterborough manager, Grant McCann, will take charge of his 100th game, and should put out a strong side, though the striker Jack Marriott is a doubt with a hip problem.

Wilder has ruled out Kieron Freeman and David Brooks for the Blades but Ched Evans has recovered from ankle surgery and is set to feature for the first time since September. Ben Davies and Sean Maguire are out for North End, who will give a first starting place to the striker Louis Moult, who signed from Motherwell and made his debut as a substitute against Birmingham last weekend.

His replacement and fellow La Liga alumnus, Javi Gracia, takes charge of Watford for the first time. Both managers’ primary objective is staying in the Premier League, but a win would provide either side with a needed morale boost. The stakes are certainly lower than their last Cup meeting – the 2003 semi-final at Villa Park, won by Southampton.

The stage could be set then for another Cup upset at the DW Stadium following Bournemouth’s exit in the previous round. Both sides are likely to rest players with an eye on upcoming league games but, with West Ham unable to call on Marko Arnautovic and Manuel Lanzini, Wigan could have the forward momentum to go through.

As he savoured his sixth Australian Open on his way to a night of no doubt impeccably behaved celebration, he engaged with everyone who wanted to spend even a second in the glow of his royal progress. And, when it was suggested to him that Federation Square near Flinders Street station in the middle of the city be officially shortened to Fed Square in his honour, he blushed and smiled. “Fed Square, eh? That’d be cool,” he said to the other part of his post-match double act, Jim Courier. “We’ll make it good. Rock it.” Only a couple of hours earlier, he had dragged himself through such an emotional wringer – beating Marin Cilic 6-2, 6-7 (5), 6-3, 3-6, 6-1 in just over three hours under the roof on Rod Laver Arena – that he broke down in tears at the end of the courtside presentation. Later, he revealed why. “My thoughts were all over the place all day. I was thinking, ‘What if I lost? What if I won?’ Like all day. By the time the match comes around, you’re a wreck.” Who would have thought that the 36-year-old father of four with the perfect life and a bank of achievement in his sport that might never be equalled would be capable of such vulnerability? He has never shown us this side of him before – although he said later: “I have felt it many times.” As for his performance, which swung between outrageous genius in the 24-minute first set, through a perplexing struggle mid-match and on to a devastating finish, he said: “I had my chances. I think I froze in the [second-set] tie-breaker. And I got nervous in the fourth set. I couldn’t stop the bleeding, almost. He was in control, calling the shots. My mind was all over the place in the fourth set, like, ‘Don’t mess it up.’ I had to get lucky at the beginning of the fifth set. And I could see he was feeling it.” These are rare and candid insights into the mind of a champion, a player who has risen to the stratosphere of his sport, slipped and climbed again, looking back from time to time to check on his younger rivals, who have tumbled from view. No Rafael Nadal in the final this time, after last year’s epic comeback to rob the Spaniard of the glory; no Novak Djokovic, who is contemplating surgery on his elbow; and no Andy Murray, who has already taken that route to mend his hip. Federer has sailed serenely on, inhabiting a cloud that is eternally silver-lined. And he shows no sign of leaving the stage. It is 15 years since he appeared in the first of his 30 grand slam finals, when he beat Mark Philippoussis at Wimbledon. His first Australian triumph arrived the following year. Then came a string of wins that lit up the sporting universe like a blazing sun. “Everything changes in your life after your first,” he said – as if ordinary people would understand what that was like. “This one reminds me of 2006 against Marcos Baghdatis. I was keeping my composure. And then I was so relieved. I felt the same way tonight. It was terrible.” He meant terrible to endure but wonderful to revel in after his last serve was called good. And there to applaud with all the others was the man in whose honour the main stadium here was named, Rod Laver. Lining up his mobile phone, he snapped away from the stands to record the moment Federer raised the Norman Brookes trophy for the sixth – and probably not final – time. Federer said: “He’s the best. The Rocket. I’m so happy when I see him. It’s because of the legends of this sport that I play tennis. But I didn’t even see that through the tears. I couldn’t lift my head. I was so embarrassed.” There is a view that Federer lacks self-awareness, that he sometimes says the most gauche, self-serving things when praise is heaped upon him – which is most of the time. But this almost boyish grinning also talks to the innocence still in him. He has won everything, been everywhere, done things with a tennis racket even his peers marvel at, and yet he plays on because he loves it. The inbuilt addiction of hitting a fluffy ball with a racket is as incomprehensible to him, probably, but as strong as when he was a child prodigy. And, in the serious heat of battle on a night of fluctuating drama – when he might so easily have lost had he not regathered his composure in the fifth set – he drinks from the cup of innocence. He plays a grown-up game with the freedom of a child, and that is a rarity that defies proper description. As he wandered from one interview to another, passing the tournament staff and fans who did not want to go home, he never stopped smiling. “Thank you guys,” he shouted to them. “Thank you for your support.” And that is the other secret to the Federer phenomenon. He feeds off the adoration. He probably cannot imagine what it is going to be like without it, or at least this very public version of it. “We love you, Roger,” screamed one star-struck fan after another as he disappeared back into the bowels of the building to be grilled more formally by his friends in the media. This is his life."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/jan/28/saturday-night-live-will-ferrell-george-w-bush-aziz-ansari","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-28T12:38:46Z","webTitle":"Saturday Night Live: Will Ferrell and the cast discuss Aziz Ansari… and explode","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jan/28/saturday-night-live-will-ferrell-george-w-bush-aziz-ansari","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jan/28/saturday-night-live-will-ferrell-george-w-bush-aziz-ansari","fields":{"headline":"Saturday Night Live: Will Ferrell and the cast discuss Aziz Ansari… and explode","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Will Ferrell is hosting Saturday Night Live and he takes the cold open like the pro he is, reprising a … beloved old character? An old one, anyway. Ferrell’s George W Bush is chuffed at how good the current president is making him look. ‘At this rate I might even end up on Mount Rushmore … I’m suddenly popular af,” he says. “So I just wanted to address my fellow Americans tonight and remind you that I was really bad. Like, historically: not good.” Leslie Jones enters as Condoleezza Rice. They sing a song about the good old days, when “Cheney shot a guy in the face”. Live from New York: it’s Saturday night. And Ferrell has done a quick change. So quick, things got violent. “Me, Will Ferrell on Saturday Night Live? What?” he says. His forehead is bleeding. “I hit my head on a steel beam so hard that I heard a crack and then a whoosh of wind,” he says, and then starts singing I Think I’m Gonna Like It Here while smearing blood on an audience member. Cecily Strong and Kenan Thompson sing along and take him off stage on a gurney. Green screen! Will Ferrell is a fighter pilot whose call sign is “Clown Penis”: “Clown like the circus, Penis like your penis.” The studio audience howls every time he says “penis” but the audience in my living room is stoic. Beck Bennett and Kyle Mooney are Ferrell’s roommates in a Real World-style show. It’s as tedious as it sounds, except Tracy Morgan makes a fleeting appearance as another housemate. Ferrell and Kate McKinnon are an elderly couple filming a commercial for a roadside diner. Ferrell’s character can’t remember his line, “baked in a crispy pastry crust”. McKinnon has an impressive prosthetic chin. That’s the skit. Old people! Can’t remember lines! Aidy Bryant and Chris Redd are flight attendants doing a safety rap and Ferrell keeps interrupting with rhymes about the inevitability of death: “When I say ‘death is’ you say ‘final’.” Eventually he’s dragged off the plane shouting “Everyone should read Nineteen Eighty-Four”. A faux commercial for Next, “the only antiperspirant for men who are feeling the heat because their Time’s Up”. Deodorant for sex criminals! “As an actor,” Alex Moffat says, “I need a deodorant that works with me, because no one else wants to.” Chris Stapleton is the musical guest. He’s wearing a large white cowboy hat and strums his guitar in the way that made him one of the nation’s most beloved artists. Weekend Update! They come out shooting: Stephen Miller, says Michael Che, “looks like he has a sex doll called Mother”. Then Colin Jost compares Trump to the Hamburglar because “he’s basically the Hamburglar” and Ferrell joins the table as his classic character, Jacob Silj. “You don’t have to shout,” Jost says. “Unbelievable,” Ferrell says, “I happen to suffer from voice immodulation syndrome … it has been diagnosed in over zero people in the United States alone.’ He shouts some more at Jost. “Maybe you’d like to sell your co-host over there to one of your rich Harvard friends,” he says, gesturing at Che. Che recovers to report on a baboon escape and a camel beauty pageant, then Heidi Gardner rolls on as a teenage film critic. “Shape of Water was, like, I don’t know, it was weird.” Three Billboards “was weird too”. She strokes her hair a lot and cries. Teenage girls! More annoying that old people! The next sketch is set in a suburban backyard, where Strong and Ferrell are returning to their old neighborhood as triumphant reality show stars. Their fake tan is very funny. Last week, the show did not address the biggest entertainment story of the week. This week, they do, and it’s the cleverest sketch of the night. The ensemble is sitting in a restaurant; couples enjoying a night together. They discuss dogs. And then. “Has anyone read that article about … Aziz Ansari?” Gardner asks. Everyone freezes in horror. “Of course, we can talk about it,” Ferrell says. “I’ll go first,” says McKinnon, as Ferrell’s wife, “I think … that some women …” “Careful,” says Ferrell. “Careful,” says Bryant. “I think that some men have a … proclivity.” Thompson takes over. “While I applaud the movement …” he says. “Watch it,” says Gardner. Thompson brings up race. Everyone screams. Gardner disappears behind a black magic book. A fox dissolves in acid and a nuclear bomb hits. It’s one of the more intelligent ways SNL has addressed what people call “the present moment” when they don’t want to say “sexual assault”. Sturgill Simpson joins Stapleton for his second song, Midnight Train to Memphis. A group of colleagues are sitting around having a lunch. “I have a story about the south and its foods,” Ferrell says, but he gets the name of the restaurant wrong – Crate and Barrel instead of Cracker Barrel – and becomes agitated when everyone corrects him. It escalates: he accuses Chris Redd of bringing a prostitute to the holiday party, telling Alex Moffat he doesn’t wear condoms. And finally: an infomercial for the songs of Will Ferrell, a creepy 50s rocker. “Fourteen,” he sings, “she’s only 14!” “Huh,” says McKinnon, one of the hosts. “So, obviously this guy’s a pervert and we have to stop the commercial.” “I can’t just bail on him,” says her counterpart, Bennett. “This is my grandfather. It was a different time back then. It was the 80s.” And that’s Saturday Night. Everyone bows, and I’m as exhausted as Ferrell’s shtick from 20 years ago.

We’re grateful to him for his points and want to clarify that only patients detained by order of the magistrates or crown courts under the Mental Health Act will have to wait six months before appealing to a tribunal. The point we make in our evidence to the independent review is that once a person is detained for treatment under section 3 of the act, the order detaining him or her lasts up to six months – though it can be lifted by the hospital or the tribunal and, in some cases, the “nearest relative”. It is unusual for a patient to stay in hospital for six months: that’s why we believe that period is too long – it is demoralising and distressing, and doesn’t reflect reality in the vast majority of cases. Therefore in our evidence we suggest that an initial limit of three months is considered. Second, in relation to the point on community treatment orders, health professionals in London boroughs have reported to some of our members that payments are offered to patients for attending appointments where depot injections – a slow-release form of medication – may be administered, rather than for taking the medicine itself. This is reflected in our response, where we say we understand “that London hospitals go so far as to offer financial rewards to patients who attend appointments for depot injections”. Christina Blacklaws Vice-president, Law Society of England and Wales • Sally Cheseldine (Letters, 26 January) suggests that reforms of English mental health law might follow Scotland in providing for short-term 28-day detention, and rights of appeal against short and long-term detention, supported by legal aid. In fact, all these provisions already exist under England’s Mental Health Act 1983 (amended 2007) and Legal Aid Agency rules; Wales has equivalent provision. There is a danger that the government’s review of mental health law will rapidly become a distraction from the more pressing problem of underresourcing of mental health services. Nick Gould Emeritus professor of social work, University of Bath Tom Burns is right in his response to the Law Society request for a review of the Mental Health Act. The act is largely fit for purpose. The problems are in the lack of well-thought-out and properly resourced services. The lack of investment in systematic workforce planning, education and training and service development is, or at least should be, a cause of acute concern and no little embarrassment. If there is anyone left in the government with any interest in mental health they should hang their head in shame.

Kalagia (4.25) was a warm favourite for a six-furlong handicap at Brighton last time out but never really threatened to justify her price as she finished third, a couple of lengths behind the winner. She did look very much as though a step up in trip would suit, however, and the extra furlong at one of the stiffest tracks in the country could prove ideal. Add in the fact that her latest race was run in a useful time – Jack Taylor, the winner, is one to look out for – and Kalagia is very interesting to beat six opponents at around 100-30. Mischief Managed (3.50) is another with fair prospects at the prices on the same card, while Seen The Lyte (6.50) could regain the winning thread at Nottingham later having blown her chance with a slow start at Chester last time out. Medalla Doro (7.20), also at Nottingham, and Bahamian Dollar (7.30) are two more to think about on the evening cards."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"cities/2018/jun/25/tourists-go-home-refugees-welcome-why-barcelona-chose-migrants-over-visitors","type":"article","sectionId":"cities","sectionName":"Cities","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-25T06:15:53Z","webTitle":"'Tourists go home, refugees welcome': why Barcelona chose migrants over visitors","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/jun/25/tourists-go-home-refugees-welcome-why-barcelona-chose-migrants-over-visitors","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/cities/2018/jun/25/tourists-go-home-refugees-welcome-why-barcelona-chose-migrants-over-visitors","fields":{"headline":"'Tourists go home, refugees welcome': why Barcelona chose migrants over visitors","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Early last year, around 150,000 people in Barcelona marched to demand that the Spanish government allow more refugees into the country. Shortly afterwards, “Tourists go home, refugees welcome” started appearing on the city’s walls; soon the city was inundated with protestors marching behind the slogans “Barcelona is not for sale” and “We will not be driven out”. What the Spanish media dubbed turismofobia overtook several European cities last summer, with protests held and measures taken in Venice, Rome, Amsterdam, Florence, Berlin, Lisbon, Palma de Mallorca and elsewhere in Europe against the invasion of visitors. But in contrast to many, as fiercely as Barcelona has pushed back against tourists, it has campaigned to welcome more refugees. When news broke two weeks ago that a rescue ship carrying 629 migrants was adrift in the Mediterranean, mayor Ada Colau was among the first to offer those aboard safe haven. Is it really the case that Barcelona would prefer to receive thousands of penniless immigrants rather than the millions of tourists who last year spent around €30bn in the city? The short answer, it appears, is yes. Increasingly it is tourism, not immigration, that people see as a threat to the city’s very identity – though numbers of both have risen exponentially in recent decades. In 2000 foreigners accounted for less than 2% of the population; a mere five years later, the figure was 15% (266,000). In 2018, it is now officially 18% although, according to Lola López, the city’s integration and immigration commissioner, the true figure is closer to 30%. The influx of new residents has radically changed the face of the city, but Barcelona has not seen a single anti-immigrant protest of any substance – nor is immigration an issue at local elections. According to research by Paolo Giaccaria, a social scientist at the University of Turin, the case of Barcelona “establishes a connection between two types of mobility that are at odds with each other: northern tourism and southern migration. It subverts the common feeling about which kind of mobility is desirable which is not.” Immigration has changed the city, but tourism is destabilising it – and even people in the industry agree that it can’t go on like this. In 1990 the city received 1.7 million tourists; last year the figure was 32 million – roughly 20 times the resident population. The sheer volume of visitors is driving up rents, pushing residents out of neighbourhoods, and overwhelming the public space. “We see immigration as having a positive impact – people have integrated well,” says Natalia Martínez, a councillor in Ciutat Vella, the old part of Barcelona which has been at the forefront of both immigration and tourism. “It’s brought more than it’s taken away in terms of identity.” Her colleague Santi Ibarra argues that the diversity that comes with immigration enhances the city – but tourism contributes nothing positive. “Tourism takes something out of neighbourhoods,” he says. “It makes them more banal – the same as everywhere else.” Like London, the number of native Barcelonans is quite small, especially in working class neighbourhoods, which is where most of the latest wave of immigrants have made their homes. The three largest groups of immigrants are Europeans, Latin Americans and North Africans, mainly from Morocco, as well as significant Chinese and Pakistani populations – though López says that Barcelona has its own identity, distinct from that of Catalonia or Spain. “We’ve found that children born here of immigrant or mixed couples tend to identify themselves as being from Barcelona, rather than anywhere else.” The main obstacle to integration is language, especially as schooling is in Catalan, which none of the immigrants speak. Magda Martí is a headteacher in a primary school in Ciutat Vella, where more than half the children are foreigners and says that, along with language barrier, food can also be an issue. The city council requires the school to provide a halal meal option if only one family requests it; Martí says this is tricky, not only logistically but ideologically for a non-religious school. However, she adds: “To me it’s all the same where a child is from, the important thing is to make them and their families welcome. The really positive change is in the new teachers, who don’t see immigration as a problem. They see diversity as something positive, which is how I see it, too.” The neighbourhood where immigration is most visible is El Raval (from the Arabic, meaning suburb), which lies on the opposite side of La Rambla from Ciutat Vella, and has long been synonymous with drugs and prostitution. Until quite recently it was known as Barri Xinès (Chinatown), though there were no Chinese people there – a reflection of its perceived otherness. These days it’s nicknamed Ravalstan for its sizeable Pakistani population. Oscar Esteban, director of the Fundació Tot Raval, an umbrella group that coordinates a wide range of voluntary and statutory organisations in the area, compares el Raval to the east London borough of Tower Hamlets: both historically port neighbourhoods, and for centuries the point of entry to the city. (Similarly, life expectancy in El Raval is five to six years less than in the city’s more salubrious areas.) “El Raval has its own identity and its own way of dealing with things,” says Esteban. “Everything starts here, many social phenomena appear here first and then spread; we’re a social laboratory. There’s a massive level of immigration here but on a day-to-day level there’s no conflict, not even after the terror attack last summer.” Thirteen people died and over 130 were injured in the van attack on La Rambla in August last year. Mohammed Halhoul, the foundation’s president and a member of the Catalan Islamic Council, says that afterwards people were “shocked and indignant, but everyone came together to condemn it”. Halhoul – who came to Barcelona from Morocco in 1990 – attributes the lack of a backlash against the Muslim community to broad political consensus on immigration, and the city’s strong network of community associations. “There are isolated cases but when it comes to racism or Islamophobia, we don’t see it as a problem,” he says. “It’s not something we lose any sleep over.” Of course racism exists in Barcelona inasmuch as it does in any other city – but it has not been allowed to fester. Since 2010 the council has pursued a intercultural policy (as opposed to assimilation) to recognise and respect cultural and religious differences that has enjoyed widespread support, and immigrants have not been scapegoated despite years of economic hardship. But if they have succeeded in escaping a backlash, tourists have not – even though tourism accounts for around 12% of Barcelona’s GDP, and many residents’ jobs depend on it. “There’s no question that a lot of people here live off tourism, but it can’t be a case of anything goes – there have to be limits,” says Esteban. “We’re losing much of the identity of the centre of the city, the port, the very traditions that attract visitors.After 20 years of city authorities flogging Barcelona to visitors from overseas, the council elected in 2015 has moved to put the needs of citizens above those of visitors. It imposed a moratorium on new hotels, made efforts to contain the spread of tourist apartments and devised an urban plan for Ciutat Vella that prioritises local commerce over businesses aimed at tourists. Albert Recio, a spokesman for the Barcelona Federation of Residents Associations representing around 100 bodies, says the dizzying rise of city breaks has had a significant impact on housing, with landlords choosing to make easy money renting to tourists, rather than residents and driving up rents in the process. Public services are also feeling the strain. “People who live near the popular tourist spot of Park Güell can’t get on the bus because it’s full of tourists,” Recio says. “And many traditional businesses that have existed for over 100 years have been driven out.” Barcelona is not alone in its battle to protect its identity, with many European cities being overwhelmed by skyrocketing tourism fuelled by cheap flights and platforms such as Airbnb. According to the Association of British Travel Agents, 53% of British holidays in 2017 were city breaks compared to 41% beach holidays. Antipathy has reached especial heights in Venice, which last month erected barriers in an attempt to control crowds. “In Venice people hate tourists, especially the cruiseships – the worst kind of tourism,” says Patrizia Riganti, who teaches at the school of architecture at Nottingham Trent University and has researched the impact of immigration and tourism in Amsterdam and Venice. “They pollute the city, and consume it as though they were eating a sandwich, what in Italian we call ‘mordi e fuggi tourism’: literally, take a bite and run. “As in Barcelona, the presence of tourists in Venice and the competition for services far outweigh any perceived problems about immigrants who, thanks partly to tourism, can’t afford to live there anyway,” says Riganti. In Lisbon, too, they are feeling the negative impact of mass tourism. Fátima Bernardo, assistant professor of social sciences at the University of Évora in Portugal, fears that the Alfama district in Lisbon may face a similar fate to Ciutat Vella, as another neighbourhood with a strong community and sense of identity. “What tourists like about Alfama is its authenticity, but now it’s too expensive and young people can’t afford to live there, only older people with secure tenancies, so Alfama is dying,” Bernardo says. “The neighbourhood’s social dynamic has changed. “People in Lisbon are very worried about the possibility that our city and our identity might become like Barcelona – a parody and a theme park.” The real issue is the pressure on public space which is not designed to cope with the volume of visitors. Tourists occupy bars and restaurants that were once popular among locals, they saturate public transport and clog pavements, and use far more resources such as water than locals. Residents say the sensation is of being under occupation. It’s this that gives Barcelonans the sense of displacement, that their city and its identity are being stolen from them, making them little more than extras on the set of their own city – a sensation that not even large-scale immigration has provoked. In Barcelona especially, immigrants are seen as part of the fabric – working, building communities, and generally making a contribution to the city while tourists simply use it. “The image of the city that the people themselves have projected is of a place of welcome,” says López of the ease with which new immigrants integrate in Barcelona. But – at least for the foreseeable future – tourists can expect a different reception.

To get here you must pass the tumbling dice, the restless women queuing for the Magic Mike live show, and the inert displays of Johnny Cash memorabilia. It is slightly incongruous, appearing as it does down the street from Backstreet Boys: Larger Than Life and Mariah Carey: The Butterfly Returns, but no less razzle-dazzle in its own way. Since forming in 1988 as the brainchild of Trent Reznor, Nine Inch Nails have taken various anti-commercial elements – industrial noise, songs about pain, absence and sex – and hammered them into Vegas-ready shapes, showtunes for the goth-glam set. Thirty years on, Reznor – the only official member until 2016, when his long-term British collaborator Atticus Ross was added – is in one of his most fertile periods, having just completed a trilogy of releases with new album Bad Witch, six arresting tracks of wailing sax, acid house bass lines, and post-punk drumming, topped with Reznor’s trademark misanthropic lyrics (“I eat your loathing, hate and fear”). “We’re just animals that, left to our own devices, will kill each other,” Reznor shrugs, his regulation all-black attire making him blend into a leather sofa backstage. “We’re only out for ourselves anyway. This illusion that we’re more than that is nothing but that: an illusion.” This bleak worldview has barely changed since the band’s beginning. After his parents divorced, Reznor, now 53, was raised by his grandparents in Mercer, Pennsylvania, a “little, shitty town, a small-aspiration environment” between Cleveland and Pittsburgh, the kind that – in teen movies – only has room for one hooded, bullied outcast. “I was always good at math, and I was going to be an engineer, because you had to have a real job,” Reznor says. “Where I come from, there are no artists; artists were teaching at the high school down the street.” Long before the internet and with no access to cool college radio, Reznor was immersed in mainstream AM-radio rock. “I could sing you every hit from the 70s, every word to every song, because I heard them all constantly. The idea of having a chorus and a melody, it’s beaten into my head.” At 23 and working alone under the influence of Prince, the industrial label Wax Trax! and more, he started writing the songs that would make up the band’s brilliant 1989 debut album Pretty Hate Machine: tinny, seething tracks that had definite shades of Depeche Mode, Nitzer Ebb and other twisted synthpop, but with a head-banging street-punk swagger that was totally new. The lyrics conjured up a struggle between God, love and death as Reznor contemplated suicide, sin and salvation in sex. “I fucked around with some bad music; I was trying to sound like other bands,” he says of his pre-Pretty Hate material. “I thought the Clash were cool so I was trying to be cool, too. Important political statements, no one’s going to make fun of me for them. But the journal entries of a horny, sad guy who doesn’t fit in ...” He realised that the words he was writing in his journal – “to keep myself from going crazy” – were the real lyrics he needed, and Nine Inch Nails’ success was quick and exponential. Today, with burly arms and designer stubble, he is still a rock star, but one with a top note of nerdish unease: shoulders ever so slightly tensed, head ever so slightly bowed. He says he has never fully grown out of the disquiet that powered Pretty Hate Machine and sent him into a gyre of self-destruction in the 1990s – The Downward Spiral, to quote the title of the band’s multi-platinum 1994 followup, infamously recorded in the house where the Manson family murdered Sharon Tate. “The self-destruct button was pushed when I first started writing,” he says. “There was a sense that I couldn’t fit in anywhere, I couldn’t relate to people; I felt alone, I felt angry about it. And part of me is still that. I felt like I was heading down into something that wasn’t going to have a good ending. That ended up being addiction: its claws were in me but it hadn’t fully revealed itself.” Reznor began drinking, then using hard drugs, culminating in an accidental heroin overdose in 2000 that nearly killed him. “I wasn’t the guy who aged 12 had a beer and turned into a werewolf,” he says. “It kind of crept up. I wasn’t prepared for the transformative effect of fame and recognition. Now everyone’s here to see me, and I still feel like I don’t belong there, that I don’t deserve to be there, that I don’t know how to act. I don’t know how much of that is learned, how much is experiential, how much is in my DNA, how much is in how I was raised. But I found myself uncomfortable in a scenario where everybody wants to be your friend. Having a drink or two was a tool. It did help, for a while, until it started to define who I was. In every scenario I had to drink, because that was me now.” Someone who helped slow the rot was David Bowie, whom Reznor describes as his hero. He proposed a tour with Nine Inch Nails in 1995. “Things in my life at that time felt unrecognisable,” Reznor says, “and Bowie definitely helped. Not in a lecturing kind of way, but I saw someone who had come through [addiction], and he was happy and optimistic and remained fearless. I thought: if he can do that, maybe there’s light at the end of the tunnel.” Versions of Bowie’s I’m Afraid of Americans and I Can’t Give Everything Away feature in Nine Inch Nails’ tour setlist. He also credits his wife Mariqueen Maandig, with whom he formed the band How to Destroy Angels and had four children, and Ross, the Eton-educated studio wizard with whom, outside of Nine Inch Nails, Reznor has scored a series of films and documentaries. They won an Oscar for their work on David Fincher’s The Social Network. “Over the last 18 years, we’ve probably spent more time together than we have with our wives,” Ross laughs, wreathed in biscuit-scented vape smoke when I meet him later on. “We work 11am to 7pm every day, and not on the weekend. Some people wait for inspiration. Our experience has been – and I’ve read this a lot about painters and writers I like, too – that it comes from the act of doing it, and continuing to do it.” Alongside the new Nine Inch Nails material, Reznor says the pair have been working on “two major things and two minor things”, neither of which he can disclose. Reznor’s other recent extracurricular activity was working as chief creative officer for Beats Music – later bought by Apple – alongside the company’s co-founder Jimmy Iovine, who signed Nine Inch Nails to Interscope in the 90s (and who has since married Ross’s model sister Liberty). Reznor consulted on the streaming service that eventually became Apple Music. “I was trying to make the experience of how people listen to music feel more akin to walking into a great indie record shop rather than an FTP server,” he says. “There was always a part of me that wondered: what would it have been like if I went down the other branch of my life?” Namely, the one where he became an engineer in Mercer, Pennsylvania. “But I don’t want to do that, if I have the choice. It made me appreciate the life of the artist much more; I really prefer being a musician.” Corporate life over, he and Ross hunkered down for this latest trilogy, “a reflection on the way we are now in the world we live in now,” Ross says, “and the scary things in America. A dark journey.” For Reznor, the records started “from this position of: I think I know who I am now, the chaos feels behind me, there’s family life and stability. It was me daring myself to say: ‘What if all that was bullshit? And what I really am is an addict in remission that can’t wait to light a match to the whole thing?’” Aside from this flirtation with the devil, he and Ross describe it as a reflection on Trump’s America. “It feels like things are coming unhinged, socially and culturally,” says Reznor. “The rise of Trumpism, of tribalism; the celebration of stupidity. I’m ashamed, on a world stage, at what we must look like as a culture. It’s seeing life through the eyes of having four small kids – what are they coming into? And who am I in this world where it feels like every day the furniture got moved a bit while I slept?” The first EP, Not the Actual Events, was a “self-destruct fantasy binge” that harked back to NIN’s 90s sound; the second, Add Violence, “was addressing the same issue, but saying: ‘Maybe it’s not me, maybe it’s the world, maybe this is all a simulation.’” Bad Witch came from a realisation that it is all our fault, after all: “We aren’t these enlightened beings, here to take care of each other and think about our benevolent role in the universe as protectors and creators – we’re just a fucking mutation and an accident.” For Reznor, it wasn’t merely Trump’s presidency that brought on this Damascene moment – it was our online behaviour. “We’ve got dumber, more tribalised; we’ve found niches of other people that focus on extremity. For the miracle of everyone sharing ideas, I see a hell of a lot more racism. It doesn’t feel like we’ve advanced. I think you’re seeing the fall of the empire of America in real time, before your eyes; the internet has eroded the fabric of decency in our civilisation.” Social media meanwhile is “poisonous: I don’t think great art comes from being overly concerned or hyper-aware of what your audience’s expectations are. Market your brand: that’s part of what being an artist is, sadly.” You can see why he left Apple. The other thing that gets both barrels today is popular culture. Reznor starts talking up the greatness of Childish Gambino’s This Is America: “Choreography: excellent. Camerawork: excellent. What’s actually being said: I’m really thinking about it. I feel humbled by that – it reminded me that the bar can be as high as it needs to be.” I suggest that one of the best things about it was everyone’s evident joy at parsing its meaning online; I love rap trio Migos, but This is America was a reminder that we cannot live on escapist lyrics alone. “That would sum up my cursory feelings on popular culture right now,” he replies. “There’s plenty of birthday cake, Migos being a great example – there’s nothing wrong with that. But isn’t there anything else? There are times I don’t mind being reminded of excellence.” While he admits that his alienation from pop culture might be down to his age, he suggests that he would like as many thinkpieces devoted to rock – presumably including him – as there are about hip-hop. “How many Kanye West thinkpieces have the Guardian done in the last fucking month?” he asks. Er, a few. “The guy’s lost his fucking mind: that’s the thinkpiece. His record sucked, and that’s it. He has made great shit; he’s not in a great place right now.” So you’d like the conversation to be wider? “It would be nice, but there’s no appetite.” Later, on stage, Reznor shows that Nine Inch Nails are still worth talking about. Holding the mic as if he’s turned a lightsaber on himself, he vents half a lifetime of political anger and personal revelation into it. “It’s not coming from the same place as when I was 23 years old, but there is still rage,” he’d said earlier. Nine Inch Nails’ genius is to create a pit to contain that rage, and the audience’s too. While the lights initially face the band, they slowly rotate during the show until they are facing out into the crowd: a small gesture of communion in Trump’s America. Maybe it is not all cold and black and infinite after all. Bad Witch is released on 22 June in the UK. Nine Inch Nails play Royal Festival Hall, London, on 22 June as part of Robert Smith’s Meltdown, and Royal Albert Hall, London, on 24 June."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jun/18/carl-sargeant-family-say-they-are-being-excluded-from-inquiry","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-18T09:43:25Z","webTitle":"Carl Sargeant family say they are being excluded from inquiry","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/18/carl-sargeant-family-say-they-are-being-excluded-from-inquiry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jun/18/carl-sargeant-family-say-they-are-being-excluded-from-inquiry","fields":{"headline":"Carl Sargeant family say they are being excluded from inquiry","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The family of Carl Sargeant have claimed they are being excluded from an inquiry into the circumstances surrounding his sacking as a Welsh minister four days before he took his own life. Relatives of Sargeant, who lost his job amid allegations about his behaviour to women, are threatening to launch a judicial review if their barrister is not allowed to cross-examine witnesses. They also claim the hearings have been deliberately arranged to take place at a time when the family barrister, Leslie Thomas QC, will not be able to attend because he is heavily involved in the Grenfell Tower inquiry. Neil Hudgell, the family’s solicitor, called the situation “deeply unsatisfactory”. He said: “The grieving Sargeant family are losing patience and faith in the inquiry and are hurt and upset that everything they have asked for has been ignored. “We currently have an inquiry process where there will be no effective involvement from the family. How can that be fair?” Sargeant killed himself after being sacked as communities and children secretary by the Welsh first minister, Carwyn Jones. Sargeant’s family and friends claimed he was let down by Welsh Labour and after intense pressure, Jones announced that an inquiry would take place into how the sacking was handled. Hudgell said the family was very concerned about decisions made by the permanent secretary, Shan Morgan, who leads the Welsh civil service, on how the inquiry will operate. He said: “The permanent secretary, acting on behalf of the first minister, has refused to allow the family to have their own legal representation at the inquiry, meaning they will be unable to have a barrister cross-examine any of the witnesses.” Hudgell said the family had taken “at face value” the assurances by the inquiry chair, Paul Bowen QC, that the process would be fair and independent. But he added: “I have written to Paul Bowen and the permanent secretary to advise them that we believe the decision-making in relation to the protocol to be unreasonable and we will challenge it by way of a judicial review in the high court if we have to.” Last month Jack Sargeant, who won his father’s Welsh assembly seat in a byelection, told the Guardian the family was upset at the time it was taking for an inquiry into the circumstances surrounding his father’s death to begin in earnest, and said his family had been unable to start the grieving process because of the delay. The Welsh government insisted the family would be able to pose questions via an investigation team – which it said was a common feature of inquiries undertaken at the request of a government. A spokesperson added: “No concerns about timing have been raised previously; indeed earlier representations about timing indicated a wish for the investigation to proceed as quickly as possible, which is now happening. We will consider the detailed legal arguments carefully but consider the proposed proceedings to be misconceived.” The hearings are expected to take place in the autumn. On Friday at a pre-inquest review it emerged that Sargeant had depression for two years before he was found dead and had therapeutic levels of antidepressants in his system. The first minister will be called to give evidence at the inquest. In the UK the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123. In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255.

Until last month, Ranjana Sharma had never considered the question. Then she arrived home one night to find her sister filling buckets. The hot season has occasionally caused brief water shortages in Shimla, the former summer capital of the British Raj. But for an unprecedented 15 days in May and June, most taps in the Indian Himalayan town ran completely dry. Public toilets were padlocked; families used disposable cutlery and threw it away; water trucks rolled in offering to fill tanks – at a steep mark-up; and people queued for hours to receive two buckets from a government supply. Most schools were shut, but not the one where Sharma works as a child psychologist. It stayed open but advised students not to flush the toilets. “I tried to avoid the bathrooms as much as possible,” she says. She chose to keep flushing her own. “I haven’t washed my clothes in weeks.” India is undergoing the worst water crisis in its history, a government thinktank announced last week. About 600 million Indians face “high to extreme water stress” and about 200,000 die each year because they can’t get a clean supply. And the situation is getting worse. By 2030, water availability will be half what India needs. The thinktank quoted predictions that up to 6% of GDP could be lost to extreme water scarcity. Put another way, millions of Indians could be too thirsty, or sickened by contaminated water, to study, work or live. Signs of crisis are already apparent. While wealthier residents of major cities such as Delhi still drink from reliable supplies cleansed by home filters, in a northern Delhi slum in March, a father and son were killed in a brawl over a water tanker – the first reported deaths in the capital from a water dispute. An estimated 21 major cities could exhaust their groundwater supplies within two years, government advisors believe. Several smaller cities have said they also are teetering on the edge. In the past month, Shimla, in the hills of Himachal Pradesh, has emerged as the frontline of the emergency. Officials in the city have blamed an 82% shortfall in winter rain and snow. “There is climate change all over India and the world,” says Jai Ram Thakur, the Himachal Pradesh chief minister. Others say Shimla is an example of how negligence can create a water crisis, one they warn will be repeated in cities and villages across India. ‘The problem is not a lack of water. It is a lack of vision’ Hours after he was sworn in as the mayor of Shimla in 2012, Sanjay Chauhan asked to visit the Giri river, one of six major sources of the city’s water supply. The Giri was supposed to be supplying the city with 20m litres of water each day. Shimla was receiving just 12m. “It looked like no council officers had visited the place in years,” he says. Heavy vegetation had formed around the pipes, which were gushing water into the surrounding soil. “In a one kilometre stretch, almost 60% was being leaked out,” says Chauhan, who lost office last year. “Not like a fountain, like a waterfall.” On paper, Shimla should receive about 55m litres of water each day. In practice, 22m litres – enough to fill nearly 10 Olympic swimming pools – seeps out of the system each day. The loss rate across India is even worse: researchers estimate 50% of the country’s usable water leaks from pipes or is wasted, especially by farmers, nearly all of whom irrigate their fields in the most inefficient way possible, simply flooding crops with vast quantities of water. The British established Shimla on seven cedar-studded hills in 1851. They foresaw a maximum population of 16,000 people. Last year, more than 18 million tourists visited the city. Successive governments have done little to stem the flow of new residents and visitors, and looked the other way as hundreds of hotels illegally sprung up to house them. “It was a boom,” says Shimla-based environmental lawyer Deven Khanna. “Whoever had land, built a hotel. Even some who didn’t have land just cut down trees and without sanction made a building.” Officials estimated there are 25,000 illegal buildings in Himachal Pradesh, many of them in Shimla. The surge has overwhelmed the city’s stocks of rain and snowfall, and wiped out nearly 70% of its groundwater. “Himachal has enough water,” says Khanna. “We have rivers, glaciers. The problem is not a lack of water. It is a lack of vision and will from the government.” This approach is not unique to Shimla. “All over India, we have an anarchic situation in water management,” says Himanshu Thakkar, the coordinator of the South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers and People, a network of advocacy groups. He compares Shimla to Cape Town, the South African city that narrowly avoided running out of water this year after officials raised warnings and citizens restricted their use. “Once they predicted that water would run out, action followed,” Thakkar says. “In India, you would never even get a prediction. The water would just go.” Officials in Shimla maintain the crisis was exaggerated. “Within four or five days, the situation was back to normal,” says Thakur, the chief minister. Yet every resident the Guardian met on the city’s main promenade disagreed. A salesman, Ritaram Sham, said the community tap he and his neighbours rely on ran dry one morning in May. “It has been off for the last month,” he says. Naresh Kumar left Shimla for his village after the tap stopped working for nine days. “Washing clothes, taking baths, they became privileges,” he says. Chauhan, the former mayor, is not surprised by the discrepancy between the views of officials and ordinary citizens. In India, he says, water is power. “No minister was standing in the line for the water tankers,” he says. “It was only the poor, the working class, the small shopkeepers.” Without effective plans to manage dwindling supplies, future water crises will likely play out the same way. “That’s what the powerful people want,” says Thakkar, the water rights advocate. “They are in a position to pull the strings they need to. The weaker people have no strings to pull.” Additional reporting by Madan Lal"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jun/18/extreme-dieters-eating-gluten-free-food-alongside-smoking-and-vomiting","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-18T15:06:12Z","webTitle":"Extreme dieters eating gluten-free food alongside smoking and vomiting","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/18/extreme-dieters-eating-gluten-free-food-alongside-smoking-and-vomiting","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/18/extreme-dieters-eating-gluten-free-food-alongside-smoking-and-vomiting","fields":{"headline":"Extreme dieters eating gluten-free food alongside smoking and vomiting","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Young adults are choosing “gluten-free” products because they think they are healthy, but new research shows some of those who buy them also have unhealthy behaviours, such as smoking or vomiting to try to lose weight. Gluten-free products are soaring in popularity around the world. Global sales rose by 12.6% to hit $3.5bn, between 2016 and 2017 compared with 4% for packaged foods generally, according to Euromonitor. Gluten-free diets are medically advised for people suffering from the digestive condition coeliac disease, but most of the growth in sales is among people who do not need to eat gluten-free foods. According to the study, a Gallup poll in 2015 in the US reported that one in five consumers said they actively try to include gluten-free foods in their diet. Some celebrities have endorsed them for weight-loss. The new research in the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics among young adults aged 25 to 36 in Minnesota in the US found that many choose gluten-free because of its “health halo” – the perception that it is better for you. Other labels that have a similar health halo include “low sodium”, “natural” or “free from” artificial additives. Of 1,819 of these young adults who are enrolled in a long-term study called Project Eat, 13% said they valued gluten-free foods. They tended to be people who also valued organic, locally-grown, non-GMO, and not processed foods, the survey found, and had a weight goal – usually to lose weight although a few (usually young men) hoped to gain weight. But while many ate in a very healthy way, having breakfast and eating lots of fruit and vegetables, others were potentially doing themselves harm by smoking, taking diet pills and making themselves vomit. Those who engaged in such unhealthy behaviours were three times more likely to value gluten-free foods than those who ate well, the survey found. “I have concerns about the increasing number of people who perceive that eating a gluten-free diet is a healthier way to eat. Of particular concern is the higher risk for those engaging in unhealthy weight control practices for perceiving a gluten-free diet as important, given that eating gluten-free may be viewed as a ‘socially acceptable way’ to restrict intake that may not be beneficial for overall health,” said lead investigator Prof Dianne Neumark-Sztainer, head of the division of epidemiology and community health at the University of Minnesota. “If there is a need for eating gluten-free, then it is important to avoid foods with gluten. Otherwise, a dietary pattern that includes a variety of foods, with a large emphasis on fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, is recommended for optimal health.” The researchers also worry that people who go for gluten-free and other so-called healthier foods may over-eat, assuming that you can’t have too much of a good thing. “Products labeled as ‘low sodium,’ ‘natural,’ and ‘free from’ certain food components or characteristics may be interpreted by consumers as being healthier overall,” said lead author Mary J. Christoph of the university’s department of paediatrics. “The health halo effect can have unintended consequences on eating habits, such as people over-consuming because they believe they have chosen a healthier product.” The paper points out that gluten-free foods are also expensive and says there is no reason to recommend them. “Young adults should be advised that eating gluten-free products may not improve weight or health,” it says. Gluten is a protein found in grains such as wheat, barley and rye. Plenty of healthy foods, such as fruit and vegetables, contain no gluten. The concern is over gluten-free substitute packaged foods, which can be high in calories, saturated fats and salt. A big US study published last year found that avoiding whole grains in order not to eat gluten could lead to an increased risk of heart disease. “The promotion of gluten-free diets among people without coeliac disease should not be encouraged,” concluded the study in the British Medical Journal."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"sport/2018/jun/18/fernando-alonso-f1-future-indy-500-le-mans","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-18T09:55:40Z","webTitle":"Fernando Alonso puts his F1 future in doubt after Le Mans win","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jun/18/fernando-alonso-f1-future-indy-500-le-mans","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jun/18/fernando-alonso-f1-future-indy-500-le-mans","fields":{"headline":"Fernando Alonso puts his F1 future in doubt after Le Mans win","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Fernando Alonso has said he will consider his future in Formula One after his win at the Le Mans 24 Hours put him within touching distance of achieving motor racing’s triple crown. The Spaniard’s victory, alongside his Monaco wins, means he has secured two of the three to match Graham Hill, the only driver to achieve the feat. For Alonso the third and final hurdle, a win at the Indy 500, is now a priority. The double F1 world champion won at the Circuit de la Sarthe alongside his Toyota teammates, Kazuki Nakajima and Sébastien Buemi, who put in a superb team effort to take the 86th edition of the endurance classic. Alonso was in superb form to chase down the leading sister Toyota during a quadruple stint through the night. His contract with McLaren in F1 ends this year and he made clear his priorities. “I will make my mind up after the summer what I will do next year but after winning Le Mans, Indy comes into play with a high priority,” he said on Sunday. “Let’s see if it is next year or the following year. Let’s see what the future of F1 will be.” The 36-year-old won Le Mans at his first attempt and although in a Toyota that was the class of the field and enjoyed a clear advantage over its non-hybrid competitors, he remained appreciative of what a remarkable achievement it had been. “It’s definitely very special,” he said. “Winning Le Mans is close to winning a world championship because the race is so iconic and so prestigious and winning the triple crown is a very attractive target as only one man in history has done it. I am also attempting to win the World Endurance Championship not only Le Mans and am already a world champion in F1 so it could be a super-triple crown.” Alonso has been struggling with an uncompetitive McLaren in F1 for the past three years and this season their car is still well behind the leading teams. Last year, he missed the Monaco Grand Prix to race at the Indy 500, when he led for 27 laps, until forced to retire with an engine failure on lap 179 of 200. A return to the Brickyard will now likely play a major part in his career choices. Alonso is in talks with McLaren about his future and the chief executive, Zak Brown, has hinted that a McLaren IndyCar project might be one he could pursue. His frustration with the lack of competition in F1 has been well-documented and he is known to be following the plans for new regulations proposed for 2021. He reiterated those concerns at Le Mans. “In F1, you just follow your team performance,” he said. “If your team is first you will be first or second. If your team is third you will be fifth or sixth. To be a more complete driver you need to win every series against the specialists in those series, to beat them in oval racing or in endurance racing, the guys that know every little trick. To be able to come here and be at that level is great.” Hill won Le Mans in 1972 for Matra, his 10th attempt at the grand prix d’endurance, and Alonso was full of praise for Toyota who had given him the tools to do the job on his debut, although the team have never won the race before, with 19 entries and five second-place finishes. “Toyota have deserved this,” he said. “Practice, qualifying and the race, achieved domination. It seems easy but there is a lot of work behind it, This year there was a lot of preparation, a lot of looking into details on what may go wrong. It was a perfect execution from everyone. I am sure it will not be the last.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"society/2018/jun/19/deaths-of-mentally-ill-rough-sleepers-in-london-rise-sharply","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-18T23:01:08Z","webTitle":"Deaths of mentally ill rough sleepers in London rise sharply","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/19/deaths-of-mentally-ill-rough-sleepers-in-london-rise-sharply","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/jun/19/deaths-of-mentally-ill-rough-sleepers-in-london-rise-sharply","fields":{"headline":"Deaths of mentally ill rough sleepers in London rise sharply","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Deaths of rough sleepers with mental health problems have risen sharply over the last seven years, prompting concern that specialist services are not reaching those who need them. Research released on Tuesday by the homeless charity St Mungo’s shows that four out of five (80%) rough sleepers who died in London in 2017 had mental health needs, an increase from three in 10 (29%) in 2010. The charity is calling on the prime minister to take urgent action to prevent more people dying on the streets and ensure that no death goes ignored. “This is a scandal and something the government needs to recognise and do more about ... there should be more funds and support for these groups but instead they have been cut over the years and that correlates in these people stuck living on the streets ... these deaths are preventable,” said Petra Salva, director of St Mungo’s rough sleeping services. Salva added: “The rise is because rough sleepers with mental health support needs end up sleeping rough and the help isn’t there and when it is there it is not quick enough ... access to help and support is getting harder and so the prevalence of death ... is increasing.” The charity called on the government to invest more in specialist support, saying that with NHS services “severely overstretched” this could sometimes be overlooked. “Research carried out by St Mungo’s showed that only 32% of the areas where 10 or more people are sleeping rough on any one night commission mental health services actively targeting people sleeping rough,” the report said. Speaking anonymously, one street outreach worker quoted in the report, said: “There is no on-street mental health services like there used to be. There is limited beds [sic] spaces for people who need sectioning/need short inpatient care. There is an issue with dual diagnosis and neither service wanting to take responsibility,” Additionally, 70% of outreach workers surveyed by the charity said access to mental health support for people sleeping rough had got harder over the last five years, compared to just 5% who said it had become easier and 25% who said it stayed the same. The figures come amid concern about the growing number of homeless deaths and lack of reviews into what has led to them. Out of the hundreds of deaths that have occurred in recent years, reports suggest only eight have resulted in a review. The Guardian and the Bureau of Investigative Journalists revealed earlier this year that 340 homeless people died on the streets or in temporary accommodation in the last six years, surging from 32 in 2013 to 78 in 2017. A further 59 deaths have been recorded so far this year, already more than the whole of 2016. In the capital, the only place where a local authority actively records homeless deaths, 158 people died between 2010 and 2017, an average of one death a fortnight. Experts have warned that without official counts and reviews it’s impossible to determine why so many homeless people are dying and take action to prevent future deaths. The report also featured a survey of dozens of street outreach workers and 63% said they were aware of someone who had died while sleeping rough in their local authority area last year. However, only 23% had experienced a review being carried out. The number of people sleeping rough has risen by 169% since 2010. Last year in England more than 4,700 people slept rough on any one night, and a far larger number experienced rough sleeping during the course of the year. “With access to vital emergency accommodation and support services getting harder and harder, it is unsurprising that the number people dying on the streets is rising. Urgent action to provide rapid relief from rough sleeping is needed to turn this around,” the report stated. Matt Downie, director of policy and external affairs at Crisis, said: “In 21st-century Britain, nobody should be dying on our streets, especially when there is clear evidence to show that rough sleeping – and all forms of homelessness – can be ended. “Homelessness is a devastating experience. People sleeping on our streets – who are experiencing the most visible form of homelessness – are exposed to everything from sub-zero temperatures, to violence, to debilitating illnesses. And all of these dangers puts them at serious risk of death.” Howard Sinclair, the St Mungo’s chief executive, said: “This is nothing short of a national scandal. These deaths are premature and entirely preventable.” Sinclair said that he welcomed the government strategy set out by Sajid Javid to reduce the number of people sleeping rough. “The forthcoming strategy presents a vital opportunity to make sure no one else dies as a result of sleeping rough. We are calling on the prime minister to follow through on her commitment to end rough sleeping by making sure all parts of the public sector play their part, especially the health, justice and welfare systems,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/jun/18/bach-weekend-review-jean-rondeau-jean-guihen-queras","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-18T10:57:47Z","webTitle":"Bach Weekend review – fluent and fleet cello suites after artful Goldbergs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jun/18/bach-weekend-review-jean-rondeau-jean-guihen-queras","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/jun/18/bach-weekend-review-jean-rondeau-jean-guihen-queras","fields":{"headline":"Bach Weekend review – fluent and fleet cello suites after artful Goldbergs","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The spine of the Barbican’s Bach weekend was provided by John Eliot Gardiner’s three programmes of cantatas with the Monteverdi Choir and English Baroque Soloists, but the other events grouped around them were just as full of interest and novelty, too. A concert by Solomon’s Knot had included four of the motets, and Isabelle Faust and Kristian Bezuidenhout played violin sonatas, while the Goldberg Variations and three of the cello suites came from Jean Rondeau and Jean-Guihen Queyras respectively. Rondeau was a pupil of the celebrated harpsichordist Blandine Verlet, and seems to have acquired a cult following in his native France. But other than prefacing this performance of the Goldberg with a statement of the main theme that was almost overwhelmed by ornamentation, before then playing the aria as Bach indicated, there was little evidence of the eccentricity and irreverence on which that reputation has been based. In fact, it was a rather sober, deliberate affair, with tempi that were generally on the slow side. With most of the repeats observed, it lasted 75 minutes. By comparison, the later and more measured of Glenn Gould’s famous recordings clocks in at just 51 minutes. But it can’t just be the beard, long hair and casual clothes that get Rondeau’s fans so excited, and just occasionally there were glimpses of the kind of playing that suggests a real pedigree – in the perfectly balanced virtuosity with which he dispatched the bravura variations, for instance, and in the exemplary clarity with which he unfolded so many of the canons. But it was all so po-faced, so lacking in visceral excitement. Even the final variations, the quodlibet, had an almost funereal tread to it. After such self-consciously artful Bach playing, Queyras’s account of the first three cello suites came as rather a relief. His playing had a wonderful fluency and naturalness to it, without a hint of grandstanding or attention-seeking. Other interpreters perhaps dig more expressive profundity out of the sarabandes than Queyras did, especially in the second suite in D minor, and there were moments especially in the third suite, in C major, when his fleetness threatened to seem a bit glib, but it was wonderfully accomplished all the same."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/live/2018/jun/17/us-open-2018-day-four-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-17T23:02:34Z","webTitle":"Brooks Koepka wins US Open 2018 – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2018/jun/17/us-open-2018-day-four-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2018/jun/17/us-open-2018-day-four-live","fields":{"headline":"Brooks Koepka wins US Open 2018 – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"All that’s left is to post the leader board one last time ... and to thank you all for reading. Hope to see you in a month for the action at Carnoustie. Hey, if the pros thought Shinnecock Hills was tricky... +1: Koepka +2: Fleetwood +3: D Johnson +4: Reed +5: Finau +6: Shauffele, Hatton, Stenson, Berger +7: Simpson, Rose +8: Knox, Fitzpatrick, Z Johnson +9: Aphibarnrat +10: Matsuyama, Oosthuizen, Li, Casey The presentation ceremony ... and Brooks Koepka gets his trophy back! “I want to thank the USGA, they do a great job. [muted applause, followed by more platitudes] ... I would have taken five on 11 - hoo hoo hoo! I made an incredible four, I was dead ... to make those eight-to-ten foot par saves is sometimes better than making birdies ... to lag it up from 13 feet to win is tougher than it looks, I can tell you!” The runner-up Tommy Fleetwood - fourth last year, second this - speaks! Again! And what a magnanimous interview he gives. “The time went quick, funnily enough. It was fine. I enjoyed watching the golf. As a fan, it was good watching, how he handled himself down the stretch ... as a player who was one behind him, it wasn’t great to watch, but I have nothing but respect for him and enjoyed watching how he did it. It was time well spent. All in all, it’s been a great day.” All hail Brooks Koepka, then! The first man to retain the US Open since Curtis Strange in 1989, and the first to retain any major since Padraig Harrington kept hold of the Open jug in 2008. It’s a stellar achievement, which should in time help us forget the nonsense about the course set-up ... and Phil Mickelson’s rush of blood to the head. Koepka won this tournament with some brilliant all-round golf: he attacked, going on a birdie blitz in the second half of his second round to kick-start his bid, and today in the early stages of his round to earn himself a buffer; and he defended, out in the worst of it yesterday, and making some huge saving putts coming back today. It’s a comprehensive and well-deserved victory. He’s a major talent. Par for Daniel Berger, who signs for a 73 and ends a fine week at +6. A double for Tony Finau, who ends the day with a 72 at +5. A sad end for Finau, but he can take succour in the fact that’s back-to-back top-ten finishes in the majors. Finau had in fact sent his second into more filth, so hacks his third into sand. He splashes four onto the green. This is becoming an expensive denouement for Finau. Fleetwood will finish in second, a fitting reward for his final round of 63. Down the hole, Finau bashes out of the rough. He’ll have to hole his third from the fairway to deny Tommy Fleetwood - a couple of turns of a ball away from a 62 and a play-off - second place on his own. Brooks Koepka is the 2018 US Open champion! He tickles his first putt up to the lip, and taps in for a bogey. He ends with a 68 that was initially exhilarating, later steely. He’s become the first man to retain the title since Curtis Strange in 1989. Dustin gives him a big hug, as the crowd do their thing! There’s a bunker between Koepka’s ball and the flag. Out comes the lob wedge. He doesn’t faff around, just hits it. No time for the nerves to overwhelm him. And it’s a great decision, because he lobs onto the far-left edge of the green, and allows the ball to turn right down the slope, finishing roughly pin high, but 15 feet the other side of the hole. That’s a sensational shot in the circumstances. He’ll have two putts from there for the title, because back on the tee, Finau has lashed his drive into thick muck. Before he can take them, Dustin rolls a birdie putt into the cup and signs for a 70. “Oh no!” He sends a big hook towards the stand on the left! The ball takes a clatter off the hoardings, and bounces a few yards from the stand. So that’s a huge break, as it’s pinged back towards the green. But suddenly he’s become a little tense. With two shots in hand over Fleetwood - and Finau’s just missed his birdie chance on 17 - he’s got margin for error. But the pressure of winning a major championship, eh? Justin Rose finishes the week with a 73, at +7. Henrik Stenson shoots 71, ending up at +6. Back down the hole, Brooks Koepka prepares to hit one of the shots of his life, and ... Koepka sends his drive at 18 bouncing down the fairway. One more good shot, a couple of putts, and he’ll soon be crowned US Open champion again. Tony Finau knocks his tee shot at 17 to 15 feet, searching for a desperate birdie, just in case Koepka stumbles. DJ takes another long look at a long putt. This one’s just over 60 feet, in fact. And he leaves a dreadful effort ten feet short. Koepka’s up next, and his 25-footer looks like it’s going to drop for birdie, but it breaks right near the end. Dustin can’t make his par putt, and his US Open is over. He’s +4. It’s been a miserable weekend for the world number one. Finally Koepka tidies up, and he’s got a two-shot lead going up 18. Finau can only par 16 - he stays at +3 - so this really is the reigning champion’s tournament to lose now. Koepka looks in total control of his game and his emotions. He calmly sends his tee shot at 17 into the heart of the green. He’s 25 feet from the flag. DJ finds the green too, but he’s well short of the cup, facing a good 50 footer for a birdie that might apply a little pressure. Meanwhile up on 18, Reed’s brave bid dies: he can’t make his long birdie putt, and ends up carding a final-hole bogey after missing a tiddler. It’s a miserable end to a superb tilt at the title from the Masters champion. No grand slam of majors in 2018, then. A 68, and he ends the week at +4. It’s do or die for Reed at 18. He reaches the green in regulation, but his ball thinks about toppling off the front. It doesn’t quite, but he’s left with a huge rake if he’s to join Fleetwood in the clubhouse lead. Dustin’s 20-foot uphill putt is surely a must-make. He spends an age prowling around it, considering, contemplating. But he’s built it up too much, and pulls a nervous one left of the cup. Just a par. Meanwhile Koepka tips his little birdie putt into the centre of the hole, and this is beginning to look like his US Open! Meanwhile Finau can only par 15, while Berger, his race run, bogeys. E: Koepka (16) +2: Fleetwood (F) +3: Reed (17), D Johnson (16), Finau (15) +5: Berger (15) Dustin lifts his wedge in to 20 feet. He’ll have a good look at birdie. But Koepka will have a tiddler to go two clear at the top, because he pings a stunner of a chip to a couple of feet from 130 yards. That might just be the shot that won ... no, retained the US Open! Reed’s birdie effort at 17 is always going right, and always stopping just short. He’ll make his par, but he’ll need a birdie up the last to retain any sort of chance. Finau wedges his second at 15 pin high; he’s in similar territory to DJ, who made birdie a few minutes ago. And on 16, Johnson and Koepka take turns to lay up with their second. Much depends on the wedge shots coming up ... especially if Koepka goes close. Reed fires an iron at the par-three 17th straight at the flag ... but he’s a good 30 feet short. Back on 15, Finau smacks his tee shot down the middle. And on 16, DJ batters his drive down the centre of the fairway ... and Koepka follows. +1: Koepka (15) +2: Fleetwood (F) +3: Reed (16), D Johnson (15), Finau (14) +4: Berger (14) Reed wedges his third into the par-five 16th. It lands well short of the hole, and he can’t rake in the 45-footer for an outrageous birdie. Par, and he needs something at either 17 or 18 if he’s to tie Fleetwood and keep himself alive. A two-putt par for Koepka on 15, but DJ sends his second to seven feet and teases in the birdie putt. He’s back in business at +3! And back on 14, Berger races his first putt 12 feet past the hole, but nails the return to cling onto hope. He’s +4 still. Tyrrell Hatton pars 18, and signs for an excellent final-day 69. He ends the week at +6; that’s a top-ten finish at the US Open to go with his top tens at the Open and PGA in 2016. Meanwhile Tony Finau bangs a 370-yard drive down 14, then wedges his second to kick-in distance from 140 yards. He’ll move to +3, and his bid is back on! Koepka clips a fine chip at 14 eight feet past the pin. And he makes the par saver! He’s battled like hell since the 11th hole, his putter getting him out of some serious scrapes. And he’s still leading the tournament as a result! He’s within sight of becoming the first man to retain the US Open since Curtis Strange in 1989. But it’s slipping away from DJ, who leaves a 70-foot rake from the back of the green eight feet short, and pushes a timid par putt to the right. He’s going backwards at exactly the wrong time. +1: Koepka (14) +2: Fleetwood (F) +3: Reed (15) +4: D Johnson (14), Finau (13), Berger (13) +5: Stenson (14) Ian Poulter doubles the last, and signs for a 75. he finishes the week well off the pace at +12, having once tussled with the leading pack. In retrospect, his bid fell apart around the 8th green on Friday night, when he bladed a bunker shot over the green and ran up a triple bogey. But it’s been another street-fighting showing from a fine player enjoying a late-career renaissance. Koepka has a terrible lie, and can only blast his ball out, roughly 100 yards up the fairway. He’ll need to get up and down from 66 yards to save his par. Meanwhile Berger knocks his second at 13 to 12 feet, then watches in astonishment as his birdie putt horseshoes out at slow speed. And Reed rolls in a biggie across 15 to rise back to +3. It’s tight at the top! Koepka sends his drive at 14 into the deep fescue on the right. That ball took a couple of bounces, then disappeared; his lie is in the lap of the golfing gods. DJ, spooked, smacks an iron down the track. Meanwhile it looks like the end of the road for Rose, who finds sand with his tee shot on 14, was forced to splash out sideways, and ends up missing a 15-footer for his par. He’s +6. His partner Stenson birdies to pass him going the other way: he’s +5. The greens are getting bald, the greens are getting fast. And so Koepka’s right-to-left birdie putt, hit firmly, stays on the high side and dribbles four feet past. That’s a nervy one coming back, but in it pops. Par for Dustin, too. I wonder how fast the second hand on Tommy Fleetwood’s watch is going round right now? +1: Koepka (13) +2: Fleetwood (F) +3: D Johnson (13) +4: Reed (14), Finau (12), Berger (12) +5: Rose (13) Reed drives into sand down the left of 14. Up against the face, he can only hoick out short of the green. But he bumps his chip up to three feet, and escapes with a par to remain at +4. Back on 13, Koepka puts an end to a couple of shaky holes, lifting a wedge over the flag to eight feet and setting up a birdie chance. And on 12, a three-putt bogey for Tony Finau. He had a wedge in his hand from the centre of the fairway, only to come up well short of the flag, at which point his woes began. He slips to +4 and he can’t afford that sort of silly mistake at this stage. A needless bogey. More trouble for Koepka, who wings his tee shot at 12 into rough down the right, then sends a flyer through the green. But he whips a high lob back towards the flag, and will have a six-footer to save a brilliant par. In it goes. That’s the first time he’s avoided bogey on this hole this week; what a time to buck the trend! Dustin meanwhile sends his second to 16 feet ... but once again spurns a good chance, his putt sailing by, high on the left. Par. Rose lets a six-foot birdie chance tickle by on 14, too. +1: Koepka (12) +2: Fleetwood (F) +3: D Johnson (12), Finau (11) +4: Reed (13), Berger (11) Justin Rose started dismally: a double at 4 and a bogey at 5. But birdie at 6 meant he retained a faint glimmer of hope, and the lights have been turned up a further notch on 12, as he arrows his approach to three feet and tidies up for another birdie. He’s +5 and the 2013 champ will know nothing’s over quite yet. And here’s some illustration of that: Tony Finau rattles in a 40-footer up 11 for his third birdie in four holes! He’s +3. His partner Daniel Berger, who had gone close with his tee shot, sends his six-foot birdie putt to the right and remains at +4. Par meanwhile for Reed on 13. Xander Schauffele pars the last and signs for a 68. After tying for fifth spot at Erin Hills last year, it looks like he’ll be finishing in the top ten at a US Open again. Not a bad record from two starts in the competition. Meanwhile Russell Knox was in with a 69; he ended the week at +8. Koepka splashes out from the deep bunker, but only to 12 feet. He rattles in a stunning bogey putt, though. That was a big putt, and if it’ll not feel quite like a birdie, it’ll give him a boost considering the trouble he was in. Meanwhile DJ had sent his tee shot carefully into the centre of the green, perhaps spooked by the fate of his partner. He leaves his 30-footer for birdie six feet short - then yips the par putt. Oh Dustin! And not finished yet: Berger, who rakes a long birdie putt across 10. He’s +4, as is Finau, who pars. It’s all change at the top! +1: Koepka (11) +2: Fleetwood (F) +3: D Johnson (11) +4: Reed (12), Finau (10), Berger (10) +6: Rose (11), Schauffele (17), Hatton (14) +7: Simpson (17), Stenson (11) Reed bumps a lovely chip up 10 to six feet or so. He very nearly hit the flagstick again, but it misses and scoots past. He knocks in the return putt to limit his pain to bogey, but he’s +4. Meanwhile on 11, Koepka has to come out of the thick stuff and up the bank. He decides to punch up the hill ... and sends his ball flying through the green and into the sand on the other side. A new-look leader board coming up soon! Koepka’s tee shot at the par-three 11th is abysmal. Off down the bank to the left it goes, and snags in the thick stuff. It’s where Reed was a few minutes ago, and he needed a huge stroke of fortune just to limit the damage to bogey. Speaking of Reed limiting the damage to bogey ... he can only punch his third out of the rough to the fairway in front of the green. Meanwhile Matt Fitzpatrick signs for a 70: he ends the week at +8. Koepka makes his birdie putt, while Dustin only pars, and gets himself back to level. Meanwhile Reed flays his drive at 12 into thick oomska down the right, and can only hack further up the hole. He’s in danger of dropping a third shot in four holes. E: Koepka (10) +2: Fleetwood (F), D Johnson (10) +3: Reed (11) +4: Finau (9) Patrick Reed very nearly curls his right-to-left putt in. But that’s him dropping back to +3. Some good news for Tommy Fleetwood. Not such good news: a simply delicious second at 10 by Brooks Koepka to five feet. And Tony Finau isn’t giving this up, either: after his awful start, he follows up birdie at 8 with another at 9, and he’s turning in 36. And this is instructive: the back-nine performances of four players looking to usurp Fleetwood as clubhouse leader. Koepka has played the back nine in +6, Reed +4, Dustin even par, and Finau -3. Place your bets! Because this is beginning to look as though anything could happen. A big stroke of luck for Reed, who hits a hot chip up the bank at 11 and onto the green. It looks like bounding through and into the sand on the other side ... but twangs the flagstick and rebounds to the left, holding the green. He’ll have a 15-footer to complete an outrageous par save! Reed is in an awful place on the par-three 11th. He pulls his tee shot left, and it bounds down the big swale and into the semi-rough. That’s going to be a test and a half. Meanwhile birdie on 8 for Tony Finau, who moves up to +5 alongside his playing partner Daniel Berger. Those two, bringing up the rear, are hanging onto the coat-tails of the leading quartet. Just about. Koepka and Dustin swish their second shots into the heart of 9. Both have good looks at birdie from 15 feet or so. Koepka leaves his a couple of turns short. Par. He’s +1. Dustin has the chance of grabbing a share of Koepka’s lead from similar distance ... but lets that one bleed off to the left. Another par. Up on 10, Reed finds the dancefloor in regulation, and is left with a 26-footer. He’s not far away with his birdie effort, but he makes his par without fuss and stays at +2. “A par of 70 on a 7,000 yard course is a bit of a laugh,” suggests Hubert O’Hearn. “I say it’s par 72 and Fleetwood is in at -6. Anyone want to fight me on this?” Tommy Fleetwood speaks to Sky! How does it feel to be joining some of the US Open greats with a final-round 63? “That was more on my mind than where we were with the tournament! It is very cool. It is something very special. I thought about the 62 after about six or seven holes. I knew I had to shoot something really good. Early on, it was getting back into the tournament. Coming down the stretch, the 62. I felt really good, I hit it great. I’d love to hit the putts again on 16 and 18, but I can’t take anything back. I wouldn’t really change anything. I hit the putt on 18 I wanted to hit, I thought I’d made it, but the green’s so steep. I don’t think I’ve got a chance, I think it’s going to be one or two short. Unfortunately I’ve got the best players in the world up in front! There’s nothing I can do now. The greens late in the day aren’t as easy, the wind might pick up ... but if it was yesterday’s conditions I might feel a lot more confident! We’ll see. We’ll just wait and see!” Bounce-back birdie for Dustin Johnson at 8! He’s within one of the lead, because Brooks Koepka spurns a chance for a birdie of his own, lipping out from eight feet. His putter’s suddenly gone cold at the most inopportune time. And a three-putt bogey for Patrick Reed on 9. A first blemish on his card, though he’s still turning in 31. Meanwhile bogey for Finau at 7; Berger can only par. This is going to be a long two or three hours for Tommy Fleetwood, isn’t it. +1: Koepka (8) +2: Fleetwood (F), Reed (9), D Johnson (8) +5: Berger (7) And, y’know, it’s not easy out there. On 7, Koepka misses his short birdie putt, while Dustin fails to get up and down from the front. I wonder if the wind will pick up? Or if these greens dry out in the Saturday style? It’s not going to be easy out there. And Fleetwood’s in the clubhouse. With Reed, Koepka and Johnson all battling away, I guess the odds are against ... but you never know! +1: Reed (8), Koepka (7) +2: Fleetwood (F) +3: D Johnson (7) The Shinnecock Hills crowd gives Fleetwood a glorious ovation as he walks up to the green. The most popular Englishman in New York! An eight-foot, uphill, left-to-right slider. This is for the all-time low round in a US Open. He strides round the putt. Sizes it up. And ... it dies to the right at the death. Bah! But it’s still a stunning, superb, sensational 63! He looks disappointed right now, but soon enough he’ll realise how brilliant that was. He matches the best-ever US Open lowest rounds of Justin Thomas, Johnny Miller, Vijay Singh, Tom Weiskopf ... and Jack Nicklaus. Not bad company, huh? The crowd pour on the love. Whatever happens, he’s once again proved his world-class credentials. A fourth-place finish last year ... and what will happen today? He’s set a mark of 282, +2, and you never know. You just never know! Fleetwood whip-cracks a 5-iron from 190 yards straight at the pin! He’s got an eight-foot uphill putt to tie the best-ever round in a major championship, the 62 set by Branden Grace at last year’s Open. There’d be a nice symmetry to the story if he manages it, seeing Grace set the mark on Fleetwood’s home course of Royal Birkdale. God speed, Tommy Fleetwood! An appalling tee shot at 7 by Dustin Johnson. His iron lands on the front edge of the green, then topples back down the track. He’ll still have about 50 yards coming into this par three! Brooks Koepka makes no such mistake, clipping a wonderful shot to six feet, setting up a birdie chance. Meanwhile on 18, Tommy Fleetwood smashes his drive down the middle. A chip and a putt for a 62, then. No pressure! Koepka sends his tee shot into the rough down the right of 6. He does well to get his second greenside, but half-duffs his wedge, leaving himself well short of the cup. The 15-footer shaves the right of the cup, and he slips back into a share of the lead with Reed ... who has just found the centre of 8 in regulation, setting up another birdie chance from 20 feet. And a birdie for Berger on the par-five 5th. He’s slowly turning his US Open bid around. Birdie for Finau, too. +1: Reed (7), Koepka (6) +2: Fleetwood (17), D Johnson (6) +4: Berger (5) +5: Finau (5) Fleetwood whips his tee shot at 17 straight at the flagstick. The ball takes a hot bounce past, though, and he’s left with a 20-footer back up the hill. He can’t make it, but that’s another par, and if he makes a third in a row up 18, he’ll be signing for a 63. On the final day of a US Open! Yet another birdie for the Masters champion Patrick Reed! He sends his tee shot at 7 to 12 feet, and the putt never looks like missing! Five in seven! He’s +1. It’d be something to see Reed win this tournament, partly because he’d be halfway to the grand slam, but also because he took a ludicrous amount of flak after his Masters win. People criticised the supposed stodgy nature of his final round, but ignored the three days of brilliant golf that preceded it, plus the fact he’d closed it out calmly when Jordan Spieth and Rickie Fowler came racing at him late on. It was a magnificent performance. As for the personal stuff, well, he ignores it so let’s do that too. He’s a top talent, and whatever happens today, will be a factor in the majors for quite some time. Fleetwood’s second down 16 slips into the semi-rough down the left. But he swishes a wedge straight at the flag, leaving himself an uphill 12-footer for yet another birdie. But he doesn’t hit it. It was probably missing left anyway. That puts an end to his run of birdies. The first sign of nerves? Par meanwhile for Fitzpatrick on 13. Koepka lags his 60-footer up to tap-in distance. Wonderfully judged. That’s his third birdie of the day. Dustin has a 22-footer for his eagle, but that’s never going in. Both men settle for birdies. Par for Reed on 6. This is hotting up beautifully ... but threatening to turn into a four-man race. E: Koepka (5) +2: Fleetwood (15), Reed (6), D Johnson (5) +5: Fitzpatrick (13), Stenson (5), Berger (4) Daniel Berger stops the rot with par at 4. He stays at +5. But his fellow traveller in the final group continues to slide: a third bogey in a row for Tony Finau, who slips to +6. Meanwhile four big booms down 5, and both Koepka and Dustin are on the par-five green with long eagle putts. Justin Rose splashes out from sand at the side of five to four feet. He looks to have salvaged his par after playing the hole in the slapdash style ... but he pushes the short putt wide right, and he’s off in the wrong direction at pace. He’s +7. Tommy Fleetwood hits an extremely average wedge into 15. It’s a rare mistake. But then he rattles in a 30-footer for his fourth birdie in a row! This is an astonishing run, and one which might stand him in very good stead if he can keep it going until the end. If he can post something low, and the sun and wind dry the greens out ... well, he could improve on last year’s fourth place at the very least. But let’s not tempt fate and get ahead of ourselves. God speed, though, Tommy! He’s +2, with the second par five to come! A third bogey in five holes for Ian Poulter, this time at 8, and at +10 he’s toast. Meanwhile Justin Rose, who doubled 4, is now in all sorts of trouble, hacking his way down the right side of 5. And bogey for Matt Fitzpatrick on 12, the result of a wide flay left from the tee. Although he found the dancefloor, he was 50 feet from the pin, and raced his first putt well past the cup. He’s back to +5. The final pairing are struggling. Tony Finau and Daniel Berger have followed up bogeys at 2 with bogeys at 3. They’re +5. Going the other way, though, is the Masters champ Patrick Reed. His second into 5 found the bunker, and his splash out wasn’t all that, but he’s sent the 20-foot birdie putt scampering into the cup, and the 118th US Open Championship, ladies and gentlemen, is on! +1: Koepka (4) +2: Reed (5) +3: Fleetwood (14), D Johnson (4) And in a flash, John is gone. Goodbye, John. And hello Tommy Fleetwood! He’s just raked one in from off the front of 14. That’s three birdies on the bounce, and suddenly Southport’s finest is tied for second! Matthew Fitzpatrick has the sniff of glory in his nostrils too, with birdie at 10. +1: Koepka (3) +3: Fleetwood (14), Reed (4), D Johnson (3) +4: Fitzpatrick Koepka’s next tee shot is wayward so work to do for him. The same will go for Johnson. Justin Rose ended up on the jaws between two bunkers from his drive and a bogey is the best he can hope for. His bump and run gives him a chance that he blows. Double bogey drops him to +6. Tommy Fleetwood’s charge on 14 might have been stopped by falling short of the green. Berger’s scramble shot to save himself on the third, having bogeyed the second, has him wringing his hands in agony. Reed finds a bunker, too. That lengthy sequence of goofs and poor luck is a reminder of just how tough this course remains. Koepka is two clear now at +1 after holing from close in but Johnson’s good work from the rough is undone by a missed birdie putt. Up the course, charging Tommy Fleetwood is five under for the round and just two off the lead after birdie on 13th. Patrick Reed is excited, too excited and that weird swing of his, as if he was trying to take his jumper off, is exacerbated as his ball wangs into the wilderness. The bunker beckons. Reed’s run come to its end with a putt on the fourth that squirts into a run away from the hole. Justin Rose’s putter is steady enough but not quite inspired. He will have to settle for par on the third. Dustin Johnson is out in Hazzard County in some thick rough but his saver shot, a low punch, is inspired. It gives him a fine chance for birdie. Koepka is just as close after a far more regulation effort. Koepka has the lead at +2 after a birdie on the second. Johnson couldn’t match him. Off the third, Johnson worries some spectators with a wild tee shot while Koepka’s shot bounces along merrily into safety. Patrick Reed plays another pearler to set up the quadpot of birdies. Further back in the field, Ian Poulter drops a shot on the par 5 fifth while Tommy Fleetwood on the 12th, has put himself within two of the lead. There are a huge amount of possibilities for the win and being a clubhouse leader might not be a bad state of affairs if, say, the wind picks up even more. John McEnerney in Barcelona emails in: “Big Henrik has the last day Major win experience &amp; he showed glimpses of his class yesterday. He’ll be there &amp; thereabouts today but that putter of his needs to stay hot. Pin placements today should produce some low scoring.” Reed now has a share of the lead after his third consecutive birdie. In the final pairing, Tony Finau and Daniel Berger are underway, with Finau going to first to stay safe off the tee, and the same for Berger, who landed the better angle. Justin Rose’s bunker shot is ambitious but is affected by a layer of sand that keeps him too short. But! He holes the par putt. Dustin Johnson lays up on the first with a measured long putt and has a gimme for par. Koepka, meanwhile, has the chance to take the lead but his putt has too much purchase. He and Johnson stay levels, you devils. Elsewhere, Patrick Reed is on one hell of a charge. And he has got the locals hollering and yahooing with his stroke play. Another birdie looks likely on the third. Stenson and Rose play that par 3 second. Stenson lands it on the green though has a way to go to make birdie. Rose, though, has plugged his in the sand. A rescue job required. Dustin Johnson’s wedge is topped a little from an unkind angle. He has two difficult putts to make par on the first. Popular Patrick Reed birdies the second and is within a shot of the lead. Behind them Dustin Johnson, 2016’s champion of course, blamms a three iron to the left of the fairway. Brooks Koepka, defending champ, and playing with his mate here, drills one into a similar position, yet probably behind Johnson. Rose’s first putt falls short but a par should be his. Rose’s second shot on the first lands on the green, and spins dead. Par looks on from that distance, though a birdie putt is far more of a problem. Stenson gave his shot a bit too much gas and narrowly avoided rolling on from the green. Rose has the better chance. Patrick Reed holes out on the first for birdie and then sets up another with a fine tee shot off the second tee. Tyrell Hatton also lands a birdie on the ninth. The putts are flying in compared to yesterday’s crazy golf on a rollercoaster but Ian Poulter says, “You are kidding me” as his shot lips into the bunker. Thank you, Scott. Henrik Stenson and Justin Rose go on the first tee. Stenson has the honour and the local yahoos acclaim a shot that booms into the centre of that mighty fairway. Justin’s effort is within yards of Stenson’s, though Rose, narrowly further behind, will play his wedge shot first. After missing short birdie putts at 1 and 2, Ian Poulter nearly makes a 30-footer on 3. But that’s a third par in a row, on a day when he needs a fast start. He stays at +7. And Tommy Fleetwood can’t rescue himself from the side of 9; a bogey, and an underwhelming end to his front nine, though he’s still out in 32. He slips to +6, and in all probability, that was a slip he simply couldn’t afford if he was to post something special, early doors. And with that slightly downbeat message, I’m off to chow down on a plate of Hamburger Helper, still the only MSG-flavored foodstuff to be marketed by a singing golf glove. Your pal and mine, John Brewin, takes up the reins! Charley Hoffman goes the wrong way, a ten-foot left-to-right curler lipping out at 3. He’s back to +8. Paul Casey is back to where he started the day, after coming up short at 7 and dropping another stroke. He’s +9 again. And trouble for Tommy Fleetwood at 9, as he sends his approach to the right of the green, his ball nestling in some pretty thick stuff. He’ll have his work cut out getting up and down from there. Ian Poulter responds to disappointment at missing out on birdie at 1 by creaming a long iron into the par-three 2nd. It rolls serenely up the green, sliding in from left to right, and stops four feet behind the cup. That’s a beauty. But another chance goes begging as he shoves his putt right of the hole. Par for Tommy Fleetwood at 8; he’d nearly made it three birdies in a row but his 25-foot putt stopped just short. He stays at +5. Par for Tyrrell Hatton at 1: he’s +7. And birdie for Matthew Fitzpatrick at 5; he joins the group at +6, just three off the lead. Poulter whips his second at 1 straight at the pin, then pumps his chest in a show of determination. But he misses the birdie putt and stays at +7. Grace can’t save his par, always in trouble after that loose tee shot, and he drops to +8. Meanwhile another birdie for the 2012 winner Simpson, at 3. The leader board has had its first serious shake-up! +3: Berger, Finau, Koepka, D Johnson +4: Rose +5: Fleetwood (7), Stenson +6: Schauffele (3), Simpson (3), Aphibarnrat, Reed, Furyk Another birdie for Tommy Fleetwood! He sends his tee shot at the tricky par-three 7th to ten feet, then guides home the left-to-right slider. He’s moving through the field at pace! He’s +5. Meanwhile Xander Schauffele lands his second at 3 pin high, but 20 feet left of the target. He can’t quite make the birdie putt, but that’s another drama-free hole for the young Californian. Fleetwood sends a gentle high draw into 6. It lands softly by the flag, and stops within kick-in distance. He’ll surely make a birdie that will lift him to +6. A dropped shot for Paul Casey at 4, though; he slips back to +8. And Ian Poulter is out, clapping an iron down the middle of 1. Branden Grace however finds the thick semi-rough down the left and might be in a little trouble from the get-go. Scott Piercy suffered terribly in the final group yesterday, shooting 79 as he and Dustin Johnson dragged each other down. He looks in much better nick today, though: birdies at 5 and 6 have sent him up the leader board to +7. A lot of red figures out there right now; there are birdies to be had out there. Hideki Matsuyama illustrates this point perfectly: he’s in with a 66, at +10 snatching the very early clubhouse lead from Rickie Fowler, who had posted that best-of-week 65 earlier today. One thing to note: most of Fowler and Matsuyama’s low scoring was done on the front nine. So it’s important to get a wriggle on quicksmart, Schauffele style. The 2012 champion Webb Simpson came back to prominence last month with his stunning romp round Sawgrass to win the Players. He’s been grooving himself into form this week, following up an opening-day 76 with a couple of 71s. And he keeps that momentum going with birdie at 1 today: he’s +7. Ditto his playing partner Zach Johnson: the 2007 Masters and 2015 Open champ birdies 1, moves to +7. Meanwhile another birdie for Schauffele, who sends a low draw into the long par-three 2nd, then strokes home the 13-footer he’d left himself. The fastest start, and he’s +6, just three off the lead. A lovely chip bumped up from the back of 2 by Matthew Fitzpatrick, and he’s saving his par. He remains at +7. But his playing partner Justin Thomas is heading the wrong way, missing a short par putt that drops him to +9. Joining Fitzpatrick at +7: Paul Casey, with his second birdie of the day at 3, and Xander Schauffele, who is a major winner in waiting, I’ll be bound, with birdie at 1. Brooks Koepka is aiming to become the first player since Curtis Strange in 1989 to win back-to-back US Open titles. If the 28-year-old Floridian manages it, he’ll become only the seventh man in history to achieve the feat. And it’s quite an elite club: Willie Anderson, John McDermott, Bobby Jones, Ralph Guldahl, Ben Hogan and Strange. This sort of thing doesn’t happen often; we could be witnessing some rare golfing history today. Fleetwood is this close to making it three birdies in a row, at 4. But his putt from 15 feet shaves the side of the hole. He’s got the par-five 5th, statistically the easiest hole of the week, coming up. Behind him, Matthew Fitzpatrick comes out of the blocks quickly, sending a gorgeous second into the 1st green to four feet. He makes his birdie to move to +7, though he’s a bit aggressive with his tee shot at the par-three 2nd, and his ball scoots past the flag and topples off the back. That’s not a pin position you can have a pop at the USGA for, given the length of the hole: it’s playing at 264 yards today. A bad omen for Dustin Johnson. Whenever he’s held the lead after 54 holes of the US Open, he hasn’t converted his position to a victory. He led by three going into the 2010 edition at Pebble Beach, only to start duffing chips and winging drives onto the beach. He ended up shooting 82 as Graeme McDowell snatched the prize. Then in 2015 at Chambers Bay, he was tied going into the final day, but ended up missing a short birdie putt for the win, then yipping the one coming back to hand the trophy to Jordan Spieth. Third time lucky? Or is the 2016 champion somehow ill-starred in these particular situations? Another birdie for Fleetwood, this time the result of a 20-footer across 3. He’s already risen to +7. Russell Knox follows his lead by raking in a monster on 2; he’s +8. An opening birdie for Paul Casey: he’s +8. And Patrick Rodgers is back in the clubhouse with a 67. There’s definitely a score out there right now. But who will seize the day? Justin Thomas, maybe, who shot 63 last year at Erin Hills. He’s out and about now. Expect a bit of upward movement on the leader board soon, as the later groups begin to take to the course. A fast start for another links expert, Tommy Fleetwood. The son of Birkdale can only find the front fringe of the green at the long par-five 2nd, but rakes a 60-foot monster straight into the cup for his birdie. He smiles broadly, in the manner of a man who has decided he’s just going to go out and enjoy himself today. He’s +8. “I was dismayed at the greens yesterday,” begins Anthony O Connell. “They got so far out of control that I fear today will basically be a joke in the other direction. Someone could easily shoot a 63 looking at the early scores. The PGA tour sets up stupid easy courses then the USGA work in the complete opposite direction.” Fowler was going round with Phil Mickelson today. Lefty scribbles his name on a 69, milks the applause from his loyal fans, and ends the week at +16. And with that, the circus leaves town. Rickie Fowler sends his second at 18 to three feet, tidies up for birdie, and signs for a best-of-week 65. He finishes the week at +11 and will be ruing his total capitulation yesterday amid the carnage, when he shot 84. The plus side: Fowler is a links aficionado and this is all good preparation for the upcoming Open Championship. He really is due a major. Millions will be wishing him all the best at Carnoustie. Some pre-action reading: “I’ve recently finished a blog about Ray Floyd’s win at Shinnecock Hills in 1986,” writes our man Steven Pye. “A triumph for the 43-year-old after an uncharacteristic collapse at the Westchester Classic the week before, and more disappointment for Greg Norman in the year of his Saturday Slam.” With such a crowded leader board, there’s a fair chance this could end in a play-off. A reminder that, should it happen, we won’t be going to 18 holes on Monday, in the traditional style. The USGA have adopted a new format, and it’ll be a two-hole aggregate play-off on 17 and 18. Should the scores still be tied after that, they’ll keep playing 17 and 18 on a sudden-death loop. I have a feeling that this one is going all the way. Anyone for some actual golf? Yay! First out today, with a marker, Andrew Johnston. Poor Beef had to put up with a lot yesterday, as Lefty lost it, and shot 82 as a whirlwind whipped around his bemused but highly amused head. “I looked at him and was like: ‘Is this actually happening?’ I said to him: ‘Sorry but I can’t help but laugh at that, it’s one of the funniest things I’ve ever seen.’ I’ve never seen anything like it.”) Still, he’ll have some story to tell the grandkids. And he’s finished his third US Open in positive fashion, with birdies at 15 and 16. He’s back in the house with a 71, the gallery sending this popular man off with the ovation he deserves. He ends the week at +19. God speed, Beef. Rich Beem, the 2002 PGA champion turned Sky commentator, reckons 17 out of 18 pin placements today are absolutely fine and dandy. The only one he’d question is 7, but there’s nothing you can do on that Redan green anyway, it’s a fault of the course architecture. Mike Davis of the USGA meanwhile has said his team were initially happy with the set-up yesterday, but it went wrong in the latter stages of the day because the wind got up more than they’d expected, drying the greens out. Hence all this preemptive action ahead of the final day’s play. And even if it does dry out in similar style this afternoon, the kinder placements should at least offer a little succour. Fingers crossed, then! The USGA have also pumped “appropriate levels” of water - i.e. large quantities - onto the greens for “turf health and firmness”. Accordingly, they’re going to be on average “10 to 12 inches slower than rounds two and three”. They’ve also adjusted the pin positions according to “agronomic data”, so hopefully those won’t be as punitive today. In other news, Phil Mickelson told Butch Harmon this morning that he “kinda lost it” yesterday. He also reportedly offered to withdraw, but the USGA weren’t having it, though no doubt we’ll be hearing more from both sides down the line. Do all these early birdies suggest the course is playing fairer today? Perhaps best to wait a while: it was giving up scores yesterday morning, too, and look how that panned out. The weather forecast is for sun and a bit of wind ... much like yesterday, then. But the pin placement on 15 doesn’t seem half as daft today, so that’s one in the bag from the get-go. Let’s see how this pans out. Hideki Matsuyama, like Rickie, is surely going to become a major champion one day soon. Like Rickie, he’ll have to wait a bit longer, after a hope-shredding 79 amid the mayhem yesterday. The Japanese star initially went backwards today with bogey at 2, but then followed it up with four birdies on the bounce. Matsuyama either blows hot or cold with the putter; this morning he was on one of his sizzling streaks. Another birdie at 9, and he’s reached the turn in 31 strokes, too. He’s +10. Mickelson was out in 32 this morning. Though he’s since bogeyed 11, he’s two under for his round through 12 right now, +15 for the championship. Also eating up the front nine this morning: Rickie Fowler. A disastrous 84 yesterday put paid to Rickie’s hopes of landing that elusive first major, but he’s going like the clappers today. Birdies at 5, 7, 8 and 9, and he’s reached the turn in 31 strokes. He’s +12 overall. Here we go, then ... and where shall we start? How about [plucks random name from the ether] Phil Mickelson? You could make an argument that his slapshot on 13 yesterday afternoon is destined to become the defining shot of this US Open. Maybe. But this morning he’s made a more traditional application to the canon. From the centre of the par-five 5th fairway, he whipcracked a long iron from 275 yards to 18 inches, then tapped in for eagle. The gallery, needless to report, are still four-square behind Lefty, and celebrated accordingly. It was such a gorgeous shot, his ball landing just short of the green and trundling towards the flag in the links style. Shades of his Muirfield pomp. He might have lost it yesterday, but he’s not lost it. Well, Moving Day sure escalated quickly. The US Open, folks! There’s not another tournament like it! But how about that Phil Mickelson shot? No, not his hockey-puck slap on the 13th. The one on 18, off the back of a green everyone else had been tentatively nudging their ball down, lest it slide ten feet past the hole and they three-putt. He opened up his lob wedge, took a full-blooded swing, sent his ball a thousand miles into the air, and landed it softly by the flag. The ostentatious, showboating shot of a singular man who had nothing left to lose, had already made his grand statement, and fancied making another. If ever there was a middle finger to the USGA, it was surely that. It’ll be unfashionable to say so, the way internet debate is framed these days, but you can see both sides. On the one hand, Mickelson’s behaviour was petulant, and ran counter to the spirit of golf; then again, he made his point, and in spectacular style. And perhaps more importantly, seeing sport is supposed to be a distraction from the everyday drudgery of existence, it was very funny to watch, as his easy-going playing partner Beef was quick to point out afterwards. Jaw-dropping entertainment. Nobody died. As for the actual debate regarding the set-up of the course, to which Mickelson was referring via the medium of contemporary dance? Well, a couple of pin positions were ludicrous yesterday, no doubt, the 15th especially, where exquisitely played, delicate chips were rolling slowly past the cup then picking up speed and toppling 50 feet down a huge bank. Generous landing spots on the greens are at a premium. And boy is that rough thick. But some players have been making no adjustments to their usual target-golf Tour tactics of boom and chip. Like an Open Championship links, Shinnecock Hills requires a new way of thinking. And nobody said the US Open should be easy. The way things are going this week is much closer to the USGA’s ideal of Level Par Wins, than the recent birdie-fests at Erin Hills, Pinehurst and Congressional. But like I say: you can see both sides. That’s a reasonable way to go about life, isn’t it? Hey, whatever your opinion, you can’t deny Moving Day was one heck of a thrill. The leading pack came back to Daniel Berger and Tony Finau, who had shot 66s early in less windy, less parched conditions. The 36-hole leader Dustin Johnson crashed to a 77, though did very well to regain his composure in the worst of it after going out in 41. And so, given that Arnold Palmer won from seven back in 1960, there are a fair few people who will fancy their chances of winning this today. Maybe not Phil, mind you. +3: Berger, Finau, Koepka, D Johnson +4: Rose +5: Stenson +6: Aphibarnrat, Reed, Furyk +7: Gay, Meyer, Hatton, Grace, Poulter, Hoffman +8: Woodland, Simpson, Z Johnson, Schauffele, DeChambeau, Thomas, Fitzpatrick +9: Molinari, Casey, FOx, Knox, Henley, Fleetwood, Piercy +10: Steele, Cabrera Bello, Howell . . . +17: Mickelson Anyway, it’s on!

Set the tone neatly. Player of the week A solid start from Cristiano Ronaldo – scoring three from four shots, and mocking David de Gea’s beard with a treat for British fans of a certain age: a rarely seen 1980s’ playground Jimmy Hill/Chinny Reckon goal celebration. Goals of the week Nacho against Portugal, Ronaldo’s free-kick, Denis Cheryshev’s double on day one, Sergio Agüero against Iceland. But none of them matched the audacity of Aziz Bouhaddouz’s 95th-minute diving header clearance for Morocco, which duly rasped into his own net. The stuff of nightmares. Dramatist of the week Was Uruguay’s Luis Suárez – nailing a rare double dive in their win over Egypt: going to ground waving, bouncing up into Ahmed Hegazi’s groin, then going down waving again. Plenty more to come from him. Freeze-frame of the week The expression on Lee Dixon’s face when Mark Pougatch asked him to analyse Russia 2018’s geopolitical backdrop for ITV on day one. He went with: “Everyone is aware of what’s going on. But now it’s football’s time.” Best-observed tradition An ITV apology for an advert mix-up: a big part of any football showpiece. They got in early this year after mistakenly running ads over the first 30 seconds of Russia v Saudi Arabia online. It lacked the comic timing of 2010’s effort, though: a Hyundai ad played in place of England’s opening World Cup goal. Best new unit of measurement Came from ITV’s Argentina v Iceland commentator Sam Matterface, getting Twitter worked up with his introduction for sub Cristian Pavón: “He’s only 5ft 5in tall, which is the same height as Kirsten Dunst, or Mel from Mel and Sue.” Anticipation of the week Was the wait for Jonathan Pearce’s first encounter with VAR, following his 2014 battle with goal‑line technology. His opening week highlight was this response to Suárez scuffing the ball wide against Egypt on Friday: “1-0 Uruguay! No! The referee’s disallowed it!” Lawsuit of the week As threatened by Saudi Arabia’s General Sports Authority: a pledge of “necessary legal action” against BeIn Sports over the “one-sided” coverage of their 5-0 defeat. Officials said pundits were unduly political and positive towards Russia. “This [justifies our] banning this network from our soil.” Coup of the week São Paulo-based broadcaster VTV, signing ex-Brazil president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva as star match analyst. VTV say Lula – jailed for 12 years for corruption in April – “will write down his impressions” in his cell, “then we will put them on the screen”. Pose of the week England’s squad, modelling their official £264 M&amp;S World Cup merino wool suits featuring “patriotic red, white and blue trim”, which, it later turned out, were manufactured in Cambodia. M&amp;S denied it clouded the message. “It allows us to offer our customers the best value for money.” Clip of the week Was this viral footage: Uruguayan schoolchildren bursting out of their classroom after José María Giménez’s late winner. Reflexes of the week Were displayed by Poland’s Michal Pazdan – reacting to a TV lighting stand falling towards the journalist who was interviewing him by kicking it to safety before it could hit her. More grist for his “Kung Fu Pazdan” nickname. Eye roll of the week Iceland coach Heimir Hallgrímsson – showing the first signs of growing tired of being asked the same question. “Yes, I am still a dentist. I will never stop being a dentist.” Wisest animal This year’s Paul the Octopus, St Petersburg-based cat Achilles, made a smart first decision. Offered two bowls of food by his Russian handlers he chose the one with the Russian flag. His loyalty will be tested again on Tuesday. And one to watch Mexico City’s “Great Warlock” Antonio Vázquez, revealing he’s put a positive hex on his side to “guarantee” a win today against Germany. Vázquez says he’ll build on his London 2012 success where he rightly tipped a 2-1 win for Mexico in the football final while “spraying spiritual balm” at journalists. Mexican media advised caution: “His previous tips have been less successful.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/jun/14/uk-sport-change-funding-olympic-paralympic-games","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-14T18:06:00Z","webTitle":"UK Sport urged to change funding model for Olympic and Paralympic Games","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jun/14/uk-sport-change-funding-olympic-paralympic-games","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jun/14/uk-sport-change-funding-olympic-paralympic-games","fields":{"headline":"UK Sport urged to change funding model for Olympics and Paralympics","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The governing bodies of 12 British sports have demanded an end to a funding policy that puts Olympic medals above all else. Describing the current model as “divisive”, the bodies – which include Badminton England and GB Wheelchair Rugby – have called on UK Sport to apply “at least a baseline level of funding” to all Olympic and Paralympic sports. In a letter to the Guardian the 12 also challenge UK Sport’s current consultation on future strategy. “It seems designed to create fear that there will be a total collapse of the UK medal tally should the current funding model be meddled with,” it read. “We believe that giving many millions of pounds to some sports but none to others is divisive and will prove self-defeating. We think the British public believes in fairness and equality of opportunity, and the best way to achieve this is to provide at least a baseline level of funding to all Olympic and Paralympic sports. We are confident that this can be achieved without sacrificing current medal success.” Great Britain has enjoyed unprecedented success at the Olympic Games since the no-compromise approach to funding was introduced in 2004. At Rio 2016 Team GB won 27 gold medals and finished second in the table. In so doing they also became the first country to improve their medal tally at five consecutive Games. This success has accompanied a narrowing of funding, however. While 70% of Olympic and Paralympic sports were funded at London 2012, less than 50% are expected to receive public money before Tokyo 2020. None of the 12 bodies that signed the letter to the Guardian will be funded during that cycle. While the group argue that a new approach need not be at the expense of medals, they also make the case for changing the criteria upon which funding is based. “UK Sport has a responsibility to ensure that all our Olympic and Paralympic athletes are encouraged to achieve their potential and that a system of development opportunities should be there for all of them”, the group argue. “The popularity and levels of participation of a given sport are key to inspiring a nation and must be considered when funding decisions are made,” the bodies argued. UK Sport launched a public consultation on post-Tokyo funding this month, asking respondents to consider how funding can contribute to the government’s current sports strategy of “using high-performance sport to promote inspiration, participation, economic growth and social impacts such as on physical and mental health in society”. Its board will announce its decision in ‘early 2019’ and any changes will be implemented by April 2021. The 12 signatories were: Archery GB, Badminton England, Baseball, Softball UK, British Fencing, British Handball, GB Luge, GB Wheelchair Rugby, Table Tennis England, British Volleyball, British Weightlifting and British Wrestling."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jun/15/morning-mail-trump-lawsuit-world-cup-opener-reef-pollution","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-14T21:06:20Z","webTitle":"Morning mail: Trump and children hit with lawsuit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jun/15/morning-mail-trump-lawsuit-world-cup-opener-reef-pollution","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jun/15/morning-mail-trump-lawsuit-world-cup-opener-reef-pollution","fields":{"headline":"Morning mail: Trump and children hit with lawsuit","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Good morning, this is Richard Parkin bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Friday 15 June. Top stories New York’s attorney general has filed a suit against Donald Trump, three of his children and his charitable foundation alleging that the family used charitable assets as “little more than a checkbook for payments to not-for-profits” from Trump and his companies. Foundation assets, acquired through tax-deductible donations, were used to settle legal claims against one of Trump’s golf clubs and to buy a painting of Trump to be displayed at another club, the suit alleges. The lawsuit, filed by Barbara Underwood, seeks $2.8m in restitution and penalties from Trump and asks for the distribution of $1m in assets to other charities, as well as seeking to dissolve the Trump Foundation and bar the Trumps from serving on the boards of any charitable organisations. Trump has categorically denied the charges, claiming them to be the politically motivated actions of “the sleazy New York Democrats”. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Friends and colleagues have paid tribute to young comedian Eurydice Dixon, remembering her as a talented performer and “remarkable” young woman with a bright future. Dixon’s body was found on Wednesday morning in Melbourne’s Princes Park. A man has been charged with her murder. The comedian Nicky Barry said Dixon was a “joyous and independent spirit” who was dearly loved by those who met her. “She was often someone who provided an ear and some wise words to others when they were having a hard time,” Barry said. “She was a really remarkable young woman. She was a very talented comedian. And she really had just started to find her feet as a performer.” Angela Merkel has come under intense pressure to tighten Germany’s refugee policies or risk the collapse of her coalition government as an increasingly urgent argument over how to handle irregular migration rattles Europe. Merkel has called immigration “a litmus test for Europe” requiring “a truly unified approach”, but faces pressure from within her own conservative bloc. Pope Francis also weighed in on the debate, demanding more cooperation on refugees and a “change of mindset” from politicians everywhere. Four rivers are most responsible for polluting the Great Barrier Reef, according to research that scientists hope will help governments better target efforts to reduce damage to the reef from land use. After climate change, poor water quality is the biggest threat to the reef, with the Burdekin, Fitzroy, Tully and Daintree rivers responsible for carrying dissolved inorganic nitrogen into the ocean, stimulating the growth of algae, which can smother corals. The lead author, climate scientist Nick Wolff, said: “We want to get pollution under control because we’re so fearful of climate change. This is one thing we can do in the very near term to build the resilience of the reef.” Argentina is a step closer to becoming the third Latin American nation to legalise abortion, after a vote narrowly passed its parliament in what has been acclaimed as a historic victory for the country’s women’s movement. Tens of thousands of women braved a freezing winter night to stand vigil outside the congress building in Buenos Aires during the marathon 20-hour debate. “Today we are a fairer country,” said an activist, Julieta Ortega. “We are very happy for us and for the young girls of today who will become the women of the future.” Sport Russia has blown away concerns about potential humiliation at home with an emphatic 5-0 win over Saudi Arabia in the opening match of the 2018 World Cup. Ranked 70th in the world and on a seven-game run without a win, the host nation burst out of the blocks, to the delight of 80,000 inside the Luzhniki stadium. The first day of the tournament went almost without a hitch for the hosts, although Robbie Williams provoked consternation by giving the finger to the camera during his performance at the opening ceremony. With Australia preparing to open their World Cup campaign against France on Saturday, several selections appear to remain up in the air. Will it be Andrew Nabbout, Jamie Maclaren or Tomi Jurić up front? Mark Milligan or Matthew Jurman at the back? Is there room for Mile Jedinak? What about young tyro Daniel Arzani? Guardian Australia’s football writers have their say on their preferred starting XI before the opener in Kazan. Thinking time Every year, the Bagala clan of the Jawoyn people opens their remote community of 350 up to more than 3,000 guests, who camp in their bushland backyards for Barunga festival: a celebration of music, sport and culture for Indigenous Australian audiences. Marking 30 years since the Barunga statement, this year launched with a historic agreement to negotiate a treaty with the NT’s four land councils – but the festival proper overflowed with significance for other reasons, with tributes to Dr G Yunupingu, an all-Indigenous music lineup, and the children of several NT legends stepping into the spotlight. Next month Tony Abbott is due to deliver the Bob Carter Commemorative Lecture to the Australian Environment Foundation. But what is the AEF? Graham Readfearn delves into the history of an “environment charity” that promotes views that wind turbines make you sick, that human-caused climate change isn’t really a thing, and that environmentalists are killing farmers, fisheries and the economy. In the wake of news that Australian troops in Afghanistan have been flying Nazi flags, the former infantry captain Bridget Clinch cautions against simplistic “rotten egg” assessments. “We have entrusted these soldiers to defend us and our way of life, not to become the monsters we have fought in the past,” she writes. “The source of the problem here is not the individuals, it is the culture and leadership, plain and simple.” What’s he done now? On his 72nd birthday, Donald Trump has taken the opportunity to wish two other beloved entities a happy birthday; the US army, and the US flag. Meanwhile, the president’s praise for Kim Jong-un continues to draw rebuke after Trump dismissed Kim’s shocking human rights record, stating “a lot of other people [have] done some really bad things”. Media roundup The front pages of the Herald Sun, the Age and the Australian are dedicated to the young comedian Eurydice Dixon, whose body was found after she failed to return from a standup gig on Tuesday.

A yellow digger is parked outside, construction workers throw sandbags over their backs, and thick black tubes stretch from high windows to the ground like the legs of a giant octopus. Inside, a foreman in a baseball cap sits behind a desk at a laptop. “Going good,” he says. This will be the luxury home of Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon, owner of the Washington Post and would-be first man on Mars. A sign on the corner of S Street in the swish Kalorama neighbourhood still points to the textile museum that occupied the 27,000 sq ft property before Bezos bought it for $23m. Along the row there are flags and signs supporting immigrants and gay rights; there are diplomatic outposts including the Irish ambassador’s residence. On one doorstep, the inevitable: a package from Amazon. Renovation of the Bezos mega-mansion is due for completion in September 2019, granting the multibillionare ready access to the Post’s state-of-the-art headquarters on K Street and, potentially, Amazon’s second HQ, for which Washington and surrounding areas are pushing hard. In a city where Donald Trump occupies the White House and owns a huge five-star hotel, it appears the stage is set for an epic battle: the world’s richest man versus its most powerful. For two and a half years Trump has launched Twitter attacks against Bezos, spuriously claiming Amazon benefits from billions of dollars in subsidies from the US Postal Service while dodging the taxman. Few doubt the president’s animus is truly motivated by Bezos’s ownership of the Post – a bastion of what he calls the “fake news” media – along with, perhaps, envy of his wealth. In March, Bezos topped the Forbes rich list for the first time with $112bn, making him the first person to break $100bn since Forbes began the ranking in 1987. Trump’s fortune dropped by about $400m to $3.1bn during his first year in office, leaving him as the world’s 766th-richest person – a fall of more than 200 places. “Bezos is as rich as he claims, Trump never was,” said Michael D’Antonio, a political commentator and author of The Truth About Trump. “He’s ranked many hundreds of places higher than Trump on the scale of wealth and he did it without any inheritance of the sort that Trump had. He’s respected in a way that Trump never was as a businessperson. He is circumspect in the way that Trump is not. He’s everything that Trump hates.” The men are a study in contrasting styles. One is defiantly bald, the other has a combover; one has a famously raucous laugh, the other seems allergic to laughing at all; one has an iron discipline in messaging and insists on six-page memos, the other is a verbal scattergun of provocations and self-contradictions and allegedly refuses to read briefing documents. Bezos founded Amazon as an online bookseller in 1994 and has expanded it to a retailer of breathtaking scale and range, including even groceries in brick-and-mortar stores after its $13.7bn purchase of Whole Foods Markets last year. It also runs data centres and makes TV shows and, some analysts say, is becoming dangerously big. Bezos, 54, has poured part of his wealth into Blue Origin, a maker of rockets that aims to lead space tourism. Its owner, whose father is a Cuban immigrant, has also donated to progressive causes such as same-sex marriage and to mostly Democratic candidates in elections. He bought the Post from the celebrated Graham family for $250m, five years ago. In a letter to its employees, he urged two kinds of courage: “The first is the courage to say wait, be sure, slow down, get another source. Real people and their reputations, livelihoods and families are at stake. The second is the courage to say follow the story, no matter the cost. While I hope no one ever threatens to put one of my body parts through a wringer, if they do, thanks to Mrs Graham’s example, I’ll be ready.” This was a reference to former publisher Katharine Graham who, during the paper’s digging into Watergate scandal in the 1970s, was threatened by Richard Nixon’s attorney general, John Mitchell: “Katie Graham’s gonna get her tit caught in a big fat wringer if that’s published.” In an interview with Post editor Marty Baron in May 2016, Bezos elaborated: “I have a lot of very sensitive and vulnerable body parts but if need be they can all go through the wringer rather than do the wrong thing.” #SendDonaldtoSpace Bezos’s investment has reinvigorated the Post, enabling it to hire dozens of new reporters and take on the New York Times in an old fashioned newspaper war. Both have enjoyed increased readership in the Trump era. Both have attracted opprobrium as nodes of the anti-Trump resistance. Trump has attempted to conflate Amazon and the Post at least a dozen times, claiming that the paper is a lobbying tool to help the Seattle-based behemoth evade sales taxes. Back in December 2015, he tweeted: “If @amazon ever had to pay fair taxes, its stock would crash and it would crumble like a paper bag. The @washingtonpost scam is saving it!” Bezos, probably as sceptical of Trump’s electoral chances as anyone else, responded wryly: “Finally trashed by @realDonaldTrump. Will still reserve him a seat on the Blue Origin rocket. #sendDonaldtospace” By October 2016, the Trump threat had become real. Bezos told a conference in San Francisco: “He’s not just going after the media, but threatening retribution to people who scrutinse him. He’s also saying he may not give a graceful concession speech if he loses the election. That erodes our democracy around the edges. He’s also saying he might lock up his opponent. These aren’t appropriate behaviours.” Since the Republican insurgent’s shock victory, Bezos has followed the example of special counsel Robert Mueller by maintaining a sphinx-like silence and refusing to be baited. Nothing, it seems, infuriates the president more. D’Antonio said: “Trump doesn’t know what to do with someone who won’t play and it would be a grave mistake for Bezos to engage. He doesn’t have to. “Bezos is just ontologically the opposite of Donald Trump and that gets under Trump’s skin. What he really hates is someone who appears to be incorruptible. He reads that as being superior, haughty, holier than thou. It’s what he hates about Mueller: that Mueller is an emblem of rectitude. There’s no evidence that Bezos is anything but a tough business person.” Trump has upped the bombardment. Last year he pondered: “Is Fake News Washington Post being used as a lobbyist weapon against Congress to keep Politicians from looking into Amazon no-tax monopoly?” He has not yet bequeathed on Bezos one of his infamous nicknames but has come up with the formula: “Amazon Washington Post.” What is driving this? Sam Nunberg, a former senior adviser to Trump’s election campaign, said this week: “Amazon, Google and Facebook are essentially monopolies in different sectors; even Rupert Murdoch is trying to fight Facebook. Suddenly it looks like the whole country is going to be Amazon Valley. The president does not like monopolies – he likes competition.” As for Bezos, Nunberg said: “I think the president sure doesn’t like him but Bezos doesn’t like the president either.” The notion that Amazon is ripping off the US Postal Service (USPS) has been widely debunked. The Politifact website rated Trump’s claim false, noting that the Amazon deal must be at least a break-even venture because a 2006 law makes it illegal for the USPS to price parcel delivery below its cost. “Amazon isn’t causing the United States Postal Service to lose a fortune,” the website concluded. “In fact, it’s contributing to its biggest growth sector, package delivery. Deals like the one with Amazon brought in $7bn in fiscal year 2017.” Last month the Post reported that Trump has personally pushed postmaster general Megan Brennan to double the rate the USPS charges Amazon and other firms to ship packages. On Wednesday two Democrats, Elijah Cummings, ranking member of the House committee on oversight and government reform, and Gerald Connolly, ranking member of the subcommittee on government operations, rebuked the president and pointed out that Amazon is not receiving any preferential treatment. “It is highly inappropriate to use the authority of your office to attack a political rival and seek to impair his business financially,” they wrote. “It is even more inappropriate to launch such attacks using false claims that are not supported by the facts. The allegations you have made about Amazon and the Postal Service are inaccurate, and we ask that you correct the record.” Bezos and the Post also deny that he ever attempts to meddle in the paper’s editorial coverage. Baron told the New York Times in April: “I can’t say more emphatically he’s never suggested a story to anybody here, he’s never critiqued a story, he’s never suppressed a story. Frankly, in a newsroom of 800 journalists, if that had occurred, I guarantee you, you would have heard about it.” D’Antonio, the Trump biographer, said: “As far as I know, Bezos is hands-off with the Washington Post and that is something that Trump can’t understand. The fact that this person would have a commitment to a free press and, as a publisher, honour the separation of editorial and business interests is anathema to Trump. His very being is a rebuke to Trump, so it all makes sense to me. “If Trump owned a newspaper, it would be called The Daily Trump and he would have a front-page column. I have no doubt of that.” Overlapping interests Experts who have met Bezos and chronicled his career say he is unlikely to be fazed by Trump’s jabs. Brad Stone, author of The Everything Store: Jeff Bezos and the Age of Amazon, said: “He is extremely compelling, charismatic, incredibly intelligent, an incredibly disciplined communicator on behalf of the interests of his company. He doesn’t let emotions govern his responses. Everything is well articulated and thought out. It’s been honed at Amazon for decades.” Amazon will be aware that Trump is not forever, Stone added. “They do think over the long term, five or 10 years, and they probably have business ambitions with the government. This is not going to last for more than three or seven years. They probably view it as a squall and they’ll stay huddled under their umbrellas until it passes.” And even now, Trump v Bezos can be seen as a skirmish rather than all out war. The latter was among tech chief executives who met the president-elect at Trump Tower in New York in December 2016; with other tech chiefs, Bezos has also been to the White House. Amazon has continued to work with the White House on initiatives around cyber-bullying, artificial intelligence and first lady Melania Trump’s “Be Best” campaign. There are overlapping interests in space exploration. Tim Fernholz, author of Rocket Billionaires: Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and the New Space Race, said: “What is interesting about this feud is that Trump’s policies towards towards commercial space companies like Blue Origin have been very positive. Things are very rosy between Blue Origin and Nasa. This is flying below the radar of everything that’s happening.” Bezos has been obsessed with space since childhood, when he reenacted Star Trek scenes with friends. “With Blue Origin, Jeff Bezos is very personally invested and he goes to rocket launches,” Fernholz added. “I think the Washington Post is philanthropy, an experiment in digital media – he says Don Graham talked him into buying it – whereas he was talking about rockets since he was a kid. I think he is proud of the Post and excited about space.” Trump’s obsessive tweets are not likely to keep Bezos up at night, considering all the other complaints in Amazon’s in-tray, according to Fernholz. “People are worried about the way they treat their workers, worried about the taxes they pay and worried about what market they’re going into next. Jeff Bezos is the world’s richest man and he’s thinking five or 10 years ahead, so he’s got bigger problems than Donald Trump to think about.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/14/russians-and-brits-set-aside-differences-for-football-humour-and-pop","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-14T18:01:25Z","webTitle":"Russians and Brits set aside differences for football, humour and pop","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/14/russians-and-brits-set-aside-differences-for-football-humour-and-pop","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/14/russians-and-brits-set-aside-differences-for-football-humour-and-pop","fields":{"headline":"Russians and Brits set aside differences for football, humour and pop","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"In London’s diplomatic quarter on Thursday, it was finally time for Brits and Russians to put aside poison, politics and pointed accusations and celebrate the many things that they have in common: a sense of humour, the beautiful game and Robbie Williams. And 52 years of hurt. Yes, Russians enjoyed their footballing high-water mark in 1966 too, when they competed as the Soviet Union, oligarchs and Robbie Williams hadn’t been invented and even Vladimir Putin was just a scrappy teenager. Since then, it has been one long chorus of pain walking down a one-way street. Russia have been even harder to watch than England. As three dozen students, expats, pensioners and officials gathered at the Kensington offices of Rossotrudnichestvo (a Russian cultural cooperation body similar to the British Council in almost every respect apart from one: it is still open), there was a sense that this was not just about the action on the pitch, but the whole spectacle. “Our football is our frustration,” said one Russian fan, a long-term London resident who has changed his name to James Grey. “We do not have the best team,” he said. “But it is an important moment for Russians – Russia will be the best host ever, safe and secure, you will see.” Elena Doroshenko, who has lived in London for 15 years, agreed. “It gives us a special feeling of pride, a national consolidation,” she said. “The event has a special value for the country and popularity of Russia and our way of life and our people. We are a very welcoming people.” And so the crowd started watching in the peculiar surrounds of a cultural centre, a grand piano in one corner, and paintings by Soviet artist Oleg Kudryashov on the walls. It was all very English, really. There were heads in hands half the time, hoping against hope, and ready to scoff and laugh when things get a bit ugly. There was much head shaking during a scrappy first half and raucous laughter at the diplomatic highlight, when Putin consoled his Saudi guest Mohammed bin Salman with a no-hard-feelings handshake. The relief when Yury Gazinsky opened the scoring was palpable, and by the end all was forgiven when Aleksandr Golovin hammered in the fifth, and strangers were saluting each other like old friends. For Anton Chesnokov, the head of Rossotrudnichestvo in London, it was a fitting end to a busy day that started with a cultural event on bilingualism with Russian and British educators. Here is a man with a tricky job: keeping up the battle for hearts and minds while the diplomacy turns to novichok. “The more difficult the political situation, the more important our work is,” he said. “But here the World Cup can help, by showing Russia’s visitors a good time. “From what I’ve seen the reception for the English has been great. It’s the best month to visit Russia, it’s warm, people will embrace the culture, they can travel freely.” And the Russian team? “We hope they will perform well to get out of the group and bring joy and fun for Russians. “But the main purpose of the event is for the world to meet in Russia.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/14/the-guardian-view-on-universal-credit-fix-this-cruel-expensive-fiasco","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-14T23:01:02Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on universal credit: fix this cruel, expensive fiasco | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/14/the-guardian-view-on-universal-credit-fix-this-cruel-expensive-fiasco","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/14/the-guardian-view-on-universal-credit-fix-this-cruel-expensive-fiasco","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on universal credit: fix this cruel, expensive fiasco","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The language is descriptive; the tone is dry. The authors are auditors and civil servants, and their evaluation of universal credit will have been scrutinised by Department for Work and Pensions officials before its release. But there is no mistaking the meaning of today’s report. Eight years after the flagship welfare project was launched by Iain Duncan Smith, the verdict from the public spending watchdog is in: it is a fiasco. Not only is it not working now, after £1.9bn has been spent. The National Audit Office sees no reason to believe that it ever will. The original promise, that 300,000 unemployment benefit claimants would get jobs, is impossible to measure. The savings supposed to be generated by efficiency and the reduction of fraud have not materialised. These two pledges – that more people would work; that public money would be better spent – were the point of this programme. That neither is deliverable is a disaster. But it gets worse, because the NAO also says there is no way back. With 10% of 8 million claimants moved across to universal credit so far, on two separate pathways involving different software, and more than 7 million to follow, we are stuck between a rock and a hard place. As the work and pensions select committee chair, Frank Field, put it, there is now a “mega cost to scrap it and a mega cost to the taxpayer to continue”. Just how mega depends on whether the DWP’s predictions about what happens next turn out to be right – whether, for example, the cost per claim plummets from £699 to £173, and the number of claimants verifying their identities online shoots up from 38% to 80%. The NAO’s verdict on such optimistic projections: “Universal credit may cost more to administer than the previous system of benefits it replaces.” The human misery brought about by the changes requires a different form of accounting. Yesterday the high court ruled in favour of two severely disabled men whose benefits were cut when they moved into a universal credit area. The government is applying to appeal. This will surely not surprise the auditors, whose report draws attention to the defensive, combative stance taken by the DWP towards its critics – and taken again today in a statement insisting that everything is “on track”. Since the Guardian’s first reports on the pilot areas in 2015, it has been clear both that there were flaws in the system’s design, and that some claimants were finding it difficult to navigate. The inbuilt delay of five weeks before the initial payment is one problem, since this leaves people without any money. Another issue is rent. Whereas housing benefit was paid direct to landlords, universal credit is paid to claimants, and there is evidence that increasing numbers have found themselves in arrears. That the DWP doesn’t want to know about any of this is all the more shortsighted since there was, and remains, a cross-party consensus that a simpler benefits system is a good idea (and Liberal Democrats were in the cabinet alongside the Conservatives when it began). There are principled objections to the new regime, as well as to the cuts that have exacerbated its punitive aspects. But the government can no longer dismiss all criticism as political. It has to get a grip. Since Mr Duncan Smith resigned in 2016 there have been four work and pensions secretaries. Esther McVey has been in post just a few months, as has the permanent secretary Peter Schofield. As a first step, the government must admit that it has got universal credit wrong, and set about limiting the damage."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2018/jun/15/can-scotland-save-its-wildcats-from-extinction","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-15T15:52:17Z","webTitle":"Can Scotland save its wildcats from extinction?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jun/15/can-scotland-save-its-wildcats-from-extinction","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/jun/15/can-scotland-save-its-wildcats-from-extinction","fields":{"headline":"Can Scotland save its wildcats from extinction?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Set deep in mixed woodland of Scots pine and birch, near the banks of the river Beauly in Inverness-shire, several huge, concealed pens contain two breeding pairs of Scottish wildcat. Wildcats mate from January to March, and their high, anguished breeding calls through the dark winter nights are thought to have inspired tales of the Cat Sith, a spectral feline of Celtic legend that was believed to haunt the Highlands. “It is a cry that carries over quite a distance and it is spine-chilling if you hear it in the middle of the night,” says Sir John Lister-Kaye, renowned nature writer and director of the Aigas Field Centre. The former Victorian sporting estate, which now offers conservation holidays and environmental education, is one of 20 sites currently participating in a conservation breeding programme led by the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland (RZSS). “I’m sure that if there were other wildcats nearby they would have been attracted to the calls. But since we started in 2011 we’ve had foxes, pine martins, badgers, one or two domestic cats come and have a look – but not a single wildcat anywhere near.” The Scottish wildcat is now one of the most critically endangered wild mammals native to the UK, according to a comprehensive analysis by the Mammal Society released earlier this week, which estimated the population at 200 but accepts that the figure may be significantly lower. “I think it’s desperate,” says Lister-Kaye, who believes the population in the wild may have dwindled to the low tens. “We’re at the last possible moment to try and recover this species from extinction.” He is currently awaiting the birth of more wildcat kittens – the pairs have successfully produced six live offspring since they were homed at Aigas, while a further 71 live in captive breeding programmes around the UK, coordinated from the RZSS Highland Wildlife Park near Aviemore. Wildcats may look distinctive with their muscular bodies, flat faces and thick, blunt tails, but they are are notoriously difficult to monitor, as Roo Campbell of Scottish Wildcat Action (SWA) explains: “They are so secretive. They are one of a few mammals that have proper cryptic camouflage, this brown, buff and black striping that breaks up their outline. They can really hide themselves and move around without being seen.” Based 10 miles to the east of Aigas, in Inverness, SWA was set up by the Scottish government agency Scottish Natural Heritage in 2015 to implement a five-year national conservation plan to restore a viable population of wildcats north of the Highland fault line. Tracking difficulties are compounded by the problem of reliably distinguishing between a wildcat and a hybridised cat, the result of a wildcat breeding with a feral or domestic cat. While the SWA will pay for farm or domestic cats living near suspected wildcat habitat to be neutered, as well as vaccinating feral cats in order to curb exposure to feline diseases, most specialists accept that all wildcats in Scotland exhibit a degree of hybridisation. “We then have to find a line in the sand,” explains David Barclay, who manages the RZSS breeding programme, “a point at which a cat is so hybridised that is has no conservation value because it is so far removed from a wildcat genetically.” Barclay and his team have developed their own bespoke genetic test, with a cut-off point of 75%, which has revealed that the remaining captive wildcats across the UK enjoy a much higher species purity than those tested in the wild. Although some vocal critics argue it is better to leave the few remaining pockets in the wild to breed in isolation, the majority of those working in wildcat conservation are convinced that hope rests with captive breeding, then rewilding. Barclay is blunt about the reality of the situation. “Of course we want to conserve the population in the wild, and that should be the priority, but when you have such a bad population in the wild, bordering on extinction, it doesn’t matter what you do – neuter feral cats, remove all the threats – unless you add more animals.” Nor is species recovery and re-introduction a speedy process, he adds, and is dependent on committed individuals accepting that their efforts in the wild have been in vain. “When the data is indicating that the likelihood is there is no viable species, the danger is that you don’t act because you think it might be controversial. We’ve got to be careful that we don’t get into a situation where we are researching the animal to death, or focusing on just one photograph that gets a lot of publicity because it might be a wildcat.” Lister-Kaye concurs that “only way forward is to capture-breed from high quality hybrids, and by selective breeding over several generations increase the population.” But that is only half the story, he cautions. “The reason that Scottish wildcats have declined so dramatically is loss of habitat, to commercial forestry, industrial agriculture and urbanisation. So finding areas where there are the right prey species in sufficient numbers to support a wildcat population is very difficult.” While wildcats enjoy mosaic habitats, and would be capable of surviving on the edge of woodland, farmland, even towns, the risks of persecution and genetic pollution in those areas for the re-introduced population would remain high. “The ideal would be very wild areas, but in the Highlands they have got a gross over population of deer which have over-grazed the landscape, removing vegetation for wildcat prey species. So it isn’t at all simple.” While Barclay remains confident that “species recovery is a proven tool”, Lister-Kaye points to the successful conservation breeding programme with Iberian lynx in Spain: “You do have to have the right habitat to release these animals into, but it has been done.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"fashion/2018/jun/15/stitch-crochet-fashion-handicraft-knitwear","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-15T11:04:40Z","webTitle":"Stitch in time: crochet craze harks back to fashion’s crafty past","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/jun/15/stitch-crochet-fashion-handicraft-knitwear","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2018/jun/15/stitch-crochet-fashion-handicraft-knitwear","fields":{"headline":"Stitch in time: crochet craze harks back to fashion’s crafty past","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"It is usually confined on the high street to bralettes and bikinis, while its presence among the luxury labels has been dominated by Missoni’s trademark zig-zag creations. But this summer, crochet is breaking out, as the high street and celebrities embrace the handicraft trend. The summer collections featured high-end iterations of the look, such as Dolce and Gabbana’s black knitted dress with oversized, orange-shaped buttons, while the autumn shows provided a gothic approach in the form of berry-hued belted creations from Dior, and raw, hessian sack-like crochet dresses from Balmain’s recent Resort collection. It’s not just a luxury trend, however. TV’s Love Island boasts a number of fans, among them Dani Dyer, whose white and pastel crochet Missguided dress sold out out after she wore it on the show. On the high street, a multitude of items are springing up. This season Topshop is offering everything from crochet-trimmed pyjamas to a rainbow crochet T-shirt. “As we moved closer towards summer we saw a huge rise in searches for crochet,” a spokesperson for Arcadia said. “[They] were up 296% in April compared to March, signalling that this was going to be a popular trend for the season.” Elsewhere, Zara has branched out into bucket hats and colour-pop cable-knit jumpers, with a multicoloured crochet dress and a crochet-collar shirt among the store’s “trending now” this past week. At the midpoint between designer and high street, the Australian label She Made Me, whose crochet bikinis have been worn by social media mainstays including Kourtney Kardashian and Gigi Hadid, launched its debut ready to wear collection back in December, featuring crochet dresses and two-pieces. Searches for crochet items on the Lyst.com fashion platform have increased 31% in the second and third quarters compared with the same period last year, with tops recording the biggest increase, followed by dresses and sweaters. As well as endorsement from social media stars and influencers, and visibility across both luxury and accessible brands, its winning formula is arguably linked to its bohemian simplicity, and the sense that it harks back to a traditional, craft-adept world. Which could mean it’s here to stay."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"politics/2018/jun/15/conservative-rebel-theresa-may-forced-backtrack-brexit-pledge-meaningful-vote","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-15T17:47:01Z","webTitle":"Conservative rebels prepare to 'battle for the soul of Brexit'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jun/15/conservative-rebel-theresa-may-forced-backtrack-brexit-pledge-meaningful-vote","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jun/15/conservative-rebel-theresa-may-forced-backtrack-brexit-pledge-meaningful-vote","fields":{"headline":"Conservative rebels prepare to 'battle for the soul of Brexit'","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Tory rebels are refusing to back down as they attempt to secure a “meaningful” vote on how the government should respond if there is no agreed Brexit deal, despite Downing Street insisting there were no new concessions to be made. MPs are set to decide the shape of Brexit next week, in what is coming to be seen as one of the most important votes so far on the EU withdrawal bill. As Dominic Grieve, the rebels’ chief negotiator, insisted that he still hoped to win consensus in further talks, one ally described it as “a battle for the soul of Brexit”. Dr Sarah Wollaston, one of the most prominent Tory rebels, said: “There are some who really do just want a walk-away no-deal Brexit but others, like myself, who feel just as passionately that a hard Brexit would be immensely damaging and want parliament to be able to prevent that.” Rebels believe there is still no majority in parliament for a hard Brexit and that they can muster enough support across the Commons to carry an amendment on a meaningful vote. But Brexiters also believe that with a handful of Labour rebels and a few Tory abstentions, they can win, and they are urging Theresa May not to make any more concessions to MPs. On Monday, peers will vote again on the so-called Hailsham amendment. It says that if by February 2019 – only weeks ahead of the exit date of 29 March – there is no deal, MPs will be empowered to direct the government. There was a majority of nearly 100 when peers voted on the measure last month. Some peers are talking of mobilising for the “biggest vote ever”. There will also be a vote on the compromise government amendment which is framed to prevent a substantive vote and only allows MPs to “take note”. On Friday, May’s spokeswoman said: “The prime minister listened to those across the house who called for the ability to express their view in a no-deal scenario, and we’ve put forward an amendment which will be debated next week.” But when the government’s compromise amendment was published on Thursday, there were angry cries of betrayal from rebels who claimed it fell short of the promises made to them by the prime minister at a last-minute meeting in her Commons office when a revolt looked likely on Tuesday. One rebel, Antoinette Sandbach, who has been threatened and abused on social media for her pro-European position, said that in the hour before the amendment was tabled, David Davis’s Department for Exiting the European Union (DExEU) “appeared to get involved and the process was hijacked and one was tabled that wasn’t agreed to”. She said: “There was no discussion, no notification. It’s extraordinary. I’d like to see grown-up government and it seems to me that DExEU is trying to reduce parliament to a school debating chamber. “I hope there’s open dialogue before Monday and I hope the government comes to its senses.” Stephen Hammond, another rebel who acts as convenor for the group, accused unnamed ministers of forcing the prime minister to change her position. Wollaston added: “There are some who would have voted for the government last week who feel the way Dominic and parliament itself has been treated has disrespected a mechanism that is used to reach consensus without inflicting a defeat. Goodwill has been very badly undermined.” Although some argue that such a vote would never in fact happen as the government would fall if it could not get its Brexit deal through the Commons, the vote on Wednesday is seen as a key demonstration of support for the rival positions. Party managers hope to have the EU withdrawal bill on the statute book before the EU council at the end of June. The following week, on 4-5 July, there is a two-day cabinet session at Chequers where ministers will thrash out an agreement on the shape of the much-delayed white paper on the future relationship with the EU. The outcome of next week’s votes is likely to have a bearing on the approach the government takes as it prepares for the big quarterly council meeting in October. It has been set by the EU chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, as the meeting where the withdrawal treaty will be agreed in outline and any loose ends relating to withdrawal are tidied up."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/jun/15/tesco-posts-highest-growth-in-seven-years","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-15T08:20:59Z","webTitle":"Tesco posts highest growth in seven years","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/15/tesco-posts-highest-growth-in-seven-years","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jun/15/tesco-posts-highest-growth-in-seven-years","fields":{"headline":"Tesco posts highest growth in seven years","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Tesco has recorded its strongest growth in seven years, boosted by its acquisition of the Booker cash and carry group. The supermarket said UK and Irish sales rose 3.5% in the most recent three months, its 10th consecutive quarter of growth. Group sales – which include Asia eastern Europe – climbed 1.8%. Sales at Booker, which were included in the group for the first time this quarter, jumped 14.3% as it won new clients but growth at the main Tesco chain slipped back to 2.1% from 2.4% in the previous quarter. The company’s chief executive, Dave Lewis, said food price inflation had dropped and the company had also been affected by bad weather. The supermarket was forced to close all its stores in Ireland for a day during the “beast from the east” storm in early March. Lewis said food price inflation had dropped to 1.8%-2.4% from more than 3% late last year. Tesco has cut prices on fresh food lines as it continues to try to fight off competition from discounters Aldi and Lidl. Lewis said the grocer had cut prices by 6%-7% over the past three years, helping it add £300m of sales in the UK, well ahead of its competitors. “Our growth plan is on the track we set for it,” he said. “We are beginning to realise the growth potential of the merger [with Booker].” Tesco has begun selling 30 of Booker’s best selling items in 50 of its stores and is testing a professional caterer’s section, Chef Central, in two outlets. Booker is also benefiting from using space in some Tesco warehouses, helping it deliver food to clients more quickly in some areas. Lewis said the food market was proving more resilient than other retail sectors where he noted that “business failures this year have been unprecedented”. He partly blamed the government’s failure to change the business rates regime, which is weighted towards high street businesses. “Three years ago I gave a speech at the CBI where I did say that the approach on business rates, minimum wage and the apprenticeship levy was potentially a lethal cocktail … three years on we start to see the impact of that,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/jun/15/abc-retains-cricket-radio-rights-for-the-next-six-years","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-15T07:21:19Z","webTitle":"ABC retains cricket radio rights for the next six years","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jun/15/abc-retains-cricket-radio-rights-for-the-next-six-years","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jun/15/abc-retains-cricket-radio-rights-for-the-next-six-years","fields":{"headline":"ABC retains cricket radio rights for the next six years","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The ABC will continue to broadcast cricket on the radio for at least the next six summers, Cricket Australia has confirmed.

It undermined our commitment to the ABC and the ABC’s longstanding commitment to cricket. “Never for a minute had it crossed our minds that the ABC was not a staple in the Australian cricketing summer. “Radio has long been an important part of how people enjoy cricket in Australia over the summer, and the breadth and depth of these agreements ensures that people will be able to tune in to the cricket action regardless of where they are.” Under the terms of the new deal Macquarie Media will cover the men’s Big Bash season and share rights to cover men’s and women’s internationals with the ABC."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"film/2018/jun/15/liza-minnelli-renee-zellweger-judy-garland-biopic","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-15T09:24:45Z","webTitle":"Liza Minnelli: I do not approve of Renée Zellweger's Judy Garland biopic","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jun/15/liza-minnelli-renee-zellweger-judy-garland-biopic","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/jun/15/liza-minnelli-renee-zellweger-judy-garland-biopic","fields":{"headline":"Liza Minnelli: I do not approve of Renée Zellweger's Judy Garland biopic","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Liza Minnelli has said it is “100% fiction” that she approves of the forthcoming Renée Zellweger biopic of her mother, Judy Garland.

At phenomenal cost to the taxpayer, David Cameron and George Osborne backed this pointless upheaval that has inflicted untold suffering on claimants and yet achieves nothing measurable, says the national auditor’s autopsy report. It’s a breathtaking read. This should mark a tombstone moment for a government whose wanton maladministration has caused unforced errors in one public service after another: think of the needless turmoil in the NHS, immigration chaos, social care collapse and 62 free school fiascos. Today the Department for Work and Pensions is the offender: “The benefits that it set out to achieve through universal credit, such as increased employment and lower administration costs, are unlikely to be achieved.” The department is castigated for “a lack of regard in failing to understand the hardship faced by some claimants”. Forget normal Whitehall tact, here unfolds eight years of unrelenting failure, ploughing on despite alarms as costs rose to £2bn. Severe hardship is being caused because a quarter of claims are paid late, so people’s debts and rent arrears soar: districts where universal credit is rolled out see a 30% upsurge in foodbank use. Some 60% of claimants need an advance before payments come through, which becomes added debt, while council and social landlords are out of pocket for rent unpaid and private landlords refuse to let to those on universal credit: the system will never deliver all claims on time. Rollout should have finished last year – but after eight years of failures, each greeted with hubris and denial by Duncan Smith and his department, universal credit still covers just 10% of claimants. Warnings came over and over that many would not cope with hideously complex online claim forms: sure enough, the NAO says 43% have needed help – with no recompense for councils and charities struggling to provide it. You could say all this is unintentional, albeit the result of arrogantly ignoring experts who warned universal credit wouldn’t deliver more claimants into work. But add in the brutish sanctions, the deliberately cruel assessments of disabilities, with jobcentre staff bullied to knock people off benefits, and the DWP; this has been a hellish regime. The sanctioning system is slightly relaxed from the worst days when Duncan Smith boasted his system told claimants: “This is not an easy life any more, chum. I think you’re a slacker.” But still monstrous DWP injustices come up for appeals that are usually won. On top of that, the slashing of working benefit rates ensured universal credit makes people worse off. For every extra pound people earn, they lose 63p in working credits. Amyas Morse, comptroller and auditor general, concludes helplessly that the department now has “little realistic alternative but to continue with the programme”. But with the administrative cost of every universal credit claim an eye-watering £699 per case against an ultimate target of just £173, others in the field call to stop this nightmare now and reconsider all options. For years ahead, however, who will dare attempt another radical shake-up? The most urgent need is to restore the £23bn Osborne cuts due to cause a record 37% of children in poverty by 2022, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies. From day one, all those who understood the fiendish complexity of benefit systems warned Duncan Smith of the quicksands ahead. But with a blithe eureka, he claimed he had found the philosopher’s stone that would simplify everything, just like that. He sold it to his leader – David Cameron was never one for detail – as melding together six benefits in one easy form, all done online, so magic computers would change the amount paid each month with families’ changing lives. But there are reasons for complexity: the form was some 50 pages long by the time every human permutation of coupledom, children, disabilities, working hours, rent, council tax and plenty more was folded together. Paying benefits fairly is complicated because people’s lives are difficult: they change jobs, hours, incomes, numbers of children at home, partners, homes and illnesses. But Duncan Smith swaggered to his party that he had solved the great conundrums and perversities that fox every welfare system. How do you treat the sick and needy kindly, without perverse incentives? How do you top up low incomes without subsidising skinflint employers? As one great failure dogged another, as IT systems failed to fix all, such extravagant claims were made by this charlatan alchemist, that neither Cameron nor Osborne dared pull the plug and admit failure. So on it went. Sounding anything but optimistic, Morse ends by saying that the DWP will hopefully learn from past mistakes. But that’s not what happens in Whitehall. Duncan Smith jumped ship before this humiliation, pleading a sudden attack of tenderness for claimants subjected to cuts singularly lacking until icebergs loomed in front of his Titanic. Now he’s back on the backbenches as one of the good old boy “bastards” of John Major’s days. After this, those listening to him hammering on about a miracle economy and super-trade in post-hard Brexit Britain might question his judgment. Also departed is Robert Devereux, the DWP permanent secretary who was well warned about likely calamity, yet he let Duncan Smith drive on. He never asked for a “letter of direction”, to show he had advised against this folly and so absolve himself of responsibility. Will other permanent secretaries learn from any of this? Unlikely. They always glide away from their mistakes. Devereux retired this January, as a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath, a title all permanent secretaries expect, regardless of any disservice they did to the nation. • Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"stage/2018/jun/17/rudolf-nureyev-documentary-unearths-unseen-avant-garde-footage-ballet","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-17T13:26:37Z","webTitle":"Rudolf Nureyev documentary unearths unseen avant-garde footage","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/jun/17/rudolf-nureyev-documentary-unearths-unseen-avant-garde-footage-ballet","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/jun/17/rudolf-nureyev-documentary-unearths-unseen-avant-garde-footage-ballet","fields":{"headline":"Rudolf Nureyev documentary unearths unseen avant-garde footage","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Previously unknown footage of Rudolf Nureyev will be seen for the first time in a new British documentary to be released in cinemas worldwide. Ballet’s most famous star can be seen performing, choreographing and rehearsing in material unearthed by the film-maker Jacqui Morris. She was taken aback to find about 16 minutes of unseen footage relating to the greatest male ballet dancer of all time. In one clip, Nureyev can be seen rehearsing the Nutcracker with Claude de Vulpian, choreographing her while dancing together. Most of the footage shows modern works created with leading choreographers such as Martha Graham. Morris said of the footage: “You see him on stage, dancing very provocatively throughout … This is very avant-garde, very sexually provocative – the opposite of him playing the prince in ballet. In one section, he’s polishing a scaffolding pole in the most provocative way imaginable.” She said the discovery was so important because prior to now there was very little footage of his contemporary work. Morris described the material as “amateur-shot”: “Nureyev didn’t like being filmed because he knew his best angles when he was performing on stage, but he couldn’t control the camera. He knew what an audience was going to see live. “But he had good friends, particularly quite wealthy women, who followed him around the world, and he did allow them to film. There’s a couple of bits that we’ve found from other people who surreptitiously filmed in theatres.” The documentary– Nureyev: All The World His Stage – will be released in September. Morris is a co-directer, with her brother David. Their previous documentaries include McCullin, about the war photographer Don McCullin, which received two Bafta nominations. Nureyev died in 1993 aged 54. The Nureyev Foundation gave the film-makers access to around 20 boxes of old VHS tapes, among other material in a vast archive held in the New York public library. David Morris said: “There’s about 16 minutes of dance footage that even the most diehard fan has never seen … There are things the Nureyev Foundation didn’t know existed.” Over two yearswading through the archive, Jacqui Morris realised that labels did not fully detail their contents. Thierry Fouquet, vice-president of the Nureyev Foundation, was excited by the discovery. “There were lots of things I hadn’t seen before,” he said. In her 2017 autobiography, the former prima ballerina Dame Beryl Grey recalled how Nureyev could transfix his audiences with the grace and beauty of his movement, but said he was also capable of brutal behaviour. He could be rude even to his legendary dancing partner Margot Fonteyn, whom he adored. Grey remembered him kicking a ballerina so hard she required medical treatment. Jacqui Morris said: “He could be a monster and he did hit people. There’s no question of it. But in the footage we’ve got, you can just see how hard he’s working and how much those dancers adored him because he pushed them. He would slap them, but they’d come out of it going, ‘you know what, I’ve just given a performance of a lifetime’. Dance was his whole life.” Saturday marked the anniversary of Nureyev’s dramatic defection from the Soviet Union in 1961. He gave his minders the slip in Paris and presented the west with one of the greatest propaganda coups of the cold war. David Morris said it marked a pivotal moment in history. “Nureyev’s life was dominated by politics, although he wasn’t political himself.” He said the documentary would reflect the great tragedy of Nureyev’s life: “That he came to the west, was the great star of his age, but that he couldn’t see his mother.” Trevor Beattie, the documentary’s producer, said the time that Nureyev lived in was not as “camera-obsessed” as it is now, so there is not “wall-to-wall” footage of Nureyev that someone of his fame and genius would now attract. “Imagine the footage that there would be [if Nureyev had his career today] … It would be non-stop. So, in comparison, there’s very little. “He was a performer on the big classical stage, and those things were not filmed every night … Cameras were also more cumbersome than they are today. A camera on a tripod would be fixed to the floor at the back of row Z … and it wouldn’t move.” The film-makers say that, even a quarter of a century after hisdeath, Nureyev’s story has never been more relevant. “His defection to the west is symbolic as Russia and the west struggle once more to reconcile conflicting values.” The documentary takes an innovative approach to the form. As well as interviews with those who knew Nureyev, there are contemporary dance sequences choreographed by Russell Maliphant that tell his story where no archival footage exists."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jun/15/special-visas-for-white-south-african-farmers-on-agenda-for-liberal-council-meeting","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-15T09:12:47Z","webTitle":"'We can't help them all': Liberal motion on white South African farmers defeated","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jun/15/special-visas-for-white-south-african-farmers-on-agenda-for-liberal-council-meeting","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jun/15/special-visas-for-white-south-african-farmers-on-agenda-for-liberal-council-meeting","fields":{"headline":"'We can't help them all': Liberal motion on white South African farmers defeated","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Liberal party members who attempted to have white South African farmers singled out for special treatment when applying for asylum in Australia have been defeated after an emotional interjection from a former immigration minister. In a policy motion put forward to the federal council, where members attempt to influence Coalition policy, they attempted to amend a motion changing “South African minorities targeted by hate crimes” to “European farmers”, to ensure white farmers were given particular attention. But after a flurry of debate, Philip Ruddock addressed the crowd, saying singling out whites for special humanitarian visa attention went against what Australia stood for. • Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon “The problem is that we have something in the order of 65 million people around the world displaced, 22 and a half million of them refugees,” he said. “Now, I hate to say it, as much as I might like – we can’t help them all. The question is who do you help? And that is always the question. “And I am not saying you shouldn’t help South African farmers if they are being discriminated against, any more than I would argue that there are others that should not be helped. “My view is, at the moment, our arrangements enable all minorities targeted, to be able to seek asylum in Australia, by way of an appropriate application and they have to be considered objectively by Australian officials.” The motion was carried, but as originally put forward, with South African minorities standing in place of Europeans. The policy motions only show the direction members would like the government to take on particular issues, but remain non-binding for the government to pick up. However, the issue of the South African farmers proved the first flashpoint in a conference where party divides, between moderates and conservatives, are expected to feature. Peter Dutton had laid the groundwork for the South African farmer issue in March, after which Tony Abbott told Sydney radio 2GB that “something like 400 white farmers have been murdered, brutally murdered, over the last 12 months”. Despite several fact checkers debunking the claim, the idea the white South African farmers should be granted special attention, including fast-tracked visas, had persisted, particularly in Western Australia, where a large number of South Africans have settled. It was the West Australian branch that put the idea forward to the national council, calling on the government to “enable the South African minorities targeted by hate crimes to seek asylum in Australia”. Julie Bishop has already ruled that out as unnecessary, after Australia’s high commissioner was called in to Pretoria to explain the Coalition’s position following Dutton’s comments in March that the group deserves “special treatment”. “Australia does monitor the rate of violent crime in South Africa and there has been no dramatic increase in recent years,” she said in March. “We do have a humanitarian visa program if any person feels they are persecuted, then they can apply to Australia for a humanitarian visa, and that would be considered on its merits and I believe that is what Peter Dutton is referring to.” Each branch of the Liberal party, after consultation with its own state branches and members, can submit policy motions to the federal council for consideration. Western Australia also wants to put the GST back on the agenda, and has asked the government to include tax revenue from gambling operations when calculating GST allocations. WA has no pokie machines, which would set its revenue lower, compared with the big gambling states on the east coast. The federal women’s committee has called for voter identification laws to be established across the country, forcing “the presentation of an identification document that includes the voter’s photograph or voter’s name and residential address when voting in a federal election”, as well as to “properly fund and promote vocational education and training as an equal first choice career pathway for students”. The Young Liberals have called on the government to follow Donald Trump’s lead and move the Australian embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, and to “suspend aid to the Palestinian Authority until it terminates it’s ‘martyrs’ fund’”. They also want the government to “abstain from military intervention in Syria with an intention to oust its secular regime”. The ACT branch, in an attempt to rid the public service of all quota hirings, wants a public service recruitment process that would strip candidates’ applications of any and all identifying data to ensure gender, race and age are removed – “commonly known as blind recruitment”. Victoria is calling for the government to ban any drugs approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration from being used for doctor-assisted euthanasia. The government is also being asked to implement the findings of a recent review and establish a minimum 90-day fuel supply for the country. The federal council will begin considering the policy motions late on Friday afternoon, and the main debates will kick off on Saturday, when Malcolm Turnbull will address the party faithful."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/16/optus-under-fire-after-world-cup-streaming-leaves-fans-frustrated","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-15T22:46:52Z","webTitle":"Optus under fire after World Cup streaming leaves fans frustrated","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/16/optus-under-fire-after-world-cup-streaming-leaves-fans-frustrated","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/16/optus-under-fire-after-world-cup-streaming-leaves-fans-frustrated","fields":{"headline":"Optus under fire after World Cup streaming leaves fans frustrated","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Optus Sport, which has the rights to broadcast every match of the 2018 World Cup in Russia, was at the centre of a social media storm after its live streaming service encountered problems on Friday night, leaving football fans fuming. The telco, which purchased the rights to show all 64 games at the tournament in Russia live and on demand, had promised that “Aussie viewers will be able to experience every emotion of the tournament”. But after the second day of action, the overriding emotion viewers were experiencing was anger. During the Group A game between Egypt and Uruguay, users complained of the streaming service dropping out and constantly buffering, making viewing difficult and leaving fans frustrated. Robbie Slater, the former player and Fox Sports pundit, labelled the poor service an “absolute disgrace”, while the Matildas player Sam Kerr said she was “furious” for all Australians who were unable to watch the game. Complaints poured in to the Optus Sport Twitter account late on Friday night before a short statement was made on its Facebook page, apologising for the technical difficulties and directing customers to its website to continue watching. That website appeared to be available free of charge. An Optus spokesperson later told Guardian Australia: “Some Optus Sport customers experienced a disruption to their 2018 Fifa World Cup viewing experience on Friday night. This was due to an extremely high number of viewers logging into our platforms just before kick-off causing some systems to overload. “While most customers on most platforms were unaffected, we apologise unreservedly to those customers who were, and are continuing to investigate the cause of these systems issues.” Optus also holds rights to the Premier League, having successfully outbid previous rights holder Fox Sports. The opening weekend of its coverage of the 2016-17 season suffered similar technical glitches – and outrage. Before the World Cup began, Optus Sport executive producer and presenter Richard Bayliss told Guardian Australia that “the technology is now is light years ahead of where it was a year or two ago”. “And there are scores of people whose job it is to make sure everything goes off without a hitch and having seen how hard they’ve been working in the lead-up to the World Cup I don’t think people should be concerned at all,” he added. Free-to-air broadcaster SBS has rights to show 25 of the 64 games, including all three of the Socceroos’ group stage matches, but fans who want complete coverage have to go through Optus – for a price. At the beginning of May, Optus announced it was launching a subscription service for non-Optus customers for a monthly fee of $15. The later game between Iran and Morocco appeared to stream without problems."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"education/2018/jun/15/t-levels-will-not-be-quickly-forgotten","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-15T15:49:53Z","webTitle":"T-levels will not be quickly forgotten | Letter from Anne Milton MP, apprenticeships and skills minister","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/jun/15/t-levels-will-not-be-quickly-forgotten","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2018/jun/15/t-levels-will-not-be-quickly-forgotten","fields":{"headline":"T-levels will not be quickly forgotten","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"In Fiona Millar’s opinion piece on the new T-levels, I find myself in agreement with her. The divide between academic and technical education does need bridging. For far too long technical education has been sidelined; initiatives taken by successive governments, as she sets out, had their heart in the right place but ultimately failed to create technical routes that are the equal of A-levels and provision in our world-class universities. But Ms Millar’s pessimism around T-levels will prove misplaced (‘T-levels are the latest in a series of quickly forgotten vocational qualifications that come and go’, 12 June). To improve technical education for every child, we need to truly shake up the system. In designing the new system we have looked carefully at previous reforms, along with Lord Sainsbury’s review of what works well in the best international systems, so we don’t repeat the mistakes of the past. T-levels are the biggest reform of technical education for over 70 years. So what makes them different? We have put employers and business in the driving seat; they are at the heart of the design of T-levels – working with us to develop course content, provide industry placements and ultimately employ the skilled workforce that T-levels will produce. But this new qualification is one part of a much wider transformation of technical education; we are also improving the quality of apprenticeships and establishing institutes of technology that will offer top-quality technical training to degree standard. It is this holistic approach that will finally end the disparity between technical and academic education. I haven’t met Ms Millar – which I assume is why she refers to me as the “barely known minister for skills”. While I would be very happy to meet her, how well known I am is not what matters. What matters to me is that I will have played my part in changing the lives of young people. We are serious about creating the highly skilled, homegrown workforce our country needs and making sure our young people gain the skills for the jobs of tomorrow. This is a chance to build the bridge, giving people of all ages – whatever their background, wherever they come from and whoever they know – a chance to get on in life. These exciting new qualifications will not be quickly forgotten. They are here to stay.

He sensed it long before his playing career had been curtailed, reconciling himself with the reality that a move to one of the Premier League’s elite clubs had gone, but never that his chance to scale the pinnacle of the sport would elude him. “Over the last few years I have felt too often that I may have to wait for a career in management to have a shot at fulfilment,” he had conceded. “A strange thought for a man still unsure about what he wants to do after his playing days are over.” The conclusion had been drawn towards the end of Woody and Nord, the book written with his close friend and former teammate in Crystal Palace’s youth team Andy Woodman in 2003, when he still had three years of a stint at Middlesbrough to run. It proved prophetic and, if the 47-year-old rather stumbled into his current role, there has been clarity to his approach to the job. In the Volgograd Arena on Monday, when Southgate’s England stare down Tunisia in their opening Group G fixture, that opportunity to realise a long-held aspiration will finally be his. This will be a very different test of Southgate’s credentials. Everything he has done over his England tenure has been impressive. Those who feared he was merely a yes man, the Football Association’s safest option given the post-Euro 2016 meltdown and Sam Allardyce’s stunted spell, have been reassured by the strength of so much of his decision-making. The omissions of Joe Hart and Jack Wilshere for Russia felt bold calls but were justifiable. There has been no repeat of Fabio Capello’s wild selection in 2010, and no attempt to find short-term fixes, with his focus geared towards progression. Another who missed out, Alfie Mawson, may have a role in the long term, so there was also a phone call to the Swansea City defender to explain this was a tournament too soon. Even the manner in which he dealt with Raheem Sterling’s tardy arrival at St George’s Park was impressive. There was a firm but calmly delivered reminder that such behaviour is unacceptable, a glimpse of his authoritative side. Once the forward was caught in a media storm over the tattoo of a rifle on his calf, Southgate recognised the need to be supportive. His initial intention to leave out Sterling against Nigeria was shelved. The player, potentially vulnerable, had suffered enough. This was a time to unite. The relaxed atmosphere in which the team have undergone preparations has helped disperse anxiety which might have gripped the third-youngest squad England have dispatched to the finals. Players have spoken consistently of his calmness. “His mindset rubs off on the group,” said Ruben Loftus-Cheek, who had played under Southgate for the under-21s. “He’s good at managing players off the pitch because he has been one of us, at club and England levels. He understands us.” But, if all that equates to winning the phoney war, the early indications are promising as to how he will attack what happens next. Southgate was capped 57 times over an international career that encompassed spells, sometimes very brief, under six managers, and has taken elements from each. Where he learned on the hoof having been thrust into the job at Boro – he considers the 12th- and 13th-place finishes in the top flight in his first two years as his “biggest achievement” – he has been more strategic with the national setup. Older and wiser, he had a plan. His team were pragmatic and efficient through qualification but, once passage to the finals had been secured, he was insistent, even with time and opportunities relatively limited, the approach needed to shift. “I feel we need to expand our game to succeed at the highest level,” he had offered in his book when surveying his England career under Sven-Göran Eriksson. Yet again, he has been true to that philosophy. The side he sends out in Volgograd will be attack-minded and bold, youthful and brimming with energy. Southgate preaches the possession-based football which, he believes, allows sides to flourish in tournaments; particularly in oppressive heat. England are far from the finished article but should be better placed to cope. There will be no stifling of intent, no sudden cramping up with caution and no awkward shoehorning of players into his lineup. He has selected a squad comfortable with the style of play demanded, as Chris Smalling discovered to his cost. The choice of three at the back delivered a solid platform from which a team without a stellar playmaker can tap into the qualities they do possess. If there were concerns the manager’s forte might not be on the training pitch then he hired shrewdly in Steve Holland, his right-hand man with the under-21s, whose departure constituted a significant loss to Chelsea. Holland worked with Antonio Conte’s back three in their title-winning season. Southgate played it under Terry Venables and Glenn Hoddle with England. They can switch from 3-5-2 to 3-4-3, with flexibility an asset. “The top managers Steve’s worked with – people like José Mourinho, Antonio Conte – he can take all that knowledge and bring it to us,” added Loftus-Cheek. “Steve does a lot more of the training, while Gareth tends to do more of the tactical stuff. They work so well together.” That ability to adapt in games will prove the acid test of Southgate’s leadership, particularly if England are struggling, but there is no reason to suppose Southgate will not rise to that task. He is strong-willed, with a clear vision of England’s future, a philosophy that struck a chord with the FA. He fought to make his playing career a success having been rejected by Southampton at 13 and almost released by Palace, before earning the respect of senior professionals in the “bear pit” that was the south London club’s Mitcham training ground. It yielded League Cups with Aston Villa and Boro, and a First Division title at Palace, but the possibility to achieve real fulfilment remains."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/jun/17/the-handmaids-tale-recap-season-2-episode-5-a-glimpse-of-hope-amid-the-gloom","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-17T21:15:24Z","webTitle":"The Handmaid's Tale recap: season 2, episode 5 - a glimpse of hope amid the gloom","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jun/17/the-handmaids-tale-recap-season-2-episode-5-a-glimpse-of-hope-amid-the-gloom","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jun/17/the-handmaids-tale-recap-season-2-episode-5-a-glimpse-of-hope-amid-the-gloom","fields":{"headline":"The Handmaid's Tale recap: season 2, episode 5 - a glimpse of hope amid the gloom","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Spoiler alert: this recap is for people watching The Handmaid’s Tale, series two, on Channel 4 in the UK. Please do not add spoilers from later episodes. She’s Offred. She’s June. She’s Offred again. The pendulum swings back and forth, but June has promised her unborn baby that it won’t grow up in Gilead, so the light of hope isn’t completely extinguished in her. Yet. The before time No flashbacks to life before the republic this week. Instead we get brief, stinking sojourns to ... the colonies. Janine and Emily slog away in the poisoned fields as their co-workers drop dead around them. Every time we cut back to them, I try to banish images of a grim-faced French and Saunders playing Janine and Emily, toiling and grimacing and persevering through the unimaginable hardship. The relentlessness of their suffering is hard to take and gives this episode a stifling quality. There’s no relief at all this week, either in Gilead or elsewhere. The suffering is compounded by cruel guards in gas masks who demand that sickly fainters get back to work. The inmates sing Morning Has Broken in weedy voices and two more have died in the night. Another, Kit, is set to follow. But not before she’s had a death-bed wedding to her colonies sweetheart, Fiona, that Dickens himself would have balked at due to oversentimentality. Obviously, it’s not played that way, but this hour is dominated by the meek being ill-treated by the mighty. I find the lack of light to balance out the shade (except in the cinematography) leaves me feeling a bit weak. Gilead Back in harness, Offred’s “I’m not supposed to be out of my room at night” to Nick when he finds her burning the contraband letters is like a catechism. He can’t get through to her any more. When Offred notices blood in her underpants, it’s no wonder she keeps it a secret. All of her power lies in her pregnancy and, if it’s going wrong, she’s really in trouble. “What is the matter with you?” demands Serena, enraged by Offred’s muted conversation on their walk together. She can’t have it both ways. Either she wants a compliant handmaid or June in full fight mode. Nick expresses concern about Offred’s mental state to Serena, who is not best pleased and tells him to butt out. She really should have listened to him. Lydia spoke earlier of finally “bringing Offred to heel”, but Serena is clearly unnerved by her newfound compliance. Fred, at his sunlit, art deco office, tries to get Nick a promotion, clearly disquieted by the furtive looks between his driver and his handmaid and very much led by Serena. Then it’s time for Nick’s surprise wedding. At first it looks like he’s being given a medal for services rendered, along with his fellow guardians. But then the parade of veiled child brides is brought out and Offred’s face turns to stone as she realises her one ally is being annexed by the enemy. As the newlyweds arrive home, Offred’s total detachment from her surroundings is clear. Mrs Waterford sends her to bed, as though she were a child, and she leans against the wall by the window, bleeding heavily now and assuming she is miscarrying. In a touch of pathetic fallacy, Nick stands out in the pouring rain, stalling his wedding night with a cigarette. Then he spots Offred, bloodied and unconscious in the bushes. She has jumped. Waking in hospital, June finally returns. She lifts the blanket to find a foetal-heartbeat monitor strapped to her still-pregnant belly. “You’re tough, aren’t you?” she says to the bump, adding: “I will not let you grow up in this place.” The sound of music The episode ends on a hopeful note with Julianna Barwick’s Heading Home. Blessed be the fruit. May the lord open. Grim scale The relentless horrors of life in the colonies bring this episode up to a hard-going 7/10. Under his eye Lydia’s use of a pencil is designed to pull rank over Serena as the two women jostle for control of Offred’s pregnancy. Women aren’t usually allowed writing materials. That shot of Offred’s face reflected in the blood-red water of her bath is a striking image, perhaps hinting that she is still two people, not just the passive robot she seems to have become. I don’t know how many more times this series June’s resolve can be broken only for her to find strength again.

We need to be clear in recognising them, and resolute in dealing with them. A precondition for fighting antisemitism effectively is clarity about what it is, and what it is not. Antisemitism is discrimination, prejudice or hostility against us because we are Jews. It is a form of racism. It may be manifested in violence, denial of rights, discriminatory acts, prejudice-based behaviour, verbal or written statements, negative stereotypes or scapegoating. Holocaust denial, the blood libel, conspiracy theories about supposed Jewish power or the alleged priorities of Jews worldwide – all are expressions of antisemitism. Criticism of Israel is not antisemitic unless motivated by anti-Jewish prejudice. Examples of this can include: holding all Jews accountable for the actions of the state of Israel; engaging in conspiracy theories about the state of Israel that draw on antisemitic stereotypes about supposed Jewish power; accusing all Jewish citizens of being more loyal to Israel than to the interests of their own nations. Criticism of Israel, of its displacement of Palestinians and of its denial of their rights, is not antisemitic. Criticising laws and policies of the state of Israel as racist and as falling under the definition of apartheid is not antisemitic. Calling for boycott, divestment and sanctions against Israel to oppose those policies is not antisemitic. We call upon all public bodies and other organisations to apply these principles in addressing antisemitism within their own organisations and when challenging it within wider society.

But last year I set out on the ultimate quest: I took the Eurostar to Belgium. The crowds who squeeze into a tiny chapel in St Bavo’s Cathedral to see Hubert and Jan van Eyck’s Ghent Altarpiece are not there merely because there’s not much else to do in Ghent. As we wait for the doors of this giant painting made of multiple hinged wooden panels to open, I run through the reasons it’s supposed to be so special. There are so many firsts in this painting you can lose count. It contains the first realistic interior, the first convincing townscape, the first great north European landscape, the first completely lifelike portraits. Begun by Hubert in the 1420s, it was finished in 1432 by his brother Jan. That’s at the very beginning of the Renaissance, long before such heights of realism reached Italy. Yet some works of art that were revolutionary in their day become senescent with time. Not this one. One of the strangest Annunciation scenes ever painted is spread across the closed panels. The angel visits Mary in a room whose lovely details include a washbasin in a Gothic niche. Out of the window we see a medieval town painted with an acute eye for architecture and space. This is intimate, it’s so human – then the doors open to reveal a sublime vista. Christ sits enthroned in heaven, accompanied by Mary in a blue gown and gold crown. Why did the Van Eycks reject the conventional focus in European art on the suffering of a human Christ on the cross and instead reach back to something more primitive and barbaric, an omnipotent eternal judge? And another first: Adam and Eve stand naked, their embarrassed nudity not only unprecedented in its day but still uneasily real and touching to look at. The divine and human, real and fantastic – these almost shocking contrasts display the artists’ sophistication. The lower part is a visionary landscape that spreads across, and connects, five separate panels. Exotic nature and unearthly cities unfold under a glowing sky. This is not just the start of the Renaissance but Romanticism too. There is so much to look at that you barely notice one of the panels is a modern copy. If the lost original of the Just Judges really does come to light it will add yet more magic to a masterpiece that starts by involving you in humble depictions of the real then transports you to mysterious realms of revelation. The Ghent Altarpiece may be just a train journey away but it is a passport to paradise."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/15/british-botanist-rachel-saunders-body-south-africa","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-15T14:58:36Z","webTitle":"Body of British botanist found in South Africa","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/15/british-botanist-rachel-saunders-body-south-africa","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/15/british-botanist-rachel-saunders-body-south-africa","fields":{"headline":"Body of British botanist found in South Africa","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Police in South Africa have identified the body of a British botanist who disappeared earlier this year while searching for rare seeds in a remote nature reserve. Rachel and Rodney Saunders are thought to have been looking for rare plant seeds near the oNgoye Forest in KwaZulu-Natal province when they were last confirmed alive in mid-February. Four suspects were arrested within days following a manhunt across the province. Three remain in custody, facing charges of murder, assault and abduction. The badly decomposed body of Rodney Saunders, 74, was found a week after the alleged killing by fishermen in the Tugela river and took several weeks to be identified. Police have given no details of where the remains of his 63-year-old wife were found. “A multi-pronged investigation … led to the positive identification of the mortal remains of Rachel Saunders,” Capt Lloyd Ramovha of the elite Hawks investigative unit said in a statement. Local media have reported that the couple, dual British-South African nationals who ran a business in Cape Town trading rare seeds, had been filmed by a team from BBC Gardeners’ World shortly before they disappeared. Police believe they were kidnapped and murdered by Islamic extremists who talked of killing non-believers around the time of the attack. The case prompted the UK’s Foreign Office to warn that terrorists were likely to try to carry out attacks in South Africa. Africa’s most industrialised country has never suffered a major terrorist incident involving Islamic extremists and no attack followed a similar warning by Britain and the US in June 2016. The new advice was described as alarmist by some local experts. But police evidence during bail hearings suggests the Saunders’ alleged killers were at least in part motivated by radical ideologies. Sayfydeen Del Vecchio, 38, and Fatima Patel, 27, were detained in a raid on a house near Mtunzini, a small coastal town 30km (18 miles) from the oNgoye forest on 16 February. They face charges of kidnapping, murder and robbery. A third man was found in possession of the couple’s mobile phones. He was sentenced to a suspended three-year sentence after coming to an agreement with prosecutors. The case has led to criticism of South Africa’s security services. Del Vecchio, who converted to Islam 15 years ago, was already on a watchlist after being seen on a quad bike watching planes landing and taking off at the King Shaka Zulu airport outside the city of Durban more than two years before the alleged murder. Patel, who is the daughter of a Muslim cleric, was also on a watchlist after being arrested in July 2016 during an anti-terrorism raid conducted Johannesburg. She was later released on bail. Two brothers detained at the same time remain in custody, accused of planning attacks on Jewish, British and US interests in South Africa following contact with an Islamic State extremist. Police found a drone, camping gear, generators and paintball equipment, all bought with Saunders’ bank card in a series of shopping trips, at the home Patel shared with Del Vecchio, along with a GPS device belonging to the couple. Police also allege the couple once flew an Islamic State flag at their home. Lawyers for the accused say police have exaggerated the links to the Islamic State. A police statement to the court claims Del Vecchio had used Telegram, the encrypted messaging service, to advise an unidentified individual on bomb-making techniques. Security officials and experts say there are no known Islamist militant groups actively targeting South Africa, where Muslims make up less than 2% of the population."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2018/jun/15/derry-girls-actor-nicola-coughlan-apology-overweight-girl-review","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-15T14:30:49Z","webTitle":"Derry Girls actor offered apology for 'overweight girl' review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/jun/15/derry-girls-actor-nicola-coughlan-apology-overweight-girl-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/jun/15/derry-girls-actor-nicola-coughlan-apology-overweight-girl-review","fields":{"headline":"Derry Girls actor offered apology for 'overweight girl' review","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The British Theatre Guide has apologised to the Derry Girls actor Nicola Coughlan after one of its reviewers described her as an “overweight little girl”. The offending description, which has since been removed, appeared in Philip Fisher’s review of The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie at the Donmar Warehouse in Covent Garden, London. He wrote that Coughlan as Joyce Emily was “the kind of overweight little girl who will always become the butt of her fellows’ immature humour”. Responding on Twitter, the actor complained that was the second time Fisher had been to see a show she was in and “as part of reviewing the show he has also reviewed my body”. Addressing Fisher, the BTG’s London editor, she said: “I know you are a theatre reviewer and your body has no relevance to your job but maybe you’d like me to cruelly review it for you and post it online.” In tweets to the British Theatre Guide (BTG), she said Fisher was not welcome to review any more shows in which she appears. After her initial post, she won backing from many people on Twitter including fellow actors. Susan Wokoma, who starred in Crazyhead and Chewing Gum, wrote: “This has happened to me before, it’s really unnerving. Sharing solidarity – we must call reviewers out on this!” Responding a few hours later, the BTG said: “Nicola, we apologise unreservedly for the offence caused by the wording of this review. The offending words have been removed. While the reviewer may not have intended to offend, he accepts that it is not acceptable to use such descriptions in a review and not BTG policy.” Some on Twitter complained that the apology did not go far enough as it only apologised for “offence caused”. Coughlan wrote that Fisher also reviewed her last year in a show called Jess and Joe Forever at the Traverse Theatre, in Edinburgh, and that his opening sentence was: “Jess [the part played by Coughlan] is a fat girl.” That description also appears to have been removed from the BTG website. Coughlan wrote: “My weight has no relevance to either the performance I gave in that or in The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie.” Coughlan plays Clare in Channel 4’s hit comedy Derry Girls, which is set in Northern Ireland in the 1990s at the tail end of the Troubles. The show, written by Lisa McGee, won the best comedy award at the Irish Film and Television Awards last month."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/15/the-guardian-view-on-the-nhs-cash-boost-pay-for-it-with-deficit-spending","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-15T16:09:01Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on the NHS cash boost: pay for it with deficit spending | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/15/the-guardian-view-on-the-nhs-cash-boost-pay-for-it-with-deficit-spending","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/15/the-guardian-view-on-the-nhs-cash-boost-pay-for-it-with-deficit-spending","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on the NHS cash boost: pay for it with deficit spending","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Finally the penny has dropped in No 10. The prime minister, Theresa May, has recognised that the English health service does not have the resources it requires to provide high-quality patient care, and has told the Treasury to “find the money” the NHS desperately needs. Mrs May seems to be offering to increase the budget of the English NHS by about 3% a year until the end of the parliament, meaning that government spending would rise from around £130bn to £150bn in four years’ time. While welcome, the sums are probably going to be too small to keep pace with the rising cost of drugs and an ageing population that has ever more complex needs. The decision is not an act of compassion. It is not a birthday gift – although it might be sold as such because the NHS is 70 this July. It is not because there is a Brexit dividend – there isn’t. It is because the NHS is falling apart before people’s eyes. GP appointments are harder to come by. Patients routinely sit for hours in overcrowded emergency wards. In hospitals, operations are cancelled more often, because of a lack of beds. Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, deserves credit in arguing for extra money. But Mrs May will find the cash because public dissatisfaction with the NHS is at its highest level for a decade. Politics demands that she acts. The Tories have no one else to blame for this sorry state of affairs but themselves. Conservative ministers spent the last eight years bleeding the health service dry. Like physicians of old, Tory policymakers believed that bloodletting could heal the sick. It was wrong in medicine. And it’s wrong in economics. It has not just inflicted pain; it has made the patient weaker. Other parts of the system have succumbed: social care offered by local authorities has been decimated by austerity. Mrs May does not want to be remembered as the prime minister who squandered the dramatic improvements that had been achieved by the NHS. Despite the longest budget squeeze in its history, the NHS was last year judged the best and safest healthcare system of 11 developed nations. Unsurprisingly, given austerity, the NHS was reckoned to be cheaper to run than other healthcare services found in comparable economies. What the health service needs is the kind of vision that Tony Blair and Gordon Brown offered almost two decades ago when they decided to raise health spending to the EU average. Before spending more money on the NHS, British politicians should take the advice of the US economist Stephanie Kelton: in a UK lecture this week, she explained that it was wrong for politicians and the media to argue that the government must balance its books, just like a household. If a household were to continually spend more than its income, it would eventually face insolvency; it is thus claimed that the government is in a similar situation. This is false. Yet politicians are obsessed with avoiding an increase in the deficit, an impulse so ingrained that Professor Kelton described as it “almost Pavlovian”. An analysis of the UK’s economic position tells us how to fund the NHS: growth is flatlining, real wages are stagnant and there’s little inflation. The UK’s indebted households are sinking deeper into debt. Hardly the time to raise taxes. The public sector deficit ought to be seen as an instrument to support the economy, not a way to break it. To pay for the NHS, which is critical for long-term prosperity, the government should engage in Keynesian deficit spending: this would help to keep not only the public healthy but the economy too."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/15/waitrose-shamed-food-waste-shoppers-baddies","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-15T16:14:29Z","webTitle":"Now Waitrose is being shamed for food waste.

Yet shoppers are to blame","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Another day, another supermarket-bashing report – even if this latest one is slightly unexpected. This time it’s aiming at the upright, conscientious, middle-class shoppers’ favourite. But now Waitrose has been criticised by the campaign group, Feedback Global, for being the worst performer out of 10 UK supermarket chains at tackling food waste. According to Feedback Global’s findings, Waitrose provides no public data on food waste. It redistributes a small quantity of food compared with other retailers, has done limited work with suppliers to reduce food waste, and has no programme to send permissible food surplus to serve as animal feed. This is in striking contrast to Tesco – the supermarket all right-thinking people like me are supposed to hate. Tesco was the first group to produce third-party audited food-waste data, and in 2017, according to the report, increased its food surplus distribution network by 40% on the previous year, donating 7,975 tonnes of food to people in need. Far from being smug or discerning, many Waitrose shoppers like me will be looking at themselves, thinking of the oft-tweeted Mitchell and Webb sketch, asking: “Are we the baddies?”. The Waitrose PR team may be on high alert, activating damage control procedures, and we need to demand that they do more to tackle food waste. But we should also rethink our own expectations of and demands on supermarkets. The inhabitants of the Hebridean island of Islay make a mad dash to the island’s Co-op on a Tuesday afternoon, two hours after the fresh food lorry has made its weekly visit to the island, as they know that the fresh produce will sell out that afternoon. Pacts are made between neighbours so those at work or unable to get to the other side of the island can still get their weekly fresh produce that can’t be bought elsewhere on Islay. Most of us who live in urban or suburban areas have come to expect shelves consistently heaving with fresh produce right up until closing time, and woe betide the supermarket that doesn’t meet those expectations. This need to have anything we want at virtually any time we want has huge consequences for the food supply chain, as well as creating serious issues with food waste. As individuals, we could consider how our own choices are helping cause a surplus of unsold food. Simply giving away unsold but perfectly good food seems like a very sensible idea, but it is complicated both logistically and politically. Aside from practicalities, are supermarkets still liable for the food they give away? What are the legal and logistical realities of giving away highly perishable goods? And given that the present government, which is still leading in some opinion polls, has actively created a hostile environment for immigrants, the poor and the disabled, the chances of it passing a law akin to the one passed by the French senate in 2016, obliging supermarkets to donate unsold food to charities and food banks, are about as likely as the England team making it to the semifinals of the World Cup. Indeed, donating the food to breakfast clubs for children in deprived areas, refugee kitchen spaces, or volunteer kitchens that work alongside food banks would be a PR disaster. It would be a matter of weeks, not months, before a newspaper wrote an exclusive exposé on “scroungers” feasting on free food from supermarkets that hard-working families have to pay for. Corporations may not create these environments but they are highly sensitive to them, and the risk of backfire and outrage may simply be too great. The report also criticised all supermarkets for overzealous best-before dates that lead to millions of pounds’ worth of needless food waste. Are we so distrusting of our own instincts to know when a yoghurt has gone off that we rely on the date on the lid? Just as we need to temper our expectations around fresh produce, we need to better educate ourselves about best-before dates and food waste – or we, the customers, could end up being the baddies. • Rachel McCormack is a writer and broadcaster"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/15/real-madrid-rodrygo-goes-teenager-cristiano-ronaldo","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-15T16:00:15Z","webTitle":"Real Madrid to sign €45m teenager Rodrygo as Ronaldo ‘settles tax affairs’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/15/real-madrid-rodrygo-goes-teenager-cristiano-ronaldo","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/15/real-madrid-rodrygo-goes-teenager-cristiano-ronaldo","fields":{"headline":"Real Madrid to sign €45m teenager Rodrygo as Ronaldo ‘settles tax affairs’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Real Madrid have agreed to sign Rodrygo Goes from the Brazilian side Santos for €45m, with reports in Spain that Cristiano Ronaldo has accepted a settlement over his tax affairs.

The last of the trees planted by the Victorians are now being harvested, and in the intervening century so few have been grown – and fewer still grown in the right conditions for making timber – that imports, mostly from the US and Europe, are the only answer. “We are now using the oaks our ancestors planted, and there has been no oak coming up to replace it,” says Mike Tustin, chartered forester at John Clegg and Co, the woodland arm of estate agents Strutt and Parker. “There is no oak left in England. There just is no more.” Earlier this month, the government appointed the first “tree champion”, who will spearhead its plans to grow 11 million new trees, and conserve existing forests and urban trees. Sir William Worsley, currently chairman of the National Forest Company, has been given the task of overseeing trees in England and Wales, including England’s iconic national tree, and ensuring that trees are not felled unnecessarily. Worsley is a former chief of the Country Land and Business Association, which represents landowners and rural businesses. Trees were once fundamental to the British economy, from the days of Magna Carta, a large section of which concerned forestry rights, to the “Hearts of Oak” centuries of the empire-building Royal Navy, up to more recent times when millions of homes were needed, and the Forestry Commission was set up immediately after the first world war to grow the material to make them, while providing jobs for returning soldiers. Today, forestry is a tiny business and only about 13% of the UK is covered in forest, a vast improvement on the 5% after the first world war, but far less than the European average of more than 30%. The UK produces about 13m tonnes of timber a year, only about 20% of its needs, with the rest coming from imports, and despite tax breaks and incentives the amount of land coming under forest does not appear to be increasing. The coalition government made a marked mis-step when it proposed privatisation of the Forestry Commission, which was officially abandoned but commercial incursions on to forested land have been allowed to increase. Meanwhile, protections for existing trees are sparse, as controversies over Sheffield’s felling plans and Network Rail’s tree-cutting operations have indicated. Planting 11 million new trees, as well as 1 million in urban areas, may appear a tough target, but Tustin notes this would require just 4,400 hectares, compared with the 800 hectares currently planted annually. “It’s a drop in the ocean,” says Tustin. Timber prices have risen sharply in recent months, from about £45 a tonne last year to £65 to £70 a tonne at present. Forested land is a good investment, as owners need not pay inheritance tax or capital gains tax on commercial forests, and government grants are available to cover much of the average £3,500 per hectare cost of planting trees. However, forest owners planting native broad-leaf species for their amenity value, rather than for commercial timber, lose many of the tax benefits. Despite the government incentives, the rates of new forests being planted remain stubbornly low in England, where the high prices of land for farming and for housing development discourage tree-planting, as even the most popular commercial species such as Sitka spruce can take 30 to 50 years to reach maturity for harvesting. One of the first tasks Sir William Worsley will face is establishing the extent of the UK’s forests. John Tucker, director of outreach at the Woodland Trust, says there is little reliable information on how much land is covered by trees in the UK, and there are few protections even for ancient trees, on public or private land. “We are simply not collecting the data, we don’t know where we are,” he says. Without knowing the baseline of how many trees there are now, measuring progress will be impossible. Jeremy Barrell, director at Barrell Tree Consultancy, and a member of the Institute of Chartered Foresters, said: “There is strong anecdotal evidence and improving research evidence to confirm that urban canopy cover is declining around the world, and that is certainly my experience in Britain. Successive UK governments have failed to recognise the threat and act to reverse the adverse impact on ordinary people.” He said the appointment of a national tree champion was “the best chance there has ever been to formally recognise and introduce the importance of urban trees into mainstream built-environment management”. Worsley will also have to address the issues at Network Rail, which has been felling trees for the past decade as part of track management plans. Network Rail says it cuts down 50,000 trees a year. The Guardian has seen a leaked internal document proposing an “enhanced clearance” programme; Network Rail says the paper is just “a piece of modelling work” that was not adopted as policy. Jo Johnson, the rail minister, called a halt to all current tree felling during what is the nesting season and commissioned a review into other options than felling for the rail operator. Local authorities also face dilemmas, following protests in Sheffield over the felling of more than 6,000 trees there. Council members argued that the felling was needed as the trees posed a hazard to vehicles and pedestrians, but many local people objected. Cash-strapped councils must balance the amenity value of trees with the cost of maintaining them, and the potential insurance risks if they are found to contribute to accidents. • This article was amended on 24 August 2018 following a complaint from Network Rail. The readers’ editor substantially upheld the complaint, finding that in initial reports the status of the leaked policy options document had been overstated."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/jun/22/country-diary-the-old-mystery-of-the-devil-birds","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-22T04:30:18Z","webTitle":"Country diary: the old mystery of the 'devil birds'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jun/22/country-diary-the-old-mystery-of-the-devil-birds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/jun/22/country-diary-the-old-mystery-of-the-devil-birds","fields":{"headline":"Country diary: the old mystery of the 'devil birds'","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"I’m not sure why Coggers Lane is so named. A “cogger” in these parts is someone who wields a hammer, and by extension someone who hammers people: a fighter. Hathersage has its moments, but I’m guessing the name is more a fossil of the village’s industrial past. I do know it offers one of the prettiest views of the Derwent valley to the south, and to the east high above the gritstone cap of Higger Tor, richly coloured by the early evening sun. I stood drinking it in until the swarming midges drove me inside. When I emerged hours later the sky was deepening to black, on the threshold of night. Blinking in the gloom, I heard them first: an outburst of screaming that broke over my head. Looking up, half a dozen swifts were slicing and jinking through the thickening dark as they skimmed the roof, or else dived towards their young sheltering in the eaves. Then they were back out, blading through warm air still thick with those hateful midges. Their throats bulged with them, a ball of protein glued together with saliva to bring back to their brood. Swift nests are half-hearted, more nomad’s bivouac than des-res. Vibrant and restless, the birds are never anywhere for long; a burst of summer madness and then, in late July, gone, back to Africa, before the chill of autumn can snag their wings. They likely won’t touch the ground again until next summer. David Lack’s much-loved 1956 book, Swifts in a Tower, is republished this month in an updated edition, his research still the cornerstone of our understanding of this delightful bird. Modern photography also traps their magic in cold detail: wings spread vertically, heads twisted to the horizontal, or else mouths agape as they scoop water from a pond. Even so, watching them in Hathersage, I felt something of their old mystery, these little “devil birds”, as they were once called, with their hooded faces and deep-browed eyes. There’s another old road in Hathersage with a strange name: Besom Lane, “besom” being an old-style broom of tied twigs, the kind a witch might ride, up among the swifts, shrieking their charms against the failing light."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/15/the-guardian-view-on-a-no-deal-brexit-a-fatal-delusion","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-15T16:09:27Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on a no-deal Brexit: a fatal delusion | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/15/the-guardian-view-on-a-no-deal-brexit-a-fatal-delusion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/15/the-guardian-view-on-a-no-deal-brexit-a-fatal-delusion","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on a no-deal Brexit: a fatal delusion","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Dominic Grieve is not a man much inclined to rebellion or grandstanding. That is why the Conservative former attorney general was amenable to compromise with the government in this week’s dispute over parliament’s “meaningful vote” on Brexit terms. Mr Grieve and his fellow Tory rebels agreed not to inflict a humiliating Commons defeat on Theresa May. In exchange, they were told that the government would accept the thrust of their proposal. Mr Grieve had drafted an amendment to the withdrawal bill that would force the prime minister to consult MPs about subsequent action in the event that her Brussels deal is rejected in Westminster. But Mrs May has reneged. The government’s alternative to Mr Grieve’s amendment offers MPs a rubber-stamp motion only, not a serious mechanism to influence events. No 10 exploited the Conservative moderates’ loyal impulses and made fools of them. In so doing, Mrs May has yielded to the warped logic of the most extreme Brexiters. They hated Mr Grieve’s parliamentary safety net, claiming that it spoils Brexit negotiations. They argue that it signals to Brussels that the UK is afraid to leave the EU without a deal, whereas Britain must demonstrate willingness to detonate the whole process in order to persuade the EU members to take its demands seriously. This is a zombie argument, staggering on despite relentless blows of economic and diplomatic reality. The EU is not impressed by the “no deal” gambit. As a bluff it is transparent. Separation on acrimonious terms harms European interests but hurts the UK more. The absence of a deal leads to a frantic scramble to keep ports open and supply chains for essential goods intact. The prime minister would be begging Brussels for a merciful stay of execution. And if it is not a bluff? The Brexiters’ appetite for chaos tells the rest of Europe that they have taken leave of their senses and that the UK is a volatile, unreliable partner. This does not encourage flexibility. The EU side does not need further convincing that the Tories are capable of foolishness. What is missing from the negotiations is a dialogue based on the legal realities of how a future relationship might work – how to resolve the UK’s insistence on keeping old privileges that derive from being “in” alongside entitlement to new privileges of being “out”. Hard leavers refuse to recognise the tension. They cannot construe Brexit in terms of sacrifice. They denied for so long that it would be costly and now, rather than experience the shame of being proved wrong, they plunge deeper into delusion. They have been peddling lies for so long that, like drug dealers, they are now getting high on their own supply. Some of them crave the worst outcome as if it were the best expression of their ideal. Madness. That is not Mrs May’s view because, for all her failings, she has a grasp of how responsible governments behave. But dismissing the no-deal option in private is not enough. She must stop indulging extremists in her party who promote unilateral severance of EU ties as a legitimate course. And those Tory MPs who understand the peril must stand up and be counted on the side of sanity. They must support Mr Grieve’s parliamentary fail-safe mechanism. This is not a question of thwarting or even of diluting Brexit. It is a matter of patriotic duty to take out a legally binding insurance policy, protecting the country against a foreseeable catastrophe."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/shortcuts/2018/jun/15/mystic-marcus-is-the-world-cups-psychic-pig-really-100-accurate","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-15T14:56:25Z","webTitle":"Mystic Marcus: is the World Cup’s psychic pig really 100% accurate?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/shortcuts/2018/jun/15/mystic-marcus-is-the-world-cups-psychic-pig-really-100-accurate","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/shortcuts/2018/jun/15/mystic-marcus-is-the-world-cups-psychic-pig-really-100-accurate","fields":{"headline":"Mystic Marcus: is the World Cup’s psychic pig really 100% accurate?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Name: Mystic Marcus. Age: Eight. Appearance: Porcine. That’s not very nice. It’s OK. Mystic Marcus is a pig. A mystic pig? A prognosticating pig. Does that means he sniffs out truffles? Marcus sniffs out the future. In the past, he has predicted the winner of Wimbledon, foretold of Derby County’s failure to be promoted and divined the outcome of the Brexit vote. Yeah, but what’s he done lately? He has just named the semi-finalists in this year’s World Cup. He sounds like Some Pig. How does he operate? Faced with 32 apples set out in a circle, each with a national flag stuck in it, Marcus chose four. How did he choose them? By eating them. I’m not a pig behaviourist or anything, but isn’t it possible that Marcus, left to his own devices, would eat all 32 apples? You know nothing. It’s about which ones he eats first. Which ones did he eat first? Those with the flags of Belgium, Argentina, Nigeria and Uruguay. Audible sigh. Is this really news? It is in Nigeria – the odds of them reaching the semis are currently 33/1. In that case, Marcus must have eaten the wrong apple. Don’t be so sure. According to his owner, Juliette Stevens, Marcus has so far been right 100% of the time. How can that possibly be true? According to Stevens, his powers derive from his being the seventh piglet of the seventh piglet. “He also predicted Trump would win,” she said. “I said: ‘Marcus, you’ve definitely got that wrong.’ And then look what happened.” Yeah, thanks a bunch, Marcus. He can’t help it. “For one football match he didn’t eat any of the apples,” said Stevens, “and it turned out to be a draw. It’s really bizarre.” There’s a long and idiotic tradition of animals predicting World Cup matches, isn’t there? Yes. You may recall Paul the octopus, who in 2010 correctly predicted the result of all seven of Germany’s World Cup matches, and went on to tip Spain to win in the final. Then he died. RIP Paul. For a cephalopod, you sure knew a lot about football. And this year, Achilles the psychic cat of St Petersburg successfully predicted Russia would beat Saudi Arabia in the first match. What Russian cat would dare otherwise? Meanwhile, in Yekaterinburg, Spartak the clairvoyant lemur went the wrong way and picked the Saudis. Another psychic animal fraudster exposed. That’s the last time I let a lemur tell me which way to bet.

Shujaat Bukhari had just left the Srinagar city office of his newspaper, Rising Kashmir, on Thursday when three men on a motorcycle fired at him and his two guards, police said. Bukhari, 50, was hit multiple times in the head and abdomen and taken to hospital where he was pronounced dead around 7.30pm, police confirmed. He is the first journalist to be killed in 12 years and the 14th since 1990 in Kashmir, a mountainous region fought over by India and Pakistan and claimed in full by both. Police have released CCTV footage of three unidentified men who they said were responsible for the “terror attack”. Militant groups in the Indian-controlled part of Kashmir have fought a three-decade insurgency against India and its perceived allies but none claimed responsibility for the attack. Rising Kashmir, which Bukhari founded in 2008, was among the newspapers to have its printing press shut down in 2016 after the killing of a popular militant triggered months of street protests in which nearly 100 civilians were killed and thousands were blinded by pellets fired by the police and Indian paramilitary officers. Bukhari wrote for the BBC at the time that journalists in Kashmir “had to work on a razor’s edge in what is effectively the world’s most heavily militarised zone”. “Threats to life, intimidation, assault, arrest and censorship have been part of the life of a typical local journalist,” he said. “If a local journalist reports an atrocity by the security forces, he risks being dubbed ‘anti-national’. Highlighting any wrongdoing by the militants or separatists could easily mean that he is ‘anti-tehreek’ (anti-movement) or a ‘collaborator’.” Ishfaq Shah, a subeditor at Rising Kashmir, told the Guardian Bukhari had just left the office when staff heard gunshots. They first assumed they were firecrackers being set off in anticipation of the Islamic festival of Eid-al-Fitr. “Then they looked out the window and saw people running,” he said. After Bukhari’s death was confirmed the “devastated” staff returned to the office and worked to finish the day’s edition with a new front page about their editor. “We did it as a tribute to him,” Shah said. “We were taught by this man to do that.” A witness told the Guardian he rushed to the area after hearing shots and found the editor slumped in his car. “I could only hear his driver murmuring,” he said. A police official at the scene said: “It appears to be a very well-planned attack. The attackers knew the routine.” Police sources have speculated the killing might be related to Bukhari’s involvement last August in a private peace-building initiative involving activists and members of the Indian and Pakistani governments. Senior militant leaders had criticised Bukhari and other Kashmiris involved in the proceedings. The journalist had been given five security guards by the government after a murder attempt in 2000. Three were understood to be posted to his home and two travelled with him. Bukhari’s killing took place amid a push by Delhi to initiate a peace dialogue in Kashmir. A temporary, unilateral ceasefire announced by the government for Ramadan ends on Friday. The Indian home minister, Rajnath Singh, called the editor’s killing “an act of cowardice”. “It is an attempt to silence the saner voices of Kashmir,” he tweeted. “He was a courageous and fearless journalist. Extremely shocked [and] pained at his death.” On Thursday, the UN released its first report on human rights violations in Kashmir, calling for an independent inquiry into allegations of murder, rape and torture committed by India and Pakistan."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2018/jun/15/hamilton-musical-opens-washington-dc-lin-manuel-miranda","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-15T13:14:47Z","webTitle":"Hamilton makes triumphant debut in Washington – but will Trump go to see it?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/jun/15/hamilton-musical-opens-washington-dc-lin-manuel-miranda","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/jun/15/hamilton-musical-opens-washington-dc-lin-manuel-miranda","fields":{"headline":"Hamilton makes triumphant debut in Washington – but will Trump go to see it?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The mega-hit musical Hamilton made a triumphant debut in Washington on Thursday, coinciding with Donald Trump’s birthday. There seems little prospect, however, of the US president ever attending the show. Composer and lyricist Lin-Manuel Miranda paid a visit to former president Barack Obama, a huge fan, before attending the opening performance at the John F Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, where it will run for three months. Miranda was joined by celebrity chef José Andrés, wearing a T-shirt that said: “Immigrants feed America”. Andrés fought a two-year legal battle with Trump after cancelling plans to open a restaurant at his hotel in Washington and continues to jab at him on social media. A celebrated lyric in the musical, “Immigrants: we get the job done”, produced a cheer and applause. Kennedy Center staff said they were not aware of any politicians in attendance, although Hamilton seems a natural fit for a city that lives and breathes politics. It tells the story of Alexander Hamilton, an immigrant from the West Indies who became George Washington’s right-hand man during the Revolutionary war and was the first treasury secretary. The score blends hip-hop, jazz, blues, rap, R&amp;B and Broadway; the diverse casting sees George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and other dead white males (and females) played by actors of colour. The show opened in New York in 2015 and became Broadway’s hottest ticket. Miranda and other cast members were invited by Obama and his wife Michelle to perform at the White House. That seems unthinkable now. Soon after the 2016 election, vice-president-elect Mike Pence was booed at a performance and, at the final curtain, directly addressed by the cast: “We are the diverse Americans who are alarmed and anxious that your new administration will not protect us, our planet, our children, our parents.” Trump wrote on Twitter that Pence had been “harassed” and the cast had been “very rude”. He added: “The cast and producers of Hamilton, which I hear is highly overrated, should immediately apologize to Mike Pence for their terrible behavior.” Miranda has made his view of the president clear. Last October, following the deadly hurricanes in Puerto Rico and Trump’s criticism of the mayor of San Juan, the star, whose parents are from Puerto Rico, tweeted: “She has been working 24/7/ You have been GOLFING./ You’re going straight to hell./ Fastest golf cart you ever took.” It remains to be seen if Trump, who broke with tradition by staying away from last year’s Kennedy Center Honors, or Pence will put in an appearance for the Washington run of Hamilton, which won 11 Tony awards. On Thursday, audience member Dave Austin, 48, who runs an advertising agency, said: “The diversity in this cast is not something I think would be to their taste.” Recalling the “Immigrants: we get the job done” line, he added: “I don’t think they’d be applauding with everyone else.” Hannah Garrett, 26, a graduate student in clinical mental health counselling, said: “I don’t know what they’d get out of it. They know they’re not especially welcome in Washington.” Like many Hamilton fans, Garrett had listened to the soundtrack countless times but had never seen the show. “It’s a time when there’s not a lot to be proud of as an American,” she said. “It’s interesting that it came out of the Obama presidency.” Informed that Miranda was in an attendance, Garrett and two friends shouted in unison: “What?!” and began texting friends in excitement. For theatregoers in DC there has been a long wait for the masterpiece that recounts how Washington became the capital of the US, though Hamilton himself did not spend much time here. As in other cities, thousands of people queued for long hours in person and online to buy tickets. Michael Clements, the editor-in-chief of Capitol File Magazine, said: “It’s huge: from New York to London, then it’s finally made its way to DC. I’m blown away. To feel the energy of the show is completely different from hearing the chatter about it. It’s a beautiful DC night. It takes on a new meaning here, so close to the monuments.” The production has been rapturously received. Peter Marks, the theatre critic of the Washington Post, wrote: “When Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson start rapping about the national debt and states’ rights, you know this hip-hop musical is so made for Washington that it could occupy its own monument on the Mall. And it’s not just any musical, but a work that’s both cool and wonky and without a doubt one of the great musicals of all time.” Daniel Foster, a contributing editor at the National Review, tweeted a photo of himself with a woman against a Hamilton/Kennedy Center backdrop. “Finally saw Hamilton,” he wrote. “Also, she said yes.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/15/us-calls-on-vietnam-to-release-american-citizen-arrested-in-protests","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-15T05:54:57Z","webTitle":"US calls on Vietnam to release American citizen arrested in protests","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/15/us-calls-on-vietnam-to-release-american-citizen-arrested-in-protests","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/15/us-calls-on-vietnam-to-release-american-citizen-arrested-in-protests","fields":{"headline":"US calls on Vietnam to release American citizen arrested in protests","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The United States is calling on the Vietnamese authorities to release one of its citizens who was caught up in a violent police crackdown on protestors who took to the streets across Vietnam this week. Will Nguyen, 32, an American from Houston, Texas, who is currently studying in Singapore, was among those taken into custody on Sunday after he participated in a rare protest in Ho Chi Minh city. Video footage and witness accounts show Nguyen dragged through the streets by plain-clothed police, bleeding from a head injury. Vietnam’s single-party communist state bans anti-government demonstrations and the authorities require approval for public gatherings. However on Sunday, protests erupted against the establishment of new economic zones, which some fear will open the country up to further Chinese investment and interests. The relationship between China and Vietnam has long been strained, but with the growth of Chinese influence across southeast Asia – mainly through infrastructure projects as part of their Belt and Road Initiative – and China’s increasing encroachment across the South China Sea, some Vietnamese have become fearful of their neighbour. Nguyen was one of more than 100 arrested in the demonstrations, which also took place in Hanoi and central Vietnam’s Khanh Hoa and Binh Thuan provinces, where protestors faced tear gas and water cannon when they tried to storm the office of the People’s Committee. There were multiple reports of assaults by the police as they broke up the protests and Brad Adams, Asia Director of Human Rights Watch, said: “With Vietnam’s poor record of handling protests, there’s every reason to believe that police are punishing dissent, not simply keeping public order.” Nguyen is being held in jail, accused of “disturbing the peace”, but has not been charged. Nguyen’s friends and family said Nguyen, who is of Vietnamese descent, was at the protest as an interested bystander and that he has no political agenda. The protest coincided with him visiting Ho Chi Minh city to find a place to live once he finished a masters degree in Singapore. A close friend of Nguyen’s, Mary-Alice Daniel, who is coordinating efforts to get him released, said: “Protest is unusual in Vietnam and Will was there because he really supported it as a display of civil participation.” “He was there because he supported the Vietnamese people, he had no political agenda, it was not ideological. There is no evidence from people on the ground he was misbehaving in any way or doing anything other than peacefully protesting. But he was unlucky and he happened to be picked out from the crowd.” Daniel does not believe the Vietnamese police knew that Nguyen was an American citizen. Thi Thu Hang, spokeswoman for the ministry of foreign affairs denied that force had been used against Nguyen. US embassy spokesman Pope Thrower said that the embassy was aware of reports of the arrest but declined to comment further. “When a US citizen is detained overseas, the US Department of State works to provide all appropriate consular assistance. Due to privacy considerations, we have no further comment.” It is thought that more protests may take place this weekend. Last weekend’s rallies were also in protest against new cyber security laws, which require companies like Google and Facebook to store all data of Vietnam-based users in the country and open local offices. It’s feared this could lead to more government censorship online. The Vietnamese authorities have already overseen the creation of a military cyber warfare unit, countering“wrongful views” online."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/14/real-madrid-spain-absurd-reaction-spain-lopetegui","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-14T18:20:30Z","webTitle":"Real Madrid accuse Spain of ‘absurd reaction’ over Lopetegui sacking","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/14/real-madrid-spain-absurd-reaction-spain-lopetegui","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/14/real-madrid-spain-absurd-reaction-spain-lopetegui","fields":{"headline":"Real Madrid accuse Spain of ‘absurd reaction’ over Lopetegui sacking","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The Real Madrid president, Florentino Pérez, has accused the Spanish Football Federation of an “absurd reaction” in sacking their manager on the eve of the World Cup – a decision Julen Lopetegui described as “the saddest day of my life”. A little more than 24 hours after his contract with Spain was terminated due to secret negotiations with Madrid, Lopetegui was unveiled as the successor to Zinedine Zidane at a hastily arranged press conference having flown back from Russia on Wednesday evening. Luis Rubiales, president of the Spanish FA, had described his decision as an “obligation” after he was informed of the 51-year-old’s impending departure only five minutes before it was made public, with Fernando Hierro placed in charge of the team before their opening match against Portugal on Friday. But in a staunch defence of their conduct, Pérez insisted that Madrid had acted clearly and transparently and expressed his surprise that Rubiales had taken such drastic action. “It was an absurd reaction of misunderstanding and pride, which was aimed at hurting the prestige of Real Madrid,” he claimed. “We reached an agreement very quickly, in a few hours, and wanted to make a show of transparency, to avoid all rumours and speculation during the tournament. “There was no reason at all why Julen Lopetegui should not have been on the Spain national team bench tomorrow. We feel for him that he could not achieve his great goal of success with his country.” Lopetegui, who last month signed a contract extension with Spain until 2022, admitted he was disappointed not to have the chance to lead his country at the World Cup but defended his conduct over the negotiations with Madrid. “Yesterday was the saddest day of my life, since the death of my mother. But this is the happiest day. “When there was something to say the first person to know was Rubiales. I wanted to give a press conference that day but could not. I am clear that the only motive to announce it was to be honest and transparent. I am very relaxed; all of us are. We have acted in a fully professional and honest way. If someone wants to understand things another way, they can. But we have been professional, honest and clear.” He added: “I will support this magnificent group of players. In two years I have had four presidents in the federation. We survived with the strength of the squad, the team, and that strength can make them world champions.” Having begun his career with Real Madrid’s youth and B sides, Lopetegui made only one senior appearance for them before going to play for Barcelona. But he insisted the opportunity to take over at the Bernabéu was too good to turn down and hinted that Cristiano Ronaldo – who will face Spain in Sochi – still has a future at the club despite uncertainty surrounding the Portugal forward. “I came here aged 18 to play for Castilla, to experience the values and the loyalty. I had the fortune to coach Castilla, and now have this great responsibility to coach Real Madrid. It is a closed cycle, and I am very happy. Cristiano is a player I have always admired, and clearly the best in the world should be at Real Madrid.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/jun/15/the-ncaa-must-end-their-silence-on-sexual-violence-in-college-sports","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-15T09:00:12Z","webTitle":"The NCAA must end their silence on sexual violence in college sports","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jun/15/the-ncaa-must-end-their-silence-on-sexual-violence-in-college-sports","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jun/15/the-ncaa-must-end-their-silence-on-sexual-violence-in-college-sports","fields":{"headline":"The NCAA must end their silence on sexual violence in college sports","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"College sports’ Big Sky Conference made an important announcement this month: they plan to adopt a Serious Misconduct Rule for all of their member and affiliate institutions. The rule would target individuals who have been convicted of violent crimes, preventing them from receiving athletic-related financial aid or participating in practice or competition. Andrea Williams, the Big Sky commissioner, said the decision “aligns with the Big Sky’s mission to provide a quality collegiate experience for our student-athletes while focusing on their safety”. It is a big step, and one that is long overdue by all conferences. It’s no secret that sexual assault and violence is rampant throughout college sports. The problem is, despite knowing this, universities have overlooked some athletes’ history of violent behavior, often providing them scholarships when they transfer from another college where they may have been in trouble. One athlete, Alex Figueroa, was kicked off the Univeristy of Miami football team after he was arrested over allegations he raped a drunk 17-year-old on campus. He later took a plea deal and did not serve jail time. That was not the end of his football career. After playing at a community college for a year, Figueroa was offered a full scholarship at the University of Central Oklahoma in 2016. Figueroa’s story is no anomaly. A report by the Wall Street Journal found that, since 2011, at least 108 college athletes who have been convicted for serious crimes transferred to play for another institution. Many of these athletes were awarded scholarships, some attending college on a full ride. The NCAA has not taken direct action on this workaround, leaving it up to individual universities or conferences to determine how to handle players with histories of violence or sexual assault. In her book Unsportsmanlike Conduct: College Football and the Politics of Rape, Jessica Luther writes that by failing to take action, the NCAA abdicates itself from any responsibility to protect women at the universities. Brenda Tracy, an activist who told police she was gang raped by Oregon State football players in 1998, says that the NCAA should implement its own policy. “It needs to be enacted on the national level so that all schools are held to the same standard. The NCAA is a membership made up of student-athletes and they have a duty and responsibility to protect and support these athletes,” she told the Guardian. Because the NCAA has removed itself from providing any real guidance or protocols around this issue, the Big Sky conference’s decision to make it clear that sexual violence will not be permitted is an important one. “I am extremely proud of Big Sky for not waiting on the NCAA. It shows great leadership that they decided to move forward without them. My hope is that the NCAA will see the positive response to the Big Sky policy and enact their own,” Tracy added. The Big Sky Conference is not the first conference to take a measure like this. The Southeastern Conference prohibited schools from allowing transfers who had been dismissed from another school for serious misconduct, including sexual assault, domestic violence or other forms of sexual violence. And last year Indiana University said any prospective student-athlete who had pleaded guilty or no contest to a felony involving sexual violence would not be accepted. In an era where the #MeToo and Times Up movements continue to take shape, and where more and more sexual perpetrators are being held accountable, having another major conference on board is an encouraging sign in reinforcing the notion that student safety is more important than winning games. It also indirectly conveys the message that being a student-athlete is a privilege, not a right. Still, according to Tracy, colleges need to continue stepping up to the plate with policies like Big Sky’s. “I hear a lot that ‘it’s complicated’ and I think people are overwhelmed by the issue, especially sexual assault, but just because something is hard doesn’t mean that you don’t address it.” The NCAA did not respond to requests for comment on this story."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"society/2018/jun/15/social-care-elderly-should-be-free-at-point-of-need-ippr-report","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-14T23:01:00Z","webTitle":"Elderly social care should be 'free at point of need', says report","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/15/social-care-elderly-should-be-free-at-point-of-need-ippr-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/jun/15/social-care-elderly-should-be-free-at-point-of-need-ippr-report","fields":{"headline":"Elderly social care should be 'free at point of need', says report","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Older people should receive free help with basic chores such as washing, dressing and eating in an overhaul that would see social care matching access to the NHS, ministers are to be urged. Personal social care should be “free at the point of need”, just like medical help on the NHS, according to a report by Lord Darzi, the ex-Labour health minister and Lord Prior, a Conservative health minister until 2016. The move would “eliminate catastrophic care costs of over £100,000, which at present impact on around one in 10 elderly people”, they say in a report by the Institute for Public Policy Research thinktank published on Friday. What they call “bold reform” of the under pressure social care system in England would see the annual bill for it more than double from £17bn now to £36bn by 2030, they admit. Their call comes hours after Jeremy Hunt, the health and social care secretary, said that Whitehall negotiations over how much extra money the NHS should get to mark its 70th birthday next month were proving “difficult”. “Lots of you will be wanting me to tell you how my discussions are going with the prime minister and the chancellor, and I would love to be able to share that with you,” Hunt told a gathering of NHS bosses at the NHS Confederation’s annual conference in Manchester. “But sadly I’m just going to have to limit myself to saying the discussions are difficult, they are ongoing. But we should never doubt this prime minister’s commitment to our NHS, to the people who work in it and to the patients who depend on it.” He has been pushing for the NHS to receive annual budget rises of as close to 4% as possible for the next few years. However, Philip Hammond, the chancellor, wants to limit the increase to closer to 2.5% in case the sums needed if a higher figure is agreed prove unaffordable. Age UK threw its weight behind the call for care to become free. “Personal care, free at the point of need, would give older people confidence they would get help when they need it, and this would be a big improvement on the situation we have today,” said Caroline Abrahams, charity director for Age UK. “We would all have to contribute towards funding it but it may just be the kind of bold offer that many older people would consider worthwhile.” However, Simon Stevens, NHS England chief executive, earlier this week cast doubt on social care being run on similar lines to the NHS. “Nationalising social care provision is unlikely to be politically possible, so we are probably going to continue with a plural system,” he told the NHS Confederation on Wednesday. A spokesperson for the department of health and social care rejected the IPPR report, saying: “This government is committed to ensuring that everyone has access to the care and support they need, but we are clear that people should continue to expect to contribute to their care.” Hunt is due to publish a green paper on reforming social care to make it sustainable, including how that would be paid for, before the summer."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/jun/17/siemens-pilots-the-use-of-ammonia-for-green-energy-storage","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-17T13:01:07Z","webTitle":"Siemens pilots the use of ammonia for green energy storage","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/17/siemens-pilots-the-use-of-ammonia-for-green-energy-storage","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jun/17/siemens-pilots-the-use-of-ammonia-for-green-energy-storage","fields":{"headline":"Siemens pilots the use of ammonia for green energy storage","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A chemical compound commonly used to boost crop yields could be the answer to helping the world increase its consumption of renewable energy. In a world first, Siemens is opening a £1.5m pilot project in Oxfordshire employing ammonia as a new form of energy storage. The German industrial firm hopes to prove that ammonia can be as useful as more established storage technologies, such as lithium-ion batteries, when it comes to managing the variable output of wind and solar power. The proof-of-concept facility at Harwell will turn electricity, water and air into ammonia without releasing carbon emissions. The ammonia is stored in a tank and later either burned to generate electricity, sold as a fuel for vehicles or for industrial purposes, such as refrigeration. Dr Ian Wilkinson, programme manager for Siemens’ green ammonia demonstrator, said: “Storage is recognised as the enabler for intermittent renewable power. “This is where we’re different from usual storage, we’re not just looking at power. Usually it’s [storage] just filling in the gaps when the sun’s not shining and the wind is not blowing. We’re looking at other uses, mobility and industrial uses.” Siemens believes ammonia has an advantage other over emerging storage technologies, such as “liquid air” and flow batteries, because it is repurposing existing technology and hardware. The world produces about 170m tonnes of ammonia a year, the vast majority of which is used by farmers as fertiliser. Most of that is made from natural gas, emitting greenhouse gas in the process, but the Harwell plant does not use fossil fuels. While the compound was used as a fuel in Nasa hypersonic jets in the 1960s and some cars have been converted to run on it, Siemens does not expect it to be used directly in cars. The hydrogen in ammonia, however, can be extracted for use. “I see it supporting a hydrogen economy, hydrogen vehicles,” Wilkinson said. Given the demonstration scheme is relatively small in terms of storage and power generation capacity, Siemens is not expecting to make money from the trial. Instead the hope is to establish that the concept can work and prove useful. If the technology took off, the German firm stands to benefit as it makes the electrolysers which use electricity to split water into oxygen, and the hydrogen that is a building block of ammonia. Wilkinson said: “Siemens is looking at a whole range of storage technologies, including batteries and chemical storage [including ammonia].” The Harwell facility opens on 26 June, and was funded with £500,000 by Siemens and £1m from government innovation agency Innovate UK."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/may/25/morning-mail-korea-summit-off-weinstein-to-surrender-red-cross-crisis","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-24T21:05:12Z","webTitle":"Morning mail: Korea summit off after exchange of menacing statements","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/may/25/morning-mail-korea-summit-off-weinstein-to-surrender-red-cross-crisis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/may/25/morning-mail-korea-summit-off-weinstein-to-surrender-red-cross-crisis","fields":{"headline":"Morning mail: Korea summit off after exchange of menacing statements","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Good morning, this is Eleanor Ainge Roy bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Friday 25 May. Top stories Donald Trump has cancelled his planned summit with Kim Jong-un, blaming the decision on a threatening statement from the Pyongyang regime, and warning that the US military is “ready if necessary”. The abrupt decision came after an exchange of menacing statements from US and North Korean officials. In a formal letter to Kim released by the White House Trump wrote: “Sadly, based on the tremendous anger and open hostility displayed in your most recent statement, I feel it is inappropriate, at this time, to have this long-planned meeting.” Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning He declared it would not take place “for the good of both parties, but to the detriment of the world”. Asked if cancellation increased the risk of war, he replied: “We’ll see what happens.” Meanwhile, the president said his campaign of “maximum pressure” would continue, involving the “strongest sanctions ever imposed”. Julian Borger tracks the course of a debacle that “began and ended with a gut decision” by Trump. The Hollywood film producer Harvey Weinstein is expected to surrender to authorities on charges of sexual misconduct, according to multiple reports. More than 70 women have accused Weinstein of sexual harassment and assault, including rape. Weinstein has denied all allegations of non-consensual sex. And in the latest case cascading from the original Weinstein revelations, Morgan Freeman has been accused of sexual and verbal harassment by eight women. According to CNN, the women allege the actor subjected them to inappropriate remarks about their bodies. Freeman said: “Anyone who knows me or has worked with me knows I am not someone who would intentionally offend or knowingly make anyone feel uneasy.” On the eve of Sorry Day, Lorena Allam investigates a child protection system in crisis. Ten years ago tomorrow Kevin Rudd apologised to the stolen generations for the trauma of Australia’s decades-long policy of forced child removals. It is perhaps a strange time for the NSW government to announce controversial changes to child protection – including a push towards open adoptions – when Aboriginal children are so heavily overrepresented in the out-of-home care system. So what is life like for Aboriginal families and children who experience the child protection system? Meet Leticia, Isaiah , Helen and Barbara, and read their experiences of the complexity of child protection and foster care. The Australian Red Cross owes current and former staff millions of dollars in back pay as the charity grapples with a financial crisis brought on by the loss of a multimillion-dollar government contract and hundreds of job losses. Confidential papers obtained by Guardian Australia reveal that the organisation had set aside $10m to deal with “remuneration compliance” for hundreds of past and present staff dating back several years. But that figure escalated to $20m during an audit. The chief executive, Judy Slatyer, said: “I am very sorry mistakes have been made in paying staff and we are taking urgent steps to fix this and pay everyone their entitlements.” The Australian Electoral Commission’s rationale for delaying five lower house byelections is “concerning”, the deputy chair of the committee that recommended improved safeguards for candidate eligibility has said. The Labor MP Andrew Giles told Guardian Australia the recommendation to hold the elections on 28 July was “difficult to understand” on the available material, rejecting the idea that a “guidance note” to help candidates comply with the constitution explained the 79-day wait.

Thinking time Australia has a curious relationship with its wild horses, writes Calla Wahlquist. In the NT and WA, where most of the estimated 300,000 feral horses in Australia can be found, they are routinely shot from helicopters as part of culling that also targets other introduced species such as pigs, buffalo and donkeys. But in the high country straddling the border between NSW and Victoria, the wild horses are revered, embedded in folklore and Australian literary history. Why? In an edited extract from his book One Last Spin, Drew Rooke explores one of the world’s most intense, accessible and ruinous forms of gambling: Australia’s poker machines. He looks at the story behind Blow Up the Pokies, the song released by the Whitlams in 1999. “Set at the now-defunct Sandringham hotel – a live-music venue in Newtown – the song tells the story of a failing father locked in a ‘secret battle’ with poker machines.” Irish citizens are sharing emotional stories as they travel home from all over the world to cast their ballot in Friday’s historic referendum on abortion.

The debacle had been predicted by just about anyone with an experience of negotiating with North Korea, and experts who repeatedly warned that Washington and Pyongyang were talking at cross purposes. The whole episode began and ended with gut decisions made by Donald Trump with minimal reflection and consultation. It had its origins in a visit to Washington on 8 March by the South Korean national security adviser Chung Eui-yong, with a message from Kim Jong-un about his readiness to meet Trump to discuss denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula. Convinced that it had been his campaign of “maximum pressure” that had forced Kim to the table, Trump insisted on seizing the moment, and asked Chung to make an immediate statement to the press outside the White House. But it soon became apparent that Trump had no grasp of the North Korean interpretation of what “denuclearisation” meant. For Pyongyang it implies lengthy negotiations in which North Korea would be treated as an equal to the US, as a nuclear weapons power. Kim had extended the offer of talks only after declaring in January that his regime had successfully developed a credible deterrent, involving thermonuclear warheads and ballistic missiles to carry them. North Korea saw itself negotiating from a position of strength, a military power ready to pivot to economic development. To Trump it meant unilateral disarmament. The gap between these perceptions seems to have been papered over by Chung and his boss, President Moon Jae-in, who desperately needed US buy-in for his own peace agenda with the North to have a chance at succeeding. They heaped praise on Trump as an all-powerful and wise world leader destined to make history. Moon artfully suggested that Trump deserved a Nobel prize, and crowds at Trump rallies took up the cry, to the US president’s evident delight. Between March and May, Trump is reported to have spent little time grappling with the details of how a negotiation might work, focusing instead on the pageantry of the occasion and the staged release of details for the press. In the vacuum, members of his administration went their own way. His new national security adviser, John Bolton, set out maximalist demands for an immediate surrender of North Korea’s nuclear warheads and related equipment, which were to be shipped out to the US. The secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, who met Kim face-to-face on two occasions, alternated between insistence on this all-in-one option and a more phased approach. Trump himself signalled he would be ready to accept the latter, exposing some of the US negotiating strategy, such as it was. Into this swirl, Bolton casually tossed a diplomatic grenade, telling a television interviewer that the US would use the “Libyan model” to approach North Korean disarmament. He had in mind Muammar Gaddafi’s agreement to dismantle and hand over the rudimentary and fledgling nuclear weapons programme at the end of 2003. To Pyongyang, mention of the Libyan model served as a reminder that eight years after giving up his programme, Gaddafi was overthrown and murdered. Trump and the vice-president, Mike Pence, deepened that impression by warning Kim he would face the same fate as Gaddafi if he did not make a deal. The threat drew predictable outrage from North Korea – which Trump presented as the reason for aborting for the summit. But Pompeo told the Senate on Thursday that US officials had also been having difficulty organising summit planning meetings with their North Korean counterparts, who had gone silent in recent days. “The president didn’t want to fly all the way over there and North Koreans not to be there,” Victor Cha, a former national security council official with extensive experience of negotiations with North Korea, said. He added that the silence from Pyongyang suggested Washington may not have been alone in its indecision over negotiations. Pyongyang had done the same thing before in the months after an agreement to carry out phased denuclearisation in six-party talks in 2007. “I am struck by how, when we get close to where it looks like the North Koreans are about to take yes for an answer, they back off,” Cha said. “It forces them to make choices they are not ready to make.” Cha was nominated by the Trump White House as the US ambassador to Seoul, but then his nomination was withdrawn when he opposed the use of bellicose language towards North Korea. He said the cancellation of the summit “might not be an entirely bad thing if it leads to negotiations on a lower level” in an effort to close the gap over denuclearisation. Whether that is the next step, or a return to a tense military standoff, will depend a lot on how Pyongyang responds to Trump’s surprise move."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/may/24/carroll-massively-disappointed-by-200000-trial-collapse","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-24T20:00:41Z","webTitle":"Carroll ‘massively disappointed’ by £200,000 fraud trial collapse","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/24/carroll-massively-disappointed-by-200000-trial-collapse","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/may/24/carroll-massively-disappointed-by-200000-trial-collapse","fields":{"headline":"Carroll ‘massively disappointed’ by £200,000 fraud trial collapse","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Tony Carroll said on Thursday that the collapse of a six-week fraud trial, which arose from a complaint he made against a former employee, was “a massive disappointment” to him and owners at his Worcestershire yard. The veteran trainer issued a categorical denial of “any suggestion that I directed the defendant’s activity”, which was the contention put forward by James Hamer’s defence team during the trial at Hereford crown court. Carroll was responding to a report on the subject in Wednesday’s Guardian. Repeated efforts had been made to obtain comment from him for that story. His statement was issued on Thursday evening by the National Trainers’ Federation. Hamer faced 23 charges of fraud relating to sums totalling £200,000 and faced years in prison if found guilty. Carroll said there was no legitimate explanation for money relating to his business having passed through Hamer’s own bank accounts. However, the defence team said forensic accounting evidence showed the Hamer accounts had been used for the benefit of Carroll’s business. Carroll’s statement added of the legal proceedings: “I contacted the British Horseracing Authority at an early stage and have been completely open with them. I hope justice will eventually be done.” The case collapsed on Tuesday as a result of the prosecution’s failure to make proper, timely disclosure of relevant material to the defence. After the issue of disclosure had been raised a number of times during the trial, the judge eventually called a halt to proceedings. Meanwhile, the businessman Alex Frost has spoken about his hopes for the future of the Tote, in which his Alizeti consortium has bought a 25% stake with a guaranteed option to buy the entire business in three to five years. Asked if he would be exercising that option, Frost said: “That’s very much our aim. But I think what we don’t want to do is go in with both feet. We want to learn about the business alongside some people we respect enormously in the Betfred organisation, they’ve been doing this for a lot longer than we have.” Frost declined to name his investors but has identified them as “racehorse owners who care deeply about the future of the sport”, owning more than 1,000 horses combined. He said those involved were not interested in a quick profit but were committed to a long-term investment with the aim that it should benefit racing. Frost reports he has had positive discussions with the new firm Britbet which will take over on-course pool betting at many tracks in July and believes the two can find a way to work together. “We believe in one pool. I don’t think there’s too many people in the world who suggest that split pools are a good idea. Two cost bases versus one, it doesn’t make much sense, frankly.” Asked how he plans to revive the Tote’s fortunes, Frost said: “I think liquidity is everything in betting now. It’s not as though the pool is new to the UK consumer. Every year, you’ve got millions of people going racing. They’re well aware of what the Tote represents and stands for. It’s just that it hasn’t been a rewarding experience. The placepot and the jackpot are massive, massive marquee brands but nobody’s going to bet on a placepot if the pool is £20,000.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/may/24/trump-pardons-jack-johnson-heavyweight-champion","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-24T17:11:46Z","webTitle":"Trump grants posthumous pardon to heavyweight champion Jack Johnson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/24/trump-pardons-jack-johnson-heavyweight-champion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/may/24/trump-pardons-jack-johnson-heavyweight-champion","fields":{"headline":"Trump grants posthumous pardon to heavyweight champion Jack Johnson","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Donald Trump has granted a rare posthumous pardon to boxing’s first black heavyweight champion more than 100 years after what Trump said many feel was a racially motivated injustice. “It’s my honor to do it. It’s about time,” Trump said during an Oval Office ceremony, where he was joined by former heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis, current WBC heavyweight title-holder Deontay Wilder and actor Sylvester Stallone, who has drawn awareness to Johnson’s cause. Johnson, who captured the title in 1908 and defended it with a famed 1910 victory over former champion James J Jeffries in a bout dubbed the Fight of the Century, was regarded as a master of defense and ring generalship. In 1913, Johnson was convicted by an all-white jury of violating the Mann Act for transporting a woman across state lines for “immoral purposes” in a decidedly shaky case. Duly convicted, Johnson said: “They crucified Christ, why not me?” He then skipped bail and went to Europe. In 1920, he returned to the US and served nearly a year in jail. Known as the Galveston Giant, Johnson is a legendary figure in boxing, who crossed over into popular culture decades ago with biographies, dramas and documentaries following the civil rights era. Johnson died in a car crash in North Carolina in 1946, at the age of 68. He has been widely celebrated since, inspiring a seminal jazz rock album by Miles Davis and books and films including a 2004 documentary by Ken Burns, Unforgivable Blackness: the Rise and Fall of Jack Johnson. His great-great niece had been pressing for a posthumous pardon. Senator John McCain and former Senate majority leader Harry Reid had also pushed Johnson’s case for years. “Johnson’s imprisonment forced him into the shadows of bigotry and prejudice, and continues to stand as a stain on our national honor,” McCain has said. Posthumous pardons are rare, but not unprecedented. President Bill Clinton pardoned Henry O Flipper, the first African-American officer to lead the Buffalo Soldiers of the 10th Cavalry Regiment during the Civil War, and Bush pardoned Charles Winters, an American volunteer in the Arab-Israeli War convicted of violating the US Neutrality Acts in 1949. Linda E Haywood, the great-great niece, wanted Barack Obama, the nation’s first black president, to pardon Johnson, but Justice Department policy says “processing posthumous pardon petitions is grounded in the belief that the time of the officials involved in the clemency process is better spent on the pardon and commutation requests of living persons”. The Justice Department makes decisions on potential pardons through an application process and typically makes recommendations to the president. The general DOJ policy is to not accept applications for posthumous pardons for federal convictions, according to the department’s website. But Trump has shown a willingness to work around the DOJ process in the past."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"books/2018/jun/09/all-lives-we-never-lived-anuradha-roy-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-09T06:30:15Z","webTitle":"All the Lives We Never Lived by Anuradha Roy review – compelling tale of history and family","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jun/09/all-lives-we-never-lived-anuradha-roy-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/jun/09/all-lives-we-never-lived-anuradha-roy-review","fields":{"headline":"All the Lives We Never Lived by Anuradha Roy review – compelling tale of history and family","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Here is a novel that could so easily have been loud. It is set among large events: the fight for Indian independence and the second world war. It features characters from history who enter the lives of the novel’s fictional characters, often to dramatic effect – the poet Rabindranath Tagore, the singer Begum Akhtar, the dancer and critic Beryl de Zoete and the German painter and curator Walter Spies. It has at its heart a young boy whose mother leaves him to live in another country, and whose father responds to this crisis by also leaving the child for an extended period of time, and who is later imprisoned for his anti-British activism. There are many reasons to turn up the volume dial. But readers of Anuradha Roy, whose previous novel Sleeping on Jupiter was longlisted for the 2015 Man Booker prize, know that shoutiness or showiness is never her style. She is a writer of great subtlety and intelligence, who understands that emotional power comes from the steady accretion of detail. Amid all the great events and characters of history, she chooses as her narrator a horticulturalist known throughout by his nickname, Myshkin – “a man who chose neither pen nor sword but a trowel”. Myshkin is nine years old when his mother leaves him and his father in the fictitious Indian town of Muntazir, and embarks on a new life with Spies. Muntazir is 20 or so miles from the Himalayan foothills, and its name means, in Urdu, “one who waits impatiently”. After his mother’s departure, Myshkin’s life is spent anxiously waiting – for her letters to arrive, for her to return. In later years, he compares that waiting to “blood being drained away from our bodies until one day there was no more left”. The older Myshkin, a man in his 60s, narrates the story. He is the adult version of the child whose blood drained away, now living quietly, more at home among trees than people. In the course of this deliberately self-contained life, a bulky envelope arrives one day. It has something to do with his mother, he knows, and he cannot bring himself either to open it or to throw it away. Instead, his narration takes us back to his mother’s childhood, and then to his own childhood. He is a man seeking to understand why his mother, Gayatri, made the choice she did – and to this end he delves into the unusual freedom of her adolescence, compared with the rigidity and constraint of her married existence in 1930s India. She was an artist and dancer married to a man who saw dance as scandalous and art as irrelevant, particularly when set against the great matters of history in which he chose to be involved as a member of an anticolonial organisation, the Society for Indian Patriots. Into her world steps Spies, bringing with him new possibilities. (It would be best for the unknowing reader not to search out biographical details on Spies – knowing them might detract from some of the surprises of the plot.) But Gayatri’s own life and art and Myskhin’s memories of his parents’ marriage are not sufficient to explain to him why his mother did what she did. He looks for answers elsewhere, searching in literature for insight into the tensions between women’s desires and the world’s expectations of them. To this end, the novel gives some space to discussing the Indian poet Maitreyi Devi, who wrote about her early romance with the Romanian writer Mircea Eliade. It’s perhaps the only point in the book that doesn’t feel entirely well judged – Devi’s story could have done with occupying either far more, or less, space in the story, but even so it adds to our understanding of Myshkin’s quality of searching, the wound inside him that won’t ever heal. Part of Roy’s skill as a writer is shown in her ability to reveal the awful consequences of Gayatri’s choices while retaining great compassion for those choices. This novel is not interested in condemning absent mothers. By contrast, Roy is refreshingly unimpressed by the anti-imperial activities of Myshkin’s father – who seeks freedom from being ruled while behaving like a tyrant in his own home. The world that rewards men for their public actions and forgives them their private cruelties, placing national politics above gender politics, is one that Roy slices through in her prose, though always obliquely. All the Lives We Never Lived is set largely in the early part of the 20th century, with some sections in the 1990s. It does not directly refer to #MeToo or the macho hyper-nationalism of today’s India. But in its portrayal of power structures, it is part of those very contemporary political conversations. It is also a beautifully written and compelling story of how families fall apart and of what remains in the aftermath. • Kamila Shamsie’s Home Fire (Bloomsbury) is the winner of this year’s Women’s prize for fiction.

Plug sockets, a toilet, maybe even a TV. Somewhere to store their bags that wasn’t their own laps would have been nice. But the minibus that pulled up outside the Arkles pub in Anfield on Thursday was a little more … rustic. Let’s just say the jerry can a fellow passenger had brought with him from work “for emergencies” was likely to be in high demand on the 2,750km-journey to the Ukrainian capital. Given the number of pints sunk in the pub beforehand, it may well have been full by the time the bus trundled on to the M62. Yet the cheerful couple were determined to make the best of things. “There was no way we were going to miss the match,” said Anna, white wine in hand. At least their transport showed up. A thousand other Liverpool fans found themselves stuck at John Lennon airport on Thursday when the air traffic controllers in Kiev decided they weren’t going to be able to cope with all the extra flights and denied three Scouse planes a landing slot. Onboard the minibus from the Arkles, not everyone had managed to wangle one of Liverpool’s 16,000 tickets for the match against 12-times Champions League winners Real Madrid – including organiser Martin Cleary and his 17-year-old son, Lewis Francis Cleary (“His initials are LFC – my missus is an Evertonian so I had to register him when she was still under sedation”). Father and son were confident of getting inside Kiev’s Olympic stadium, even if they got burnt last time they bought from the secondary market. “We paid £600 for e-tickets for the [Champions League qualifying] game against [Slovenian side] Maribor and when we got there they were blank, fakes,” said Cleary, who has planned for the bus to turn back around at 2am on Sunday, pretty much straight after the match. Jess Handley, 23, who was travelling alone, was unfazed by the journey ahead. “It’s the chance of a lifetime. You’ve got to grab it,” she said. Her mum, along to wave her off with her nana and granddad, was less sure. “How will she ring me to say she’s OK if she can’t charge her phone?” A few doors down at John’s Supper bar, a popular post-match chippy, the owner John Paraskeva was preparing for Saturday night, when 30,000 fans are expected to watch the game on screens at the stadium five minutes walk away. He had sourced a lifesize cutout of Mo Salah, the Egyptian king of Anfield, and was making a big vat of curry sauce to pour over chips for £1.50 a cone. “I tried to get tickets in the ballot to go to Kiev but I didn’t get any, so I’ll make the best of things here,” he said, still excited about Sadio Mané, Liverpool’s star winger, pulling up in his Porsche outside after the penultimate game of the season. “I offered him free chips but he said he had to look after his diet.” Outside the stadium, merchandise stalls were doing a brisk trade, with anything Salah-related most in demand. Buying flags for her car, Elizabeth Wright, 66, was another fan of the Egyptian striker. “People are now going to mosques because of him. He’s bringing harmony – that’s nice, isn’t it? I might go to mosque on Sunday. Are mosques open on Sundays?” In Liverpool city centre, many businesses are capitalising on the match by upping their prices on Saturday night. The German-themed Bierkeller is selling tickets for £20 a pop and most hotels have tripled their usual prices. Gareth Roberts, the editor of the Anfield Wrap, a Liverpool FC podcast and fanzine, said it was “a bit grim” how much profiteering was going on in his home city. Those charging silly prices may regret it in the long-term, he suggested: “It leaves a bad taste in the mouth. I think a lot of fans will be choosing their bars more carefully in future.” He said he had been contacted by fans from all over the world who couldn’t get tickets to Kiev so were descending on Liverpool instead. “When they’re being fleeced like this it doesn’t give the best impression of Liverpool,” he said. “It’s a tax on the passion of football.” Back at the Arkles, manager Carl Baines said they were treating it as an ordinary match day. “We’re not going to charge fans to come and watch the biggest game of the season.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"technology/2018/may/24/alone-in-berlin-and-lost-without-a-mobile","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-24T16:41:40Z","webTitle":"Alone in Berlin, and lost without a mobile | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/may/24/alone-in-berlin-and-lost-without-a-mobile","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/may/24/alone-in-berlin-and-lost-without-a-mobile","fields":{"headline":"Alone in Berlin, and lost without a mobile","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"John Harris’s critique of the internet revolution (Ignore the hype over big tech.

But its stock market, fuelled by the rise of Apple, Google, Amazon and Facebook, comprises 60% of the value of all shares traded on the planet. The Dow Jones index of Wall Street-traded companies stood at 16,000 in early 2016, but is about 25,000 now. And the Nasdaq index of tech shares has nearly doubled in just two years. Together, Apple, Google, Amazon and Facebook are now worth $3tn (£2.2tn). Meanwhile, closer to home, the FTSE 100 earlier this week hit a record high. Is this a bubble? And is there anything the average person can do to protect themselves? The answer to the first question must always be “don’t know”. None of us can predict equity movements and, if stock market history teaches us anything, it’s that bubbles go on for much longer and become much bigger long after the first naysayers warn about overvaluations. The global technological domination of the US is so overwhelming that maybe some of those valuations are justified. Europe’s tech sector is a pipsqueak in comparison, China’s only exists behind protective walls and Japan’s is virtually non-existent. Whatever your views on tax-avoiding Amazon or data-harvesting Facebook, the likelihood is that you are invested in them and US shares in general. British pension funds, which used to be stuffed full of home-spun giants such as ICI or Midland Bank, are now hugely globalised. My own company pension, managed by Legal &amp; General, has about 20% of its long-term fund invested in North American equities, compared with just 12% in UK ones. My retirement security rests on US equity valuations and the future success of the big four tech giants, whether I like it or not. But as one manager of Japan shares at investment firm Baillie Gifford told me this week, the share prices of many US stocks have been inflated by companies taking out loans cheaply and using the cash to buy back their own shares, thus pushing the price up. The FTSE’s rise should be much less of a concern. As Jason Hollands of financial firm Tilney points out, on most measures the prices of UK shares are a long way off the heady levels of the dotcom bubble and broadly in line with longer-term trends. “In a global context, UK equities look a relative bargain among developed markets,” he says. Most people, particularly those some way from retirement, are probably best to go with the slings and arrows of stock market fortunes and stick with the asset allocation model supplied by their company. Individuals who try to time the peaks and troughs of markets invariably fail. That said, I tried this week to tilt my pension away from the US and put in a bit more elsewhere. But while I can put more into a UK fund, the only other option is to go into bonds instead. With interest rates likely to rise at some point, that doesn’t appeal. It’s disappointing that while only a few nerdy types such as me will ever actually do it, we have so few options to manage our pensions. The reality is that I will remain heavily invested in the US tech giants. They don’t just own your data, they own your pension as well."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"global-development/2018/may/24/sudanese-teenager-who-killed-rapist-husband-appeals-death-sentence-forced-marriage-noura-hussein","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-24T17:12:03Z","webTitle":"Sudanese teenager who killed rapist husband appeals death sentence","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/may/24/sudanese-teenager-who-killed-rapist-husband-appeals-death-sentence-forced-marriage-noura-hussein","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2018/may/24/sudanese-teenager-who-killed-rapist-husband-appeals-death-sentence-forced-marriage-noura-hussein","fields":{"headline":"Sudanese teenager who killed rapist husband appeals death sentence","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The lawyers for a young Sudanese woman sentenced to death for killing her husband as he tried to rape her have formally appealed the ruling as a petition calling for her to be spared reached a million signatures. The legal team working on behalf of 19-year-old Noura Hussein, whose case has become an international cause celebre, had until Thursday to file an appeal to the death sentence handed down by a Sudanese court 15 days ago. High-profile figures have joined the campaign to get the sentence overturned, among them the model Naomi Campbell, actors Mira Sorvino, Emma Watson and Rose McGowan, and Julia Gillard, the former Australian prime minister. Ahead of the appeal, Hussein told the Guardian from prison in the city of Omdurman that, if she was pardoned, she planned to study law to help others. “When I get out of here, I want to study law to defend other oppressed people,” she said. Her case has underlined the issue of forced marriage, including minors, and women’s rights in the Sudanese courts system. Forcibly married by her family at 16 to an older man chosen by her father, Noura fled to take refuge at an aunt’s house. But after three years she was tricked into returning home by her own family, who then handed her over to her husband’s family. According to her supporters – including the activist group Equality Now, which is backing a petition organised on her behalf – Hussein had been with her husband for six days when he raped her with the assistance of his brother, a relative, and a witness, who held her down. When he attempted to rape her again the following day, she stabbed her husband to death before going to her own parents, who handed her over to police. One of her lawyers, Ahmer Sibair, said forced marriage was a familiar problem in Sudan. “Marrying girls and women without their consent is common in Sudan, and it causes so many problems. They marry a girl as a child and without her consent, and so many of them lost their chances to be educated.” Sibiar added that Noura, although she seemed “strong and coherent”, did not “understand her situation”. Activists who have been supporting her in her legal process cautioned that, despite the appeal against her conviction and death sentence, it could take months for the appeal court to rule. Equality Now, which has been working with a local partner in Sudan, released a copy of the appeal, which argued that Hussein was the victim in the case after killing her rapist while she defended herself. “Noura was a victim of child marriage, forced marriage, rape and denial of justice,” her legal team said in a statement. “As if that was not enough, she now is at the brink of losing her life for defending herself from violence, where law, tradition and culture failed her. “Noura and indeed the women and girls of Sudan have too often been treated as chattels to be traded and given away as though they are property, and as though they have no rights. “Here today, united and in one voice we wish to say – ‘Enough!’ We want to turn on the light against perpetrators who prey on children and women, violate them and expect protection from the law.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/may/29/revealed-industrial-scale-beef-farming-comes-to-the-uk","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-29T14:00:16Z","webTitle":"Revealed: industrial-scale beef farming comes to the UK","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/29/revealed-industrial-scale-beef-farming-comes-to-the-uk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/may/29/revealed-industrial-scale-beef-farming-comes-to-the-uk","fields":{"headline":"Revealed: industrial-scale beef farming comes to the UK","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Thousands of British cattle reared for supermarket beef are being fattened in industrial-scale units where livestock have little or no access to pasture. Research by the Guardian and the Bureau of Investigative Journalism has established that the UK is now home to a number of industrial-scale fattening units with herds of up to 3,000 cattle at a time being held in grassless pens for extended periods rather than being grazed or barn-reared. Intensive beef farms, known as Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs) are commonplace in the US. But the practice of intensive beef farming in the UK has not previously been widely acknowledged – and the findings have sparked the latest clash over the future of British farming. The beef industry says that the scale of operations involved enables farmers to rear cattle efficiently and profitably, and ensure high welfare standards. But critics say there are welfare and environmental concerns around this style of farming, and believe that the farms are evidence of a wider intensification of the UK’s livestock sector which is not being sufficiently debated, and which may have an impact on small farmers. In contrast to large intensive pig and poultry farms, industrial beef units do not require a government permit, and there are no official records held by DEFRA on how many intensive beef units are in operation. But the Guardian and the Bureau has identified nearly a dozen operating across England, including at sites in Kent, Northamptonshire, Suffolk, Norfolk, Lincolnshire, Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire. The largest farms fatten up to 6,000 cattle a year. Drone footage and satellite images reveal how thousands of cattle are being kept at some sites in outdoor pens, known as corrals, sometimes surrounded by walls, fences or straw bales. Although the cattle will have spent time grazing in fields prior to fattening, some will be confined in pens for around a quarter of their lives, until they are slaughtered. Supermarket demand is believed to be, at least in part, driving the trend. In addition, some smaller and medium-scale beef producers have struggled to farm profitably in recent years, with sometimes tight margins and fluctuating costs. Most of the units identified are believed to have grown incrementally, rather than setting up from scratch. A number of retailers, including the Co-op, Lidl and Waitrose, are among those found to be sourcing beef from UK intensive industrial scale farms, most of which are privately owned but sell to beef processing companies, which in turn supply retailers. Chris Mallon, director of the National Beef Association (NBA), the industry trade body, said the reason the largest units have come about was purely down to “efficiency”. “What we’re talking about here is commercial production, for feeding people. It’s not niche market. A lot of this will be on supermarket shelves – that’s where it’s coming into its own. In the catering side as well, they’ll be doing it,” he said. “One of the things we’ve seen over the years is supermarket domination of the beef trade. What they want is specification, size of cuts, size to fit certain packaging, size of roasts – this has all become incredibly important.” But he cautioned that farms dedicated to fattening cattle had always been bigger than those rearing them, “so actually having higher concentration of feeding cattle on units [isn’t new]. “The difference is we’re getting some larger units now and that will be because of economies of scale … if you can give the people you’re supplying a constant supply of cattle that are in the right specification, that makes you more valuable. And that’s one of the reasons we’ve seen a move towards it.” Dr Jude Capper, a livestock expert who has studied intensive beef units in the US and elsewhere said that due to economies of scale “it’s almost inevitable that a larger farm can produce a greater quantity of a more affordable product – we see this in almost all agricultural sectors globally, just as we do in other industries”. The Guardian and Bureau last year revealed that 800 poultry and pig “mega farms” or CAFOs have appeared in the British countryside in recent years, some housing more than a million chickens or about 20,000 pigs. Following the revelations, the environment secretary, Michael Gove, pledged that Brexit would not be allowed to result in the spread of US-style agribusiness: “I do not want to see, and we will not have, US-style farming in this country,” he said in a parliamentary statement. Although the number of beef units is tiny in comparison with intensive poultry or pig farms, the latest findings have further fuelled fears that the UK could be embracing industrial-scale practices. Caroline Lucas, MP for Brighton Pavillion, said the farms were “gravely concerning” and that “with Britain hurtling towards Brexit, and with our animal and environmental protections facing an uncertain future, I’m worried that we could end up adopting more of this US-style agricultural practice”. Richard Young, Policy Director at the Sustainable Food Trust, said: “Keeping large number of cattle together in intensive conditions removes all justification for rearing them and for consumers to eat red meat... More than two-thirds of UK farmland is under grass for sound environmental reasons and the major justifications for keeping cattle and eating red meat are that they produce high quality protein and healthy fats from land that is not suitable for growing crops.” Young added that that smaller scale beef farmers might feel the impact, as larger farms were likely to be “more efficient in purely economic terms”, allowing the supermarkets “to drive down the retail price of beef below the price at which more traditional farmers can produce it. As a result they go out of business.” The changing face of traditional UK beef production Beef production in the UK typically involves three distinct stages - calf rearing, growing and fattening - with many farms specialising in one part of the rearing process. Cattle may move between a number of different farms during their lifecycle. (A smaller number of farms rear cattle from birth and keep them on the same farm until being sent to the abattoir.) After spending time on pasture many cattle are moved to dedicated “finishing units” and are typically housed in barns or grazed whilst being fattened ahead of slaughter, often for around 6 months. Many are fed specialist diets designed to encourage weight gain. But in the US, much beef fattening takes place in “feedlots” with cattle held in vast outdoor pens where the largest facilities confine up to 85,000 livestock. Such “feedlots” have proved controversial in the past, both because of their size and because many cattle were given hormones and antibiotics, sometimes to encourage rapid growth. (Such practices are not permitted in the UK). Despite acknowledging the arrival of intensive beef farming in the UK, experts reject the notion that the British beef sector will see a wholesale shift towards farming on a US-scale. “Are we likely to see huge – 100,000 head – feedlots? No. We don’t have the market, infrastructure or public demand for them,” said Capper. “However, could we make better use of male calves from dairy farms by rearing them for beef in feedlot-style operations, using feeds that we cannot [or] will not eat, such as by-products from human food crop production? Absolutely – some beef producers are already doing this.” Caroline Lucas called for the system of permits to be tightened up, and said “the Government should be officially recording the number of feedlots rather than letting reporting slip through a loophole … we need a proper debate in this country over what kind of agriculture we want in the future.” A spokesperson for DEFRA said that “beef farms are regulated in exactly the same way as any other farms”. But it later acknowledged that “Defra does not have a database of feedlot style units...The Cattle Tracing System can provide figures on the number of holdings split by premised type e.g. Agricultural Holding, Slaughterhouse, Market etc. and the number of animals registered to each. However, it does not hold any data in respect of the feeding practices on the holdings.” Waitrose said of its own supplier: “Animal welfare is of the highest importance to us and a large farm does not equal poor animal welfare standards. The farm is run under a bespoke environmental management plan in conjunction with Natural England. All the cattle graze the marshes during the summer season then during the winter months, when the grass is dormant the cattle are bought back to the yard when the finishing/fattening cattle are housed in covered sheds. For clarification the length of grazing season is weather dependent, once the grass stops growing the cattle need to be yarded and fed a forage based ration in accordance with animal welfare and best practice.” A spokesperson for the British Retail Consortium said: “Our members take their responsibilities to animal welfare very seriously and work closely with trusted suppliers so that high welfare standards are upheld. They have strict processes in place and will thoroughly investigate any evidence of non-conformity to ensure that any problems are immediately addressed.” The Guardian approached several of the largest units but all declined to comment. Some in the beef industry itself have expressed unease about the intensive farming system. Russ Carrington, of the Pasture Fed Livestock Association, said: “It is sad that the travel towards cheap, de-valued food has led to the removal of livestock from fields. There is a very different, more sustainable way of producing high quality beef which is also considerably healthier for humans to eat – 100% grass-fed and grain-free, which has lower total and saturated fat content, a better ratio of omega 3 to omega 6 fatty acids and more vitamins and minerals, which comes from the diverse pasture they eat.” Pressure group Compassion In World Farming (CIWF) have raised concerns that some cattle held at in “feedlots” are kept in “high stocking densities” with little or no shelter or shade and “no dry ground to rest on.” The group says it believes “cows belong on pasture”. In response Dr Jude Capper said: “In my experience at feedlots all over the world, I’ve yet to see any welfare issues that are inherent to the system. If we are to assume that cattle must be able to graze to lead a ‘happy’ life, then confinement may be regarded as an issue. However, I’ve yet to see this being backed by [any evidence-base].” Evidence compiled by the Bureau and Guardian suggests that most intensive beef farms appear to operate to high welfare standards. Chris Mallon said: “Cattle actually will be very happy in [these systems]. Cattle in the wild don’t build nests for themselves or hide in caves, they’re an outdoor animal and I think we’ve got to remember that.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2018/may/24/netflix-disney-most-valuable-media-company-latest-list","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-24T17:50:59Z","webTitle":"Netflix overtakes Disney to become most valuable US media company","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/may/24/netflix-disney-most-valuable-media-company-latest-list","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2018/may/24/netflix-disney-most-valuable-media-company-latest-list","fields":{"headline":"Netflix overtakes Disney to become most valuable US media company","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Netflix surpassed Disney as the most valuable US media company on Thursday, a sign that Netflix’s subscriber growth, coupled with potential problems in Disney’s acquisition of 21st Century Fox’s TV and film assets, as well as changes in entertainment media consumption habits, are contributing to fundamental shifts in power. Netflix’s stock is up 70% since January. Netflix shares jumped energetically in Thursday morning trading and by 12.15pm local time in New York, the stock was up 1.9%, to an all-time high of $351.09 per share. That gave the company a market capitalization of nearly $162bn. Disney, by contrast, was down 1.1% to $101.74 per share, giving it a market value of $151.6bn. Disney’s drop was based largely on fears that the cable operator and NBCUniversal parent Comcast, armed with $60bn in cash, might prevail in a battle with Disney for Fox assets. Streaming giant Netflix is riding high on news of a multimillion-dollar deal with Barack and Michelle Obama to use their newly created TV production house, Higher Ground Productions, to create shows. “We hope to cultivate and curate the talented, inspiring, creative voices who are able to promote greater empathy and understanding between peoples, and help them share their stories with the entire world,” the former president said earlier this week. Netflix has also cut recent deals with Shonda Rhimes, who produced Grey’s Anatomy and Scandal, and Glee creator Ryan Murphy. According to the Financial Times, the Obamas’ “multiyear” agreement includes both scripted and unscripted series, documentaries and feature films. But the battle between Netflix and Disney may only just be heating up. The two companies have been wary rivals, with Disney licensing some content to Netflix. That agreement is set to expire as Disney pushes deeper into subscription-streaming territory. The competition for creative talent has also been joined by Apple, Google and Amazon, each pouring billions of dollars into content production. That’s led to a sharp rises in costs – and a payday for talent – with traditional entertainment studios struggling to match Silicon Valley’s deep pockets."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/may/25/close-result-expected-in-irelands-abortion-referendum","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-25T10:34:38Z","webTitle":"Ireland abortion referendum: close result expected in historic vote","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/25/close-result-expected-in-irelands-abortion-referendum","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/25/close-result-expected-in-irelands-abortion-referendum","fields":{"headline":"Ireland abortion referendum: close result expected in historic vote","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The people of Ireland are voting on Friday in a historic referendum on whether to repeal or retain a constitutional clause protecting the rights of the unborn that has produced one of the most restrictive abortion regimes in the world. Polling stations across Ireland opened at 7am and close at 10pm. At 6.55am in Dublin, voters were already waiting in the entrance of Our Lady’s Clonskeagh Parish secondary school. Ruth Shaw, who was second in the queue, had changed a flight to New York so she could cast a vote, accompanied by her nine-year-old daughter Simi. “Its really important [to be here],” she said. “I’ve got two daughters.” The outcome of the vote, expected to be close following a polarised and often acrimonious campaign, will either confirm Ireland on its journey from a conservative Catholic country to a socially liberal one, or indicate that social reforms over recent decades have reached their limit. Leo Varadkar, Ireland’s taoiseach, has said the referendum is a “once in a generation decision”. If the proposal to repeal the constitutional clause is defeated, it is likely to be at least 35 years before voters get another say on the matter, he said this week. On Friday he said he was “quietly confident.” “Not taking anything for granted, of course, but quietly confident,” he told reporters. “There has been a good turnout so far across the country.” “A high turnout, I think, would be to the advantage of the ‘Yes’ campaign.” At stake is article 40.3.3 of the Irish constitution, known as the eighth amendment. In place since 1983, it puts the “right to life of the unborn” on an equal status with the life of a pregnant woman. It underpins a near-total ban on abortion in Ireland, even in cases of rape, incest or fatal foetal abnormality. Seeking or providing an abortion is punishable by up to 14 years in prison. There has been an exception for when a mother’s life is at risk only since 2013, when a woman died from septicaemia following a drawn-out miscarriage. As a result of the stringent controls on abortion, each year about 3,500 women travel abroad, mostly to the UK, to terminate their pregnancies – and an estimated 2,000 women illegally procure abortion pills online and self-administer them with no medical supervision. If the vote is in favour of repeal, the government plans to introduce legislation permitting unrestricted abortion during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. Abortions up to the 23rd week will be permitted when a woman’s health is threatened and in cases of a fatal foetal abnormality. Voting has already closed on some of the islands on the west and south of Ireland, with 2,151 people entitled to vote yesterday on the Donegal, Galway and Mayo islands and another 460 voting in the Cork islands. Counting will begin on Saturday morning, with the final result expected to be formally announced in the late afternoon. However, the outcome may be clear earlier as results come in from key constituencies. Dublin is expected to be strongly yes-voting, and rural areas more inclined to vote no. Campaign literature is officially banned in polling stations, but at least one person had come to Our Lady’s Clonskeagh Parish school wearing a yes badge hidden under her sweater, a symbolic tribute to the campaign she supported. Aisling, 31, came just as the polls opened to cast her vote for yes before going to the gym. “I really don’t know [which side will win],” she said. “It’s very divisive and probably no is a bit controversial, a lot of people won’t speak out [if they are voting that way].” The votes of thousands of Irish expatriates travelling home to take part in the referendum could be significant. Some reported on social media that they were coming from as far away as Los Angeles, Australia, Vietnam and Argentina in order to cast their votes. Lauryn Canny tweeted: Colette Kelleher tweeted: The latest opinion polls indicate a majority for repeal, although undecided voters – estimated at between 14% and 20% of the total – could hold sway. Two polls published this week showed small increases in the yes vote, with one putting it at 56% and another at 52%. One poll also used a technique known as “wisdom of the crowds”, asking people to estimate the result of the referendum. The outcome was 56-44% in favour of yes. Private polling for Fianna Fáil, whose parliamentary representatives are divided on the referendum, is believed to predict a similar outcome. Friday’s referendum comes three years after Ireland became the first country in the world to back same-sex marriage in a popular vote, confirming a profound shift in Ireland’s social attitudes. Twenty years earlier, Ireland voted by the tightest of margins in a referendum to allow divorce, which was previously banned under the constitution. Changes in social attitudes have been in lockstep with the declining influence of the Catholic church, once the dominant voice in Ireland and a crucial player in the drive to add an abortion ban to the constitution. But revelations of sexual abuse and cover-up by priests in recent years have shaken Ireland’s faith in the church, and the internet and social media have challenged the authority of the pulpit. Although 78% of the population still identified as Catholic in 2016, the proportion is significantly smaller among people under the age of 35. Between 1972 and 2011, weekly church attendance fell from 91% to 30%. In Dublin, it dropped to 14%. Social media has been an important battleground for both sides of the campaign. Earlier this month, Google announced a ban on all ads relating to the referendum and Facebook announced that it was blocking all foreign referendum advertising. But there has also been an intense ground battle, with campaigners for both sides canvassing door-to-door, holding public rallies and meetings, and handing out leaflets on the streets in an attempt to win over undecided voters. The yes campaign has focused on the argument that abortion is a reality for thousands of Irish woman, but the constitutional ban merely exports the issue at huge emotional, physical and financial cost to a woman in a crisis situation. The no campaign has repeatedly said “extremist” legislation would follow repeal. In fact, the government’s proposals would bring Ireland into line with most of Europe."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2018/may/27/hamlet-as-you-like-it-michelle-terry-shakespeares-globe-shirleymander-playground","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-27T07:00:20Z","webTitle":"The week in theatre: Hamlet; As You Like It; Shirleymander – review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/may/27/hamlet-as-you-like-it-michelle-terry-shakespeares-globe-shirleymander-playground","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/may/27/hamlet-as-you-like-it-michelle-terry-shakespeares-globe-shirleymander-playground","fields":{"headline":"The week in theatre: Hamlet; As You Like It; Shirleymander – review","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Why does the artistic directorship of the Globe matter so much?

Sauciness! – she was damned for insufficiently respecting the theatre’s traditions. Who did the board think they were appointing? A false opposition has grown up between the original practices of founding artistic director Mark Rylance and Rice’s carnivalesque. It is the unique electricity between audience and stage at the Globe that counts. Rice responded to this. I loved her stuff – but also love something she abandoned: the shared natural light of spectator and stage. There is room for both approaches. Judging by her first two productions, Michelle Terry is the person to prove this. In the best tradition of actor-managers. Much has been written about her aims and practices: among them, opening her rehearsals to the public. Most of this can be forgotten as you watch. Just be stirred by focused performance and dishevelled tradition. The stage is bare. The light is natural. The sense of an arena slowly filling up with words is mesmerising. Costumes are a mash of two Elizabethans. Genders are frequently switched – Jack Laskey is a graceful “more than common tall” Rosalind who scoops up Bettrys Jones’s appealing Orlando in her arms. And who – this is the real innovation – would have thought Shakespeare’s language might be intricately expressive while being silent? Nadia Nadarajah is a deaf actor who delivers her speeches as Celia in British sign language, hands fluttering like butterflies. Rosalind (entwined cousins understand each other) often provides a spoken translation. A special translation had to be devised for Shakespearean English; in rehearsals (Nadarajah also plays Guildenstern), the sign for “bacon” was used for “Hamlet”. For those of us who can’t sign, this begins as an intriguing shadow dance, and changes into something more particular. You hear new things – I had forgotten Celia’s being told by her father: “open not thy lips”. You wire into this language – as non-scholars from a 21st-century street tune into Shakespearean speech. There are lovely flights in both plays, both performed rapidly, with almost overlapping scenes. As Ophelia, Shubham Saraf in a conical white dress shows that the mad speech need not be about a girl shredding herbs in her nightie, but a scene about grief. Terry – with a smile that eats up her face and a voice that purrs, without ever being just velvety – is a Hamlet who grows. She starts slumped in black, moves into clown costume, and powers into conviction. The Globe’s power is shrewdly demonstrated by Pearce Quigley, an outstanding Jacques in As You Like It, the stronger production of the two. What, he is asked, does he mean by “ducdame” (good question). He explains: “’Tis a Greek invocation, to call fools into a circle.” Then looks away. At the spectators who encircle the stage. West London’s small Playground theatre is also looking straight out at the world around it – at a constituency. A few minutes’ walk from Grenfell Tower, it marks the anniversary of the fire by staging Shirleymander, Gregory Evans’s sharp play about the erstwhile leader of Westminster city council, Shirley Porter – she who, in the 1980s, manipulated the sale of council houses to ensure a Tory majority. And was made a dame by John Major. The contemporary parallels are not exact, but institutionalised disregard – what amounts to contempt for people in social housing – hangs in the air. There is a difficulty about monsterising Porter. Like Margaret Thatcher, she was as often sneered at for how she sounded as condemned for what she did. Her father was Jack Cohen, the market trader who founded Tesco: “grocer’s daughter” arouses sniggers in the way that “Aryan son of a toff” does not. Shirleymander touches on this – with a telling glimpse of little Shirl, bagging up raisins with dad in his first shop. Its main thrust, though, is the skewering of her policies. Rightly. She was the worst thing that happened to London before Boris Johnson. It was not just the gerrymandering, but the selling off of cemeteries, the shunting of people into flats not fully cleared of asbestos, the shredding of evidence when she was under investigation. And what did she give the city? Hanging baskets and superloos. Evans’s play was originally written for radio: in the very early preview to which I went, Anthony Biggs’s production had not entirely shaken off its static origins. Yet there was nimble multitasking by Jack Klaff. As the antiheroine, Jessica Martin is immaculate, eerily beady. And accurately got up: the frozen hair, gorgeous four-colour high heels, dangling earrings – even when in a pink negligee. Like a frilly cover on a loo brush.

She carried out pioneering work on the sexual abuse and harassment of young athletes and footballers by their coaches in the 1980s and 90s. Her research led her further to examine the sexual, physical and emotional abuse of all athletes, her findings being met with total denial by the then sports establishment. In 2001 she began working with the Football Association to assess the state of child protection at clubs, and to monitor a new FA strategy to protect junior players, but what was intended to be a £1m, five-year project was curtailed because of internal disputes in the Football Association and a disagreement between Adam Crozier (then FA chief executive) and the Premier League clubs, which objected to the project. Her work will live on because it is being incorporated into the current inquiry into abuse in football, led by Clive Sheldon QC. By nature a rebel, Celia would challenge authority, whether at local, national or Olympic level, to take action to protect young people in sport – often facing hostility from those who would not believe that such a problem existed. As she said in the 90s: “People thought I was a troublemaker and trampling on paradise. It was the same in the church – people could not bear to believe this could happen because these were places of sanctuary.” Her reputation grew in Britain and internationally as she worked in collaboration with the NSPCC, Unicef, the International Olympic Committee and the Paralympic movement. Her final job was as a child protection adviser to Dame Janet Smith’s inquiry into the sexual abuse perpetrated by Jimmy Savile at the BBC. She was born in Hitchin, Hertfordshire, the middle child of John Brackenridge, a dentist, and his wife, Joan (nee Stroud), who was then a Women’s Royal Air Force sergeant and jazz singer. She won an assisted place at Lady Eleanor Holles school for girls in Hampton, south-west London, where she excelled in sport and music. Against the wishes of her headteacher, she decided not to go to university and instead trained as a physical education teacher at Bedford College of Education. She shone at Bedford and was selected to be one of the few certificate of education students to go to Cambridge University, where, as well as a BEd with first-class honours (1972), she earned a double sporting blue, for lacrosse at national level and for women’s cricket at county level. She was selected to play lacrosse for England and then Great Britain. She became captain, winning the Vaux Silver award for leading the team to five victories over Australia in 1979. She was in the side for 14 years, making the Guinness Book of Records in the mid-80s for the most appearances as a GB lacrosse player. She then had a brief period as national team coach for the Lacrosse World Cup in the US, where she was not as successful, having already changed career direction for academia by becoming a full-time lecturer at a teacher training college, now part of Sheffield Hallam University. She was a founder and first chair of the Women’s Sports Foundation UK, a lobby group intended to raise public awareness of gender inequality in sport and influence public policy. She described it as “like a Greenpeace for women’s sport”. This transformed itself into the Women’s Sport and Fitness Foundation. In 1994, in Brighton, it held its first world conference attended by 82 countries and adopted what became known as the Brighton Declaration on Women and Sport, promoting the involvement of women at all levels in sport, including coaching and administration. This has now been taken up by more than 150 national organisations. At the same time Celia pioneered research into the sexual and physical abuse of young athletes by their coaches. Her initial research was greeted with hostility from UK sports governing bodies. Even after Paul Hickson, a former chief swimming coach at the Seoul Olympics, was jailed in 1995 for 17 years for raping two girls and indecently assaulting many others, Celia still received hate mail and suffered from sporting bodies refusing to allow her to develop her work. In 1994 she moved to Cheltenham and Gloucester College of Higher Education, becoming professor of sport and leisure. Her final academic post was as professor and director for youth sport and athlete welfare at Brunel University (2005-10), retiring as professor emerita. In 2012 she was appointed OBE for services to child protection and equality in sport, and she helped set up the charity Safe Sport International with Unicef, working with the Olympic and Paralympic movements to promote athlete protection and welfare. She received numerous awards and honorary fellowships including a lifetime achievement award. From 1988 Celia’s partner was Diana Woodward. They entered into a civil partnership in 2006. Diana described Celia as a person who “did not suffer fools gladly” but who “was perpetually surprised to find that some people found her intimidating. She could be rather pompous, but was easy to tease.” Celia and Diana’s self-built innovative timber eco-house on the outskirts of Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire, featured in the Grand Designs television programme in September 2012. Celia is survived by Diana, two stepsons, Alex and Nick, her sister, Dinah, and her brother, Glenn. • Celia Brackenridge, sportswoman, campaigner and academic, born 22 August 1950; died 23 May 2018"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/may/28/simon-hattenstone-lost-on-the-beach-i-was-scared-for-the-first-time-in-my-life","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-28T07:00:47Z","webTitle":"Simon Hattenstone: ‘Lost on the beach, I was scared for the first time in my life’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/28/simon-hattenstone-lost-on-the-beach-i-was-scared-for-the-first-time-in-my-life","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/28/simon-hattenstone-lost-on-the-beach-i-was-scared-for-the-first-time-in-my-life","fields":{"headline":"Simon Hattenstone: ‘Lost on the beach, I was scared for the first time in my life’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"I was seven years old and a ridiculously happy little boy. Every day was exciting; a new adventure. I was in my second year at school, and loved it. Of course I loved it – I loved everything. But even more than school I loved holidays. And most of all I loved summer holidays. Those six weeks that stretched into infinity in which you could do nothing and everything. Six weeks was a lifetime back then. That summer we went to Italy for two weeks. Rimini, beaches, gelati, paddle boats, sand castles. Even Dad, who was always ancient, seemed to get younger on holiday. All I wanted was the beach. There was a whole universe to explore on the beach. I loved to wander off, and return with shells and seaweed and invented stories of distant shores. In truth, I was only wandering a few yards. But not this time. I got carried away with my shell search, and just forgot about Mum and Dad and my sister Sharon. Eventually, I turned round to head back. I walked and walked. But nothing. No sign of them. I didn’t panic because I loved life, and this was just another adventure. I must have gone too far, so I turned back and walked the other way. Still nothing. So I turned again and walked. And again. The beach was packed with tourists like us. Everybody looked the same. I would walk up close to people, invade their space, stare into their squinting eyes, hoping it was Mum and Dad, but nothing. I began to lose sense of time. The sun was lower, and the blazing heat turned to a late-afternoon warmth. People were leaving the beach. This really was an adventure. Wait till I tell my friends about this – the day I got lost on an Italian beach, and loved it, just like everything else. And I turned back and started walking again. By now I had no sense of time or place. I never burned, but my forehead was beginning to feel funny. I was hungry, too. It must have been hours since I’d eaten. Since I’d seen my mum and dad. The light started to fade. It became chilly. The last few people departed the beach. I was really cold now – goose-pimple cold in my tiny trunks, starving and dehydrated. For the first time in my life I was scared. I wanted my mummy. Really wanted her. It was dark. There was nobody on the beach. I didn’t want to be here. I’d never had bad thoughts before. But what if nobody came back for me; what if I was just left here. I wanted to scream. But what was the point of screaming into a vacuum. The sea was coming in. Common sense told me to move away from it, and eventually I found myself on the pier. I. Want. My. Mummy. I sat in the cold and cried. This was a rubbish adventure. I sucked my thumb for solace, My thumb was my comforter, but even that didn’t make me feel better. I began to feel things I didn’t yet have words for – panic, loss, hopelessness, despair. I don’t know how much later it was that a man rode up on his bike. It felt long enough to fill a whole summer. In the dark I could just make out a square cap. It turned out to be a policeman’s cap. He smiled at me, and asked my name in broken English. He put me on the back of his bike and we rode in silence to a building. I think it was a police station. By now I was brave again – the joyous adventurer with a story to tell. I was enveloped in a huge hug from Mum. I didn’t notice her face. It took her decades to tell me what that day took out of her."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"society/2018/may/24/anglicans-support-same-sex-marriage","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-24T16:42:17Z","webTitle":"Anglicans support same-sex marriage | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/may/24/anglicans-support-same-sex-marriage","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/may/24/anglicans-support-same-sex-marriage","fields":{"headline":"Anglicans support same-sex marriage","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"It is unfair to say that same-sex marriage is “forbidden by the church [of England] despite being sanctioned by parliament” (Are you there, God?

Over and over again, company spokespeople have promised that they only start recording if someone says the wake word: “Alexa”. It’s a spiel Danielle, an Alexa user from Portland, Oregon, had believed. She’d installed Echo devices and smart bulbs in every room in her house, accepting Amazon’s claims that they were not invading her privacy. But today she asked the company to investigate after an Alexa device recorded a private conversation between her and her husband and sent it to a random number in their address book without their permission. Danielle found out her Alexa was recording when she received an alarming call from one of her husband’s colleagues saying: “Unplug your Alexa devices right now, you’re being hacked.” She told KIRO-TV in Seattle that at first she didn’t believe the co-worker, but then she said: “You sat there talking about hardwood floors.” Danielle realised the colleague must have heard everything. “I felt invaded,” she told KIRO-TV. “A total privacy invasion. Immediately, I said, ‘I’m never plugging that device in again because I can’t trust it.’” An Amazon customer service representative confirmed that Danielle’s audio had been sent to the number and apologised but didn’t provide any information about why the device had been activated. A spokesperson for the company said it had “determined this was an extremely rare occurrence”. At 6pm ET on Thursday, an Amazon spokesperson provided an updated statement with an explanation for why they believe Alexa forwarded the conversation. They said: “Echo woke up due to a word in background conversation sounding like ‘Alexa’. Then, the subsequent conversation was heard as a ‘send message’ request. At which point, Alexa said out loud ‘To whom?’ At which point, the background conversation was interpreted as a name in the customer’s contact list. Alexa then asked out loud, ‘[contact name], right?’ Alexa then interpreted background conversation as ‘right’.” Recognising the improbability of this series of mishaps occuring, they added: “As unlikely as this string of events is, we are evaluating options to make this case even less likely.” Although Amazon maintains this was a malfunction rather than proof Alexa is always listening, the company has filed patent applications in the past for functionalities that involve always listening, such as an algorithm that would analyse when people say they “love” or “bought” something. The patent included a diagram where two people have a phone conversation and were served afterwards with separate targeted advertisements."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/blog/2018/may/24/hasan-ali-mohammad-abbas-pakistan-england-first-test","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-24T18:38:05Z","webTitle":"Hasan Ali and Mohammad Abbas show Pakistan attack is no pushover","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/may/24/hasan-ali-mohammad-abbas-pakistan-england-first-test","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2018/may/24/hasan-ali-mohammad-abbas-pakistan-england-first-test","fields":{"headline":"Hasan Ali and Mohammad Abbas show Pakistan attack is no pushover","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Back in 2010, that annus horribilis for Pakistan cricket, Hasan Ali’s parents set alight his whites after becoming frustrated with a sporting obsession that appeared to have taken priority over his studies and their dream of him one day becoming a lawyer. The previous year Hasan and his elder brother had made their own pitch by hand, digging a two-foot deep trench before filling it with concrete and asking a local bricklayer to help smooth it over. Needless to say, this was a young man already set on making it as a professional, just not the kind his mother and father had envisaged. At Lord’s on Thursday, when morning rain made way for watery sunshine and the surface offered a touch more vegetation than his home-made strip back in Gujranwala, Hasan was one part of an impressive Pakistan attack that, like his folks and those whites, left England’s hopes of a new dawn, after their winter of antipodean angst, somewhat burned. The meek 184 all out from Joe Root’s side will doubtless lead to criticism of a lineup that, despite some tinkering, still seems hugely dependent on individuals coming off rather than collective solidity. But credit must go to the tourists too, for whom Hasan and the eye-catching Mohammad Abbas took four wickets apiece. From a 2-2 series draw two years ago that left supporters wishing for a decider, Pakistan have somehow wound up as the hors d’oeuvres this summer, ushered in before the visit of Australia for some one-dayers and then the Test headliners, India. But despite their batting lineup being shorn of Misbah-ul-Haq and Younis Khan, and their ranking having tumbled from No 1 to No 7 in the intervening time, this bowling unit was never going to be a pushover. Though much of the pre-series focus was on Mohammad Amir, and a plan to replicate the lengths that led New Zealand’s Trent Boult to slice through England in Auckland, it was Abbas who set the standard. This 28-year-old right-armer has already made a strong start to his Test career and in this, his seventh match, he looked tailor-made for English conditions with a smooth action, exemplary wrist control and a desire to stay full. Just ask Mark Stoneman, who was adjusting to a series of balls that had beaten the outside edge before being castled by one that nipped back in, or Ben Stokes, trapped lbw on review by a ball that with the naked eye looked to have pitched outside leg. Like South Africa’s Vernon Philander, Abbas gets tight on the stumps and stands the seam up beautifully to ask questions of top-order techniques, or those lower down such as Stuart Broad and the debutant Dom Bess. The more slippery Hasan is better known in these parts, having transferred that concrete schooling to white-ball cricket and wound up player of the tournament in last year’s Champions Trophy, where his bomb-detonating wicket celebration exploded 13 times in all. Here it followed Root channelling his inner James Vince, Dawid Malan’s indifferent footwork, Jos Buttler channelling his inner Root and a late bonus from Mark Wood; Hasan’s ability to keep the older ball still swinging is a fine attribute from first-change. The support acts in the wickets column should not pass without mention, with Faheem Ashraf and Amir both vying for the ball of the day. Faheem, the all-rounder in a five-man attack, ended Jonny Bairstow’s return to No 5 with one that looked to be angling down the hill only to hold its line and ping the top of off; Amir’s to Alastair Cook, which caught him on the crease, was more timber-rattling porn. While Shadab Khan, the 19-year-old leg-spinner, was always unlikely to be in the game on day one, he did get six overs to bowl and he too is a cricketer of some promise. Provided an inexperienced batting lineup can stand up in this series – Pakistan’s start of 50 for one, under lights, was steady enough – then the bowlers should ensure the visitors are not simply early summer fodder."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/may/24/wolfsburg-lyon-womens-champions-league-final-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-24T19:10:28Z","webTitle":"Lyon sweep to Women’s Champions League win over 10-player Wolfsburg","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/24/wolfsburg-lyon-womens-champions-league-final-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/24/wolfsburg-lyon-womens-champions-league-final-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Lyon sweep to Women’s Champions League win over 10-player Wolfsburg","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Lyon’s right-back Lucy Bronze described becoming the first England player to win the Champions League in its current format as “the best thing I’ve done to date.” Goals from Amandine Henry, Eugénie Le Sommer, Ada Hegerberg and Camille Abily handed Lyon their third consecutive Champions League title after they had fallen behind in an action-packed extra time. After a dull 90 minutes with the score at 0-0, the game sprung to life in style when a deflected strike from the Wolfsburg forward Pernille Harder, massively against the run of play, was followed by Henry’s top corner strike from a wonderful Hegerberg chip. In between Harder’s goal and the leveller, Wolfsburg had gone down to 10 as Alexandra Popp picked up a second yellow for a rash challenge on Delphine Cascarino. The fresh legs of Shanice van de Sanden then sealed the tie for the French side as she three times raced clear on the right, first providing the assist for Le Sommer, then for an unmarked Hegerberg – her record-breaking 15th Champions League goal in a single campaign – and finally for Abily, on her final appearance for Lyon at 33. Lyon had dominated in normal time and had felt aggrieved when a Le Sommer header seemed to cross the line, only to be waved away. “Watching their goal go in was heartbreaking, and having just had a goal disallowed that definitely crossed the line was a very up and down situation,” said Bronze. “We push for more and more in these big games. Lyon and Wolfsburg are trendsetting and pushing women’s football. We do as much as we can as players on the pitch, but we need the referee and goalline technology to be up to standard as well,” she added. Bronze was full of praise for the Lyon substitutes, particularly the former Liverpool player Van de Sanden. “Shanice was a game changer in the end, she got three out of four assists, came on and made the difference with the pace she’s got getting in behind. Both teams were tiring and she’s so energetic, works so hard and won us the game” This was the third meeting of the two sides in a Champions League final. Both previous encounters were tight affairs; in 2013 only Martina Müller’s penalty for Wolfsburg at Stamford Bridge could separate the European giants, and in 2016 Lyon won on penalties. The first chance of this match fell to Lyon after five minutes, after Griedge M’Bock Bathy was brought down in the middle of the park. A swung-in free-kick fell to Henry but her shot bounced clear off a Wolfsburg body. Minutes later, up the other end, Popp’s ball across the front of Sarah Bouhaddi’s goal was teasingly out of reach of the incoming Ewa Pajor. The tree-lined Valeriy Lobanovskyi Stadium was close to empty shortly before the whistle, perhaps thanks to heavy security. However, 35 minutes into the match the little 17,000-seater was heaving, mainly with locals. Lyon edged the first 45 with the tricky winger Amel Majri and the left-back Selma Bacha causing plenty of trouble for Anna Blässe on the left. However, the half had failed to light up, half chances and misplaced passes the order of the day. After 15 minutes Lyon began to up the pressure a little, and a Dzsenifer Marozsán corner was cleared as far as Bronze, whose volley went wide. With the Wolfsburg defence resolute and well organised, Lyon were forced to try their luck from distance, a swerving shot from the left-hand corner of the box by a frustrated Marozsán comfortably collected by Almuth Schult. As the half drew to a close, Harder, the heartbeat of the Wolfsburg attack, was increasingly forced to go deeper to get the ball. With Wolfsburg struggling to make anything happen, their manager, Stephan Lerch, swapped the winger Caroline Graham Hansen for Tessa Wullaert at the break to try to shake things up. An uneventful opening to the second half was brought to an abrupt halt when Sara Bjork Gunnarsdóttir crumpled to the ground, on her own, clearly in pain – the exertions of the German cup final win after extra time and penalties at the weekend starting to show in the legs of the players. Lyon spent much of the second period camped in the opposition half and they were denied a breakthrough in the 69th minute when a corner from the left found Henry, who flicked the ball goalwards. Replays seemed to show the ball crossed the line, but Noelle Maritz cleared and the referee waved away appeals. Lyon kept pushing for what would surely be a winner. Cascarino, on for the bright Bacha, sent in a low cross but Le Sommer’s shot was nicely saved by Schult. Wolfsburg came out fighting in extra time, as Harder raced forward and her deflected strike from outside the box gave the German side a surprising lead. It was then that the game exploded. Popp received her second yellow before Hegerberg’s lovely chip found the onrushing Henry, who put the ball into the top of the net. Moments later the holders took the lead as Van de Sanden raced down the right and her cross was met by Le Sommer to poke past the keeper. With Wolfsburg forced to push forward they were left even more exposed, and again, Van de Sanden found an unmarked Hegerberg to put the game out of an exhausted Wolfsburg’s reach in the first half of added time. Then Abily put a lovely curling strike beyond Schult with two minutes to play, giving her an emotional send-off as she rounded off Lyon’s record fifth European title, one she said was “amazing, I couldn’t hope for a better end. I came in and scored and we won, it was a perfect night for me.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/may/24/england-pakistan-first-test-lords-day-one","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-24T18:01:44Z","webTitle":"England horror show leaves patient Pakistan brimming with hope","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/24/england-pakistan-first-test-lords-day-one","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/may/24/england-pakistan-first-test-lords-day-one","fields":{"headline":"England horror show leaves patient Pakistan brimming with hope","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A post-tea collapse, triggered by Mohammad Abbas and Hasan Ali, two pacemen of Pakistan who look tailor-made for English conditions, punctured any early-summer optimism in the home camp in the space of seven overs. The stands were full as the final session began since this was no time for gossiping with old friends out the back. The Royals were dominating everyone’s attention again – the Rajasthan Royals, that is. The score was a less than satisfactory 165 for five but in the 20 minutes before tea Ben Stokes and Jos Buttler, fresh from the Indian Premier League, had hinted at a glorious Tamasha after tea. Buttler had cruised to 13 in no time while Stokes, in exemplary Test fashion, had reached 36. It was compulsory to be back in the bucket seats in time for the resumption. Instead of a dazzling Bollywood counterattack, there was a horror show of X-certificate proportions. Five wickets fell for 19 runs and England were bowled out for a paltry 184, not what Joe Root had anticipated when winning the toss. This ugly procession began with a shrewd review by Pakistan against Stokes. When the delivery from Abbas struck Stokes’s pad the naked eye suggested that the ball must have pitched outside his leg stump; the replay demonstrated otherwise, providing a reminder that Abbas gets commendably close to the stumps upon delivery. Two balls later Buttler flashed hard against Hasan and Asad Shafiq held a stinging catch at second slip. The Royals had been dethroned. There was no wagging of the tail. Dom Bess, after clipping his first Test boundary, was caught at second slip; Stuart Broad was so lbw that he did not bother to review even though there were still two available and Mark Wood had an unsuccessful swish. The spectators had been glued to their seats for the wrong reasons. Not that the upper order had offered much reassurance. Without a resolute 70 from Alastair Cook, only the third time he has passed 50 in his last 25 Test innings (on the other two occasions he scored 243 and 244 not out), England might have been fielding before tea. After an early stream of boundaries Cook recognised the problem. The ball was swinging on to a surface that had retained a tinge of green despite the dryness of the soil underneath, which meant that the captain winning the toss did not have an easy decision to make. So Cook set out to blunt a probing Pakistan attack. His feet moved more positively than in New Zealand, with the right one further down the track to the fuller deliveries, which were frequent since the bowlers recognised the virtue of pitching full with the Duke ball swinging obediently. The others were nowhere near as reassuring as Cook. Mark Stoneman was dismissed by a good ball from Abbas but he should not have been bowled by it – lbw might have been a better dismissal. He pushed away from his body and the ball crept through the gate that had been created. He did not look in great form; accomplished Test players can cope with that but Stoneman has yet to graduate to that level. Root was the most obviously culpable of the batsmen. Having been tied down for 23 balls he swished at a very wide swinging delivery from Hasan and Sarfraz Ahmed gleefully accepted the catch in front of first slip. Dawid Malan, on the back foot, edged his third delivery. The suspicion remains that his technique is better suited to the truer, bouncier surfaces of Australia. Jonny Bairstow suggested permanence alongside Cook but was bowled for 27 by the first ball of a new spell from Faheem Ashraf. There followed a brisk 49-run partnership between Cook and Stokes, who hit the solitary six of the day off the leg-spinner Shadab Khan – it was not a day for a tweaker of any sort. Then Cook, stuck on the crease, was bowled by a trimmer from Amir that beat his outside edge. Arguably the best ball of the day had dismissed the day’s best batsman. A little flurry from Stokes and Buttler and the innings was over. All the while Pakistan had been disciplined and patient in the field. Their quartet of pacemen bowled full enough to allow the ball to swing – and they received excellent support, a flying catch at mid-on by Amir to polish off the innings reflecting that. Batting was not much easier when Pakistan came out in gloomy conditions, with Broad, striding in from the Nursery End, offering the greatest threat. He removed Imam-ul-Haq, lbw after a review. Later Haris Sohail, on 16, was dropped off the bowling of Wood, who had been preferred to Chris Woakes in the morning; Stokes, poaching a catch that should have been destined for Malan at second slip, was the unlikely culprit. That aside Azhar Ali and Sohail batted with discretion, fine judgment and hope in the last hour to take Pakistan to 50 for one at stumps. You always bat with hope having bowled the opposition out for 184. On Friday the tourists can add expectation."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/may/25/real-madrid-liverpool-teams-champions-league-final-kiev","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-25T12:00:46Z","webTitle":"A dentist agent, Messi the dog: meet the Real Madrid and Liverpool teams","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/25/real-madrid-liverpool-teams-champions-league-final-kiev","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/25/real-madrid-liverpool-teams-champions-league-final-kiev","fields":{"headline":"A dentist agent, Messi the dog: meet the Real Madrid and Liverpool teams","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Real Madrid Keylor Navas A film of Navas’s life came out recently. Man of faith, it’s called. He has needed it too – always seems to be on the verge of replacement, but still there. Was to be the makeweight in deal to sign David De Gea from Manchester United in August 2015 but the deal collapsed because the documents were not submitted to Fifa before the Spanish transfer deadline. Dani Carvajal Born in Leganés, a Madrid suburb, and was the small, floppy-haired blond kid who laid the first stone at Real Madrid’s training ground with Alfredo Di Stefano. He returned much later a bearded and ultra-competitive right-back. Sergio Ramos “More tattoos per square centimetre than anywhere else,” he said when he posed with David Beckham last week. Each tells a story and he’s accumulated loads of them: the devoted Catholic has a tattoo of Mary covering the top half of his left arm. Also likes bullfighting and horses. Owns a stud farm in Andalusia. Raphaël Varane Zinedine Zidane saw him at 18 and brought him to Spain when no one else had even heard of him. Asked Zidane to call him back in June 2011 when the Madrid manager expressed an interest, because he was in the middle of revising for his exams. Scored a header on his debut – against Barcelona. Marcelo Lived with Roberto Carlos when he first arrived in Madrid with the impossible task of replacing the man with the thunderous thighs – and, in the end, did so. The best left-back in the world, Roberto Carlos says. Diego Maradona says he’s the third best player in La Liga, after Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi. Luka Modric Modric is the name Granada midfielder Javi Márquez gave his son. Not Luka, Modric. “My wife liked the name; it’s just a coincidence,” he protested, before adding: “Although Modric is a good person and a good player.” Brings what José Mourinho considers “that artistic sense” to the game. Casemiro Don’t let that cherubic, slightly chubby, gentle smile fool you. And he might be a defensive midfielder but don’t let him shoot either. “Has changed the face of Madrid,” according to Atéltico’s coach, Diego Simeone. Marcelo is even more effusive: “He saved my life. I might play until I’m 45 with this guy by my side.” Toni Kroos Says he only ever got nervous on his wedding day, and a big fan of Robbie Williams; really, really big. His father, Roland, works as youth coach for Hansa Rostock. Scored twice for Germany in that 7-1 humbling of Brazil at the last World Cup. Isco Francisco Román Alarcón Suárez or Isco has a dog called Messi “because Messi’s the best and so is my dog”. He said that before he was at Madrid, of course. Team-mates call him “Magic” – and let’s face it, you have to pretty good for them to call you that. Scored a hat-trick for Spain in the 6-1 drubbing of Argentina in March. Cristiano Ronaldo Once said that he was going to carry on playing until he was 40. It seemed silly then; it doesn’t now. Has the world’s biggest Facebook fanbase with 103 million followers and an airport named after him and his own football museum. Gareth Bale Admits he isn’t that good at watching football – he’d rather put on the golf – but is a bit good at playing it. Better than some in Spain seem prepared to admit. Attended the same Cardiff high school as future Wales rugby union captain Sam Warburton. Karim Benzema Appears in a video for Walabok by the French rap artist Booba. The video clip features images of drugs, bags full of cash and men in hoodies pointing guns towards the camera. Says he doesn’t like the Marseillaise because it’s a “call to war”. Marco Asensio Asensio’s mother was Dutch and he was named after Marco van Basten. As a kid could barely walk for a year with growth problems in his knees. In February scored Real Madrid’s 6,000th goal in the Spanish top division. Lucas Vázquez Walked up to the penalty spot at the end of the 2016 final spinning the ball on his finger, which he admits made him look cooler than he really was. Kiko Casilla Brother Pepe is a Spanish international volleyball player. Played only 15 minutes for Spain, letting in one – scored by Kroos. Last played for Real in the 3-1 home defeat by Juventus in April. Nacho Nacho used to be told by Álvaro Arbeloa he would have been in the Spain squad if he played for anyone else but in the end he got there playing for Madrid. Able to play anywhere at the back, very fast (although he doesn’t look it), and made it despite having diabetes. His son José Ignacio was born on the morning of Madrid’s 2016 Champions League win. Theo Hernández Brother of Lucas, son of Jean Francois, footballers both, and brought up at Atlético Madrid before moving across the city this summer. Like Zidane, a native of Marseille. Yet to make his senior debut for France. Mateo Kovacic The first time Rafa Benítez suggested that Madrid could sign Kovacic, whom he said would one day be a €90m player, the club’s president said why not sign him when he is a €90m player. He’s not yet, but he is good. Nicknamed Il Professore (the Professor). Liverpool Loris Karius Bayern Munich fan from Biberach an der Riss grew up idolising Oliver Kahn and was inspired by his three-save shootout performance against Valencia in 2001 but has never been involved in a penalty showdown at senior level. “When you are standing on the line, there is a voice inside you that will tell you which corner he might put it,” Karius says. Trent Alexander-Arnold Grew up within walking distance of Melwood and lives at home with his mum. Ambassador for An Hour For Others, a community organisation that helps vulnerable people. Will be the first teenager to play in a European Cup final for Liverpool if selected. Dejan Lovren Has a bromance going with Mo Salah and says that Virgil van Dijk – with whom he has helped Liverpool to 17 clean sheets – has improved his game. His family are Bosnian Croats who escaped to Germany during the Bosnian war and he is heavily involved with the Help Refugees charity. Vocal in dressing room but introspective. Excellent at basketball. Virgil van Dijk World’s most expensive defender was born in Breda to a Dutch father and Surinamese mother. Worked as a kitchen hand at the Oncle Jean restaurant in Breda when he was 16 – and still sends them his signed football jerseys. Wants to be Liverpool’s regular free-kick taker. Andy Robertson Released at 15 by Celtic – the team he supported as a boy – for being too small and worked in the ticket office at Hampden Park before turning professional with Dundee United. Relegated with Hull last season, now a firm favourite with Jürgen Klopp and the Kop. Donated a signed shirt of Roberto Firmino to a young Liverpool fan who had given his pocket money to a local food bank. Georginio Wijnaldum Wanted to be a gymnast and was not much interested in football before signing for Sparta Rotterdam and then Feyenoord. A popular figure in the dressing room, he is the half brother of Huddersfield’s Rajiv van La Parra and brother of Giliano Wijnaldum, who plays for Willem II. Jordan Henderson The main, if unheralded, influence on a united dressing room made his professional debut with Sunderland in 2008 and spent time on loan at Coventry. Turned down a move to Fulham at the start of Brendan Rodgers’ reign as Liverpool manager. Rodgers wanted to use him as part-exchange in a deal for Clint Dempsey. James Milner Relishes his Boring James Milner tag and known as Milly the Machine by Jürgen Klopp for the ground he covers. Enjoys his status as a social media sensation, and his reaction to the ball going in off his face against Roma – “Anyone got any tips for getting a Champions League logo off a face?” – caused a Twitter frenzy.

Simon Mignolet Speaks four languages and has a degree in political science. Told Klopp after the New Year’s Day win at Burnley that his rotation of Liverpool’s goalkeepers “wasn’t healthy”. Klopp agreed and has played Karius ever since. Popular with fans for his jokey tweets, particularly the post that showed his oversized head superimposed on a hipshaking body while cheering on Salah at the PFA awards. Adam Lallana Jürgen Klopp’s next door neighbour has a Spanish grandfather and grew up supporting Everton. His father ran a carehome in Bournemouth and his looks earned him a deal as the face a high-street fashion retailer’s men’s collection before the 2014 World Cup promoting “ a collection of heritage pieces recontextualised for the modern world”. Alberto Moreno Credited Mona Nemmer, Liverpool’s nutritionist, with his improved form at the start of the season after she made allowances in his diet for jamón ibérico and sea food.

No, not the royal wedding, but the Chelsea flower show. What was once a staid and civilised occasion is now a circus of overcrowding and corporate entertaining, its show gardens showing increasingly ugly things to do with concrete and mirrors, for which I blame Diarmuid Gavin. And in all the verbiage, one quote leapt out: “The lupin is having a moment.” What, the lupin is suddenly popular? Nonsense – this magnificent and statuesque plant has long been an essential element of a well-dressed garden. Mind you, the lupin is in good company: foreign language books are having a moment in Australia; oud, an ancient fragrance, is having one, too; as are Thomas the Tank Engine and Atlanta actor Brian Tyree Henry. Quite where this phrase came from is beyond me, but it adds precisely nothing to the language and the kindest thing to do is consign it to the compost bin soonest. And if anyone suggests that that horticultural excrescence, the red hot poker, is having a moment, I’ll know that the gardening world has gone truly bonkers. Meanwhile, back in the real world, the question of how best to deal with the demands of an ageing population continues to vex. George McNamara, of the older people’s charity Independent Age, spoke on the subject: “Older people are often penalised when it comes to policy making by not having a champion within government.

Parliament’s public spending watchdog said a programme to modernise the Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) has been marred by poor planning, delays and spiralling costs. The programme is more than four years late and costs are expected to be £229m more than initially planned, a report by the public accounts committee (PAC) said. In an unusually damning assessment, MPs also said a new facility introduced to make it easier and faster to check for changes to safeguarding information has seen a fraction of the demand expected when it was set up. Meg Hillier, the chair of the committee, said the Home Office, which is still reeling from allegations over the Windrush scandal, was struggling to implement two of its major modernisation projects. She said: “Government has a crucial role to play in safeguarding children and vulnerable adults but the handling of this project has been a masterclass in incompetence. “These are testing times for the Home Office. We continue to have serious concerns about its largest project, the emergency service network, which is critical to the ability of our emergency services to do their jobs and keep citizens safe. “The department also faces huge challenges arising from the UK’s departure from the EU, not least potential threats to security at the border from day one of Brexit. On both DBS and ESN the Home Office appears either to have ignored or not fully understood the needs of the end user.” The DBS was established in 2012 as the result of a merger between two quangos, one of which was the much-criticised Criminal Records Bureau. It was intended to simplify and lower the cost of background checks for employees, often in the public sector, working with children and vulnerable adults. In October 2012, the Home Office contracted Tata Consultancy Services to design, build and run a new IT system for DBS. The updated service was intended to allow employers to check whether there were any changes to the safeguarding information on a certificate since it was issued. But the updated service has not delivered expected savings and is behind schedule. The National Audit Office said in February that Tata continued to make a £5m-a-year profit despite spending more than expected on the modernisation programme. The Home Office said: “We recognise that there have been delays in some aspects of the delivery and implementation of the DBS modernisation programme. “However the DBS has launched the first phase of its new IT system and will continue to work towards providing their customers with a faster and more efficient service. “We will fully consider the PAC’s recommendations and respond formally in due course.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"games/2018/may/29/fortnite-rules-of-survival-tips-games","type":"article","sectionId":"games","sectionName":"Games","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-29T14:36:10Z","webTitle":"How to survive in Fortnite if you're old and slow","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/may/29/fortnite-rules-of-survival-tips-games","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/games/2018/may/29/fortnite-rules-of-survival-tips-games","fields":{"headline":"How to survive in Fortnite if you're old and slow","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Your kids are playing it, your friends are complaining about their kids playing it, and the tabloid press are telling you no one should be playing it because it’s evil. But the fact is, Fortnite is here, it’s lots of fun, and if you can’t beat its 40 million players you may as well join them. Fortnite is a “battle royale” game in which 100 players land on an island, run around collecting weapons, resources and items from abandoned houses, build forts for protection, and then attempt to blast each other right back into the starting menu. The last player standing wins. When you first start out, it can be a little bewildering – but not nearly as bewildering as not playing and then trying to understand what your daughter means when she tells you she just took out two John Wicks with nothing but an uncommon silenced pistol. If you’re thinking of dipping your toe in, here are 13 tips to get you started. 1. Stay on the battle bus until the end If you want to live long enough to collect a couple of guns and some resources, stay on the bus until the last few seconds and then land somewhere near the coast. Very few players will be around, because most of them eject immediately over Tilted Towers. This way, you at least get to arm yourself and have a little look around before being pulverised by a stranger dressed like Harley Quinn from Suicide Squad. 2. Land on a roof when you eject from the battle bus You’ll want to land near a house, where you’re most likely to find weapons and chests. But it’s even better to land on the roof. This gives you a height advantage on anyone else nearby, and also means you can quickly chop your way through each floor, grabbing all the goodies from the top of the house to the bottom. 3. Prioritise weapons over resources in the opening seconds As soon as you’ve landed, you need to find something useful to fight with just in case someone else has dropped nearby – you don’t want to be running at them with your pickaxe. At this stage anything will do, though a tactical shotgun or submachine gun will be best because it’s likely to be a close encounter. Don’t engage anyone unless you really have to. You’re not Rambo. 4. Learn about weapon grading There are five grades of weapon in Fortnite: gray (common), green (uncommon), blue (rare), purple (epic) and orange (legendary). With each grade, the weapon’s damage capabilities improve, so always prioritise rarer weapons. 5. Learn to make a basic fort As quickly as possible while you’re exploring the world, start smashing stuff up to get you the three basic resources: wood, bricks and metal. Wood is the weakest but also the quickest to build with, so, if someone is firing at you, this is what to go for first. The basic defence is to surround yourself with four walls, then build a ramp in the middle and jump on to it as its forming. This gives you height and cover. Building other identical levels on top of this will accentuate your height advantage, but only building upwards makes you vulnerable to someone blowing up your lower levels with a rocket launcher, destroying your whole tower. If you can, it helps to build around a scenic structure like a house, as that gives you a head start on gaining height and a decent foundation. As you get nearer to the endgame, start making stronger buildings out of brick and metal, but always use ramps so that you have cover. 6. An assault rifle and a shotgun are your must-have weapons These will see you through most encounters. Prioritise automatic assault rifles over burst fire models as the latter are trickier to use in a sudden firefight. There are scoped ARs, giving you the long-range aiming of a sniper rifle with the rapid fire of an AR (handy for when you’re exploring), and then there are special combat assault rifles, which do lots of damage and reload fast. They’re the motherlode of the assault rifle world. There are three types of shotgun. The pump model delivers more damage but takes longer to reload, while the tactical shotgun is quicker but weaker. The heavy shotgun – available in epic and legendary flavours – is powerful, quick to reload and has a longer effective range – it is very much the Incredible Hulk of short-range combat. Many players line up a pump next to a tactical in their armoury, getting away an opening shot with the former, before quickly switching to the latter. If you’re unsure, stick with any AR and a tactical shotgun. 7. If you want to practise shooting, go to Tilted Towers If you’re new to the game, it’s worth getting some practice in with combat, and that means dropping down in a city and becoming bullet fodder for all the young scamps who have been doing this for three hours a day since September. Just land, find a weapon and try to shoot it at someone. Fortnite has an authentic – if rather exaggerated – physics system, so the further away your target is, the more you need to lead your shot, firing just over their heads, and slightly in front if they’re running past. 8. Pack your perfect inventory Every player has their own priorities when it comes to filling their backpack. Many go for three weapons (short, medium and long range), bandages or a health kit, and some sort of projectile, such as a grenade or clinger. If you’re new to the game, it’s probably not worth wasting an inventory slot on remote mines, impulse grenades or boogie bombs. If you pick up anything that boosts your shields, use it immediately – it’ll free up an inventory slot and there’s no benefit to saving them. If you’re not planning to get in many firefights, prioritise health kits and large shield potions over bandages and small bottles. As a newcomer, when you do get into a fight, it’s likely you’ll need massive medical intervention rather than a plaster and a kiss on your sore bit. 9. Use sound to your advantage If you can, wear decent headphones, preferably with 7.1 surround sound. This way you get excellent audio feedback on where another player is in relation to you. (Footsteps are really noisy in this game.) Also remember that everything you do, from changing weapons to slurping some shield potion, is audible to nearby players. Oh, and crouching makes your movement harder to detect. Start weighing up every action in terms of how it gives away your position - especially in cities. 10. Stay away from open ground You are basically cannon fodder when walking through open fields, so try to vary your movement, using jumping and weaving, rather than legging it in a straight line, which is basically the equivalent of shouting: “Shoot me now.” Use scenic elements such as hills, trees and walls as cover. Chopping down trees sends leaves flying into the air, alerting everyone within 500 metres to where you are. 11. Stay away from close encounters Let’s face it, the chances are, you’re going to lose in close, open combat. So be sneaky. If you spot another player, try to engage them from a distance using a scoped rifle – and wait until they’re standing still. Alternatively, watch them for a while, hold off until they’re engaged in exploring or building, then get into the crouch position and tiptoe up to them. Use a shotgun and aim for the head. It’s also a good idea to swoop in after you’ve observed two players fighting each other as they’ll both be low on health and shields. If all else fails, don’t feel bad about running away. 12. Tweak the controls Some people find the controls over-sensitive, which can make it tough to construct forts at speed. If that’s the case with you, go into the menu and change the settings. You can also tweak the button configurations depending on whether you want to prioritise combat or building. Once you’ve learned what your strengths and weaknesses are, there’s no shame in using the controller options to augment them. 13. Watch the experts If you really want to immerse yourself in Fortnite’s surrounding culture (or properly get good at it), head to YouTube or Twitch and watch experienced players. The likes of Ninja, Myth and Dakotaz are considered the best in the world, but Britain’s Ali A is a really good starting point – he explains his strategies clearly and makes professional, watchable videos."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/24/yulia-skripal-russia-salisbury-poisoning","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-24T17:17:01Z","webTitle":"Yulia Skripal delivered a coded message and it spoke volumes | Angus Roxburgh","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/24/yulia-skripal-russia-salisbury-poisoning","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/may/24/yulia-skripal-russia-salisbury-poisoning","fields":{"headline":"Yulia Skripal delivered a coded message and it spoke volumes","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The Russian authorities’ response to Yulia Skripal’s televised statement, recorded in great secrecy under the watchful eye of her British government minders, was predictable. The Kremlin said it might have been made under pressure, and there was no reason to trust it. Moreover, according to the Russian embassy, the phrasing suggested that the text had been written by a native English speaker and translated into Russian. I had a very different impression. I am old enough to have watched stage-managed “confessions” on Soviet television, and this was quite different. Yulia appeared relaxed. She deviated at times from the written version of her Russian text, and while her somewhat wooden intonation clearly indicated she was making a statement rather than improvising, her expression at no point suggested she was saying things she did not believe. The best way to dispel all doubts, of course, would be to stage a press conference or use an interviewer. But her reluctance to do that is understandable, in the light of what was perhaps the most interesting sentence in her statement: “In the longer term, I hope to return home to my country.” Any interviewer would press her to speculate about who poisoned her, and why – and yet her ability to return to Russia in safety will depend on her keeping her mouth firmly shut about any suspicions she may have. Her continued polite refusal to meet anyone from the Russian embassy, plus her effusive thanks for the care she has been given in the UK, gives a fair impression of whom she trusts more at this moment. The attempted assassination of Yulia and her father remains a mystery, but there is little reason to suspect any perpetrator other than Russia, with its history of extrajudicial killings and of lying to cover things up. Just as Yulia’s statement was broadcast, international investigators published hard evidence that the BUK missile that shot down Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 over Ukraine in 2014 came from a specific, named missile brigade inside Russia. Meanwhile the Russians have come up with umpteen implausible alternative explanations, flying a dozen ragged kites to distract everyone from the obvious truth. The Russians’ claims regarding the Skripals are no more convincing. That said, however, the UK authorities have not exactly excelled in providing timely or consistent evidence. Official information has been provided in bursts, and has often smacked of stage-management and over-zealous PR, intended as belated justification for the initial rush to expel diplomats. The theatrical spectacle of specialists in elaborate, yellow, chemical protection suits still busy “securing” sites around Salisbury, while citizens in ordinary clothes stroll around them, is bizarre. No one has satisfactorily explained how novichok, claimed to be one of the most lethal weapons-grade nerve agents, has affected only three people, and not even its intended victims were killed by it. The drip-feed of official information has rarely provided real insight, but has almost always coincided with ministers demanding more cash for defence and security. There can be no one in Britain, surely, who feels they have been told the whole truth about the Skripal case by the British government. Even my own near-certainty that the Russians were behind the attack rests more on intuition and precedent than on incontestable facts. Beyond the human story of the Skripals, their recovery and future plans, lies the bigger question of what to do about Russia. There is little doubt that we are dealing with a Kremlin, under Vladimir Putin, that feels it can act with impunity around the world. The fact that Putin does so in part because he believes the Americans have also done so for decades does not excuse such behaviour. Whether the Skripal poisonings were personally ordered by Putin, or simply carried out by those who feel empowered by the hyperactive patriotism nurtured in today’s Russia, will in all likelihood never be known. Which means the west has a choice: continue to respond to every Russian outrage by ratcheting up the hysteria and the pressure (none of which, though it might hurt Russia, will change Putin’s policies); or accept the fact that for the next six years we have no choice but to work with him, and that there are many areas of mutual interest on which we could collaborate. All conflicts end either in victory or in some sort of agreement. The west is not going to “beat” Putin, but we can at least try to make the next six years a little less dangerous. • Angus Roxburgh is the author of Moscow Calling: Memoirs of a Foreign Correspondent, and was an adviser to the Russian government between 2006 and 2009"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/24/ireland-abortion-debate-pro-choice-uk-laws-referendum","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-24T16:59:17Z","webTitle":"Ireland’s abortion debate has already succeeded in shifting my position | Gaby Hinsliff","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/24/ireland-abortion-debate-pro-choice-uk-laws-referendum","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/may/24/ireland-abortion-debate-pro-choice-uk-laws-referendum","fields":{"headline":"Ireland’s abortion debate has already succeeded in shifting my position","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"They came from Los Angeles, from Bangkok, from Sydney, from Buenos Aires; from all four corners of the globe. One woman said her plane ticket was a birthday present from her boyfriend, who knew how much it meant to her. Others are funded by student unions, family whip-rounds, expats who have been away too long to take part. Young Irish women and men are coming home to vote in Ireland’s abortion referendum, many wearing their hearts on the sleeves of their repeal jumpers. They swap knowing glances in airports, proudly tweeting and Instagramming as they go. The #HomeToVote phenomenon is an extraordinarily moving, powerful sight. For what cause would you fly halfway round the world and back again? Only one that cuts to the heart of who you are, how you seek to live. Repealing the eighth amendment would be seismic enough, since it’s what guarantees the unborn a right to life even when the mother has been raped, is practically a child herself, or is carrying a wanted baby with such severe abnormalities it cannot survive. But this referendum has become a public test of so much more; of a woman’s place in society more generally, of a scandal-ridden Catholic church’s moral authority, even of shifting dynamics between the sexes in the #TimesUp era. Some yes campaigners detect small but worrying numbers of men threatening to vote no seemingly from a desire to put empowered women back in their boxes; but also men reluctant to engage, reasoning that this is a “woman’s thing”, even though babies don’t conceive themselves. Since the argument is all about women’s autonomy over their own bodies, perhaps it’s understandable that some men would steer clear. But this battle can’t be won without male votes and the change would benefit men too – at least if they don’t want to see wives and daughters suffer, or indeed to become fathers before they’re ready. We who watch from abroad – fingers crossed for yes – know we have no right to interfere in Ireland’s decision. We don’t want to presume, yet cannot look away: it’s too visceral. You don’t need to have had an abortion yourself to be profoundly grateful that the right not to give birth against your will exists, a backstop to every other freedom women have. Besides, the Irish vote feels like an omen, a sign of the way the global winds are blowing. Rather like the teen movement for gun control in America, it’s tempting to see the yes movement as part of a millennial blowback against gathering reactionary forces – although older women raised in darker days, when supposedly “fallen” women endured grim punishment in mother and baby homes, are often as anxious for change as their daughters. But there may be more practical implications for Britain too. To be clear: a vote for repeal would allow Ireland’s parliament to consider reforming abortion law, but doesn’t guarantee this. The proposals aren’t for no-questions-asked abortion on demand, and they are not, despite what some no campaigners say, wildly more liberal than British law. But they are different: stricter in some ways (abortion would be legal beyond 12 weeks of pregnancy, and up to 24, only given a risk to the mother’s life, or serious harm to her health), and looser in one. Under the Irish proposals, a woman wouldn’t need to give a reason for seeking a termination before 12 weeks. She’d simply need a doctor to confirm her stage of pregnancy, and then undergo a 72-hour cooling-off period to reflect on the decision. In Britain abortion is legal up to 24 weeks only provided two doctors agree it’s justified on grounds including threat to the mother’s health, or to that of any existing children; serious foetal abnormality; risk to the mother’s life; or grave permanent injury to her. In practice, the law is elastic enough that refusals are rare. But the beginnings of a campaign for abortion on demand at least in early pregnancy are visible in Britain, with campaigners arguing that women don’t make this choice on a whim and shouldn’t have to beg permission. The British Medical Association now backs scrapping the two-doctor rule and bringing abortion under medical regulation, not the criminal law. If the public mood in Ireland has shifted, what about Britain? Despite being adamantly pro-choice, I’ve always felt ambivalent about further liberalisation. Opening the law up in parliament would let anti-abortion politicians seek their own amendments, a risky venture perhaps when Tory majorities rely on the DUP. The law doesn’t generally stop women ending unwanted pregnancies, but acknowledges concerns, helping ensure public consent. And since repeated terminations can be a sign of an abusive partner who won’t use contraception or accept a woman’s right to refuse sex, I’d worry that shortening conversations with doctors might reduce opportunities to pick up on victims of domestic violence or sexual exploitation, who may indeed need terminations, but other help besides. Yet Ireland’s experience makes me wonder if a debate wouldn’t be healthy. There is something exhilarating about the refusal to shove this under the carpet any more, as is the telling of stories once suppressed for shame and fear that have brought greater understanding of women’s lives. Ireland always told itself it was “banning” abortion when it was only ever outsourcing it; forcing women to bear the burden of unwanted pregnancy alone and silently, pushing them into an online black market in pills or into lonely journeys to clinics overseas. But now the chickens are coming home to roost. Ireland’s young are crossing the ocean in reverse, to be heard. It’s their decision, not mine. But like I said: fingers crossed. • Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sport/2018/may/24/giro-d-italia-yates-dumoulin-stage-18-lead-cut-half","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-24T21:16:18Z","webTitle":"Simon Yates has Giro d’Italia lead halved by Tom Dumoulin’s late burst","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/24/giro-d-italia-yates-dumoulin-stage-18-lead-cut-half","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/may/24/giro-d-italia-yates-dumoulin-stage-18-lead-cut-half","fields":{"headline":"Simon Yates has Giro d’Italia lead halved by Tom Dumoulin’s late burst","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"“It’s a good question,” said Simon Yates, his words unusually hesitant and imbued with apparent self-doubt. “I don’t know. I hope not. We’ll see.” As rallying cries go, it was hardly Henry V before Agincourt. Especially given the fact that his interrogator was asking whether the first cracks in his effort to win the Giro d’Italia were beginning to show. Then again, perhaps Yates’s demeanour was understandable. It had taken him nearly 2,000 miles, across 20 days and two continents, to put together a 56-second lead over last year’s winner Tom Dumoulin – and, suddenly, within a mile of climbing , half of it had vanished into the thin mountain air. As the speculation swirled through the press box – Is Yates ill? Had he burned up too much of his tank during Tuesday’s time trial? Was he conserving energy? – only one question really mattered: was this a blip or a preview of the final few days of this Giro? Many of the answers are likely to be found in Friday’s torturous 184km stage from Venaria Reale to Bardonecchia in the Alps. In theory, the vicious ascents should favour a pure climber such as Yates. But the peloton will be probing for weaknesses as soon as they hit the Colle delle Finestre, not only 2,178m high but also up gravelly roads. There were few signs that Yates was in trouble for much of the 18th stage from Abbiategrasso, a pleasant enough town on the outskirts of Milan, to Prato Nevoso. Indeed for all but two of the stage’s 196km he looked comfortable and content. Ahead of him a pack of 10 riders had established a 16-minute lead over the peloton, but none of them was a danger to him on general classification – including the stage winner Maximilian Schachmann. Dumoulin, meanwhile, was being closely man-marked. But then the stage and the race was suddenly blown apart. The fracture came in two parts. First Dumoulin attacked, a break Yates rushed to contain. Then Chris Froome hit him again, and Yates found nothing in response. “I couldn’t have closed the gap,” he admitted. “It was not a technical problem. I was just a little bit tired. I couldn’t respond to the final acceleration. And that’s OK. That’s OK.” Just before Froome went, Yates had looked into Dumoulin’s eyes, trying to seeing how he was coping – and whether he had given everything in one attack or whether he still had his legs. Watching the Dutchman shoot off ahead of him provided an instant answer. “But the next two days suit me more,” Yates insisted. “Thursday was a very explosive effort – one big effort. I don’t think it is my forte.” That is true enough, but there were plenty of sceptics among the Italian media who fear that Yates has expended too much energy in winning three stages and picking up several bonuses. But as he pointed out, with some justification, it is being so aggressive that has put him in the lead in the first place. “This is what I needed to do,” he said. “If I hadn’t have been so aggressive then I would have been behind. I’ve taken 40 seconds in bonus seconds in this race so far, and I am only 28 seconds ahead. So for me it has been necessary.” Froome, meanwhile, who remains in fourth place, 3min 22sec behind, has not given up hope of a shock victory. Before the stage a large crowd had swarmed around the Team Sky bus shouting “Chris, Chris” and fingers clambered to touch a five-times grand tour winner. During his four Tour de France victories Froome has been doubted, spat at and accused. Here, at least, there was only love. And with the help of his team-mate Wout Poels, who had headed up the road earlier on the climb, Froome showed signs of his best form. He explained: “Wout was feeling good so we agreed that he’d push on and see what would happen in the last few kilometres if I could get across to him. It worked out really well. “I had no idea Yates was on the limit there. Only when I accelerated did I turn around to see Dumoulin with me and not Simon. The race is still on – with two extremely hard days coming up. We’ve got Colle delle Finestre so there’s all still to race for.” The only positive for Yates on a day when this year’s Giro d’Italia was blown spectacularly apart could be found in the mirror. For both cheeks were still firmly imprinted with rouge lipstick, courtesy of the podium girls at the end of the stage. “If I finish now I have already had a successful Giro,” he said as he left the hotel. But, having come so close to the Maglia Rosa, he will be desperate to seal the deal."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/may/28/joe-dunthorne-who-needs-sunlight-when-you-can-bask-in-the-jaundiced-glow-of-your-only-child","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-28T06:00:45Z","webTitle":"My summer in a windowless special care baby unit: 'I have never looked so dead nor felt so alive'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/28/joe-dunthorne-who-needs-sunlight-when-you-can-bask-in-the-jaundiced-glow-of-your-only-child","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/28/joe-dunthorne-who-needs-sunlight-when-you-can-bask-in-the-jaundiced-glow-of-your-only-child","fields":{"headline":"My summer in a windowless special care baby unit: 'I have never looked so dead nor felt so alive'","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"We spent high summer in a windowless room on the postnatal ward. It wasn’t even really a room – just papery blue curtains dividing us from five other families. Through the thin fabric, we could hear fate dealing out the cards. On one side, a mother saying she needed no pain relief and her baby was latching beautifully. On the other, a mother saying she could hardly bear to look at the thing, let alone feed it. Whenever I walked down the corridors, I saw other parents sobbing. The happy sobbers were indistinguishable from the sad ones. For our part, our son had an infection from the three-day labour. We had told the doctors we didn’t want him on antibiotics and they said he could be dead within hours and then we said we wanted all the antibiotics. Twice a day for seven days, I shuttled our tiny yellowish creature from the ward to the special care baby unit. I took him there in a plastic box on wheels that looked like a portable fish tank. He had a bulky cannula inserted into his wrist. We had to put one of my socks over his arm to stop him tearing out the needle. It was an orange sock and every time I took him to get his antibiotics he would whack his outsize orange arm against the sides of the fish tank in protest, like a lobster who knows he is destined for the pot. Then the doctors would push liquids into his blood and he would scream and then take a huge breath so that he could scream again. Walking back to the ward each day, I always glimpsed the TV in the waiting room, showing Wimbledon. There was Roger Federer, tossing a ball high into sunlight. There was Sue Barker silhouetted against a crisp blue sky. Henman hill writhed with all the sunburnt, child-free fans whose only worries were the poor distribution of strawberries in their Pimm’s. Meanwhile, in our lightless cave, we hardly slept, ate bad food and listened to strangers weeping. This was our life now. Summer was for other people. But the strangest thing about all this is that we were happy. I had heard stories about the powerful feelings that come with parenthood, but had always feared they would not apply to me. That I would be hollow-hearted, coldly observing my child, making notes for my novel. So it was a shock and a relief to discover that I was irredeemably soppy. My wife and I look back on our incarceration as a magical time. Who needs sunlight when you can bask in the jaundiced glow of your only child? Our feelings of love for him spilled over into everything. We saw great beauty in using the disposable vomit bowls to display our bruised-fruit selection. The motor of my wife’s electric bed made a sound that was exactly the same as the horn intro to Jump Around by House of Pain and this brought us way more pleasure than it should have. We were in a literal house of pain – a hospital. And jumping around was something my wife would not be able to do for weeks. Ha ha ha – life was brilliant. It was a kind of Stockholm syndrome, we now realise. In fact, it feels like the whole of parenthood is a kind of Stockholm syndrome. You learn to love the thing that takes you hostage. After two weeks, we finally emerged from the hospital, pushing a pram. It was raining, which suited us: two grey-skinned parents, moving at the speed of zombies. I have never looked so dead nor felt so alive. • The Adulterants by Joe Dunthorne is published by Hamish Hamilton"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"film/2018/may/24/morgan-freeman-sexual-harassment-accusations-claims-women","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-24T17:06:50Z","webTitle":"Morgan Freeman accused of sexual harassment by eight women","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/may/24/morgan-freeman-sexual-harassment-accusations-claims-women","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/may/24/morgan-freeman-sexual-harassment-accusations-claims-women","fields":{"headline":"Morgan Freeman accused of sexual harassment by eight women","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Morgan Freeman has been accused of sexual and verbal harassment by eight different women. According to CNN, the women, who say Freeman subjected them to inappropriate remarks about their bodies, allege that he harassed them on the set of his films, at his production company Revelations Entertainment and at press junkets. One woman, who in the summer of 2015 worked as a production assistant on the set of the comedy Going in Style, said she experienced months of harassment, claiming the actor touched her inappropriately and frequently commented on her figure and clothing. On one occasion, she says, Freeman “kept trying to lift up my skirt and asking if I was wearing underwear”. Alan Arkin, a co-star on the film, reportedly told Freeman to stop. “Morgan got freaked out and didn’t know what to say,” the accuser, who chose to remain anonymous, added. Another woman, who was part of the production staff on the 2012 heist thriller Now You See Me, alleges that Freeman harassed her and an assistant by make crude comments about their bodies. “We knew that if he was coming by … not to wear any top that would show our breasts, not to wear anything that would show our bottoms, meaning not wearing clothes that [were] fitted,” she said. In a statement, Freeman said: “Anyone who knows me or has worked with me knows I am not someone who would intentionally offend or knowingly make anyone feel uneasy. I apologize to anyone who felt uncomfortable or disrespected – that was never my intent.” CNN reportedly spoke to 16 people for the investigation, eight of whom accused Freeman, 80, of what they labeled harassment or inappropriate behavior while the rest remarked that they didn’t witness anything problematic. The co-author of the report, Chloe Melas, was one of three entertainment reporters to accuse Freeman of behaving inappropriately during encounters with press. Melas, who interviewed Freeman at a press junket for Going in Style when she was six months pregnant, says that, while shaking her hand and not letting go, Freeman told her: “Boy, do I wish I was there,” adding: “You are ripe.” Another reporter, Tyra Martin of Chicago’s WGN-TV, says that on several occasions where she interviewed Freeman he remarked on her appearance. “When I stood up, I pulled my skirt, part of my dress down, and he did say, ‘Oh, don’t pull it down now.’” Martin told CNN. “That gave me pause but I never felt uncomfortable.” Other women said that they were victims of Freeman’s misconduct at the actors production company Revelations Entertainment, which he founded in 1996 with business partner Lori McCreary. They described a “toxic” workplace atmosphere, with six former staffers claiming they witnessed Freeman’s behavior firsthand. A former manager at the company said Freeman would “come over to my desk to say hi and he’d just stand there and stare at me. He would stare at my breasts.” After another incident, the woman said she “stopped wearing a skirt around the office when he was there”. Another Revelations staffer said that the actor, while surrounded by a group of men, once “looked me up and down” and asked: “How do you feel about sexual harassment?” A male staffer characterized Freeman as a “creepy uncle”, recalling an instance in which Freeman massaged an intern’s shoulder. “One time I witnessed Morgan walk up to an intern and start massaging her,” he said. “The intern got visibly red and wiggled out of his grasp, it was awkward.” According to five sources who spoke to CNN, there was no human resources department at Revelations. Additionally, the women whom Freeman allegedly harassed on film sets said they didn’t report his behavior at the time in fear of losing their jobs. The allegations against Freeman, an Academy award-winning actor known for his performances in Driving Miss Daisy, The Shawshank Redemption and Million Dollar Baby, come in the wake of Hollywood’s #MeToo movement. Since the allegations, greater Vancouver’s transportation system, TransLink, has removed Freeman’s voice from a Visa ad campaign that was running as part of their announcements. Actors union SAG-AFTRA is also investigating the allegations. Freeman was awarded a life achievement award last year. “These are compelling and devastating allegations which are absolutely contrary to all the steps that we are taking to insure a safe work environment for the professionals in this industry,” a spokesperson said. “Any accused person has the right to due process, but it is our starting point to believe the courageous voices who come forward to report incidents of harassment. Given Mr. Freeman recently received one of our union’s most prestigious honors recognizing his body of work, we are therefore reviewing what corrective actions may be warranted at this time.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2018/may/24/mauricio-pochettino-tottenham-premier-league","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-24T15:13:23Z","webTitle":"Mauricio Pochettino signs new five-year contract at Tottenham Hotspur","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/24/mauricio-pochettino-tottenham-premier-league","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/24/mauricio-pochettino-tottenham-premier-league","fields":{"headline":"Mauricio Pochettino signs new five-year contract at Tottenham Hotspur","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Mauricio Pochettino has signed a new five-year contract at Tottenham Hotspur worth up to £8.5m each year. The manager had refused in recent weeks to guarantee he would lead the club into their new stadium in September and he sparked alarm on the final day of the season when he appeared to suggest that his future was linked to how Daniel Levy approached the summer transfer window. Pochettino called upon the chairman to “be brave and take risks” and it was clear that the Argentinian, who has led Spurs to three successive top-three finishes and Champions League qualifications, was positioning, at the very least, to win certain concessions. Pochettino has worked effectively on relatively meagre budgets during his four seasons at the club and is determined to strengthen the squad in order to challenge for major trophies. However, he is well aware that because of the financing requirements of the stadium – a further £500m, at the very least, must be found – he is likely to have to continue to balance signings with outgoings. When he delivered his end-of-season message and talked of the need to “create a new project”, he was trying to get swift decisions over player sales to gain more flexibility on his signings. Pochettino is willing to listen to offers for Mousa Dembélé, Danny Rose and Toby Alderweireld – the last of those is a target for Manchester United’s José Mourinho. He was also seeking to mark his turf over the type of player he wants to sign. Typically, Levy has preferred younger ones with resale value but the manager would like him to consider more seasoned professionals. Pochettino and Levy have since held positive talks regarding the club’s direction and the announcement that the manager has agreed to fresh terms could not be better timed. Pochettino has been linked with Real Madrid, where the future of Zinedine Zidane could come into sharp focus after Saturday’s Champions League final against Liverpool in Kiev. Tottenham hope that Pochettino’s commitment will encourage some of their big-name players to extend their contracts. Negotiations are planned with Jan Vertonghen, Harry Kane, Dele Alli, Hugo Lloris and Christian Eriksen. Pochettino’s coaches, Jesús Pérez, Miguel D’Agostino and Toni Jiménez, have also extended their deals until 2023. Pochettino said: “I am honoured to have signed a new long-term contract as we approach one of the most significant periods in the club’s history, and be the manager that will lead this team into our new world-class stadium. This is just one of the factors that makes this one of the most exciting jobs in world football and we are already making plans to ensure we continue to build on the great work that everyone has contributed to over the past four years. “Daniel and I have spoken at length about our aspirations for this football club. We both share the same philosophies to achieve long-term, sustainable success. This is a special club – we always strive to be creative in the way we work both on and off the pitch and will continue to stick to our principles in order to achieve the success this club deserves.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2018/may/24/is-four-year-old-eric-cowell-following-in-his-father-simons-footsteps-a-million-percent-yes","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-24T16:21:00Z","webTitle":"Is four-year-old Eric Cowell following in his father Simon’s footsteps?

A million percent yes","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"It is always a pleasure to see a son welcomed into the family business, as the parent in question decides the moment has come to introduce them to the industry that can only – only! – make them happy. There is some dispute about the perfect age for it to happen to maximise the potential benefit to the child. J Paul Getty’s father encouraged him to buy shares in one of his oil wells as a youngster, and was demonstratively disappointed by any of his son’s attempts to deviate from the path he wished him to follow. Perhaps if Getty Sr had brought him on even sooner, the boy who would become the richest man in the world might have foregone the payphone for guests in his London mansion, or paid up his grandson’s ransom before, rather than after, the kidnappers had relieved the 16-year-old of his ear. We can’t know. What we can do is salute a hyper-naturalistic appearance on our screens by little Eric Cowell, four, as his father Simon is stagily upstaged by his son and heir. X Factor auditions are currently underway, incidentally, as the show bids to better the worst ratings in its history for last season’s outing – but that’s not important right now. What is, is that Cowell granted an upbeat interview to Loose Women, in which a household fall was parlayed into a “health scare”, and working at night described as an addiction and so on. But hang on – who’s this accidentally interrupting proceedings? Why, it is Eric, dressed in denim shorts and a round-necked black jumper – the exact uniform of his father, of course, bar the long trousers. Winsome horseplay ensues. This is far from Eric’s debut in public life – he has already made appearances on The X Factor and Britain’s Got Talent, when his answer to an inquiry about what his father’s job was ran: “I am Daddy’s job now.” As Cowell later revealed, this is all part of a strategy. “I’m sort of training him up,” he explained. Would he like Eric to follow in his Cuban-heeled footsteps? “Oh, a million per cent. I think about that all the time. I would love him to take over. He’s really confident,” Simon continued of Eric’s feel for the show. “When he comes down here, he knows what everybody does. He likes being in the gallery. That will be my dream.” Mmm. The entire scene – and it was a total scene – reminds me where I saw this exact same device only a few weeks ago. Then it was being deployed by that other terrible old ham, Jacob Rees-Mogg. If you missed this, Jacob was being interviewed by Kay Burley for Sky News in the kitchen of his house in Somerset. They were just exchanging obsequies, when who should wander in but a young boy dressed as Jacob Rees-Mogg. “Oh hello!” said Moggy, doing surprise easily as convincingly as he’s been doing Sebastian Flyte for the past 35 years. Which is to say, not entirely. In the doorway could be seen the 10-year-old Peter Rees-Mogg, with an unidentified woman (not the mother) hovering behind. To encourage him on stage at the right moment? Who can say? Naturally – or rather almost naturally – his father deftly embraced the moment of confected chaos. “Come and meet Kay Burley,” he beckoned to Peter, “who is the most distinguished 24-hour-broadcaster.” Peter was duly brought forth and introduced. “Given half a chance,” trilled Mogg pere, “he’d take over the interview, but we’d better not let that happen.” Incidentally, Peter was dressed in his prep school uniform, which helpfully features a cravat. And yet, even this felt slightly out of place, given the interview was taking place in the kitchen of Rees-Mogg’s house in Somerset, and the school in question is a couple of hundred miles away in London. Down in the country, ought one not to be in mufti? I don’t want to go full Henry Higgins here, but as with many of Rees-Mogg’s little tells, the detail seems to have been sufficiently subtle not to upset the general suspension of disbelief as far as Britain’s Most Authentic Politician™ is concerned. “I’m not terribly agricultural,” he once informed LBC listeners, with the practised air of someone frequently asked the question: “What do you farm?” Dairy? Arable? Troll? The latter is closest to the reality, but the pose continues. Then again, the path was set many decades ago. The young Jacob Rees-Mogg was encouraged to buy shares and ask questions at shareholders’ meetings at the age of 11 – one chairman was informed by the child that his dividend offer was “pathetic” – and to give interviews seemingly to anyone that asked. “How much are you worth?” Tatler wondered of the 16-year-old. “I’m not prepared to answer that question,” he replied. “How much were you worth when you were 12?” “I’m afraid you’ll have to look that up in your file of cuttings.” (You’ll note no one ever asks where on earth the parents are in situations like this, but if one of Katie Price’s kids does similar in their teens she will literally drown in condemnation.) It recently emerged that the 12-year-old Rees-Mogg had threatened to sue the BBC for a Today programme appearance fee. “I have no idea what your excuse is,” his letter ran, “but I will not accept it. If it is not received by 10/11/81 which is nearly two months, I shall increase it to £36.” Almost the sort of thing one might expect a young Simon Cowell (whose father was a music industry executive) to have got up to, given half a chance. On these two houses roll, then, each drafting in the next generation eyebrow-raisingly early, perhaps convinced that the children hold the key to their perpetuation. The Cowells and the Rees-Moggs, ladies and gentlemen: two households, both alike in ... well, now ... dignity, would you call it? The World Cup’s official anthem gets Willie with it News that America’s Will Smith is to feature in the official Fifa World Cup song feels less scrutable than it might. In one sense, it fits a pattern of studied randomness. For a World Cup held in Russia, the Gettin’ Jiggy Wit It legend will join South American reggaeton star Nicky Jam, and a Kosovar musician called Era Istrefi in a track produced by US DJ Diplo. The US haven’t qualified for the tournament, incidentally. But once you’ve had the noted Colombian singer Shakira do the official anthem for South Africa in 2010 – Waka Waka (This Time for Africa) – it’s fair to say you’ve permanently freed yourself from the bonds of relevance. Even so, why has Fifa gone with these particular personnel for Russia 2018? I assume the answer to that question is the same as the answer to the question “Why does Fifa do anything?” But I must confess to having trouble following the angles here. Smith was certainly giving nothing away when he commented on the news, though he did manage to honour the law that no one involved with the mega-event and the product should ever mention the word football. “This global event brings people from all over the world together,” he explained, “to cheer, laugh and experience magic … at the end of the day, we just want to see the world dance.” Well quite. As for what Will described as “harmony, eclectic flavours and genres coming together”, I now want to see this ensemble performance at the opening ceremony almost as much as I want to see the hilariously cast opening match between Russia and Saudi Arabia (#COYSaudis). All Fifa World Cup songs sound as if they were put together by a committee – this one sounds as if it was put together by members of the executive committee while they were being led out of the Baur au Lac hotel beneath their bedlinen in the dawn raid three years ago. The song is being released this very Friday, however, so I leave it to you to decide whether additional criminal charges should be brought."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"news/2018/may/24/corrections-and-clarifications","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-24T20:00:26Z","webTitle":"Corrections and clarifications","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/may/24/corrections-and-clarifications","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2018/may/24/corrections-and-clarifications","fields":{"headline":"Corrections and clarifications","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"• A feature incorrectly quoted a lawyer as saying contractual obligations prevented record labels from dropping those accused of sexual offences, because if they did “they may leave themselves open to a claim from artists for unfair dismissal”.

Why is editing so important? How can we train ourselves to write with precision from the earliest possible stage in the development of our work? Writers work in different ways; some like to work fast on early drafts, while others prefer taking their time, working meticulously from the outset. But however you work, you will need at some stage to address the detail of your writing, ensuring that your narrative is as well presented as you can make it. Through a combination of practical exercises and discussion, you shall examine strategies for effective editing, and will come away with an understanding of the value of the editing process. You will learn how to edit your own work effectively, and the importance of early-stage editing.

He was more fresh-faced and less bearded, but was already purveying his now ubiquitous, one-size-fits-all mix of folk, soul, rap and bantz, urging the railway passengers to sing along and “make a circle”. In a staggeringly ironic comment to camera, he says: “My music doesn’t really hit everyone, otherwise I’d be a lucky man.” Eight years later, he is that lucky man – and then some – and the only real change is the size of the audience. A total of 200,000 people will see the creator of the fastest-selling album by a male artist ever (2017’s ÷, AKA Divide) in Manchester alone, over four nights, on the northern leg of the UK’s biggest ever solo tour. There are huge screens, a camera follows his grinning fizzog from the bowels of the stadium to the stage and there is a bloke on hand to pass him his pre-tuned acoustic guitars. But otherwise, not much has changed since St Pancras. “It’s just me, this guitar and this loop pedal,” explains the everybloke. Geezers with guitars (the choir-like noises from the loop pedal are the closest he gets to a backing band) don’t generally headline stadiums, but the 27-year-old Suffolk-raised Yorkshireman has successfully charmed millions of arena-goers as effectively as he did the bystanders at St Pancras. For refuseniks who blame Sheeran (like Coldplay and Phil Collins before him) for everything that’s wrong with music, the mystery is how he’s done it with such ordinary material. Plenty of artists are bland. Plenty write catchy songs. Perhaps nobody else writes songs that are quite so blandly catchy, but he does spin relatable everyday tales into uplifting mainstream anthems. Here 20 of them feature over 90 minutes. Sheeran’s scruffy charisma turns Castle on the Hill’s market-town youth reminiscence into the first of many singalongs, and his slightly bemused, cheery grin remains gleefully in place during The A-Team’s lyrics about a crack-addicted prostitute. Galway Girl may have been critically mauled as the musical equivalent of a fake Irish-themed pub, but it gets the joint jumping. As banter inevitably flows, an anecdote about once having played Manchester to a single person reveals the herculean drive behind the chumminess: “He’s now my lawyer. No matter how few people are in a crowd, I’ve always given my best.” He explains that “participation is a big part” – presumably even with a crowd of one – and well-worn routines such as getting the audience to scream are incontrovertibly effective. A mid-set wobble allows for toilet visits or perhaps an existential moment to ponder how pop became this boring, but as evening descends and volume increases, things liven up and some rawer edges are revealed. There’s a lyrical hint of darkness (well, dusk) to Bloodstream, and Perfect (“Dancing in the dark, with you between my arms”) arrives at the precise moment that the sun goes down and phones light up. Thinking Out Loud may be schmaltzy, but along with the wildly catchy grooves of Sing and the tropical house-ish Shape of You it rightfully generates a sea of swaying arms. Rising artists often claim to play pubs like they’re in Wembley Stadium: Ed Sheeran plays a stadium-sized version of a pub gig, but, undeniably, it works. At Etihad Stadium, Manchester, until Sunday. Then touring."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2018/may/25/what-is-galileo-and-why-are-the-uk-and-eu-arguing-about-it","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-25T11:43:12Z","webTitle":"What is Galileo and why are the UK and EU arguing about it?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/may/25/what-is-galileo-and-why-are-the-uk-and-eu-arguing-about-it","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/may/25/what-is-galileo-and-why-are-the-uk-and-eu-arguing-about-it","fields":{"headline":"What is Galileo and why are the UK and EU arguing about it?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"What is Galileo? Galileo is an £8bn satellite navigation system intended to rival the US-controlled Global Positioning System. Once fully operational in 2020 it will provide accurate position, navigation and timing information to be used by governments, citizens and industry. It will be used by everything from smartphones to security-critical military applications in target acquisition and tracking. The UK is developing receivers for military platforms that will incorporate Galileo’s encrypted Public Regulated Service (PRS). What is the problem? The European commission has started to block Britain’s space industry from being involved in manufacturing of the security elements of the satellite programme. The EU says the agreement struck over the terms of the 21-month transition period after Brexit gives it the freedom to do so. The commission has suggested that after Brexit the UK should not be given privileged access to “need-to-know” information about Galileo’s PRS. It has already banned UK representatives from discussions and exchanges pertaining to the post-2019 development of the security aspects of the satellite system. What has been the UK’s response? The government is furious. It claims UK entities have played an “integral part in designing, developing and managing Galileo to date, particularly the delivery of payloads for satellites, the ground control segment and the development of the PRS software.” The UK contributes to Galileo’s coverage through hosting two sensor stations at secure locations in the south Atlantic. The government claims that blocking UK industry from security-related areas risks causing delays of up to three years and additional costs of up to €1bn (£875m). Without being fully informed about the workings of the PRS, it claims, it would not have the assurances it needs to use the service in a military capacity. The UK has said it will demand the return of financial contributions to the programme of more than €1bn. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, has threatened to launch a rival satellite, possibly with Australia, if the EU does not back down. How has the EU responded? The EU has said it will not negotiate under threat. It insists the UK agreed with the rules when they were made. However, there are differences of opinion among the member states. The rough handling of the issue by the commission, including a failure to respond to an early letter expressing the concerns of the UK’s ambassador to the EU, Tim Barrow, has not pleased some diplomats in Brussels. The European commission is set to consult with the member states in the next few weeks. France, Spain, the Netherlands and the Baltic states are among those said to be keen for a resolution of the problem that will maintain the closest possible security links with the UK after Brexit."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/may/25/intimate-harrowing-grenfell-testimonies-make-victims-real-not-just-a-number","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-25T13:30:47Z","webTitle":"Intimate, harrowing Grenfell testimonies make victims real, not just a number","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/25/intimate-harrowing-grenfell-testimonies-make-victims-real-not-just-a-number","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/may/25/intimate-harrowing-grenfell-testimonies-make-victims-real-not-just-a-number","fields":{"headline":"Intimate, harrowing Grenfell testimonies make victims real, not just a number","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The most extraordinary thing was happening in a large, bland conference room in a west London hotel this week. Slowly, harrowingly, lovingly, life was being breathed back into the 72 people killed by the Grenfell Tower fire. One week into the inquiry, they are no longer a number – or an abstraction. No longer just collateral damage; an emblem of corporate greed and national shame. These people are Logan, Denis, Saber, Joseph, Mary, Khadija, Debbie, Rania, Hania, Fethia, Hesham, Pily, Tony, Zainab and Jeremiah Deen, Ali, Gary, Marjorie, Ernie, Mohamednur, Amal, Amaya, Amna, Kamru, Rabeya, Mohammed Hamid, Mohammed Hanif, Husna, Victoria, Alexandra, Fathia, Sirria, Nadia, Bassem, Mierna, Fatima, Zainab Choucair. And there are plenty more tributes to come. The inquiry into the Grenfell fire opened with “pen portraits” – testimonies in which family and friends enabled us to get to know those they lost on 14 June 2017. The bereaved, the lawyers and Inquest, the charity representing the families, had to fight for the right to humanise the victims, just as they did at the Hillsborough inquest in 2014. If they had not done so, the inquiry would have dispensed with the dead, and lurched straight into the technicalities of refurbishment and combustible cladding. Thankfully, the government saw sense. What has emerged is an intimate insight into the individual lives that made up the families of the proud Grenfell community, and the community that reflected the inspirational melting pot of modern London. Just after the disaster, a simplistic narrative emerged about Grenfell: those who died in the tower were a dispensable underclass that lived within spitting distance of the affluent elite (David Cameron and Madonna were often cited as neighbours). They might not have been able to compete financially with the Holland Park set, but there was nothing poor about these lives. Over the first week we learned of the most incredible array of people, their journeys and achievements. It started heartbreakingly with the story of stillborn Logan, cradled in his father’s arms hours after the family had escaped the fire. And it didn’t get any easier. The testimonies were gruelling, broken, tender, tearful, funny, haunting, angry, eloquent – every one of them beautiful in a unique way. To listen to them was a privilege. A terrible privilege. We heard how 45-year-old Debbie Lamprell, who lived on the 16th floor, loved her work at the local opera company, and the guilt her mother, Miriam, now feels for having encouraged her to move into Grenfell. Miriam was the envy of her neighbours who could feel her flat shake with laughter when Debbie was around. “A part of me has been ripped out. Nothing seems worth it any more.” The struggle to go on, the pointlessness of everything, were themes that emerged in testimony after testimony. And yet there was so much faith in the room – notably, Islam. The depth of Nick Burton’s love for his Spanish wife, Pily, gave you goosebumps. “She was very beautiful and could have chosen anybody. I don’t know why she chose me.” Pily, who was badly injured in the fire and died seven months later, was one of life’s optimists. “She loved the Bob Marley song Three Little Birds.” And he sang the opening lines: “Don’t worry about a thing. ’Cause every little thing gonna be alright …” Rasha Ibrahim’s love for her 31-year-old sister, Rania, was no less touching. Rasha lived in Egypt; Rania with her two daughters, Fethia and Hania, on the 23rd floor of Grenfell. They chatted all the time. Rania livestreamed their final moments as the tower blazed. Rasha said she still writes to Rania on Facebook. She recently sent her a message saying: “I miss you in my dreams.” Each testimony was unforgettable. There was the symbolism of Damel Carayol, a cousin of Mary Mendy and her daughter, Khadija Saye, presenting the chair of the inquiry, Sir Martin Moore-Bick, with a copy of his painting of the ashen tower, entitled Eyesore: The Final Straw. He read out the inscription. “To Sir Martin Moore-Bick. Work until truth is laid bare.” Moore-Bick accepted the gift as an act of faith and promised he would do just that. Many of the dead had come to Britain to make new lives for themselves or to escape brutal regimes. There was the horrible irony of the Sudanese teacher Fathia Ali Ahmed Elsanosi dying in the fire after nursing her sister Hayat many years earlier when she had been disabled by fire. Hayat told the inquiry: “Our trust in this country has been destroyed.” There was fun: Rania and Rasha pelting each other with eggs while cooking, Pily trying to persuade Nick to talk to the camera in Spanish. There was art: the poem by Hesham Rahman including the prescient line “Remember my presence after my departure”, the haunting film about Marjorie Vital and her son Ernie by a relative who wished to remain anonymous. There was unimaginable horror: Marjorie and Ernie tried to save themselves by running a cold bath and died fused together. There was lump-in-the-throat cuteness: Amaya, who died on the 19th floor aged three, with a different coloured flower in her hair in each photo. There was anger. Hisam Choucair, who lost six members of his Lebanese family on the 22nd floor, said: “We had to stand there watching for hours, watching them burn to death. It was five months before we were able to bury them. I have to live with my family ripped apart for the rest of my life. I don’t see it as a tragedy; I see it as an atrocity.” And there was more anger. Karim Mussilhy, whose uncle Hesham Rahman, lived on the 23rd floor said: “Until those in power make changes to the system, only God knows how many homes are safe. So listen and learn from those mistakes. We are here because the system failed to protect my uncle and 71 other souls.” The counsel to the inquiry Bernard Richmond QC interrupted him to say these points should be made at a later part of the inquiry. Mussilhy carried on to a standing ovation. “We have been censored enough,” he said. There were mouth-watering descriptions of dishes from Lebanon, Eritrea, Sudan, Egypt, Bangladesh, Spain. The whole world, and its palate, was contained in Grenfell Tower. There was the inconsolable monotone of Mohammed Hakim, who lost all five members of his family and had been left orphaned. Hakim revealed that his 82-year-old father had suffered two strokes and a heart attack and and that his siblings might have been able to escape if they had not stayed with him. “He should not have been on the 17th floor,” he said. “We complained about that numerous times.” And there was the astonishing story of Mohamednur Tuccu, a freedom fighter in Eritrea who had to flee his homeland for Sudan, then Nigeria, before moving to England and earning a BSc in genetics, and an MSc in bioinformatics. For the last 10 years of his life he worked as a security guard. The inquiry was far from perfect. Shocking footage of people trapped in the fire was shown without warning and led to a “medical emergency” as a number of distressed people left the room and one was treated for a panic attack. There were complaints that the inquiry would be moved from the Millennium Gloucester hotel, close to Grenfell, to the centre of London after the pen portraits. Dismay was expressed that contractors and senior politicians had not attended. And yet something very special was occurring here. Respect, solidarity, catharsis. Richmond – Bernie to everybody in the room – said it should be a safe space in which people should feel free to cry and clap. And by and large it was, and they did. Bernie handed out sweets from the plastic carrier bag under his desk to those in need. With his perfectly parted silver hair, grey suit and patrician voice, Sir Martin looks like a judge from central casting. Before the inquiry began it was suggested he was an inappropriate chair, that he would not be able to relate to the community. But he has been unobtrusive and quietly empathic, and even Sir Martin appears to have been embraced in the safe space. On Thursday morning, he introduced the fourth day of testimonies. “Well good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Mrs Choucair brought in two loaves of Lebanese bread today – one for the ushers and one for my team if they are very well behaved. Thank you very much.” He glanced in her direction, and smiled. After each portrait, the relief was visible, the emotion tangible. Clarrie Mendy, another cousin of Mary and Khadija, told me: “It’s off my chest now. It’s all come out. I’ve said everything I had to say.” What does she hope for from the inquiry? “I want to know why the safety concerns raised initially by concerned tenants were ignored. That should be brought into the first part of the inquiry.” Hisam Choucair looked as if he’d been 14 rounds in the ring by the end – and that was how he felt. “We had to fight for rulings from the government for pen portraits. Everything has just been a fight for us. One thing after another. If we’d not had these portraits, the culture, the history of the community, who the people were, you would have got a tick-box inquiry. And we’re going to fight it to the end. I’m not going to shut up, I’m not going to allow this to be brushed beneath the carpet. As long as I have a breath in my soul I will not let that happen because I’d be letting my family down, the community down, everybody.” On the way out Nick Burton hugged Karim Mussilhy and told him he was a hero. “To hear the stories from the families is the most important stuff – the feelings, the people, the descriptions, the pain, the loss. The whole world needs to hear this. It’s not just the loss of my wife, I feel everybody’s loss.” He pointed to the bereaved in the room. “We’re family now. There’s nothing that can break us apart.” How is he coping? He says he isn’t. “The other week I was in John Lewis buying a new duvet. I didn’t know what togs were so I phoned Pily. Then I realised what I was doing …” The first week of the inquiry has been reminiscent of the post-apartheid Truth and Reconciliation Commission in South Africa. Its architect, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, said of that process: “Forgiving and being reconciled to our enemies or our loved ones are not about pretending that things are other than they are. It is not about patting one another on the back and turning a blind eye to the wrong. True reconciliation exposes the awfulness, the abuse, the hurt, the truth. It could even sometimes make things worse. It is a risky undertaking but it is worthwhile, because in the end only an honest confrontation with reality can bring real healing. Superficial reconciliation can bring only superficial healing.” There is one big difference here, though. In South Africa many of the perpetrators listened to their victims tell them how they had destroyed their lives. So far few of those who ultimately may be held responsible for Grenfell have been present. Deborah Coles, executive director of Inquest, said: “The only criticism I would make of the process is that lawyers representing the state and corporate bodies who are being represented at this inquiry should have had to have listened to these lives cut short. It’s the pen portraits that could help drive the cultural change that is needed.” She is right. They would have learned so much about the people who died in their combustible, cheaply clad tower – and the impact it has had on those left. It is impossible to be here and not care. And perhaps suppliers, contractors, tenant management organisations, councils, government ministers, need to learn to care to ensure that this annihilation never happens again. As for the building itself, when it is finally pulled down, a museum, a memorial, a shrine, call it what you will, must be built in its place. And every single testimony, photo and film from this stage of the inquiry should be put on permanent display so we can bear witness to the lives lost – and the lives lived – at Grenfell Tower."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}
