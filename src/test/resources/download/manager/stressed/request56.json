The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is back","bodyText":"In 1985, Douglas Adams said the BBC’s view of the first series of The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy was like Macbeth’s attitude to murder: “Initial doubts, followed by cautious enthusiasm, then greater and greater alarm at the sheer scale of the undertaking.” Those days are, however, long gone and the BBC is marking the 40th anniversary of Adams’ ground-breaking creation in style. The original cast has been reunited to record a new radio series of the intergalactic comedy that, from small beginnings in 1978 on Radio 4, grew into a juggernaut that spawned a TV series, a Disney film, a much-loved series of books, several stage shows and even a video game. The first person I meet when I roll up at a recording session is Lenny Henry, who is playing a Mephistophelian character called The Consultant. He gives it his all, deploying that remarkable basso profundo voice as if he were playing King Lear. Henry appears alongside Simon Jones and Geoffrey McGivern, the original Arthur Dent and Ford Prefect, the double act at the centre of Adams’ creation. What makes the performance all the more poignant is that they are playing a scene written by Adams but never previously recorded. The new series combines unpublished material, dug out of Adams’ notebooks by archivist and superfan Kevin Jon Davies, and newer plotlines drawn from And Another Thing, Eoin Colfer’s book continuing the saga, which was commissioned by the Adams estate after the author’s sudden death at the age of just 49 in 2001. Davies says the key to Adams’ work is that he is not a science fiction writer: he is a satirist and Hitchhiker is a modern Gulliver’s Travels. “Douglas didn’t set out just to do sci-fi,” he explains, “but he said that whatever he was writing ended up with robots and spaceships. His real literary hero was PG Wodehouse.” If you see Adams as Wodehouse with spaceships, you start to understand his humour. Arthur Dent, the quintessentially English hero of the series, is one of the few survivors when Earth is destroyed by the Vogons, who are constructing a hyperspace bypass. Dent is rescued by Ford Prefect, a know-all alien who works as a researcher for the Hitchhiker’s Guide, an electronic encyclopedia full of useful (and sometimes bizarre) information. The guide anticipated ipads and the idea of the Babel fish – a yellow creature that, when placed in the ear, provides an instant translation service (allowing Arthur to understand Vogons when he hitches a lift from the disintegrating Earth on their spaceship). Fittingly, there is now a translation site called babelfish.com. Adams’ farsightedness explains why the entrepreneur Elon Musk is such a huge fan: Musk says reading Hitchhiker as a teenager changed his life and liberated him from his “existential crisis”. When Musk shot one of his Tesla Roadsters into space recently attached to a Falcon rocket, it had the words “Don’t Panic” emblazoned on the dashboard – echoing the cover of the original Guide – and there was a copy of the book in the glove compartment. Musk also included a towel, the accoutrement that Ford Prefect says no space traveller should ever be without (Hitchhiker fans celebrate Towel Day on 25 May each year). In the new series, Arthur and Ford Prefect visit the tiny planet of Nano, where they find an Irish community run by a chancer called Hillman Hunter (played by the comedian Ed Byrne). The colony is getting unruly, so Hunter wants a God to supply a few rules – God, or the lack of one, is never far away from Adams’ concerns – and begins conducting interviews for the role. Meanwhile, the Vogons have also discovered the existence of this unlikely Irish colony and are naturally sending a force to eradicate it. Fans will be pleased to learn that Marvin the Paranoid Android, the depressed super-robot with a brain the size of a planet, makes a welcome return, this time voiced by another high-profile guest, Jim Broadbent. Marvin was killed off in episode four but here pops up in virtual reality. Kevin Jon Davies vividly remembers hearing the first episode when he was 17 and instantly falling in love with the show. He met Adams soon after to record an interview about Doctor Who – Adams was a script editor. “Hitchhiker’s became my favourite thing,” says Davies, “because it combines the best of The Goons, Monty Python and Doctor Who.” Davies thinks the 2005 Disney film was a less than resounding success critically because Adams’ idiosyncratic writing had been changed for Hollywood. “It’s like a pullover,” he says. “If you start picking at threads, the whole thing falls apart.” The new radio series will take no such liberties. Dirk Maggs, one of the original producers, is in charge of production, and there’s a photograph of Adams in the control room to remind everyone who was responsible for the original big bang. “I wasn’t going to come back,” says Maggs, “but it was the 40th anniversary and I knew there was some Douglas material that hadn’t been used. It was also a chance for Arthur, Ford Prefect and Zaphod Beeblebrox [the narcissistic two-headed galactic president] to say goodbye.” Maggs says he has done his best to interpret Adams’ original intentions, but still worries about what the master would have made of it all. “If there is an afterlife,” he says, “I expect him to be waiting for me with a cricket bat.” In a break from recording, I talk to Jones and McGivern, forever associated with the befuddled, pyjama-wearing Arthur Dent and his super-smooth sidekick Ford Prefect. Now in their mid-60s, they were both members of Cambridge Footlights, where they first encountered Adams. Jones says Adams wrote Arthur with him in mind, while McGivern reckons he inspired Ford Prefect. “My father read the first book and when he read the description of Ford, he said to me, ‘That’s you at the age of 21’ – which is slightly concerning. The role always felt comfortable.” The pair say they have never worried about being defined by the roles. “It’s been a useful calling card,” says McGivern. Jones laughs at the prospect of a headline reading “Arthur Dent dies” over the story of his own demise. “If I drop dead in the street,” adds McGivern, “and anybody bothered to write ‘Hitchhiker’s man dies’, that would be OK. We’re jobbing actors. In any case, it’s not that terrible trap of being in a soap.” Mark Wing-Davey has played Zaphod from the beginning. He recalls being at a dinner party when the first episode aired. His host and fellow guests were not exactly blown away by what they heard. “After about 10 minutes, I realised it wasn’t for them,” he says. “It was hard to predict what it would become.” Wing-Davey starred in the BBC’s 1981 TV adaptation, but has doubts about whether it really worked. “It felt very rushed,” he says, “and it didn’t feel as if there was quite as much enthusiasm to push the boundaries. Douglas himself was an enthusiast: he was curious about computers, nature, the world – and that enquiring mind was part of what made it so interesting, together with his quirky observations.” Could there be a 50th anniversary? Wing-Davey says “never say never”, but the likelihood is that this is the end of an extraordinary intergalactic voyage. Davies thinks it will now be up to future generations to reinterpret Adams’ books in the way that classic creations such as Sherlock Holmes and Tarzan have been rebooted. “I think Hitchhiker’s has now earned its place,” he says, “and that when we’re all long gone there’ll be other people making versions of it. Arthur Dent and Ford Prefect will be played by actors as yet unborn. That’s where Hitchhiker’s is going – off into the future without us.” The 40th-anniversary series starts on BBC Radio 4 on 8 March."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"books/2018/mar/04/book-clinic-modern-classics-for-preteens-london-eye-mystery-siobhan-dowd-emily-gravett-imaginary","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-04T13:30:02Z","webTitle":"Book clinic: what modern classics would you recommend for preteens?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/mar/04/book-clinic-modern-classics-for-preteens-london-eye-mystery-siobhan-dowd-emily-gravett-imaginary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/mar/04/book-clinic-modern-classics-for-preteens-london-eye-mystery-siobhan-dowd-emily-gravett-imaginary","fields":{"headline":"Book clinic: what modern classics would you recommend for preteens?","bodyText":"Q: One of my superiors wants me to start a book club with the 10 children, aged 11-13, in years 7 and 8 who have the highest reading ages.

(This is kind of a moot question because there isn’t any money to buy books, but what the hell…) English teacher, 24, Nottinghamshire A: Phil Earle, award-winning children and young adults author A book doesn’t need to be penned a hundred years ago to be a classic, and there are many wonderful, enduring novels written in the past two decades that will fuel young imaginations. The London Eye Mystery by Siobhan Dowd is a great place to start. If Mark Haddon channelled his inner Agatha Christie, it would look something like this, as a young sleuth hunts for his cousin – who gets on the Eye, but never steps off. I also adore AF Harrold and Emily Gravett’s The Imaginary. Reminiscent of Neil Gaiman at his very best, this tale of imaginary friends is by turns funny, touching and terrifying. The perfect marriage of words and pictures. The second world war has been a springboard for many a tale of derring-do, and one of the finest is Sandi Toksvig’s Hitler’s Canary. I can’t recommend this story of Nazi-occupied Denmark enough: it has terrific warmth and is brilliantly accessible, despite its period setting. Finally, not one book, but three. Brock, Rook and Pike are written by Anthony McGowan and published by Barrington Stoke, who specialise in books for people with dyslexia and reluctant readers. Imagine Barry Hines resetting Of Mice and Men in the north of England and you’ll have a sense of the tone. Never have three sparsely written novellas packed such an emotional punch. Not a word is wasted and, for me, they are the absolute definition of the word “classic”.

Mark Rowley, the assistant commissioner at the Metropolitan police, drew parallels between far-right groups and figures and the Islamist extremists they claim to despise in the annual Colin Cramphorn memorial lecture in central London. Speaking two weeks before his 31-year career in policing comes to a close, Rowley revealed four extreme rightwing-inspired plots were prevented last year. In a conference with journalists before the speech, Rowley said the far-right terror threat was “significant and concerning” and the public should be “gravely concerned” by the existence of National Action, the white supremacist, neo-nazi group banned under terror legislation. “The rightwing threat was not previously organised. Every now and then there’s been an individual motivated by that rhetoric who has committed a terrorist act but we’ve not had an organised rightwing threat like we do now,” he said. He said a third of referrals to the government’s Prevent strategy, aimed at reducing radicalisation in communities, are now individuals engaged with far-right terrorism. In his speech, Rowley draws many comparisons between Islamist and far-right groups and figures, such as Isis and Anjem Choudary in the former, and National Action and former EDL leader Tommy Robinson in the latter. “Ironically, while Islamist and extreme rightwing ideologies may appear to be at opposing ends of the argument it is evident that they both have a great deal in common,” he said. Rowley said both groups have a common goal of “increasing tensions and divisions in communities”. He said both reach into communities through sophisticated propaganda, as well as create intolerance and isolation by exploiting grievances. He added both also reinforce a sense of isolation by generating distrust of the state and offer “warped parallel alternatives” that undermine values of tolerance and diversity. Rowley said he had repeatedly seen how extremism – both far-right and Islamist – creates or exploits vulnerable people. He gave the example of the Finsbury Park mosque attacker, Darren Osborne, jailed for life earlier this month, who grew to hate Muslims “largely due to his consumption of large amounts of online far-right material, including statements from former EDL leader Tommy Robinson, Britain First and others”. He then cited the example of Choudary, the convicted Islamist extremist linked with a number of banned groups and terror attacks, including the murder of the soldier Lee Rigby in London. “While Choudary became the de facto spokesperson for Islamism in the UK, mouthpieces from the far-right wing such as Tommy Robinson also attracted notoriety and attention,” he said. “Robinson also became a regular fixture in our media, giving him the platform to attack the whole religion of Islam by conflating acts of terrorism with the faith, often citing spurious claims, which inevitably stirred up tensions. Such figures represented no more than the extreme margins of the communities they claim to speak for yet they have been given prominence and a platform to espouse their dangerous disinformation and propaganda. Each side feeds into each other’s extremist rhetoric with the common goal of increasing tensions and divisions in communities.” Painting a stark picture of the scale of the challenge facing police and MI5, he said there were more than 600 investigations encompassing Islamist, extreme rightwing and other motivations comprising more than 3,000 subjects of interest and a legacy of more than 20,000 individuals who featured in past terrorism investigations. Rowley has been the most senior officer in counter-terrorism since June 2014. In the last year alone he has overseen the response to five terrorist attacks in the UK, including the atrocities on Westminster Bridge, at London Bridge, Borough Market, Finsbury Park mosque and Parsons Green tube station, and in the Manchester arena. The Guardian revealed earlier this month that a review had been launched into the extreme right by the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre. It is the first assessment of the entire landscape of the threat the extreme right poses to national security by JTAC, an elite Whitehall counter-terrorism unit, which has previously concentrated on jihadist and Irish violent extremism."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/feb/27/diabetes-diagnoses-have-more-than-doubled-in-20-years-uk-analysis-suggests","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-27T00:01:29Z","webTitle":"Diabetes diagnoses have more than doubled in 20 years, UK analysis suggests","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/feb/27/diabetes-diagnoses-have-more-than-doubled-in-20-years-uk-analysis-suggests","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/feb/27/diabetes-diagnoses-have-more-than-doubled-in-20-years-uk-analysis-suggests","fields":{"headline":"Diabetes diagnoses have more than doubled in 20 years, UK analysis suggests","bodyText":"The number of adults and older teens with diabetes in the UK has more than doubled over the past 20 years, with 3.7 million people aged 17 or older now known to be living with the disease, campaigners say. A new analysis, compiled by the charity Diabetes UK, appears to show that the number of diagnoses has shot up since 1998, at which point it is estimated 1.8 million over 16s were diagnosed with diabetes. The analysis does not break down figures into the two main forms of diabetes, type 1 and type 2. But Nikki Joule, policy manager at Diabetes UK, said that other research had shown diagnoses of both have increased, but the rise has been greater for type 2. “[The] rise in obesity has driven that largely over recent years,” she said. While both types of diabetes are linked to genetics, type 1 diabetes is not associated with weight but is an autoimmune condition where insulin is not produced. It normally begins in childhood and accounts for about 10% of diabetes cases. Type 2 diabetes – where little insulin is produced, or insulin does not trigger an uptake of glucose by the body’s cells – is linked to obesity, and typically starts later in life, with about 60% of cases thought to be preventable. Both types bring with them the risk of complications such as blindness, stroke, cardiovascular disease, kidney failure and amputations. The new figures have been drawn from a number of datasets that have been analysed to provide national estimates of diabetes diagnoses in those aged 17 or over. The findings show that in England alone almost 6.7% of the population have been diagnosed with diabetes, with more than 3.1 million people living with the condition. But there are large variations around the country. Bradford, Harrow, and Sandwell and West Birmingham show the highest prevalences at 10.43%, 9.40% and 9.14% of the population respectively, while Richmond has a prevalence of only 3.63%, and Camden and central London just over 4%. Diabetes UK says that the number of people with diabetes is likely to be even higher than the latest data suggests, with estimates indicating almost a million people in the UK have undiagnosed type 2 diabetes. Further analysis by the team based on figures relating to obesity and waist circumference also reveals that there are about 12.3 million people in the UK at risk of type 2 diabetes but who do not yet have the condition. Joule said that greater efforts are needed to help people make healthy choices to lower their risk of type 2 diabetes. “We welcome the levy on sugary drinks that is coming in in April and the work Public Health England are doing, working with industry to reduce the sugar content of food and drinks – particularly those consumed by children – but we think that it needs to go much further,” said Joule, adding that Diabetes UK is among those calling for better labelling of food, restrictions on supermarket promotions of unhealthy products and a 9pm watershed for junk food advertisements on TV. But Prof Andrew Hattersley of University of Exeter Medical School said that the rise in diagnoses was largely down to individuals living longer, and better care of those with the disease – including in managing blood pressure and cholesterol. “This data is actually good news,” he said. “The increase in numbers reflects improved treatment of patients more than it reflects increasing obesity,” Hattersley added, noting the figures highlight the need for increasing provision of good care for people with the condition. Naveed Sattar, professor of metabolic medicine at the University of Glasgow also stressed that a number of trends were at play. “The good aspect is as life expectancy goes up, more people are able to develop diabetes in later life, when it is less of a concern, and equally we are keeping people alive with diabetes for longer due to better care,” he said. “However, this does create more work as more people are living with diabetes complications so [there is] more suffering. The other bad aspect is more younger people under the age of 40 are developing diabetes due to rising obesity levels, and it is here we need to be really concerned.” Sattar added that younger onset type 2 diabetes is far more harmful to the body and substantially increases chances of a premature death. “It is also much harder to manage, and anything the government can do to lessen the obesogenic environment will have direct benefits to slowing this worrying trend,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/mar/17/quiz-white-tiger-polar-bear-hare-leopard-mythical-sea-bear-sasquatch","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-17T06:59:15Z","webTitle":"What links white tiger; hare, polar bear and leopard; mythical sea bear and sasquatch?

Sly and the Family Stone, or more Sly, captured my imagination from the moment it was forced out of a giant pair of Tannoy speakers placed in our front living room. He was a handsome opportunist hippy who manipulated the times, but definitely changed the course of them. The music is soulful, subversive and sleazy, but beautifully arranged and played. It’s a theme park of unrelated ideas made logical by Sly’s magnificence. I learned so much about making the unlikely into something rational. Nadia Rose I always appreciated how vulnerable Amy Winehouse was, her unparalleled songwriting and of course her soothing, sultry voice. As unique as she was, she was incredibly relatable, and I love that about her. Paloma Faith Vocally, I would say Etta James. There is something subtle about being so vulnerable and yet powerful at the same time; I feel most women can relate. She was a powerhouse with the ability to turn herself inside out for all the public to hear. That takes a special kind of someone. Zola Jesus Maria Callas has been an enormous inspiration to me since I was very young. The passion and devotion that she gave to her music was almost spiritual. Watching her sing you could sense how much she lived and breathed her art. It was impossible to separate the woman from her conviction of character on stage – for better or for worse. She did not act or perform, she conjured. Throughout tough times as an artist I look to her as a reminder of persistence, and to focus on the purity and discipline of my craft. Carl Craig The jazz drummer Francisco Mora Catlett, whom I met around the time I was working on my album Landcruising. He was really interested in electronic music even though his experience was with jazz, I think it was because of his days playing in Sun Ra Arkestra. He saw the parallels between electronic music and elements of what Herbie Hancock was doing in synthesis and jazz. He gave me a tape of late-60s and 70s Miles Davis music and really turned me on to what he was doing, too. Miles’s musical ideas were more techno-minded than jazz-minded; at least that’s what I was hearing. Francisco became part of my Innerzone Orchestra and was always the wise man of the tour, keeping me enlightened and entertained. Justin Young, the Vaccines I know he didn’t write most of his biggest and best-loved songs but, to me, Elvis Presley was the complete artist. His voice, his song choice, his energy and attitude, his perfect hair and clothes: it felt like he’d been sent from another planet. It was incomprehensible to me that this was a man who made mistakes, or who felt sadness or loneliness. I recently visited his childhood home in Tupelo, Mississippi and it was in stark contrast to the life I’d imagined. To a child, he seemed invincible – and he made me feel it too. To watch Elvis and to listen to his songs was pure escapism and aspiration. Blue Suede Shoes was my first love. From as early as I can remember, I knew that if I could channel some of that raw power I saw in him, life would be better for it. I guess, like all of us, he was flawed as a man, but he was the perfect entertainer. Ghetts My biggest musical influence is James Brown: the hardest working man in showbusiness, with supreme confidence and style – a stage show legend. Jessie Ware Sade is the epitome of effortless cool and beauty. My ultimate goddess, she oozes soul and sensuality, and hits you with just the right amount of heartache. Every word she says commands my attention and I feel as if we are drawn into her world rather than her trying to fit in with ours. She taught me about the art of “less is more” when it comes to singing; she is the queen of bittersweetness. Her music is timeless: you hear people playing Paradise in clubs now and it still sounds incredible. I have learned a lot from the quiet confidence in her music and there is still a mystique around her which nowadays seems impossible for an artist to have. Mabel Lauryn Hill is definitely my biggest influence. I really related to her, growing up, because as an artist she always wears her heart on her sleeve. Putting yourself out there the way she has is terrifying, but so important, and I want to do the same. I love how on her MTV Unplugged record she embraced the imperfections ... on one track she cries and on another she forgets some of the lyrics but she handles everything beautifully and they’re actually my favourite bits of the record. She taught me that showing your vulnerability is sometimes your greatest strength. Nina Kraviz There was never a single idol in my life. I grew up with the penetrating voice of Robert Plant, Jimi Hendrix’s virtuoso guitar, the heart-rending love songs of Billie Holiday and the absolute simplicity of Tarkovsky. Plus the proto-electronic psychedelia of Pink Floyd, and the painfully strained narration of Vladimir Vysotsky. But nothing is embedded in my childhood memory as strongly as the unstoppable effervescence of Tina Turner, which she carried out on a pair of the strongest and most amazing legs in pop music. At times, it seems as if they are performing on their own. Corey Taylor, Slipknot I know he will shrug this off, but my biggest influence to this day is still Mike Patton [of Faith no More]. He is my hero: the best singer in the game, and most creative man on the planet. Absolutely fearless in his approach to art and music, he isn’t afraid to say exactly what he thinks. Plus he’s cool as shit. Liam Fray, the Courteeners When Julian Casablancas came along in the summer of 2001, he and the Strokes just blew my mind. Oasis had opened my eyes and ears in the late 90s and then, just a few years later, the coolest-looking fucker ever arrived from New York with possibly the greatest album ever. That was it. Smart, sharp and infectious. I was hooked. He was, and still is, “the man”. He’s a genius who just doesn’t give a fuck, or damn, about what anyone thinks of him. He just keeps on creating. If there was ever a man who’s never typed his own name into a search engine, Julian is he. Kaitlyn Aurelia Smith Moondog, the avant-garde jazz composer, has taught me to follow whatever my natural rhythm is, and not be bound by 4/4 time. He has also taught me to love the saxophone! I love the way he composes for it: there are no rules, you create your own language. Ellie Rowsell, Wolf Alice A great musical influence on me growing up was Patrick Wolf. He sounded as if he’d been spat out of a forest on the edge of the world and straight into a bedroom in the depths of south London. I felt cool as I listened to the heavy, industrial, electronic beats of Tristan and I felt liberated as I sang along to the sugary melodies of Bluebells. As much an enchanted creature as he was a lonely teenage boy, Patrick taught me that magic wasn’t just found in fairytales, and that fairytales weren’t just for children. Most importantly, though, he taught me that I didn’t need to conform, both in music and in life."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2018/feb/26/emmanuel-macron-takes-on-french-unions-to-cut-rail-workers-rights","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-26T16:59:26Z","webTitle":"Emmanuel Macron takes on French unions to cut rail workers’ rights","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/26/emmanuel-macron-takes-on-french-unions-to-cut-rail-workers-rights","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/feb/26/emmanuel-macron-takes-on-french-unions-to-cut-rail-workers-rights","fields":{"headline":"Emmanuel Macron takes on unions to cut rail workers’ rights","bodyText":"Emmanuel Macron is to push through sweeping reforms to France’s vast state rail system and cut rail workers’ special employment rights – tackling one of France’s riskiest political issues. Any question of overhauling the SNCF state railway company has always proved controversial, with the train network grinding to a virtual halt for weeks when trade unions opposed changes to rail staff’s benefits in 1995. But the French prime minister, Édouard Philippe, said that the government would quickly push through changes by special executive decree without a vote in parliament if necessary. Trade unions are discussing possible strikes on 12 March and will join bigger public sector strikes on 22 March. Unlike Britain, where rail services were privatised in the 1990s, the SNCF remains state-run and is seen as a national treasure. But, although the train network has been rated among the best in Europe in terms of speed, quality and price, urban commuters and regional passengers increasingly complain of overcrowding, inefficiency, delays and problems. The main issue for Macron is that the French state rail operator is struggling under debts of €46.6bn (£41bn) – bigger than those of a small country such as Iceland or Croatia, but still in line with the large debt of rail networks in places such as Britain, where the track operator, Network Rail, is facing its own financial woes. The prime minister said France’s rail situation was alarming and untenable. “Whether or not they take the train, the French are paying more and more for a public service that works less and less well.” Unions had expressed fears of privatisation after an advisory report 10 days ago suggested turning SNCF into an autonomous company backed by public funds. Philippe insisted on Monday that privatisation was not on the cards. He said the SNCF would remain state-owned: it was part of French people’s heritage and “will stay that way”. However he was firm on cutting rail workers’ special employment status. Many French rail workers have jobs for life and, in some cases, the right to retire in their 50s – a decade earlier than other public workers. Under government plans, these historical privileges would not be applied to new rail staff. Philippe said France’s national railway company had to become more efficient before local and national passenger services open up to competition in coming years under European Union rules. But trade unions raged at the possible use of executive orders to force through changes – as used for Macron’s labour reforms last year. Jean-Claude Mailly, the head of the Force Ouvrière union, warned that using decrees would “pour oil on the fire”. The government said the reform process would begin with a parliamentary debate in mid-March but in the event of wide opposition the assembly would not have a final vote. The prime minister has said he would not close small local train lines, said to cost almost €2bn for only 2% of national passengers. This issue could now fall to regional authorities to decide."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/feb/27/antidepressants-pills-children","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-27T09:00:03Z","webTitle":"Antidepressants work, but for children there's a better way | Mike Shooter","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/27/antidepressants-pills-children","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/27/antidepressants-pills-children","fields":{"headline":"Antidepressants work, but for children there's a better way","bodyText":"Sian was just 14, brought by her misery to the edge of self-harm, when I met her in a cafe at the top end of one of the old mining valleys. Neutral ground. She told me about her rugby-playing older brother and her bright little sister who had lots of pets and wanted to be a vet. She felt that her parents doted on them and that there could be no room in anyone’s heart for her. She told me about her only friend, who had been killed in a road accident just as they went up to big school. About the recent death of her grandmother, who had been the only person she could confide in. And about the GP who had said she was depressed and given her a course of pills. I thought about Sian again this week. The newspaper headlines across the world were welcoming a major study that confirmed the value of antidepressant medication in the treatment of depression in adults. And so did I. Depression was validated at long last as an illness every bit as serious as physical conditions, that could cause untold human suffering and economic devastation, but could be helped with a course of antidepressant pills. First things first, I heartily agree with what that survey was saying about adult treatment. After all, I have a recurrent depression myself that has needed frequent treatment over the years. I talked about it openly when I was president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists and have continued to do so from the public platform, in the media, and to anyone who will listen. I do this in the hope that it will help to dispel the stigma that surrounds mental illness and prevents people from seeking therapy until it is too late. The diagnosis made sense of what I was going through. It wasn’t my fault. And I was grateful for the medication. Pills do help adults and we shouldn’t be afraid of saying so. And hidden below all the headlines about antidepressant medication was the finding that talking therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) may be just as effective on their own for a lot of people and a vital help in combination with pills for many others – including me. But a warning bell. The situation often requires more than a course of pills and CBT. What helped me, in addition, was the trusting relationship that I found with a psychiatrist who gave me the time, the continuity and the space to explore my feelings about the illness and its origins in the relationships buried deep in my childhood. And thereby lies my worry as a child psychiatrist, about how the public and professionals might sell this survey short. Adult mental illnesses such as depression can be treated when they occur, but most of them have their roots in childhood and there will be many opportunities to intervene in children’s lives to stop it happening – if only we care to look. The vast majority of young people that I saw had not yet fulfilled a formal diagnosis, did not need a pill for their unhappiness, but their lives were in a mess. Their development had been disrupted by physical illnesses, their trust destroyed by abuse, their faith in the world undermined by death, divorce and natural calamities, and their self-confidence stressed to breaking point by social and academic pressures. Their parents were desperate to help, had been rebuffed or didn’t know what to do. My book, Growing Pains, is a collection of their stories, just like that of Sian. It is an account of the ways in which I gave them the space to confide in me, perhaps for the very first time, the feelings they had tried so hard to conceal. Feelings that they had taken out on themselves or on those around them. And my work with them, individually and with their parents and carers, helped them to re-tell their story towards a happier ending. Work to prevent the old story from pervading their lives and being passed on to their own children in turn, in a never-ending cycle of harm. It is an affirmation of the healing power of stories and how unhappiness can be helped before it develops into something worse. Yes, of course, I welcome the messages that adults should take from this survey. But as a child psychiatrist I hope that the pressures on managers, doctors and parents to seek concrete results that can easily be measured will not result in children being burdened with diagnostic formulations and medical treatment before their time, or being diverted into social care because they don’t fit psychiatric categories. Understandable perhaps, but it would miss the chance. By not offering help in their early years, we run the risk that young people’s unhappiness may crystallise into an adult disorder for which pills may be part of the answer; but we can head most of it off at the pass. We need to get out from the clinic desk and into the community to see children and young people wherever they are, whatever distress they are struggling with, and for as long as it takes to help. We must hold their pain in the intimacy of the relationship that they have with us, no matter how difficult that may be for us on the end of it. I saw Sian in that cafe every few days for a while. We talked about how she felt about life and how she might begin to love herself as much as she wanted others to love her too. As her self-confidence grew, we agreed to talk with her parents and siblings at home and discovered, to her surprise, that they were just as worried about how she might feel about them. They grieved together about the death of her grandmother, sharing the feelings that had been locked away in Sian. And they were brought closer in their loss. I sympathise with managers who have to record such help in figures. What I did with Sian and other children in my book would not have sat easily in the figures for through-put of patients, formal diagnoses, treatment and outcome measures. But I do know that Sian had begun to find her true identity, and that her relationships were changed forever. Antidepressants are a vital help for adults who have sunk into a depressive illness, just as I did. Sian was thoroughly miserable but she was not yet formally depressed. What she needed was space to tell her story and someone she could trust to share it with. • Dr Mike Shooter is former president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists and author of Growing Pains: Making Sense of Childhood, A Psychiatrist’s Story In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123.

Not for a moment did he reckon it would become so epic in length, in scale, in consequences. He just thought his speck of a town should run its own electricity supply. A modest proposal, but in the Germany of 2003 it was highly unusual. Gerhard Schröder was still chancellor and, although a social democrat, was pushing through more privatisations of public assets than any other leader in German history. This was in a Europe that had learned from Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan to stop worrying and start loving the private sector. Now here, swimming against history’s current, was one orderly, slightly anxious engineer. On Rühl’s side were evidence, arguments and expertise. What he lacked was his multinational opponent’s money and firepower. The mismatch produced a battle that lasted years, that set off ripples around Germany and whose lessons should be pondered by anyone who wonders whether Britain could improve how it runs its electricity and gas, its water, its train services. And it kicked off in Wolfhagen, a somnolent town whose biggest previous claim to fame was that one of the Brothers Grimm had stayed in one of its half-timbered buildings. Fifteen years ago, Wolfhagen was like thousands of other German towns and cities in leasing its electrical grid for its 14,000 residents to one of the world’s largest energy companies, E.ON. But two things made this place different. First, it still had a Stadtwerke, or municipally owned electricity supplier. Second, it had Rühl, who’d only recently become the Stadtwerke’s boss. Rühl spotted that E.ON’s 20-year licence was approaching its expiry. Rather than just sign again on the dotted line, he thought Wolfhagen ought to reclaim the grid for itself – and pressed the case repeatedly upon the local council for months. For all the legal and financial advice he’d garnered, Rühl was not at all sure he’d persuade the politicians. “Lots of people were saying something totally different.” Yet, “I knew it was legal and correct, and morally right.” Perhaps it was his passion that enthused councillors, but “everyone said, ‘Well if it’s good for Wolfhagen, it’s good for us. Let’s do it.’” Now this small-town hick had to tell one of the giants of the energy world that the council no longer needed their services. How did E.ON take it? “Well … ” He remembers a scrap of English understatement: “They were not amused.” The Germans have a name for what Rühl was about to do: Rekommunalisierung. One of those satisfyingly ungainly bits of Deutsch, it denotes a town or city reclaiming ownership of its public utilities. The term was partly spread by Wolfhagen’s epic fight for control over its power supply. The British have their own word: lunacy. No matter how bad our privatised utilities get, any politician who suggests taking them back into public ownership may as well count the hairs on their palms. Rail franchises can collapse in a single afternoon. Energy giants (including E.ON) face accusations of overcharging the public. Water companies can deny the taxman his dues and the public their investment, while shovelling billions into the pockets of shareholders. For decades, Britons have paid through the nose for someone else – often based thousands of miles offshore – to rip them off. Now a clear majority of voters, even true-blue Tories, want public ownership of basic utilities. Yet to call for that very thing, as Labour’s Jeremy Corbyn does today, is to face the molten wrath of the rightwing press, the trade lobbyists and the Conservative party. To resist the ideological extreme that the private sector must always run our public services is to be denounced as an extremist ideologue. Rühl faced his own denunciations from E.ON. “They said we couldn’t do it. That the lights would go out. They said we were uneconomical … either the town would have to subsidise energy or residents would have to pay more.” All “bullshit”, he says. Yet the fight brought sleepless nights and days besieged by worry that he wasn’t up to the job. He realised he was attacking E.ON’s business model. “For them it was like, ‘If [Wolfhagen] want their grid back then maybe everyone does.’ I was part of the breaking of the dam. So they had to give it their all.” And the amount they wanted to be compensated for the grid was far higher than the town’s starting bid. Approached for comment on these and other issues, E.ON said: “Wolfhagen was one of the first cases of remunicipalisation in Germany. Many commercial, technical and legal questions were not clarified. That’s why both sides negotiated for so long.” The multinational went back and forth with Rühl for three years, before compromise was reached in 2006. E.ON’s payoff was cobbled together by loans for local banks. His town had won control of its own grid. One epic battle had ended, but many more were to follow, across Germany. A two-hour train ride from Wolfhagen lies Frankfurt, where I met the closest thing Germany has to a professor of privatisation studies. Tim Engartner can list the family silver flogged by his country – the airline Lufthansa, Deutsche Post, Deutsche Telekom. But, crucially, unlike their Westminster counterparts, German politicians don’t privatise because they believe it will lead to better services. They mainly want the euros. “Selling public assets gives them a huge windfall to spend on roads or social projects.” This lack of dogmatism has two major consequences. First, it gives half a chance to any Martin Rühl who can show that public control will yield even more euros for those essential works. Second, when a privatisation leads to worse services or higher prices, politicians can be pressured into reversing it. In the east German city of Potsdam, the privatisation of water pushed charges up by a third within two years – so it was cancelled. City after city has taken back bin collection in-house. And then there’s energy. In 2005, Wolfhagen was into the final straight of taking its grid into public hands. Since then 284 municipalities, including the second-biggest city ofHamburg, have followed suit. Such cases don’t get much of a showing in the British press. The pundits and policy wonks who equate public ownership with Red Robbo, Bakelite phones and stale British Rail sandwiches never mention that across Europe there have been 567 instances of public services being taken into public ownership since the year 2000. Everything from care homes for the elderly to bus companies is now run by continental towns and cities. In the 1870s, Birmingham was the birthplace of municipal socialism: the city’s then-mayor, Joseph Chamberlain, bought the gas and waterworks and ran them for a public profit. Nearly 150 years later, Europe is pioneering a new form of municipal socialism, while Theresa May’s ministers try the most motley methods to keep the failed East Coast mainline out of the public sector. Even so, Wolfhagen stands out. It’s where the Japanese and South Koreans fly in just to take lessons. Visit the Stadtwerke today and Rühl’s successor, Alexander Rohrssen, will list its achievements. A profit every year, which has not only paid off the bank loans but funds the town’s kindergartens. Generally cheaper electricity than most competitors, including E.ON. The number of staff has almost doubled and this still-small enterprise has won national prizes for its innovation on reducing energy use. But to see the real difference made by public ownership you need to head into the middle of the town, to a small cinema that opened in 1948. Kai Mellinghoff is the third generation of his family to run it. He barely remembers the battle with E.ON: “It was in the paper, but people weren’t moved by it.” A few months afterwards, however, Rühl came to him with a proposal. He wanted to hire the cinema to screen environmental films. It was 2006, the year of Al Gore’s An Inconvenient Truth. Tickets were either free or cheap, all 90 of the red plush seats were filled. This was an event. After the film, there might be a speaker on climate change or electric cars, and the audience would be invited on to Mellinghoff’s terrace. He shows me its postcard view of the timber rooftops of his town and the woods beyond. Out here, the townspeople would clutch glasses of wine and discuss the film, the environment and what part they could play in preserving it. Rühl wanted the now-public Stadtwerke to go 100% renewable by 2015; these evenings were his way of spreading the idea. Renewables meant a forest of solar panels, and giant wind turbines on the mountain that overlooks Wolfhagen. The prospect split the town in two: opponents of the wind farm produced mock-up posters of turbines looming out of a napalmed forest and leering down at locals. The Ancient Greeks would have known what to call Mellinghoff’s terrace. It was an agora, a place for citizens to discuss politics. For all its fury, the debate turned the Stadtwerke from a company under new management to an asset in which everyone had a stake. That bond got closer after Wolfhagen had adopted the renewables pledge. To raise the millions needed to build the wind farm, the town sold a quarter of the energy firm’s shares to locals in a citizens’ co-op. The co-op has seats on the board of the company, giving residents a direct say over how their utility is managed. Even after all the years of fighting, I ask, would Rühl recommend Britons do the same with their utilities? He ponders all the failures of British privatisation – with a special, sad mention of “your rail system”. (Every German I meet uses the same regretful tone about British trains, as if discussing a child with behavioural problems.) Then he says something that sounds uncannily resonant to anyone in Brexit Britain. “Germans say we can’t make decisions because everything is decided in Brussels or by big companies. If you can improve your standard of living and make your own choices, that has to be good.” One snowy afternoon, Iris Degenhardt-Meister walks me up the mountain to see the wind turbines up close. Over the couple of kilometres uphill, she laughs while rehearsing the charged town debates of a decade ago, as if remembering university pranks. A civil servant, she’s also a co-op director. The shares give her a decent dividend, albeit capped by a Gierbremse, or greed brake. As for the turbines: “We love them!” She can identify each one. That way lies eins, over there is vier. I ask a question that would be absurd in privatised Britain: does she feel they belong to her? “Yes!” A pause to consider the size of the co-op’s stake. “After all, we own a quarter of them.” Additional reporting by Josie Le Blond • Aditya Chakrabortty is a Guardian columnist.

We’ll be hoping the book is widely available, reasonably well known and that it will keep us variously intrigued, impressed, amazed and entertained for a month. That shouldn’t be too hard. You could do worse than look at the past winners of the Man Booker International – or, if you’re feeling lucky, try to anticipate a book that will appear on the 2018 longlist. But you could do even better. The possibilities aren’t (strictly speaking) infinite, but this month’s remit takes in everything from the Epic of Gilgamesh to the latest releases from pioneering translated fiction publishers such as And Other Stories and Peirene Press. So: all the classics, and all of French, German, Portuguese, Hindi, Sanskrit, Persian or Russian literature … You get the idea. You can go for massive, immortal classics such as The Aeneid, The Ramayana, Don Quixote and Thomas Mann’s Magic Mountain – or you can go for a slice of modern life from Dorthe Nors, Xiaolu Guo, Orhan Pamuk and Haruki Murakami. Whatever you decide to nominate, all you have to do is name your choice in the comments below. If you can give a good reason why you’ve chosen that book or books, so much the better.

On Last Week Tonight, the comic reviewed the past week’s events and examined how the idea seemed to percolate in Trump’s head. Oliver looked back on Trump’s appearance to discuss the shooting with survivors and the notes that he brought with him. The final point read “I hear you” which led Oliver to say that it’s “what you might write down if you were a robot pretending to be a person pretending to be a robot pretending to be a person”. Trump had already raised his idea to arm teachers with the press but he also decided to share it with Parkland students and school staff, asking for them to raise their hands for approval. The reaction wasn’t one of support. “That is Donald Trump in a nutshell: proposing a terrible idea in a tone deaf way then refusing to acknowledge he just lost the popular vote,” he said. Oliver continued: “There are clearly multiple issues with the idea of arming teachers from the fact that it’s not their job to the fact that there was an armed deputy in Parkland and that didn’t deter or stop the shooter.” He called the logistics of the plan “pretty daunting” and given that it would lead to over 700,000 guns in schools, he was unsurprised that the NRA was in full support. He joked that their solution to all problems tend to involve similar ideas. “They probably deal with climate change by pointing a glock at the ocean and daring that motherfucker to rise,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2018/mar/01/bon-iver-frank-ocean-and-shania-twain-here-are-the-most-influential-artists-in-music-today","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-01T18:17:55Z","webTitle":"Bon Iver, Frank Ocean and … Shania Twain?

Here are the most influential artists in music today","bodyText":"Bon Iver In 2006, Justin Vernon headed to a remote Wisconsin cabin – presumably in a flannel shirt – and recorded his album For Emma, Forever Ago. With an anniversary edition out now and Vernon installed in an eight-night London concert residency, it is an apt time to take stock of its influence: a beautiful album that has become the benchmark for rootsy millennial heartache. Some of its influence is obvious: Skinny Love, covered by Birdy then countless contestants on X Factor and American Idol; the subsequent creative partnership between Vernon and Kanye West. But more broadly, the rural disconnection of its creation bestowed the album with a mythic authenticity: along with craft beer, full beards and Field Notes notebooks, it became a fetish object for the hopelessly interconnected urbanite, showing a world where emotional turmoil was wound into the land itself. However unwittingly, For Emma became the ur-text for the artists you find on Spotify playlists called things like Boho + Chil and License to Chill: soulful white blokes such as James Vincent McMorrow, Ben Howard, Lord Huron and Kaleo. He continues to resonate – memesmiths joked “listens to Bon Iver once” after Justin Timberlake announced his Man of the Woods album, even though Vernon has since switched up his aesthetic from the wooden cabin to the biomorphic pod of his newer electronic work. For Emma might feel for ever ago to Vernon, but it still remains in the cultural here and now. BB-T Shania Twain You can assess influence by listening to beats in clubs, or bands in bars, but that is vanity, really. The true extent of influence is not in how a particular sound touches the outer margins of music, acclaimed by the congnoscenti, but in how deep it penetrates the most popular music. That is why the Beatles are the most influential group ever, and why Shania Twain is a colossally important figure in modern music. Country music purists bemoan the current state of the genre, which they lament for having little to do with Hank Williams. But the stuff that sells copies and fills stadiums – even if doesn’t sound much like Shania, one of those artists who has crossed over to first-name status – owes her a colossal debt. Today’s biggest country star Luke Bryan may not even write about the same things as her, yet Shania opened the door for country to be genetically spliced with whatever else was popular. In company with her then husband, producer and songwriting partner Robert John “Mutt” Lange – who had helped AC/DC and Def Leppard to international superstardom – Shania decountrified country on the albums Come on Over and Up!, putting out different versions for different markets. She wanted her music bought not just by country fans, but also pop fans. And you hear those lessons not just in bro country, but in Carrie Underwood, Kelsea Ballerini and in the biggest pop star of the modern age, Taylor Swift. Shania Twain may not be the power she once was, but she is still everywhere. That’s influence. MH Frank Ocean It is a sign of the scale of Frank Ocean’s influence that even former rockabilly revivalist Jack Peñate has ripped him off, when he recently announced his return with a mysterious, 19-minute-long mix and arthouse footage of him toiling away in a garage. It was a retelling of Ocean’s Endless, a video project and amuse bouche prior to the release of Blonde. For a generation of artists, that album’s melodic scope and complexity declared that music was no longer in a nostalgia loop. Since he emerged in 2011, Ocean’s experimental and psychedelic take on R&amp;B, jazz, soul and rap has paved the way for the likes of Khalid, Kevin Abstract, Berhana, Daniel Caesar, Bryson Tiller, Childish Gambino, Hare Squead, SZA, Noname and Jamila Woods. But it has always been reductive to suggest that he exists within these genres. His influence on indie musicians – most recently Rex Orange County, Jamie Isaacs or, well, Jack Peñate – has been huge. You get the feeling that for Generation Z, he has become more of an artistic deity than Alex Turner will ever be. Even the biggest stars have not gone untouched by Ocean’s influence. His uncompromising attitude – not submitting his music to the Grammys, releasing his music without the support of a major label – has readjusted the minds of Drake and Kanye, who have followed suit, while Rihanna’s fuzzy soul jam James Joint could have been lifted from Channel Orange. Meanwhile, Beyoncé, for whom Ocean wrote I Miss You in 2012, has fully embraced his off-kilter melancholy mood. Rather than intimidating listeners, he has forced everyone to catch up with him. HG Nils Frahm If we learned anything from last year’s disputed story about Spotify filling their playlists with tracks by “fake” artists – musicians and producers allegedly paid a flat fee by the streaming service to make music to order – it was that umpteen people around the world listen to music that sounds not unlike that made by Nils Frahm. His distinctive combination of non-rock piano instrumentals and ambient electronics is to the 21st-century equivalent of chill-out music what Massive Attack were to the 90s variety: an overwhelming influence, endlessly imitated with varying degrees of ingenuity. Some of the artists who have appeared in his wake have latched on to the arty, esoteric side of what Frahm does – British duo Dead Light deal in treated pianos and icy atmospherics – but most don’t, offering a reductive take on Frahm’s sound that diminishes it to something pleasant but anonymous; or, as the Spotify playlist title puts it, Piano in the Background. Millions and millions of people have played the tracks on such lists. Regardless of whether they have heard of Frahm or not, music inspired by him forms part of the soundtrack to their lives, albeit as unobtrusively as possible. AP Teedra Moses New Orleans-born R&amp;B sage Teedra Moses released her debut album, Complex Simplicity, in 2004 to a mild commercial reception – and then took 11 years to follow it up, having mostly opted out of the music industry to raise her sons. This didn’t stop Moses from becoming a revered cult figure, the kind whose audiences a decade on still breathe every ad lib of her songs, which hit a rare midpoint between evocative poetry and no-chaser real talk, delivered with startling clarity over arrangements that draw on frosty modernity as much as warm throwback soul. Her influence was felt as far away as the UK funky scene of the late 00s; bootlegged Moses remixes were staples of DJ sets and the biggest star to emerge from it, Katy B, has taken every chance to laud Moses. These days, from Kehlani to SZA, Moses’s thoughtful singer-songwriterly R&amp;B is in vogue; the carefully casual way younger, newer artists dissect human interaction was forged by her. AM The xx What is most remarkable about the xx’s sonic legacy – the capacious production, the breathy, wounded vocals and snappy beats that occupy a liminal zone between electronica, indie and R&amp;B – is the sheer scope of their influence. Initially, the London band’s impact was easily traceable, either via sampling (Rihanna nicked Intro’s throbbing synths for Drunk on Love, while Jamie xx and Gil-Scott Heron’s I’ll Take Care of U formed the basis of Drake’s 2011 mega-hit Take Care) or in the output of their immediate peers – the trio’s skin-crawlingly intimate vocals and brooding minimalism set the tone for the next generation of avant-garde UK pop, from FKA twigs and James Blake to Jessie Ware and London Grammar. Yet the past decade has seen the xx’s influence reverberate, increasingly loudly, in a less predictable sphere: that of corporate, hugely lucrative, pop. Massive acts such as the Chainsmokers, Selena Gomez and Shawn Mendes are the most obviously indebted, but it is also true that every sparsely furnished, hauntingly atmospheric hit that blurs the boundaries between pop, rock and R&amp;B (which, in 2017, felt like pretty much all of them) owes a significant amount to the xx’s genre-bending melancholia. RA Timbo Afro-swing, afro bashment, afro-hop, afro-trap: whatever you call it, Timbo started it. In UK rap and grime, genres previously dominated by Caribbean influence, he introduced the sweet fusion of Afrobeats, bashment and British grit that artists such as Kojo Funds and J Hus are now well known for. His distinct sound on STP’s 2013 Mixtape 2 helped launch the genre, while songs such as Ringtone, Ladie and Living Life (featuring Stormzy) from the same year were well ahead of their time. Even Naira Marley ft Max Twigz’s Marry Juana, sometimes credited as the catalyst of the hybrid sound, uses a beat that Timbo had rap-sung more than a year before on Happy Times. On Twitter, his display name is currently #WhereIsTimbo. The answer is simple: all over UK rap. YA Nitzer Ebb Nitzer Ebb emerged from suburban Essex in the early 80s clad in white shorts, stern haircuts and armed with libidinous, awkwardly English songs about the human body and sex. Once overlooked, recent years have seen dancefloors from Hull to Berlin’s Berghain shake to Join in the Chant and Murderous as the likes of Helena Hauff, Objekt, Perc and Optimo’s JD Twitch have used the brutal functionality of the Essex group’s pop to juddering effect. Nitzer Ebb ascribed to the essentialist musical theory that all you need for a great song is a killer bassline, a sniff of melody and some ribald lyrics about shagging; this minimalist approach is what has left them so suited for dropping in amid some 140bpm techno. It is interesting, too, that many of the producers who have championed them over the years, such as Karl O’Connor AKA Regis, are those who eschew the dry facelessness of much electronic music in favour of injecting a theatrical whiff of greasepaint and drama. LT Bikini Kill Kathleen Hanna’s Olympia, Washington feminist punk band crashed into the British music press in the early 90s, declaring, “Revolution Girl Style Now!” They railed against the rock scene as a male construct, confronted sexism and urged women in music to force change and revolution. Back then, they were adored or vilified, even physically assaulted. Fast-forward to today and what were underground manifestos have triggered a wave of empowerment, firing up generations of female musicians. Echoes of Bikini Kill’s ideology can be found in such international and musically diverse acts as Beyoncé, the Gossip, South Korean punks the Twistettes and British sensations Wolf Alice (notably their abrasively furious Yuk Foo). Bikini Kill’s influence is perhaps most pronounced in Moscow-based feminist art collective Pussy Riot, who – because of the Russian political climate and way band members have been imprisoned for protesting – Hanna acknowledges as “way more dangerous”. DS Diplo When it comes to the current grab-bag of electronic, pop and hip-hop greasing mainstream music, much of it glints with Diplo’s Midas touch. He has been savvily curating underground sounds since 2003, whether nudging the likes of Brazilian baile funk, Baltimore club and New Orleans bounce overground via his Mad Decent label, or showcasing his cherry-picking production on MIA’s 2007 catherine wheel of genres, Kala. His magpie eye has come to define the intersection of pop and dance ever since. He helped popularise US EDM and its sledgehammer-subtle pairing of giddy drop and juddering bass; he borrowed reggaeton’s dembow beat and a wonky flute sample to spearhead the latest chart craze dubbed “tropical house”, with his Jack Ü collaborator Skrillex; and with Major Lazer he has turned it all into a stadium-filling performance, laying the groundwork for enormo pop-dance acts such as the Chainsmokers. He may get called out for his liberal pilfering of Caribbean stylings, but without Diplo, chart music would be a lot less adventurous. As he recently told the New Yorker: “Culture is meant to be fused. That’s how culture moves.” KH"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2018/feb/26/one-whiff-of-no-10-and-corbyn-single-market-brexit-eu","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-26T15:42:56Z","webTitle":"One whiff of No 10 and Corbyn opts for a customs union after all | John Crace","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/feb/26/one-whiff-of-no-10-and-corbyn-single-market-brexit-eu","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/feb/26/one-whiff-of-no-10-and-corbyn-single-market-brexit-eu","fields":{"headline":"One whiff of No 10 and all of a sudden Corbyn wants a customs union","bodyText":"What goes around, comes around. Less than a year ago, the three Labour Coventry MPs had come to the city’s university to hear Gordon Brown campaign on their behalf during the general election. Not once in the course of that hour-long event was Jeremy Corbyn mentioned. The name was considered just too toxic. Now those same three Labour MPs were back at the same university to give the Labour leader their undivided attention and support as he made his bid to become the next prime minister. Also in the front row were the shadow international trade minister, Barry Gardiner, the shadow business secretary, Rebecca Long-Bailey and the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer. They too must have had mixed feelings about Corbyn’s upcoming speech, though for very different reasons. Gardiner because he had just spent months campaigning against the core argument Corbyn was about to make and was now going to look like a bit of a dick. Long-Bailey because she had never really held a firm opinion about anything – whatever Jeremy said was fine by her – and she was genuinely excited to find out what she would be believing next. And Starmer because he had spent months and months nudging the Labour leader toward this position and still wasn’t entirely sure he wasn’t going to back out at the last minute and deliver an entirely different speech. After a slight misfire – he initially appeared to head in the opposite direction away from the lectern positioned in front of three miniature hydrogen cars – Corbyn quickly got into gear. He still struggles with reading from an Autocue and his attempts at jokes invariably fall flat, partly because they’re not funny and partly because he isn’t sure which bits are the punchlines. “You’re supposed to laugh at that,” he said plaintively at one point, but there was at least some commitment in this speech. Certainly more than in any other Brexit speech he had ever made. He began by calling out the Tories for being in disarray, and keeping the country in the dark about its intentions and wanting some kind of bespoke fantasy Brexit. The irony that this also perfectly described the Labour party up till now escaped him. But then opposition parties always allow themselves a little more leeway on such matters. After a bit about Labour backing a jobs-first Brexit – has any party every backed an unemployment-first Brexit? – Corbyn got to his big sell. Britain would be staying in a customs union. Better than that, a bespoke customs union. Though obviously a very different kind of bespoke from the Tories’ bespoke. One that would not only protect the Good Friday agreement by allowing frictionless trade between Northern Ireland and the Republic, but would also allow Britain to do other trade deals because the EU would be happy to let us do so. How that was going to work, he didn’t elaborate. But he was sure it was going to be OK. Not least because it put clear blue water between Labour and the Tories and would give Theresa May a major headache. Better still, he almost sounded as if he believed in the idea that only a few months ago he had been totally against. Maybe the EU wasn’t quite as bad as he had previously thought. Especially if it was going to open the door to Number 10. Having negotiated the tricky bit of principles versus pragmatics, Corbyn moved on to his favourite subjects. Refugees and Iraq. Not that they had anything to do with Brexit, but he had insisted he be allowed to have a short rant about them in return for all the dreary EU stuff. Here we got Corbyn at his most passionate. After fielding a few questions from the media with vaguely non-committal answers, Corbyn took a question from an activist. Could he just hurry up and become prime minister? For the first time, Corbyn truly relaxed. He was among his people and he wandered off into the crowd to pose for selfies. Starmer meanwhile breathed a sigh of relief. Corbyn had kept to the script. Labour was back in the game. Now to work on the single market. That might prove trickier, but if Corbyn could be made to smell the furniture in Number 10 he might come round. Baby steps and all that."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/shortcuts/2018/feb/26/how-hard-is-it-to-learn-to-write-by-hand-as-an-adult","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-26T16:46:05Z","webTitle":"How hard is it to learn to write by hand as an adult?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/shortcuts/2018/feb/26/how-hard-is-it-to-learn-to-write-by-hand-as-an-adult","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/shortcuts/2018/feb/26/how-hard-is-it-to-learn-to-write-by-hand-as-an-adult","fields":{"headline":"How hard is it to learn to write by hand as an adult?","bodyText":"This week, paediatric occupational therapists warned that children were entering primary school not knowing how to hold pens and pencils, owing to an overuse of technology instead of activities that build muscles in the hands and teach control of movement, such as using building blocks. But what if you make it to adulthood without knowing how to hold a pen? Can you learn then? “You can, but the brain of a very young child is so plastic that it just absorbs information quite well,” says Angela Webb, recently retired clinical psychologist and the chair of the National Handwriting Association. “After age 11, you can learn things – but you have to really want to, you have to be motivated, you have to practise. The ideal position is if you learn in early childhood and then you have a skill for life.” There was a time, she says, when people didn’t believe handwriting was going to survive the digital age, “so they stopped teaching handwriting in schools. You have a generation of young adults [in their 20s and 30s] who weren’t taught at school and had to find their own way.” Learning to write well by hand is just as important now, she says. “There is a strong relationship between how you handwrite and the quality of what you write – the content of what you write is conditioned by how easy it is to get it on the page. Memory is implicated – if you handwrite the letter forms, you activate the part of the brain that is implicated in reading, so it helps reading.” With poor handwriting a child may find “learning will be harder work and it will be more superficial”. Cherrell Avery teaches handwriting to a wide range of people, from those who had difficulty as children to those who want to make their writing aesthetically pleasing, or find writing physically painful. “Not establishing writing skills as a child can, in many instances, seriously affect the pen control, fluency and handwriting style of an adult,” she says. “Not having this muscle memory firmly in place may lead to lack of confidence in writing generally and reduce the likelihood of using handwriting as a tool to aid creative thinking and retain facts.” Still, you’re never too old to learn, she says. Her oldest student is over 80. “He still works on how he holds the pen and has made huge improvement.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2018/feb/26/marie-claire-publisher-time-inc-uk-sold-epiris","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-26T16:00:56Z","webTitle":"Marie Claire publisher Time Inc UK sold to private equity group","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/feb/26/marie-claire-publisher-time-inc-uk-sold-epiris","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2018/feb/26/marie-claire-publisher-time-inc-uk-sold-epiris","fields":{"headline":"Marie Claire publisher Time Inc UK sold to private equity group","bodyText":"The UK publisher of titles including Marie Claire, NME and Country Life has been sold to private equity company Epiris in a deal thought to be worth about £130m. Time Inc UK, one of Britain’s biggest magazine publishers, owns 57 titles including What’s on TV, Woman’s Weekly, Horse &amp; Hound and style guide Wallpaper. Its new owner, Epiris, is expected to explore the sale of a number of underperforming titles, make cuts to the 1,700-strong workforce and also look to increase its presence in UK publishing through further acquisitions. “The business itself offers plentiful scope for transformation through operational improvement and mergers and acquisitions,” said Alex Fortescue, the managing partner at Epiris. Epiris was advised on the sale by Jefferies International. It is understood that Epiris is also considering a bid for assets belonging to Dennis, the publisher of titles including The Week, Viz and Men’s Fitness, for £75m to £100m. Founder Felix Dennis died in 2014. Epiris has brought in Sir Bernard Gray, the chairman of New Scientist and formerly a non-executive director of the Radio Times publisher Immediate Media, as executive chairman. The Time Inc UK chief, Marcus Rich, who joined from the publisher of the Daily Mail in 2014, will remain with the company. Time Inc UK made close to £30m in profits last year on revenues of about £250m. “At its heart this is a diverse, robust and cash-generative business,” said Chris Hanna, a partner at Epiris. “We intend to bring clarity and simplicity to it, to focus on maximising the potential of its high-quality portfolio.” Epiris has acquired Time Inc UK from US media group Meredith, which bought parent company Time Inc, publisher of People, Sports Illustrated and Fortune magazines, in November for $1.8bn (£1.3bn). The deal marks the latest round of consolidation in a UK publishing industry struggling to cope with a decline in readership of printed magazines while attempting to build a digitally viable business in the face of strong competition from rivals such as Facebook and Google. Last year, Immediate Media was bought by German media company Hubert Burda for £270m."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/feb/26/small-scream-why-tvs-horror-shows-are-scarily-bad","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-26T16:40:57Z","webTitle":"Small scream: why TV's horror shows are scarily bad","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/feb/26/small-scream-why-tvs-horror-shows-are-scarily-bad","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/feb/26/small-scream-why-tvs-horror-shows-are-scarily-bad","fields":{"headline":"Small scream: why TV's horror shows are scarily bad","bodyText":"Here’s a fun game: what’s the worst film you could possibly adapt for television? Something gimmicky like Hardcore Henry? Something abstract like Warhol’s Empire? Blair Witch Project? Actually, let’s stop there, because the answer is Blair Witch Project. The answer is always Blair Witch Project. Which is interesting, because Lionsgate has announced that it has a Blair Witch Project TV series in the works. That vague little wisp of a detail is all we have so far, and yet you already know that it’s going to be the worst film-to-TV adaptation of all time. Because what are the options? Maintain the foggy terror and unfathomable dread of the first Blair Witch movie? Nope, because nobody wants to sit down and binge-watch 10 hours of screaming, lurching found footage. Unpack the enigma of the Blair Witch myth in a more traditional manner? Nope, because then you just have a really long version of Blair Witch: Book of Shadows, and that would be far worse. This isn’t meant as a specific ding against Blair Witch. Almost without exception, any attempt to do horror on television falls at the first hurdle. The perfect home for horror will always be cinema. Horror works best when it’s a hit and run; when it comes crashing in out of nowhere, unfolds over 90 minutes, builds to a nightmarish crescendo and then disappears again. At random, take The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. In 83 minutes, it gives you just enough detail to unsettle you for days. The horrific final dinner table scene is almost entirely unexplained, and that’s the scariest part. If any more light was shone upon the events of the film, the whole thing would be killed dead. In fact, if you’ve ever had the misfortune to watch 2006’s The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning, you’ll know that this is exactly what happened. You can’t sustain that level of fright across an entire television series. It’s almost impossible to do. Remember Netflix’s Hemlock Grove, and how tedious that was? Remember the From Dusk Till Dawn series, and how watching it felt like watching a good idea get suffocated to death? No matter the subject, every season of American Horror Story always has a good four-to-five episode stretch where we’re presented with nothing but directionless padding. This is the nature of television. As a medium, it thrives on detail, and detail is the death of horror. It’s why the best depictions of horror on television come with an inbuilt self-destruct button. Shows like The Twilight Zone, Tales From the Crypt and the grislier end of Black Mirror’s spectrum work because they reset entirely after every episode. A monster gnawing on William Shatner’s wing is absolutely terrifying for 30 minutes, but if it was a series – if every episode explained something new about Shatner’s psyche or the airline’s pre-flight safety checks or the monster’s relationship with its parents – then it’d be about as scary as a damp sock. That’s not to say it can’t be done. The Walking Dead is still very popular, even if you could argue that it’s less a horror and more a violent thriller. And Bates Motel – arguably the best horror series ever made – succeeded because it owed more to Breaking Bad than Psycho in its depiction of a slow slide into evil. It wasn’t about a lunatic running around murdering people. It was about a relationship between two people, and that’s why the denouement landed such a sickening punch. Perhaps this is the line the Blair Witch TV show will take. Perhaps it won’t be a horror at all, but a drama about a community turned inside out by an influx of thrill-seeking tourists. Perhaps it’ll be about the family of a missing film-maker, and their grapples with grief. Perhaps it’ll be a Black Mirror-style anthology series about urban legends. All of these would be better than a straight-up horror adaptation of the film. Anything would be better than that."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/feb/26/police-face-disciplinary-panel-over-claim-they-spied-on-janet-alder-sister-of-man-who-died-in-custody","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-26T14:37:07Z","webTitle":"Police accused of spying on sister of man who died in custody","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/feb/26/police-face-disciplinary-panel-over-claim-they-spied-on-janet-alder-sister-of-man-who-died-in-custody","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/feb/26/police-face-disciplinary-panel-over-claim-they-spied-on-janet-alder-sister-of-man-who-died-in-custody","fields":{"headline":"Police accused of spying on sister of man who died in custody","bodyText":"Two police officers have been brought before a disciplinary panel accused of running an unauthorised surveillance operation against a woman whose brother was unlawfully killed in a police station. The pair, who have been granted anonymity, could be dismissed if they are found guilty of gross misconduct at the disciplinary hearing, which opened on Monday. Janet Alder has described how she felt “terrorised by the state” during her campaign to discover the circumstances in which Christopher Alder, a former paratrooper, died at a Hull police station in 1998. The panel, which is scheduled to sit for five days, was told police followed her and her lawyer at his inquest on 28 July 2000 and attempted to listen to conversations between them. Such exchanges are private and confidential under legal rules that protect conversations between lawyers and their clients. The panel of three heard the surveillance team followed Janet Alder and her barrister Leslie Thomas to a hotel and car park. As many as 14 officers took part in the operation. Dijen Basu, the QC for Humberside police, described the surveillance as intrusive and said it lasted nearly two hours “without appropriate authorisation and justification”. The operations commander and deputy operations commander are alleged to have conducted surveillance that went “far beyond the strictly limited terms” of what had been authorised. Both deny gross misconduct. Jason Pitter, the QC for one of the officers, said they had acted on instructions. “The culpability lies with others further up the chain. The spotlight should not be on this officer,” he said. Sam Green, the QC for the second officer, outlined a similar defence, saying the accused believed they had been carrying out a lawful order. The panel, sitting in Goole, east Yorkshire, heard police had only been authorised to monitor protesters on the concourse outside Hull crown court to identify any who may have been involved in wrongdoing. The inquest in 2000 concluded that Christopher Alder, a father of two and Falklands war veteran, had been unlawfully killed when he choked to death on the floor of the police station. CCTV footage showed he received no help from officers as he struggled for breath, with his trousers and boxer shorts pulled down around his knees. The officers thought Christopher Alder was play-acting. He stopped breathing after 11 minutes. Monkey noises were recorded on an audio tape as the handcuffed former soldier lay dead. Janet Alder feared on a number of occasions that police had been spying on her after she started her campaign. Details of the surveillance at the inquest came to light after a detective constable involved in the operation came forward to her superiors in 2013. The then home secretary Theresa May had asked all police forces to search their archives after the Guardian revealed undercover police officers had monitored the campaign to bring the killers of Stephen Lawrence to justice."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/mar/03/spot-working-mother-happy-busy-caretaker","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-03T09:00:13Z","webTitle":"Spot the working mother: happy, busy, and still treated as the caretaker | Hadley Freeman","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/03/spot-working-mother-happy-busy-caretaker","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/03/spot-working-mother-happy-busy-caretaker","fields":{"headline":"Spot the working mother: happy, busy, and still treated as the caretaker","bodyText":"I didn’t have many positive images of working mothers when I was growing up in New York in the 1980s. Ferris Bueller’s estate agent mother was the first one I remember taking notice of, and what I noticed was that she was constantly being reprimanded by authority figures for being a slack parent while Mr Bueller was left alone in his high-tower office, bothered by neither his children’s irate headmaster nor the local police, so he could get on with his day of having fancy lunches. Then there was JC, the Wall Street executive in 1987’s Baby Boom, played by Diane Keaton, whose bosses were so horrified when she became a mother that they basically pushed her out the door. (Banished to Vermont, JC made money the only way open to mothers, which was making baby food.) Probably the best was Clair Huxtable, the lawyer mother in The Cosby Show. But let’s be honest, she never seemed to do much lawyering and, let’s be even more honest, if your most positive example comes from The Cosby Show, then you’re really scraping the barrel. Like the majority of mothers in Britain, I work. My mother stopped working when I was born and I loved that she was always there when I got home from school – but that is not a financial possibility for me and, anyway, I really like my job. According to the Office for National Statistics, the number of working mothers in England has gone up by more than a million in the past two decades, which means there’s a lot of us who grew up without a roadmap for how to do this. And that can feel at times a little like getting dressed without a mirror. So when Guardian contributor Fiona Freund asked if she could photograph me with my kids for an exhibition to celebrate working mothers in recognition of International Women’s Day, I said yes. Normally I’d rather eat my own hands than be in front of a camera but I was curious about what I looked like, working and mothering, and when I looked at the photo I saw the prosaic truth: I looked busy, and I looked happy. You don’t need to come over all Andrea “as a MOTHER” Leadsom to say that you learn a lot about yourself when you combine work and motherhood. What I have mainly learned is that the stereotypes I feared most aren’t true. My brain hasn’t become a baby-centric pudding – in fact, since I had my twins, I’ve never been so full of ideas. Where once I could turn dicking around into an Olympic sport, I can now knock off two articles by lunchtime. One of my friends said she’d become a much better boss since having kids “because I’m used to having to spell things out to the kids all the time”. Also, contrary to all the stories about the guilt working mothers feel, I appreciate my job more than ever, because nothing makes the office feel more like a relaxing holiday than having two toddlers at home. And I will always believe that whatever negligible effect my occasional absence has on my boys, this is more than compensated for by the benefits they get from seeing an ambitious and professionally satisfied woman as the norm. But some stereotypes remain all too true. My partner and I are both journalists and the only way we could be more professionally equal is if we were the same person. And yet I’m still seen by others as the caretaker: I’m the one the doctor calls if something is wrong and I’m the one who other parents contact to make playdates (and by “other parents” I inevitably mean “other working mothers”). If my boys ever skip school, Ferris Bueller-style, I’ll be the one the headmaster calls, even though I work in an office and my partner works from home. I emailed my female friends who also have kids and work, and asked how they see their situations, and my inbox filled with mixed emotions, and not just of the busy/happy variety. They felt “lucky” but also “furious”, “good” but also “often crying”. My friends spoke of husbands who get irritable about doing the “childcare” (aka parenting) and male bosses grumbling about their female employees leaving work early for the school pick-up. “I have kids and I work full-time,” one boss crossly told a friend of mine who asked to have Fridays off. “Yes, and your wife quit her job to look after the kids,” my friend couldn’t quite bring herself to reply. Working mothers are becoming the norm, but residuals of the old patriarchy remain – in office practices and also in relationship dynamics. So here’s my wish for the next International Women’s Day: as well as exhibitions about working mothers, there will be ones depicting fathers doing the school run; male bosses will write articles about the long-term benefits of accommodating women so devoted to their jobs they return to them after giving birth; and no one will take it as a given that it’s the mother who goes part-time after having kids. Because I love the photo of me with my boys, I really do. But if we’re talking about working mothers without looking at the role men have to play, we’re seeing only half the picture."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/shortcuts/2018/feb/26/zoo-tinder-how-technology-is-helping-animals-hook-up","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-26T16:16:00Z","webTitle":"Zoo Tinder – how technology is helping animals hook up","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/shortcuts/2018/feb/26/zoo-tinder-how-technology-is-helping-animals-hook-up","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/shortcuts/2018/feb/26/zoo-tinder-how-technology-is-helping-animals-hook-up","fields":{"headline":"Zoo Tinder – how technology is helping animals hook up","bodyText":"Name: Zoological Information Management System.

I promise it isn’t. Got an elephant with an itch it can’t scratch? Check out Zims and it will find you the right elephant to give it the trunky rumpy-pumpy it has been looking for.

As he reached out to moderate Conservative MPs to join him in supporting a new customs union with the EU, the Labour leader appeared to accidentally offer them “new cake” instead. Blink and you missed it, but for those who have long worried that Labour is emulating Boris Johnson’s infamous “cake-and-eat-it” approach to Brexit, it was an unfortunate reminder that simply declaring what Britain wants from its negotiations with the EU is not the same as achieving it. Labour’s tactic for peeling off anxious Tories is widely seen as smart domestic politics, but whether it proves a smart policy too depends on convincing other countries to go along with it. Fortunately for those who hope this tactic could yet unlock Britain’s paralysis over Brexit, there was the beginning of an answer to the question as well. The brief verbal stumble was followed by a much more nuanced explanation than either party has offered before. The key caveat, stressed Corbyn, was that any new customs deal with the EU had to involve an agreement for both sides to also work together on future trade negotiations with the rest of the world. “The option of a new UK customs union with the EU would need to ensure the UK has a say in future trade deals ... being able to negotiate agreement of new trade deals in our national interest,” he said. “Labour would not countenance a deal that left Britain as a passive recipient of rules decided elsewhere by others. That would mean ending up as mere rule takers.” This is the difference between what Labour and the Tory moderates are offering, and what Tory critics such as Liam Fox fear would result if Britain signed up to a narrow custom union – like that which Turkey currently has with the EU. In Turkey’s case, a limited customs union arrangement has allowed both access to Europe’s integrated manufacturing supply chains and preserved independence from EU freedom of movement rules. Similar arrangements for Britain could therefore protect the car industry and the openness of the Irish border while respecting wishes among Brexit voters to curb migration. The catch, however, is that a customs union automatically implies a common external trade tariff with third-party countries. In order to keep its car parts flowing smoothly back and forth over the EU border, Turkey avoids triggering “rules of origin” problems by accepting the same external tariffs and mainly hopes to tag along for the ride when the EU negotiates new trade deals. Such a diminution of international influence would be a tough sell for any British government. It is not just those who fetishise sovereignty and a swashbuckling new future who would blanch at outsourcing trade policy to Brussels. It would also make it far harder for leftwing opponents to block controversial deals like the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) with the US. But insisting that Brussels continues to consult the UK when it negotiates with countries such as the US and China is not quite as far-fetched as some critics have been suggesting in the wake of Corbyn’s speech. A deal struck between the EU and US that failed to involve the UK and that subsequently also led to the unravelling of the post-Brexit cross-Channel trade arrangements would be almost as undesirable for future Brussels trade negotiators as it is now. A genuine alliance of UK and EU negotiators operating as a unified bloc may also stand a much better chance of getting what it wants in Washington or Beijing than either could hope for operating alone. It’s a big ask to make of Michel Barnier as well as Brexit voters, but it may be the most honest attempt to square the circle yet."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/feb/26/the-dangers-of-paid-access-to-council-planning-officers","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-26T18:24:01Z","webTitle":"The dangers of paid access to council planning officers | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/feb/26/the-dangers-of-paid-access-to-council-planning-officers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/feb/26/the-dangers-of-paid-access-to-council-planning-officers","fields":{"headline":"The dangers of paid access to council planning officers","bodyText":"Further to Simon Jenkins’ article (Wine and dine democracy is now on trial – and about time, 23 February), there is another facet of this situation.

Prices on the site range from £150 to £7,500 plus VAT. The council is “dedicated to building relationships with our customers and therefore have found that some Applicants and Agents like to have the continuity of working with specific Planning Officers”.

The ethos of our initially well-planned town is disappearing while developers who ignore the unique character of the place are helped to get planning permission by a planning authority that has enjoyed a close, paid-for relationship with them.

The Environment Audit Committee (EAC) called for a deposit return scheme (DRS) in a report in December, in which a small deposit is paid when purchasing a bottle and then returned when the empty bottle is brought back. Environment secretary Michael Gove called a DRS a “great idea” in September. But the government’s reply to the EAC report, published on Monday, suggests a DRS decision will be delayed until after a consultation on taxes to deter single-use plastics. That consultation has not yet been launched despite being announced three months ago. “The government is dragging its feet on DRS,” said Mary Creagh MP, chair of the EAC. “Every day the government delays, another 700,000 plastic bottles end up in our streets. This delay is unacceptable and the government needs to take decisive action on this important issue instead of kicking it into the long grass.” The EAC report found that 5.5bn plastic bottles – 43% of the total – are not recycled every year in the UK and 700,000 are littered every day. In Germany and Denmark, which have DRS schemes, more than 90% of bottles are returned. Plastic bottles make up a third of all plastic pollution in the sea, which is harming marine life around the world. If marine plastic pollution continues to rise at its current rate, the amount of plastic in the sea will outweigh fish by 2050, according to the report. “We agree with the EAC that we need to encourage consumers to dispose of products in the most appropriate way,” the government said in its response. “Urgent action to reduce plastic waste in the marine and open environment is vital for the future of our planet.” Its call for evidence on a DRS ended in November, but the government said it had to consider how a DRS would fit in with other planned policies, such as plastic taxes, “in order to avoid producers or consumers being charged multiple times for the same products”. The EAC report found that the UK buys 7.7bn plastic bottles of water a year and called for ministers to require all public premises which serve food or drink to provide free drinking water on request. Creagh said ministers have written to retailers to encourage them to provide free drinking water, but had no plans to make this a requirement. The government said: “It is clear that we need a cultural shift in making it clear to the public that they are able to refill bottles free of charge in many places.” It said water companies were working to create a network of water refill points. But Creagh said: “We heard no evidence from the water industry about plans to create a network of refill points.” The EAC report also called for supermarkets, retailers and drinks companies to be forced to pay significantly more towards the recycling of the plastic packaging. Currently 90% of the recycling costs are paid by the public, a much higher proportion than in most EU nations. The government said it was committed to work towards eliminating all avoidable plastic waste by the end of 2042 and was “exploring changes to the packaging producer responsibility scheme”. Elena Polisano, at Greenpeace UK, said: “This [overall response] sounds like the government trying to manage expectations before doing significantly less than is necessary. We hope this isn’t the case.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/feb/26/general-francos-summer-palace-pazo-de-meiras-caught-up-in-ownership-row","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-26T15:12:41Z","webTitle":"General Franco's summer palace caught up in ownership row","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/26/general-francos-summer-palace-pazo-de-meiras-caught-up-in-ownership-row","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/feb/26/general-francos-summer-palace-pazo-de-meiras-caught-up-in-ownership-row","fields":{"headline":"General Franco's summer palace caught up in ownership row","bodyText":"The Galician manor where Francisco Franco spent his summers fishing and shooting is at the centre of an ownership battle after the Spanish dictator’s heirs put the property up for sale for €8m (£7m). The Pazo de Meirás, which was built in the late 19th century, was bought by public subscription and handed to Franco in 1938 as a gift from the people of A Coruña. When he died in 1975, it passed to his daughter, Carmen, who became the 1st Duchess of Franco. Following her death last December, her heirs decided to sell the manor. A high-end estate agent is advertising it as a unique property with a price tag to match. The local authority is fighting the move, over which it says it should have been consulted because the pazo is a registered site of cultural interest. Sada council wants to halt the sale and look into how the property could be returned to public ownership. Two committees will meet this week to decide the next steps and provide legal and historical arguments in support of the initiative. “We want to speed up the work of both commissions to find how we can do things and to launch legal proceedings to get the sale contract annulled,” said Sada’s urban planning councillor, Francisco Montouto. He said the house and grounds belonged to the Galician people and ought to be returned to them “at zero cost”. For too long, the Pazo de Meirás had served as a monument to Galicia’s most infamous son rather than to his victims, he said. “Here, it’s not like in other countries in Europe where you can overturn the symbols of dictatorship,” he said. “The truth is that it’s a symbolic place that should serve as a way to commemorate all those who suffered and died under the repression of the Franco dictatorship. “Beyond what it might mean to the council as a site of cultural interest and a part of the area’s heritage, it’s a symbolic matter of doing away, once and for all, with the legacy of this brutal dictatorship.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/feb/26/lassie-lou-ahern-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-26T14:51:28Z","webTitle":"Lassie Lou Ahern obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/feb/26/lassie-lou-ahern-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/feb/26/lassie-lou-ahern-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Lassie Lou Ahern obituary","bodyText":"Lassie Lou Ahern, who has died aged 97, enjoyed a substantial career as a child actor in 1920s Hollywood, and was one of the last surviving performers from the silent film era. She made her debut aged three, in Hal Roach’s first full-length movie, an adaptation of The Call of the Wild (1923), and soon was regularly cast in Charley Chase comedies and as the object of rescue in the popular serials of Helen Holmes. In pictures such as Webs of Steel (1925), Ahern and Holmes carried out their own dangerous stunt work. She appeared in productions by independent producers (The Dark Angel for Samuel Goldwyn, Hell’s Highroad for Cecil B DeMille, Robes of Sin for William Russell, all in 1925), and features at major studios (John Ford’s now lost film Thank You and Excuse Me starring Norma Shearer, also 1925), before landing a contract with Universal in the mid-1920s. There, Ahern had her own dressing room with a star on the door. A clothing line was named after her (“Lassie Lou Classics”), and her name and image were used to endorse such brands as Sunkist oranges, Buster Brown shoes and Jean Carol frocks. She found her biggest success in the epic Uncle Tom’s Cabin (1927), landing the part of Little Harry over the hundreds of boys who auditioned for the role. The film was shot largely on location on the Mississippi river; Ahern appeared in the sequence featuring the escape across the ice floes and won excellent notices. The movie took more than a year and half to make, and ended up the third most expensive 20s Hollywood production, after Ben Hur: A Tale of the Christ (1925) and Old Ironsides (1926), and like those films it lost money at the box office. She was cast in the rare Jewish-themed drama Surrender (1927) and as an Arab girl in The Forbidden Woman (1927), before appearing opposite the rising child star Frankie Darro in Little Mickey Grogan, her swansong in silent pictures, as the street urchin Susan Dale. She was born in Hollywood, the daughter of Elizabeth (nee Wilson) and Fred Ahern. Her father was a real estate agent who had the actor Will Rogers as a client. After meeting Lassie and her older sister, Peggy, Rogers encouraged Ahern to take his daughters to the Hal Roach studios to be cast in parts calling for children, and soon they earned ancillary roles in the Our Gang series. It was a spate of proto-gangster films in the late 20s that led Fred, alarmed by the rising depiction of violence, to take his daughters out of pictures. Instead, he opened a dance studio, Ahern’s Allied Arts, a few blocks away from MGM, which, besides ballet and tap, taught acrobatics, rope tricks and music skills. Between 1932 and 1939, Lassie and Peggy Ahern toured the world together as dancers (and were marvellous on screen in Hollywood Party, 1937). Their act broke up when each sister decided to marry. While Peggy retired permanently from performing, Lassie returned to Hollywood in 1941 with her husband Johnny Brent, a former Dixieland drummer whom she had married in 1938, and who was employed as a musician for studio orchestras. She danced in City of Missing Girls (1941) and in the early musicals Donald O’Connor made at Universal (Top Man and Mister Big in 1943 and Patrick the Great in 1945), and had a bit part in George Cukor’s Gaslight (1944). Her half-brother Fred also went in the film industry, notably as a production designer for Alfred Hitchcock. When Ahern returned to the screen decades later, it was on television, in small parts in episodes of The Odd Couple, Love, American Style, and other popular series. In middle age she worked as a travel agent and for more than 30 years taught dance. Even after decades of relative obscurity, Ahern was still winning new fans for her silent film work, and efforts are being made to restore an original 35mm nitrate copy of Little Mickey Grogan found in film archives in Paris. I conducted an extended interview with her in 2013 for the journal Film International, and she told me: “It’s gratifying to experience such interest from around the world. Fan letters, especially from Germany and Spain, still arrive at my mailbox at a rate that amazes me.” Johnny died in 1972. Ahern is survived by their children, Cary, Debra and John. • Lassie Lou Ahern, actor, born 25 June 1920; died 15 February 2018"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"higher-education-network/2018/feb/28/qs-world-university-rankings-2018-performing-arts","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-28T13:30:18Z","webTitle":"QS world university rankings 2018: performing arts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2018/feb/28/qs-world-university-rankings-2018-performing-arts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/higher-education-network/2018/feb/28/qs-world-university-rankings-2018-performing-arts","fields":{"headline":"QS world university rankings 2018: performing arts","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/blog/live/2018/feb/26/brexit-tories-lash-out-at-corbyn-as-he-backs-staying-in-customs-union-with-eu-politics-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-26T18:06:56Z","webTitle":"Pro-European Tories play down prospect of voting with Corbyn to defeat government on custom union - Politics live","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2018/feb/26/brexit-tories-lash-out-at-corbyn-as-he-backs-staying-in-customs-union-with-eu-politics-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/blog/live/2018/feb/26/brexit-tories-lash-out-at-corbyn-as-he-backs-staying-in-customs-union-with-eu-politics-live","fields":{"headline":"Pro-European Tories play down prospect of voting with Corbyn to defeat government on custom union - Politics live","bodyText":"Jeremy Corbyn has attempted to outflank the Conservatives with the business community by placing the customs union firmly on the table if Labour took over Brexit negotiations, triggering a cautious welcome from industry representatives. Two of the eight pro-European Tories who have signed a key amendment saying the UK should stay in a customs union have played down the prospect of joining with Labour and voting for it. Their comments suggest talk of the government being defeated on this issue may have been overstated. (See 4.06pm.) A “significant” attempt by the UK government to resolve the deadlock between London and the devolved administrations over what happens to powers being repatriated from Brussels after Brexit has been met with anger and scepticism. The government has been urged to prevent domestic abusers from being permitted to cross-examine their victims in family courts. That’s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. David Lidington’s speech has not gone down well with the Scottish and Welsh government. The BBC’s Nick Eardley has tweeted this response from Michael Russell, the Scottish government’s Brexit minister. Russell also tweeted this. And this is from the Welsh first minister, Labour’s Carwyn Jones. I welcome the commitment of the UK government to continue to work with us on their EU withdrawal bill. However, as currently drafted, the bill allows the UK government to take control of devolved policy areas, such as farming and fishing, once the UK has left the EU. This is an unacceptable attack on devolution in both Wales and Scotland. We now need further progress that goes beyond warm words and I hope the ‘very big changes’ promised in the speech equate to sensible amendments to the bill which respect devolution. We will continue to work with the UK and Scottish governments to that end. In his speech Lidington also said the Tories were “too slow” to accept the case for devolution. He said: As Edmund Burke put it more than 200 years ago: “To be attached to the subdivision, to love the little platoon we belong to in society, is the first principle (the germ as it were) of public affections. It is the first link by which we proceed to love of our country and of mankind.” I suspect that most of us here derive our sense of who we are from many different sources – from our family, from where we live, perhaps from a sports club, choral society or community group that we support, in many cases from our religious faith, and of course from our nation. And in the United Kingdom we know that there is no contradiction between being an ardent Welsh or Scottish patriot and being a committed supporter of the Union. If I needed any reminder of that truth, it was when the secretary of state for Scotland was gloating to me about the rugby result on Saturday. Looking back to the last century, I think - being honest - that my party was too slow to recognise that the increasing calls for devolution and decentralisation represented a genuine shift in public mood. A substantial chunk of David Lidington’s speech about Brexit and devolution was briefed to reporters overnight and the key news lines are set out in our story here. In the full speech Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister, explained in more detail why the UK government thinks it is so important for London to retain some control over devolved policy matters that before Brexit were decided in Brussels. Some powers are clearly related to the UK as a whole and will need to continue to apply in the same way across all four nations in order to protect consumers and businesses who buy and sell across the UK, in all parts of what we might call the United Kingdom’s common market. That market is one of the fundamental expressions of the constitutional integrity that underpins our existence as a union. The Government will protect that vital common market of the UK. And by retaining UK frameworks where necessary we will retain our ability not only to act in the national interest when we need to, but to do so with a unity of purpose that places the prosperity and security of all of our citizens, no matter where they’re from or where they were born, to the fore. For example, at present EU law means that our farmers and other food producers only need to comply with one set of package labelling and hygiene rules. Four different sets of rules in different parts of the UK would only make it more difficult and more expensive for a cheesemaker in Monmouthshire to sell to customers in Bristol or for a cattle farmer in Aberdeenshire to sell their beef in Berwick-upon-Tweed. (It was very odd for a minister in a government committed to Brexit to be giving a speech in favour of the common market, but that’s another matter.) Lidington also said a bit more about the proposed changes to the EU withdrawal bill which would insert a presumption in favour of repatriated powers relating to devolution being transferred to the devolved administrations. He said: So our proposal is to amend the bill before parliament to make clear that while frameworks are being agreed, the presumption would now be that powers returning from the EU should sit at a devolved level. Westminster would only be involved where, to protect the UK common market or to meet our international obligations, we needed a pause – I stress pause - to give the governments time to design and put in place a UK-wide framework. As I have said before, we expect to be able to secure agreement with the devolved governments about what frameworks should - or should not - apply to each power. And where powers do need to be returned to a UK-wide framework, we will maintain the ability for the UK parliament to legislate to do so. Just as the current provisions within the EU withdrawal bill on releasing powers to devolved governments are intended to be by consensus and agreement with the devolved governments themselves, so we should expect this new, inverted power to operate in the same way - by consensus and by agreement. Here is some more comment on the Corbyn speech. From the New Statesman’s Stephen Bush A thread from Politico Europe’s Tom McTague starting here From the New Statesman’s George Eaton From the Institute for Government’s Jill Rutter From the Fabian Society’s Andrew Harrop From MLex’s Matthew Holehouse Here’s a good spot from Sky’s Faisal Islam. Here is the text of David Lidington’s Brexit speech in north Wales. For more information about how many times Mini parts cross the channel while the car is being made, this article is invaluable. Sir John Major, the Conservative former prime minister, will be giving a speech on Brexit on Wednesday, it has been announced. He will be speaking at an event organised by the Creative Industries Federation. Major’s premiership was crippled by Eurosceptic guerrilla warfare, and during the EU referendum campaign he described the Brexiters as the “gravediggers of our prosperity”. It will be interesting to see whether his views have mellowed ... Jeremy Corbyn’s speech is significant because is raises the possibility of Labour and the other opposition parties lining up with Tory rebels to defeat the government. At the end of last week the Conservative pro-European Anna Soubry tabled a new version of her amendment to the trade bill, new clause 5 (NC5), designed to maximise support for this cause. Eight Tory MPs have signed it. Given that the Tory/DUP working majority is generally put at 13, that is enough to engineer a defeat. But Corbyn may have moved too soon. The government has signalled it will postpone the vote until after Easter, and this afternoon two of the Tories who signed the Soubry amendment played down suggestions they will actually vote for it. Stephen Hammond said it was too soon to say what he would do. On the Daily Politics, asked if he was willing to vote with Labour on this issue, he replied: This is a process. We are a long way from that yet. He also described Corbyn’s speech as “vacuous”, and went on: If Jeremy Corbyn is the answer, the only question is how do you support UK jobs, and I won’t be doing anything to support that. And a few hours later Jonathan Djanogly told BBC News that the customs union amendments (although NC5 is seen as the main one, there are others) were not necessarily intended to be put to a vote. He said: The reason why those were tabled was not necessarily to have have a vote, although it may come to that ... The reason why you’ve got me here is because I signed an amendment saying that we should have a customs union. And I signed other amendments. That means that we have a debate on the issue ... Of course, we don’t know what government policy is at the moment, but I hope that they will want to have a comprehensive customs agreement, if not customs union. And when pressed about whether he would vote with Labour, he replied: I have not said that a customs union of whatever sort is necessarily going to be something that I support. He also claimed that Corbyn’s announcement could mean many things. Jeremy Corbyn has not given a speech on Brexit for about a year and in the Commons he often avoids the subject, giving rise to the suspicion that his own Euroscepticsm makes this an awkward topic for him as Labour leader. But today’s speech was well-crafted and substantial, and could potentially have a decisive impact on UK Brexit policy (for reasons set out by, among others, Andrew Rawnsley here and Matthew d’Ancona here.) Here is my colleague Anushka Asthana’s first news story. And here, for an alternative take, is a list of eight things we’ve learnt from the speech and from Corbyn’s Q&amp;A. 1 - Corbyn has finally quashed the perception (partly, but not entirely, fair) that the Labour and Conservative approaches to Brexit are largely indistinguishable by committing his party to staying in a customs union with the EU. The key quote is at 11.09am and the parliamentary implications are considerable. 2 - But Corbyn has also made it clear that customs union membership would be conditional on the UK retaining “a say” in EU trade deals. He set this out clearly in the speech. (See 11.11am.) And he elaborated in the Q&amp;A, when he told journalists: What we want to achieve is our right to be able to negotiate and consult at the same time with the European Union on the sort of trade agreements we make. And also to influence them on the sort of trade deals that are made with the rest of the world ... Does that mean we have to be passive takers? No. We are a large economy, we are an important part of the world trade system and we will obviously negotiate to achieve that. As the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg points out, the Labour plans get a bit hazy at this point as to what would happen if the EU were to say no. For this reason the Brexiter Labour MP Frank Field thinks the customs union plan is a non-starter. (See 12.39am.) But other experts think the EU could agree to give the UK some sort of say (see 10.38am) and it is probably easier to imagine the EU complying with what Corbyn wants than complying with what the government is demanding. 3 - Corbyn genuinely seems to think that being in the single market would stop Labour implementing some of its radical policies. Labour MPs on the centre or right of the party who say the UK has to leave the single market tend to argue for this on the basis that staying in would mean accepting free movement. By contrast, Corbyn struck a relatively liberal note on immigration (see 11.17am) and instead argued in the speech that wholesale membership of the single market could obstruct Labour policies. (See 11.15am.) He went further in the Q&amp;A, referring to EU rules covering state aid and competition. The nationalisation of RBS, in order to accommodate European rules, was accompanied by the selling off of some of the best parts of RBS and the public was left with the remainder. Royal Mail is a national monopoly, rail delivery is a natural monopoly. I do not agree with or accept the idea there has to be competition in mail delivery. After all, we all have one letter box, and it is much more efficient to have one postal delivery person coming down the street rather than three or four from different or competing companies. Likewise, the idea that you have competition in water supplies is a little odd when there is only one water pipe comes to each house. So the idea that competition rules work for the benefit of all, we do not believe to be the case. Afterwards Open Britain, which is campaigning for a soft Brexit, put out this statement from the Labour MP Pat McFadden contesting Corbyn’s claims. McFadden said: Nor should we allow our position on the single market to be shaped by the view that it doesn’t allow state intervention. That is not the case. This old Lexit tune fails to recognise the widespread state ownership of industry and the high welfare economies that exist inside the single market and inside the current EU. 4 - Corbyn believes there will be a “Brexit dividend”. In his speech he said: Labour will give the NHS the resources it needs, because we will raise tax on the top 5% and big business, those with the broadest shoulders to pay. Not by making up numbers and parading them on the side of a bus. And we will use funds returned from Brussels after Brexit to invest in our public services and the jobs of the future, not tax cuts for the richest. This is contentious because many experts claim there will be no Brexit dividend at all (because the loss to the Exchequer from the lower tax revenues generated as a result of Brexit-induced lower growth will not compensate for the £8bn-odd the UK saves not having to contribute to the EU budget.) “In short, Brexit is likely to mean less money for public services, including the NHS, than otherwise would have been the case,” the Institute for Fiscal Studies said recently. McFadden also criticised this aspect of the speech. He said: However Labour needs to be honest with itself and honest with the electorate about this concept of a Brexit public spending dividend which we have heard plenty of times from Boris Johnson and the leading Brexiters. The government’s own economic assessments leaked a couple of weeks ago show Brexit to be a drag anchor on growth even after a reduction in payments to the EU is taken into account because the economic damage of leaving outweighs any budgetary gain. If we really want to put jobs and the economy first we need to understand that. Reminder: McFadden was sacked by Corbyn as shadow Europe minister two years ago. 6 - Minis cross the channel three times before they are finished - and Corbyn understands the importance of supply chains. Here is the key passage. And many businesses have supply chains and production processes, interwoven throughout Europe. Take the UK car industry, which supports 169,000 manufacturing jobs, 52,000 of which are here in the West Midlands. If we look at the example of one of Britain’s most iconic brands in this sector, the Mini, we begin to see how reliant our automotive industry is on a frictionless, interwoven supply chain. A mini will cross the Channel three times in a 2,000-mile journey before the finished car rolls off the production line. Starting in Oxford it will be shipped to France to be fitted for key components before being brought back to BMW’s Hams Hall plant in Warwickshire where it is drilled and milled into shape. Once this process is complete the Mini will be sent to Munich to be fitted with its engine, before ending its journey back at the mini plant in Oxford for final assembly. If that car is to be sold on the continent then many of its components will have crossed the Channel four times. Actually, if Corbyn’s account is correct, by my count the Mini crosses the channel four times before completion. Whatever, it is a vivid illustration of how important supply chains are, and why having to comply with customs declarations and rules of origin paperwork could be crippling for the car industry. Government ministers don’t make this point in their speeches. 7 - Corbyn does not see Brexit as one of the great threats to humanity. Surprisingly for a speech focused on the mechanics of Brexit, Corbyn included a passage towards the end about the four greatest threats to humanity. (See 11.24am.) It was slightly incongruous, but it did make the point that Corbyn is actually much more interested in human rights issues and global affairs than in what David Cameron once describe as “Euro-wank”. The passage also included this swipe at Theresa May - probably the rhetorical highlight of the speech. Many of us have friends and family that are from or who live in other parts of the world. In contrast to the prime minister who said, “if you believe you’re a citizen of the world, you’re a citizen of nowhere”. We believe in fact that we can only fully achieve what we want to as citizens of Britain by also recognising we are “citizens of the world”. 8 - Corbyn thinks the “political class” cannot ignore the wider message of the EU referendum. He made this point as he was wrapping up the Q&amp;A. He said: Let’s say to people, in every community, in every part of the country, a Labour government will not let your industries disappear and be replaced by nothing other than short-term, insecure, zero-hours contract-type work. We are serious, very serious, about investing in every community of the country. Surely the political class should learn a lesson from the results of the referendum, that sense of anger, anger, at left-behind communities anywhere in Britain. We will not walk by on the other side and let towns and cities die for the lack of investment. It is our duty to achieve something very different and very better. Ironically (in the light of point 7) this is a point on which he and May agree; she said much the same in her speech to the Conservative party conference in 2016. This also helps to explain why Corbyn sounds so reluctant to have a second referendum on Brexit. (Asked about this today, he did not rule it out, but he said it was not party policy.) Here is some union reaction to the Corbyn speech. From the Unite general secretary Len McCluskey Jeremy Corbyn has shown that people really do have a choice on Brexit. On the one hand, there is Labour which has pledged to build on the trading arrangements presently supporting millions of jobs in this country. A Corbyn government will also make it a priority to tackle the greedy bosses who have abused migrant workers to undermine employment conditions and attack the rate for the job. On the other hand, there are the Tories who are quite clearly putting their own party interests above those of the nation. From Tim Roache, general secretary of the GMB union By committing to a customs union, Labour is showing clear leadership that would safeguard our ports, transport firms and manufacturing sectors. From Frances O’Grady, the TUC general secretary The Labour leader’s speech was a welcome step forwards. It provided some of the answers working people need on how their jobs, rights and livelihoods will be protected, and it exposed the threat to manufacturing jobs from the government’s red line on a customs union. This is what Downing Street said about Jeremy Corbyn’s speech. The government will not be joining a customs union. We want to have the freedom to sign our own trade deals and to reach out into the world. Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, says Corbyn’s Brexit policy sounds like Johnsonian cakeism. Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, is being interviewed on the World at One. He says Labour wants the UK to “have a say” in future EU trade deals, which would affect the UK if it were in the customs union. Q: The Labour Brexiter Graham Stringer says British consumers would pay more if the UK cannot cut tariffs. Starmer says he does not accept this. Q: Is there any indication the EU would accept your plans, and your request for the UK to have a say in trade deals? Starmer says this would be a matter for negotiation. But the EU has been saying it wants to know if the UK wants to stay close to it, or if it wants to drift away. Labour has now provided an answer, he says: the UK should stay close. Starmer says Labour’s policy would give EU clarity it wants about UK’s overall Brexit goals. And Tom Brake, the Lib Dem Brexit spokesman, says Corbyn should have promised voters a second referendum. [Corbyn’s] slight movement on the customs union and some EU agencies might be one step on the road to rationality, but there is still a long way to go before the rhetoric meets reality. The Labour leader spoke of putting the British people first, but made no guarantees on making sure they are the ones who have a final say on the Brexit deal. Open Britain, which is campaigning for a soft Brexit, has put out this response to the speech from the Labour MP Chris Leslie. He said: Jeremy Corbyn’s speech is not the end of Labour’s debate on Europe. His commitment to the customs union is welcome but it is nowhere near enough. Staying in the single market is absolutely essential if we are to protect manufacturing jobs and investment and to avoid a hard border in Ireland. The SNP has described Jeremy Corbyn’s decision to back staying in a customs union with the EU as “a step in the right direction” but says the Labour leader should go much further, and back continued single market membership too. This is from Stephen Gethins, the SNP’s foreign affairs and Europe spokeman. Jeremy Corbyn needs to go further if he is serious about protecting the UK’s economy and jobs as the UK leaves the EU ... Since the EU referendum, the SNP has continued to call for Scotland and the UK’s continued membership of the single market and customs union in order to protect our economy, small and large businesses and livelihoods of millions of people across the UK. The softening in stance is a step in the right direction, however, time is running out - it’s time for Labour to get on board with opposition parties in Westminster to work together to bring a halt to the UK government’s disastrous Brexit plans. Sammy Wilson, the DUP’s Brexit spokesman, has accused Jeremy Corbyn of “cheap political opportunism”. In a statement he said: It is clear that Jeremy Corbyn’s speech today is driven by cheap political opportunism, completely overturns previous promises made by the Labour Party during the last general election that it was opposed to membership of the customs union and is a blatant attempt to bring down the government rather than safeguard the interests of the UK or workers in industries across the United Kingdom who would benefit from the United Kingdom’s freedom to make its own trade deals outside a customs union. Corbyn is hoping to capitalise on the opposition to leaving the EU from the few malcontents in the Conservative party. He clearly hopes that they will join with him putting personal prejudices ahead of their own party duties. The Labour Brexiter Frank Field is not bothered by Jeremy Corbyn’s speech, because he thinks the EU would never agree to give the UK a say in negotiating trade deals - the condition Corbyn has set for agreeing to stay in the customs union. (See 11.11am.) The FT’s Jim Pickard has tweeted this. Field has changed his tune a bit overnight. He is one of the Labour MPs who provided the Daily Mail splash (see 12.16pm) because yesterday he said staying in the customs union be “to rat on the people’s decision to leave”. Here is a Guardian Opinion panel with verdicts on the Jeremy Corbyn speech from Owen Jones, Giles Fraser, Katy Balls, David Shariatmadari and Faiza Shaheen. Nigel Farage, the former Ukip leader, has accused Labour of selling out over Brexit. The CBI has also broadly welcomed Jeremy Corbyn’s speech (although it still has considerable reservations about his overall economic agenda). This is from Carolyn Fairbairn, the CBI director general. The Labour leader’s commitment to a customs union will put jobs and living standards first by remaining in a close economic relationship with the EU. It will help grow trade without accepting freedom of movement or payments to the EU. Growing trade is not an ‘either or’ question – Germany already exports five times as much with China as the UK from within the customs union. Many thousands of ambitious UK firms are looking to break into new markets. These companies need government to focus on making access to markets simpler, not putting up barriers to our most important trading partner. Importantly, a customs union will go part of the way to providing a real-world solution to the Irish border question that is of such urgent concern to the people and firms of Northern Ireland. This evidence cannot be ignored. To do so would create barriers where there are none, risking prosperity and future living standards. But businesses have their eyes wide open on Labour’s overall rhetoric on re-nationalisation. If Labour turns its back on good collaboration between the Government and the private sector - putting vital sectors solely in the hands of politicians - public services, infrastructure and taxpayers will ultimately pay the price. The CBI will continue to engage with the Labour Party to find better solutions to the shared challenges we face. Here is the full text of the Jeremy Corbyn speech. These are from Gerard Batten, the acting leader of Ukip. And Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, has criticised the Corbyn speech too. In a statement issued by Conservative HQ, Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, says staying in a customs union would mean “betraying millions of Labour voters”. Fox said: This is a cynical attempt by Labour to try and frustrate the Brexit process and play politics with our country’s future – all the while, betraying millions of Labour voters. Labour’s confused policy would be bad for jobs and wages, it would leave us unable to sign up to comprehensive free trade deals, and it doesn’t respect the result of the referendum. This is another broken promise by Labour. Only the Conservatives are getting on with delivering what British people voted for, taking back control of our laws, borders and money. Not for the first time, the Tories seem to have lifted their attack line from a Daily Mail headline (although the Mail story is based on comments from Labour Brexiters who have critcised the new party policy.) The Institute of Directors has given a qualified welcome to Jeremy Corbyn’s announcement, partially vindicating George Osborne’s claim about the speech making Labour more pro-business than the Tories. (See 11.55am.) But the IoD says it thinks its plan for a hybrid customs union is better. Stephen Martin, the IoD director general, said: Labour has widened the debate today on the UK’s relationship with the EU post-Brexit, and many businesses, particularly manufacturers, will be pleased to hear the opposition’s proposal to keep a customs union on the table. It was important to see Jeremy Corbyn putting emphasis on the complexity of cross-border ‘just-in-time’ supply chains that could face significant new costs and barriers without one. As with everything about the Brexit process, however, extracting detailed and specific answers on the future trade arrangements from our political leaders has been a slow and laborious process. There are no easy solutions here. A full customs union would make life simpler for goods exporters, but it is not clear whether Jeremy Corbyn is proposing that Brussels negotiate trade deals for the UK even after Brexit. It is hard to see how the EU could simply extend its trade agreements to a sizeable non-member state without a fundamental revision of its Treaties. We advocate instead a partial customs union covering all industrial goods, in conjunction with a broader FTA [free trade agreement] for the many other areas that would be needed to ensure frictionless trade with the EU. This would minimise disruption to the UK’s manufacturing industries, but also allow the UK to set its own tariffs and negotiate them down on products ranging from cheese and chocolate to sugar and oranges. It would also give the UK control over much of its own anti-dumping regime. George Osborne’s Evening Standard has welcomed Jeremy Corbyn’s intervention. In its leader, which Osborne, the former chancellor, has promoted on Twitter, it says Corbyn has now made Labour more pro-business than the Tories. The Labour leader has, with the smallest of nudges, manoeuvred himself into a more pro-business, pro-free trade European policy than the Tory Government. He has also opened up the looming prospect of the Prime Minister suffering a huge defeat in the Commons, as the number of Tory MPs who agree with remaining in a customs union grows each week. The Evening Standard has warned consistently that this would happen since the moment the last election result became clear. So did the Chancellor of the Exchequer, many sensible Cabinet members, business groups, Tory peers and backbench MPs. But the warnings were ignored and the Conservative leadership instead chose to appease the hardcore Brexiteers, obsessed with the ideological purity of their experiment and — in some cases — openly willing to lose an election, if that’s the price of pursuing it. Rebecca Long-Bailey takes a question from a non-journalist. It is an easy one. “Please will you hurry up and be our prime minister?” Corbyn does not reply, but John Humphrys’ job is safe. This has not gone down well with the hacks. Back to questions from journalists. Q: Are you hoping Labour MPs will join with Tory rebels to defeat the government? Corbyn says Labour will put its view to parliament. It is fighting to win the next election, he says. He says there is no future in turning this county into “some sort of xenophobic offshore island”. He says Labour is serious about investing in every community in the country. Surely the political class should learn a lesson from the referendum, he says. Corbyn says politicians should learn a lesson from the EU referendum, and not ignore the concerns of poor communities. Q: Will Labour fund adequate policing on the streets. Corbyn says Labour is committed to increasing police numbers by 10,000. And that’s it. The Q&amp;A is over. I will be posting reaction, a summary and analysis shortly. Q: What do you say to people in Coventry worried about the impact of Brexit on jobs in the region? Corbyn says this area relies heavily on trade with Europe. He wants to protect those jobs, he says. He says his plans should be good news for people in Coventry. Q: The EU says the UK can only guarantee no hard border in Ireland by staying in the single market. Do you accept this? And would you be willing to accept this? Corbyn says the Good Friday agreement was an enormous step forward. That historic movement came about because very brave people were prepared to talk. No one wants to lose that. So there has to be a customs union. Q: A group called Our Future, Our Choice is trying to persuade you to back a second referendum. Could they change your mind? Corbyn says Labour is demanding a meaningful vote in parliament on the final deal. There is a lot of negotiating to be done. Labour is not proposing a second referendum, he says. Q: If you go into a customs union, you might just get a ‘right to be heard’ when the EU negotiates trade deals, not a veto. Could you live with that? Corbyn says he has set out what he wants to achieve. He wants the UK to be consulted. Trade deals currently have human rights clauses in them. But they are seldom enforced. He says he would like to see things like this strengthened. The UK would not have to be a rule taker. It is a big economy. Barry Gardiner, the shadow international trade secretary, has set this out, he says. Q: A QC has pointed out today that some EU countries spend more on state aid than the UK does. And the Scandinavian countries spend more than the UK on public services. What Labour policies would single market rules stop you implementing? Corbyn says competition rules and state aid rules are an issue. For example, when the UK government nationalised RBS, it had to sell off bits. And mail is a natural monopoly. He says he does not accept that there needs to be competition in that field. Or in water, where only one water pipe goes to each house. And here is Corbyn’s peroration. The European Union is not the root of all our problems and leaving it will not solve all our problems. Likewise, the EU is not the source of all enlightenment and leaving it does not inevitably spell doom for our country. There will be some who will tell you that Brexit is a disaster for this country and some who will tell you that Brexit will create a land of milk and honey. The truth is more down to earth and it’s in our hands. Brexit is what we make of it together, the priorities and choices we make in the negotiations. This Conservative government is damaging our country and their priorities for Brexit risk increasing the damage. But I also know, what a Labour government could do for this country and that our priorities for Brexit negotiations are the right ones, to create a country that works for the many not the few. Thank you. Corbyn says free market economics has not worked. Labour is the Party of the new common sense on the economy, on public services and on Brexit. The only party which recognises the world has changed these last ten years and know we cannot continue with widening inequality deregulation of industry and privatisation of public services. We are in a country where Tory-run councils are collapsing because of cuts. Where homeless people are dying on the streets in the shadow of the Parliament. Where good jobs are being lost, because we have a government that will not get a grip on the casino economy. In or out of the European Union, we have to deal with that reality, the reality of market failure and austerity. The free market has not worked in the banking sector. It has not worked in the water industry. It has not worked in the energy utilities. It has crashed in out-sourcing and it has failed our fragmented railways. And it has led to a labour market where abuse is rife. Corbyn says he was Eurosceptic, but not anti-European. I have long opposed the embedding of free market orthodoxy and the democratic deficit in the European Union, and that is why I campaigned to ‘remain and reform’ in the referendum campaign. Scepticism is healthy especially when dealing with politicians or the received wisdom of the political and media establishment, but often the term “Eurosceptic” in reality became synonymous with “anti-European”. And I am not anti-European at all, I want to see close and progressive cooperation with the whole of Europe after Brexit. Corbyn rejects Theresa May’s attack on citizens of the world. We live in a globalised world, the lives we lead are dependent on the work of others and our trade with those from around the world. Many of us have friends and family that are from or who live in other parts of the world. In contrast to the prime minister who said, “if you believe you’re a citizen of the world, you’re a citizen of nowhere”. We believe in fact that we can only fully achieve what we want to as citizens of Britain by also recognising we are “citizens of the world”. Corbyn identifies further threats to humanity. Third, the unprecedented numbers of people fleeing conflict, persecution, human rights abuses, social breakdown and climate disasters. The global refugee crisis and there are 65 million refugees across the world that crisis is a challenge, much of which is on the borders of Europe and that challenge can be met by co-ordinating with our European neighbours, both to crack down on the people smugglers who put men, women and children to sea in unseaworthy vessels. And as Operation Sophia tried to rescue those from the seas around Europe as too many desperate people are drowning in pursuit of sanctuary. These are people who are simply seeking refuge from cruelty and suffering they want to make a contribution and, but for accident of birth, it could be any of us ... And finally, I want to briefly address the use of unilateral military action and intervention rather than diplomacy and negotiation to resolve disputes and change governments. Let us learn the lessons of Iraq, Libya and Afghanistan and be clear that we will not take our country down the road of regime change wars again. The real answer is genuine international cooperation, which confronts the root causes of conflict, persecution and inequality, and we will continue to play a role in partnership with the EU in that effort. Corbyn is now talking about how the UK should be working with other countries to tackle the four greatest threats to humanity. (They don’t include Brexit.) We must work with other countries to advance the cause of human rights to confront the four greatest and interconnected threats facing our common humanity: First, the growing concentration of unaccountable wealth and power in the hands of a tiny corporate elite. We must challenge that working with our European neighbours to stop those who would play one country off against another or those who hide their wealth offshore to avoid paying their dues. Second, climate change which is creating instability and fuelling conflict across the world and threatening all our futures. No matter how much we enforce them pollution stubbornly refuses to respect our borders. We can only tackle climate change, pollution and environmental degradation by working together and many of our closest allies in that struggle are in Europe. Corbyn insists on Labour’s internationalism. The constitution of the Labour Party includes a commitment to support the United Nations. A promise “to secure peace, freedom, democracy, economic security and environmental protection for all” Some want to use Brexit to turn Britain in on itself, seeing everyone as a feared competitor. Others want to use Brexit to put rocket boosters under our current economic system’s insecurities and inequalities, turning Britain into a deregulated corporate tax haven with low wages, limited rights, and cut-price public services in what would be a destructive race to the bottom. Labour stands for a completely different future drawing on the best internationalist traditions of the labour movement and our country. Corbyn turns back to Northern Ireland. The devolution of the last Labour government completed the peace process in Northern Ireland, which we must cherish. The Good Friday agreement was a great achievement and I pay tribute to the work done by Tony Blair, Mo Mowlam and all sides in Northern Ireland to secure that agreement. We must continue to support the restoration of the Northern Ireland assembly and to ensure we maintain the situation of no hard border in Northern Ireland. And from there he moves on to devolution. The previous Labour government also brought powers closer to home in Scotland and Wales establishing the Scottish parliament and the Welsh assembly. And so, Labour believes that powers over devolved policy areas currently exercised by the EU should go directly to the relevant devolved body after Brexit, so that power is closer to the people. Corbyn says Labour would address skills shortages. At the general election, Labour set out plans to invest in a National Education Service with free college and university training to tackle those shortages. People do feel frustrated when they are denied opportunities to re-train or improve their skills and employers instead import skilled labour from abroad. We will also restore free ESOL courses so that people who come here whether as migrants or refugees can learn English and fully participate in their communities and workplaces. We also set out how we would tighten labour market regulations and strengthen trade union rights to tackle the insecurity and exploitation of all workers. Corbyn turns to immigration. It was alarming that after the Brexit vote there was a clear rise in xenophobic and racist attacks on our streets. The referendum campaign was divisive and some politicians on the Leave side whipped up fears and division in order to further their cause that built on the shameful vans telling immigrants to ‘Go Home’ that the then Home Secretary instructed to trundle round the country stirring up division. I remember just after the referendum result receiving a text from a young person in my constituency who had been subjected to abuse in the street for the first time and who was afraid. Our immigration system will change and freedom of movement will as a statement of fact end when we leave the European Union. But we have also said that in trade negotiations our priorities are growth, jobs and people’s living standards. We make no apologies for putting those aims before bogus immigration targets. Labour would design our immigration policy around the needs of the economy based on fair rules and the reasonable management of migration. We would not do what this government is doing, start from rigid red lines on immigration and then work out what that means for the economy afterwards. As Diane Abbott, our shadow home secretary, set out last week, “We do not begin with, ‘how do we reduce immigration?’, and to hell with the consequences. Those are Tory policies and Tory values”. But Corbyn goes on to stress the conditions that would apply. In our transport networks, our energy markets and our digital infrastructure, too often Britain lags behind. So we would also seek to negotiate protections, clarifications or exemptions where necessary in relation to privatisation and public service competition directives state aid and procurement rules and the posted workers directive. We cannot be held back inside or outside the EU from taking the steps we need to support cutting edge industries and local business, stop the tide of privatisation and outsourcing or from preventing employers being able to import cheap agency labour to undercut existing pay and conditions. Corbyn turns to the single market. And Labour would negotiate a new and strong relationship with the single market that includes full tariff-free access and a floor under existing rights, standards and protections. That new relationship would need to ensure we can deliver our ambitious economic programme, take the essential steps to intervene, upgrade and transform our economy and build an economy for the 21st century that works for the many, not the few. Corbyn says Labour would maintain existing standards after Brexit. Labour respects the result of the referendum and Britain is leaving the EU. But we will not support any Tory deal that would do lasting damage to jobs, rights and living standards. Some seem very keen on downgrading our trading links with Europe. But we do not believe that deals with the US or China, would be likely to compensate for a significant loss of trade with our trading neighbours in the EU, and the government’s own leaked assessments show that. Both the US and China have weaker standards and regulations that would risk dragging Britain into a race to the bottom on vital protections and rights at work. And Labour is implacably opposed to our NHS or other public services being part of any trade deal with Trump’s America or a revived TTIP-style deal with the EU, which would open the door to a flood of further privatisations. And we are not prepared to ask the British public to eat chlorinated chicken and lower the standards of British farming. We would ensure there will be no reduction in rights, standards or protections and instead seek to extend them. But Corbyn sets conditions. But we are also clear that the option of a new UK customs union with the EU would need to ensure the UK has a say in future trade deals. A new customs arrangement would depend on Britain being able to negotiate agreement of new trade deals in our national interest. Labour would not countenance a deal that left Britain as a passive recipient of rules decided elsewhere by others. That would mean ending up as mere rule takers. In contrast the Conservative government has moved from saying it wanted trade with the EU after Brexit to be “tariff-free” to saying it wants trade to be “as tariff-free as possible”. In which sectors of the economy and industry does the government think it would be acceptable for there to be tariffs? Like with so much else, they haven’t spelled that out. But that is the consequence of ruling out the option of a customs union, which this government has done. So I appeal to MPs of all parties, prepared to put the people’s interests before ideological fantasies, to join us in supporting the option of a new UK customs union with the EU, that would give us a say in future trade deals. Corbyn confirms Labour would seek a customs unions with the EU. Labour would seek a final deal that gives full access to European markets and maintains the benefits of the single market and the customs union as the Brexit Secretary, David Davis promised in the House of Commons, with no new impediments to trade and no reduction in rights, standards and protections. We have long argued that a customs union is a viable option for the final deal. So Labour would seek to negotiate a new comprehensive UK-EU customs union to ensure that there are no tariffs with Europe and to help avoid any need for a hard border in Northern Ireland. Corbyn says the government is in disarray over the transition. Labour spelled out the need for a stable transition period last summer. Both the TUC and CBI agree. We thought the government had accepted that case but they now seem to be in disarray on the issue again. Time after time with this government, anything agreed at breakfast is being briefed against by lunch and abandoned by teatime. Disarray is, it seems, the new ‘strong and stable’. Corbyn is now talking about the single market. We are leaving the European Union but we will still be working with European partners in the economic interests of this country. When 44% of our exports are to EU countries and 50% of our imports come from the EU, then it is in both our interests for that trade to remain tariff-free. It would damage businesses that export to Europe and the jobs that depend on those exports for there to be the additional costs of tariffs and it would damage consumers here, already failed by stagnant wages and rising housing costs. So we will remain close to the European Union, that’s obvious. Every country, whether it’s Turkey, Switzerland, or Norway that is geographically close to the EU, without being an EU member state has some sort of close relationship to the EU. Some more advantageous than others. And Britain will need a bespoke, negotiated relationship of its own. Corbyn says the UK should remain in some EU agencies. It makes no sense for the UK to abandon EU agencies and tariff-free trading rules that have served us well, supporting our industrial sectors, protecting workers and consumers and safeguarding the environment. If that means negotiating to support individual EU agencies, rather than paying more to duplicate those agencies here then that should be an option, not something ruled out because of phoney jingoistic posturing. So we will want to remain a part of agencies like Euratom, regulating nuclear materials in energy and health sectors and programmes like Erasmus that give students opportunities to study across Europe, because they serve our interests. Corbyn pays tribute to his colleagues. I want to pay tribute to Keir Starmer and Rebecca Long-Bailey, Barry Gardiner and Emily Thornberry, who are grappling with these issues. They are a serious and united team. Now you know I don’t do personal but let me simply say this: that is in some contrast to their opposite numbers. Corbyn is now plunging into some granular Brexit detail. For 45 years our economy has become increasingly linked into the European Union. Many of our laws and regulations are set and monitored by joint European authorities, from implementing rules on use of pesticides to assessing the levels of fluoride in our drinking water. The European Food Safety Authority plays a vital role in monitoring the substances used in manufacturing or growing our food using the latest scientific evidence to assess whether substances are likely to have harmful effects on human or animal health. While the European Chemicals Agency carries out the vital task of evaluating and authorising chemicals as safe for use. And many businesses have supply chains and production processes, interwoven throughout Europe. Take the UK car industry, which supports 169,000 manufacturing jobs, 52,000 of which are here in the West Midlands. If we look at the example of one of Britain’s most iconic brands in this sector, the Mini, we begin to see how reliant our automotive industry is on a frictionless, interwoven supply chain. A mini will cross the Channel three times in a 2,000-mile journey before the finished car rolls off the production line. Starting in Oxford it will be shipped to France to be fitted for key components before being brought back to BMW’s Hams Hall plant in Warwickshire where it is drilled and milled into shape. Once this process is complete the mini will be sent to Munich to be fitted with its engine, before ending its journey back at the mini plant in Oxford for final assembly. If that car is to be sold on the continent then many of its components will have crossed the Channel four times. The sheer complexity of these issues demand that we are practical and serious about this next stage. Corbyn turns back to the Tories. The government seems much more concerned about cutting deals with each other and for their friends and funders in the City. Corbyn says many of the areas that voted for Brexit are places that have lost out. So many of the areas that voted to Leave are the same areas that have lost out from years of chronic under-investment. Areas where too many people are held back by a lack of opportunities, where people feel the system is rigged against them because they can’t get a decent secure job, can’t afford to buy a home, can’t get more hours or higher pay, can’t afford to retire or aren’t able to escape the spiral of debt. He says Labour wants a Brexit for all communities. That is why Labour wants a Brexit for all our people. One that offers security to workers in the car industry worried about their future, hope to families struggling to pay the bills each month and opportunity to young people wanting a decent job and a home of their own. And Corbyn says the third principle underling Labour’s approach is internationalism. The third is our global perspective. We are leaving the European Union but we are not leaving Europe. We are not throwing up protectionist barriers, closing the borders and barricading ourselves in. And we want a close and cooperative relationship with the whole of Europe after Brexit. We are internationalists. We know that our interests are bound up with millions of others across the world, whether that’s in order to tackle the huge challenge of climate change, build a more peaceful world or clamp down on the tax dodging elite, who think by bestriding the globe they can avoid paying their share for vital public services. Corbyn adds a line about Ireland. No one should be willing to sacrifice the Good Friday Agreement, the basis for 20 years of relative peace, development and respect for diversity in Northern Ireland. Here is my colleague Gaby Hinsliff on the speech so far. Corbyn says today he will give more details about Labour’s approach to Brexit. Here are the principles, he says. The first is our overriding mission: that whatever is negotiated must put people’s jobs and living standards first. The Brexit process must not leave our people and country worse off. We are committed to building a more prosperous and a more equal Britain, in which every region benefits and no community is left behind, as we set out in our manifesto. And that is what underpins our approach to Brexit. The second is unity. Most people in our country, regardless of whether they voted leave of remain want better jobs, more investment, stronger rights and greater equality. So we will not let those who want to sow divisions drive this process. No scapegoating of migrants, no setting one generation against another and no playing off the nations of the UK. This gets a round of applause - the first so far. Corbyn says more people are living in poverty than ever. The government’s attempts to get rid of the deficit keep being put down. After years of bluster, the Tories have been found out. They have no economic plan, he says. He says the Tories have spent the last eight years not giving money to the NHS, even though they have cut taxes for the rich and for corporations. Yet the NHS has been subjected to the longest financial squeeze in its history. He says Labour will give the NHS the money it needs, by raising taxes for the top 5%. It will not just promise money on the side of a bus. Corbyn says Labour also pushed for a transition period on existing terms. And it has opposed the return of a hard border in Ireland. And it has pushed for parliament to have a meaningful vote. Corbyn says Labour’s message has been consistent; it respects the results of the referendum, and wants to get the best deal for jobs and living standards. It has pushed the government to act, he says. (See 9.27am.) Corbyn says next month the most critical phase of the Brexit talks will start. But the county is still in the dark about what this divided government wants from Brexit. The government has soundbites, he says. Boris Johnson says it will be a liberal Brexit. Theresa May says it will be a red, white and blue one. On other days she says there will be a bespoke deal, he says. But the truth is we really don’t know much more about where they are heading in these talks. Jeremy Corbyn is starting his speech now. He begins by offering condolences to those killed in the fire in Leicester. Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, is introducing Jeremy Corbyn now. Jeremy Corbyn is due to start his speech any moment now. Yesterday Allie Renison, head of Europe and trade policy at the Insitute of Directors, said he thought that Keir Starmer was mistaken if he thought Brussels would negotiate trade deals on the UK’s behalf if it was in a customs union. (See 10.30am.) But Peter Foster, the Telegraph’s Europe editor, thinks the EU would be more flexible. Although David Davis’s Telegraph article (paywall) ends with the hypocritical-sounding “snake oil” jibe (see 9.21am), most of it focused on two more substantial complaints about the proposed Labour policy. Davis says staying in the customs union would mean the UK losing control of its trade policy. By forcing the UK to maintain a single external tariff and common commercial policy, both of which are set in Brussels, a customs union would prevent us from signing economy-boosting, job-creating free trade deals with other countries around the world. This is one of the central prizes of Brexit. It represents an opportunity to use our agility and commercial strength to create jobs and wealth here in Britain. The only way we can do this is if we have control over our own trade policy and are able to tailor agreements to our own needs, not those of 28 different countries. Being inside a customs union would make this impossible. These were points not lost on Labour at the last election when they promised to “work with global trading partners to develop “best-in-class” free trade and investment agreements”. They are now certain to throw this opportunity away in favour of a system for which the only existing precedent is Turkey. This would see the EU offering access to the UK market in their third country negotiations, without any reciprocal access for the UK. And he says the Labour plan would stop the government being able to use tariffs to protect its own industries. Membership of a customs union, with a common commercial policy, gives the EU the exclusive right to put in place remedies to tackle anti-competitive practices. This means that inside a customs union the UK would not be able to take action on the trade challenges we face, whether it’s the dumping of steel on the UK market, or any other heavily subsidised good. In his interview with Andrew Marr yesterday (pdf), Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, partially addressed this point by saying that Labour would seek to negotiate a new arrangement with the EU that would allow the UK to have some kind of say in EU trade policy. In his Financial Times column (paywall) Wolfgang Münchau says staying in a customs union with the EU would be a decent outcome for the UK. Here’s an extract. The EU will demand a degree of political convergence as a price for a customs union. It would, I presume, not require the UK to accept freedom of movement. This alone may make the customs union attractive from the UK’s perspective. But it would be a mistake to think of a customs union agreement as non-intrusive. The EU could, for example, insist on a relatively open immigration regime in the UK, something that might resemble free movement in practice. There is no economic reason to link the free movement of traded goods and of people. But politics could intrude. A customs union would have to be ratified by all 27 member states, including states that have little to gain from the smooth flow of goods, but a lot to lose from UK immigration controls. The EU as a whole would object to any immigration regime that directly or indirectly discriminates against some member states. Personally, I am struggling to understand why one would want a customs union when one can have the Norway-option. The EEA would have allowed for much wider market access, albeit at the cost of accepting freedom of movement. As net immigration from the EU is falling rapidly, the whole freedom of movement issue will lose its importance. Be that as it may, a customs union agreement would still constitute a decent second-best option because it would minimise disruption in trade flows, and solve the Northern Ireland problem. Charles Grant, director of the Centre for European Reform, says Münchau is right. And this is how political parties and campaign groups responded to the Corbyn extracts released overnight. From Steve Baker, the Brexit minister, responding officially on behal of the Conservatives Ever since the referendum, Labour have flitted between offering false reassurances and trying to frustrate Brexit – rather than getting on and making it work. Just last week the shadow chancellor said Labour are open to a second referendum. Only the Conservatives will get the best Brexit deal for the whole country, properly delivering on the referendum vote to get control of our money, borders and laws, while building a strong new relationship with Europe. From Tom Brake, the Lib Dem Brexit spokesman, on behalf of his party The Conservatives are making a mess of Brexit and Jeremy Corbyn now needs to show some strength and change course. ‘A jobs-first approach to Brexit’ is a dangerous, meaningless and totally undeliverable soundbite with Britain out of the single market. The damage leaving the single market and customs union will do to our economy poses a real risk to the NHS and public services. Corbyn needs to listen to those in his party who are calling for him to change direction. If Jeremy Corbyn carries on down this path of ‘having your cake and eating it’, it would be another betrayal to those who believe that strong public services have to be underpinned by a strong economy, and Britain staying in the single market and customs union is crucial to that. From the Labour MP Chuka Umunna, in a statement issued by Open Britain, which is campaigning for a soft Brexit It is very welcome indeed that Labour is now fully committed to participating in the customs union on the same terms as we do now, putting clear red water between Labour and the Conservatives on that issue. But the only way to retain the benefits of the single market and customs union, and to avoid a hard Irish border, is to continue to be part of both as the TUC has made clear. It is the best anti-austerity policy too because it avoids a huge negative impact on revenues to the Exchequer if we Brexit. From the Labour peer Lord Adonis, in a statement issued by Best for Britain, which is opposed to Brexit and campaigning for a second referendum I’ve always believed that - in the end - Jeremy Corbyn would do the right thing and offer the British people a final say on Theresa May’s Brexit treaty. Today’s speech moves the Labour party a further step in the direction of a referendum to stop Brexit. The Labour Party has shown today that it is no longer prepared to give Theresa May a free hand to destroy Britain’s strategic and economic relationships to appease her party’s Brexit hard-liners. But time is running out and this is not a time for pussy-footing around. Labour needs to commit, urgently, to a final say on the Brexit deal. That is the only way that we can protect Britain from a disastrous Brexit. Labour released some extracts from Jeremy Corbyn’s speech overnight. Here they are in full. On Brexit not being as bad or as good as some people claim The European Union is not the root of all our problems and leaving it will not solve all our problems. Likewise, the EU is not the source of all enlightenment and leaving it does not inevitably spell doom for our country. There will be some who will tell you that Brexit is a disaster for this country and some who will tell you that Brexit will create a land of milk and honey. The truth is more down to earth and it’s in our hands: Brexit is what we make of it together. On how Labour has influenced government policy on Brexit Our message has been consistent since the vote to leave 20 months ago. We respect the result of the referendum. Our priority is to get the best deal for people’s jobs, living standards and the economy. We reject any race to the bottom in workers’ rights, environmental safeguards, consumer protections, or food safety standards. And we’ve pushed the Government to act to guarantee the rights of EU citizens living here and of UK citizens who have made their homes elsewhere in Europe; to ensure a transition period on the existing terms to minimise disruption and avoid an economic cliff edge; to avoid any return to a hard border in Northern Ireland; and to guarantee Parliament a meaningful vote on the final deal. On Labour’s stance on the single market Every country that is geographically close to the EU without being an EU member state, whether it’s Turkey, Switzerland, or Norway, has some sort of close relationship to the EU, some more advantageous than others. Britain will need a bespoke relationship of its own. Labour would negotiate a new and strong relationship with the single market that includes full tariff-free access and a floor under existing rights, standards and protections. That new relationship would need to ensure we can deliver our ambitious economic programme, take the essential steps to upgrade and transform our economy, and build an economy for the 21st century that works for the many, not the few. So we would also seek to negotiate protections, clarifications or exemptions, where necessary, in relation to privatisation and public service competition directives, state aid and procurement rules and the posted workers directive. We cannot be held back, inside or outside the EU, from taking the steps we need to support cutting edge industries and local business, stop the tide of privatisation and outsourcing or prevent employers being able to import cheap agency labour from abroad to undercut existing pay and conditions. If you were looking for an example how political satire how become impossible, you could do a lot worse than look at today’s Daily Telegraph splash. David Davis, whose own Brexit proposals have been widely criticised by EU leaders for being wholly unrealistic, is accusing Labour of peddling “snake oil” on the subject. In a comment article for the paper (paywall) the Brexit secretary writes: Labour may think they have stumbled across a simple solution to Brexit, but there is a lesson they are yet to learn: if it looks like snake oil, and it smells like snake oil, don’t expect it to make you feel better. Actually, Davis is generally more grounded than some of his Tory Brexiter colleagues and to a certain extent both main parties are vulnerable to the charge of Anglo-Saxon cakeism on Brexit. At PMQs last week, when Jeremy Corbyn asked Theresa May to explain what her desired Brexit outcome was, she batted aside the question with the short reply: “A bespoke economic partnership.” In his speech today, setting out what Labour wants from Brexit, Corbyn will say the UK needs “a bespoke relationship of its own”. But any lingering similarities between the two parties should not distract from the all-important differences, which have existed since the referendum and which Corbyn will today firm up in a speech committing Labour to keeping the UK in some form of customs union with the EU. It is an important moment because, as Matthew d’Ancona explains in his Guardian column today, Corbyn has now identified the faultline that has the best chance of dislodging eight-plus Tories from their party, the number needed to enable Labour to defeat May. As Matthew says, Corbyn’s “conversion is not to soft Brexit, but to a hard knock on the door of No 10.” Here is our overnight story. I will be covering the speech in full, as well as bringing you reaction and analysis. Here is the agenda for the day. 10.30am: Jeremy Corbyn gives his Brexit speech in Coventry. 1pm: David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister, gives a Brexit speech in North Wales. He will promise “a very big change” to a key Brexit bill in the hope of resolving the deadlock between London and the devolved administrations over what happens to powers being repatriated from Brussels. 2.30pm: Amber Rudd, the home secretary, takes questions in the Commons.

With Wall Street adding to last weeks gains, Europe was on the front foot for most of the day. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 45.17 points or 0.62% higher at 7289.58 Germany’s Dax rose 0.35% to 12,527.04 France’s Cac climbed 0.51% to 5344.26 Italy’s FTSE MIB added 0.15% 22,706.21 Spain’s Ibex ended 0.81% higher at 9902.4 But in Greece, the Athens market slipped 0.84% to 837.04 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 279 points or 1.1% higher. On that note, it’s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we’ll be back tomorrow. Commenting on Draghi, Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: Speaking today, Mario Draghi stuck to his view that continued accommodation was necessary, and this was enough to drive the euro sharply lower against the US dollar, catching a few overeager euro bulls on the hop. Clearly the ECB is in no rush at all to taper further. ‘Sufficient unto the day’ would appear to be the message that this central banker is sending. Of course, the big event is still to come this week, as the new Fed chairman appears before US lawmakers. Draghi’s dovishness is a given, but Mr Powell is something more of an unknown quantity. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, added: Mario Draghi...stated inflation in the currency bloc is still conditional on the stimulus programme. Mr Draghi has a track record of leaving the door open to additional monetary easing, and it sounds like he hasn’t changed his ways. A final string of questions, including: Is monetary policy the only main tool for the recovery? Draghi: No, you must be tired of hearing this, I have been saying it for five years, structural reforms are of key importance. How can we avoid currency wars? Draghi: there is no currency war, the worries of the governing council are about increasing volatility which might cause an unwanted tightening of financial conditions in the eurozone. Question about Greece’s inflation not being on target. Draghi says the longer and more dramatic the recessession, the slower the rate of inflation getting towards its target. The improvement in the situation should strengthen the belief the objective will be reached. But the ECB target is not individual country’s inflation target but the eurozone as a whole. And the session concludes. Question on non performing loans at banks. Draghi says the case for tackling NPLs in a determined way is clear. Banks with high stock of NPLs have given less credit to the economy, high NPLs mean less support to firms and households, harming growth. Question: will QE need to be pursued further than 2018 if targets not met. Draghi says the possible extension of QE has not been discussed by the governing council. What I have been saying, in the presence of an improving economic situation, we need the right blend of three features. We are more confident that inflation is proceeding towards our objective, but we have to be persistent and patient. Headline inflation is still not within our objective, that will be key measure of monetary policy in coming months. The effects of monetary policy have been produced by several measures, one is net asset purchases, another is the stock of assets accumulated by the ECB. The governing council will keep on reinvesting bonds that come to maturity for a length of time after end of QE. Guidance on interest rates is very important, and the “well past” comment is very important. Question about Draghi’s controversial membership of G30 group and what he will say to ombudsman. Draghi says we have taken note of ombudsman letter and will provide an answer by the allotted time, in April. Question on failure of Latvian bank. Draghi says he won’t comment on details of emergency liquidity assistance to the bank, shortly before it failed. Another question on Greece’s performance. Draghis says, almost all agreed prior actions have been implemented, just two left, expected to be completed in next two weeks. Question on Greece, and whether a fourth programme will be needed. Draghi says, lot has been done at Greece, but certain prior actions need to be taken place in the next two weeks. At the ECB we didn’t discuss further programmes. Supplementary question on a bubble in asset prices causing the financial crisis. Draghi says expansive monetary policy is one way of explaining the financial crisis. Another is the dismantling of existing financial legislation. Expansionary policy is required by our mandate so the last thing we want to see is the dismantling of existing legislation. Question on including house prices or all asset prices in the ECB’s inflation measurements. Draghi says our primarily objective is to hit the inflation target, our focus on consumer prices can best preserve the purchasing power of the people in the euro area. We assess asset prices, for example on wealth effects and financial conditions. Question on the appointments to the ECB board, and the fact there are no women on the board. Draghi reads out the articles of the treaty about appointments. Then he adds, diversity and gender diversity is one of strategic priorities, we are aiming to do more than we have achieved so far. Question on the US tax reforms. Draghi says US tax reforms will support the US and US corporates, but it is too early to say if the spillovers will be significant for the euro area. It will reshape the tax landscape in the world. The implications are complex. We have seen money outflows from European corporates to US corporates. For the time being we are observing these flows but it is hard to say what the long term consequences are. On the financial effects of Brexit, he says the EU should finalised clearing measures ahead of Brexit: Let me also stress the crucial importance of finalising the adoption of key pieces of EU legislation... well in advance of Brexit, in order to be prepared for all possible contingencies, including a no-deal scenario. Failing to do so could leave central banks and supervisors without the appropriate tools to handle the risks.. Delayed plane flights is the explanation for the late start to the Mario Draghi session at the European parliament, explains the chair of the economic committee Roberto Gualtieri. So he will skip his opening remarks, and will also keep questions short after Draghi’s speech, which belatedly gets underway. Draghi concludes by repeating calls for further policy measures: Our monetary policy measures have had tangible benefits for the euro area economy. Further policy initiatives are however needed to reduce vulnerabilities, strengthen resilience in crisis situations and increase growth potential. Only ambitious policies will deliver concrete benefits for the people of Europe. Europe is growing more strongly than expected but inflation is yet to show sustained signs of moving higher, says Mario Draghi. Ahead of the ECB president’s address to the European Parliament, the bank has released his opening statement. He said: A comprehensive analysis by the Eurosystem has concluded that adverse cyclical factors have played a crucial role in explaining low underlying inflation. These notably consisted of dampened economic activity and high unemployment in the aftermath of the sovereign debt crisis, and subsequently subdued foreign demand and low oil prices. Yet, these factors are of a temporary nature and should not affect inflation over a medium-term horizon, even though they might impact on the speed of adjustment in inflation. He added: Overall, the analysis indicates that the relationship between growth and inflation remains largely intact, even if it has temporarily weakened in recent years to the extent that the speed of adjustment in inflation towards our aim has been affected. Looking ahead, we anticipate that headline inflation will resume its gradual upward adjustment, supported by our monetary policy measures. At the same time, uncertainties continue to prevail. In particular, the recent volatility in financial markets, notably also in the exchange rate, deserves close monitoring with regard to its possible implications for the medium-term outlook for price stability. Therefore, while the strong momentum of the euro area economy has clearly strengthened our confidence in the inflation outlook, patience and persistence with regard to monetary policy is still needed for inflation to sustainably return to levels of below, but close to, 2%. In fact, the evolution of inflation remains crucially conditional on an ample degree of monetary stimulus provided by the full set of our monetary policy measures: our net asset purchases, the sizeable stock of acquired assets and the forthcoming reinvestments, and our forward guidance on policy interest rates. ECB president Mario Draghi is due to start his testimony shortly: US markets have opened higher, ahead of a key testimony by new Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell on Tuesday. Hopes that Powell will keep the Fed on a steady course have helped lift the Dow Jones Industrial Average 153 points or 0.6% in early trading. Meanwhile the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.46% higher and the Nasdaq Composite 0.5% better, helped by a rise in technology shares. As we wait for ECB president Mario Draghi, here’s more on US interest rates. Federal Reserve member James Bullard says he is concerned about the central bank going too far, too fast on interest rates unless the data supports it. And he adds: He also indicated he was not overly concerned about the recent stock market volatility, and he did not think it meant investors were re-thinking the prospects for growth in either the US or globally. Here’s our latest on the Melrose bid for GKN, which is likely to hot up this week. Karl West reports: The hostile £7.4bn battle for control of GKN, one of Britain’s oldest engineering groups, is expected to come to a head this week as the aerospace and auto parts manufacturer reports annual results, which could prompt a raised bid from predator Melrose. GKN is scrapping for its life after rejecting the offer from Melrose, a corporate turnaround firm that specialises in buying unloved industrial assets, improving the financial returns and selling for a huge premium. Melrose has offered 1.49 of its own shares, plus 81p for every one of GKN’s shares. The mainly share-based bid would leave GKN investors with 57% of the enlarged group. Simon Peckham, the chief executive of Melrose, is confident he can pull off a coup and break GKN’s resistance. “Look at what’s happening in the market – our shares are going up and theirs are tracking ours,” he told the Guardian. “It’s their job to explain to investors why they think they are the best management for the business. Their shareholders haven’t told us to go away.” Melrose is expected to raise the stakes following GKN’s results on Tuesday. It is thought the buyout firm may have to sweeten its offer by raising GKN investors’ holding to about 65% of the merged group. The full story is here: The strength of the pound in the wake of weekend comments from the Bank of England’s Dave Ramsden - it is currently up 0.5% at $1.4034 against the dollar - is not limiting the gains in the FTSE 100. The leading index is up 0.55% at 7284, near the highs of the day. Meanwhile European markets are shrugging off a stronger euro, with Germany’s Dax up 0.39% and France’s Cac climbing 0.55%. Forecasts of a stronger opening on Wall Street are helping. After the Dow Jones Industrial Average managed a late spurt on Friday to end the day 347 points or 1.39% higher, the futures are indicating an opening gain of around 169 points. But the outlook for the euro and therefore European markets could be determined later when European Central Bank president Mario Draghi testifies before the European Parliament. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda, said: The ECB has long been preparing the markets for the end of bond buying and recent statements, minutes and comments from Draghi himself have indicated that the central bank intends to give plenty of warning of upcoming changes leading many to expect such a warning in the not too distant future. Draghi may therefore drop further hints on the timing of such a policy shift in today’s hearing which the euro will be particularly sensitive to. It’s another bad morning for hundreds of Carillion workers. The Official Receiver has announced that another 230 employees have been made redundant, following its collapse last month. In happier news, the Receiver has managed to save an extra 456 jobs by finding new suppliers to take on Carillion’s public and private sector contracts. Over the last month, 8,066 jobs have been saved and 1,371 jobs have been made redundant. That means that roughly half of Carillion’s 19,000 workers still face uncertainty, The Receiver is hopeful that more jobs can be saved, saying: Discussions with potential purchasers continue and I expect that the number of jobs safeguarded through the liquidation will continue to rise. I am continuing to engage with staff, elected employee representatives and unions to keep them informed as these arrangements are confirmed. The French economic recovery is gathering pace, says UBS Wealth Management, which has just raised its forecasts for the eurozone’s second-largest member. UBS now expects the French economy to grow by 2.3% this year, up from 1.8% previously. In 2019, it now expects GDP to rise by 2%, up from an earlier forecast of 1.6%. A year ago, investors were fretting that far-right candidate Marine Le Pen might become France’s new president. Things look brighter today, says Dean Turner, Economist at UBS Wealth Management: “Along with the rest of the Eurozone, the outlook for the French economy has improved sharply. The risks around last year’s presidential elections now seem like a distant memory. “Following his election and subsequent parliamentary landslide, Emmanuel Macron’s willingness to embark on his ambitious program of domestic structural reforms has led to a renewed confidence in the outlook for the economy. The current sense of optimism amongst French firms should mean that investment continues to rise, and the outlook for hiring remains positive.” Back in the markets, shares in outsourcing group Interserve have slumped by almost 10% today. Interserve provides services to the UK government across health, education and defence. It has been under tight scrutiny since the collapse of Carillion last month. According to the Sunday Telegraph, Interserve’s banks are reluctant to back a crucial debt refinancing deal, having already suffered big losses following Carillion’s liquidation. Interserve is hoping to persuade creditors to agree new loans lasting up to five years, to replace emergency funding that expires at the end of March. It has denies that talks with creditors have ‘stumbled’. The UK cabinet office has been watching Interserve closely, and denied that the company could be ‘the next Carillion’. Financial commentator Frances Coppola tweets: Jeremy Leaf, a north London estate agent, reckons that some certainty over Britain’s future relationship with the EU would help the housing market. He writes: “The UK Finance numbers are quite encouraging as they bear out what we have been seeing on the ground - in other words, buyers and sellers are getting on with business, albeit at more realistic prices. Certainly we don’t see any signs of fireworks but nor do we see any major corrections in the market either. Looking forward towards the spring market, we hope for a little bit of better news on the Brexit front which would give more certainty to the market and more balance of supply and demand in this crucial period for the housing market.” Although mortgage approvals rose in January, the amount of money borrowed by UK businesses actually shrank last month. This morning’s report from UK Finance shows that firms owed £263.9bn to Britain’s high street banks in January - 1.4% less than a year ago. As this chart shows, UK businesses have been trimming their debts over the last few months. That may be another sign that firms are cautious about committing to new projects while Brexit remains uncertain. Despite January’s pick-up in mortgage approvals, 2018 is likely to be a tough year for the UK housing market, says Howard Archer of EY. He predicts that the threat of interest rate rises, and weak consumer confidence, means that prices will only rise by 2% this year. If so, that might help some first-time buyers scramble onto the property ladder. Archer writes: The fundamentals for house buyers are likely to remain challenging. Consumers have faced an extended squeeze on purchasing power, and it is likely to ease only gradually as the year progresses. Additionally, housing market activity is likely to be hampered by fragile consumer confidence and limited willingness to engage in major transactions. House buyers will also likely be concerned about further interest rate hikes this year following November’s first tightening of monetary policy by the Bank of England since 2007. While the increase in interest rates was just 0.25% and mortgage rates are still at historically very low levels, there does appear to have been some impact on house buyers’ psychology. We expect the Bank of England to raise interest rates twice in 2018 (each time by 0.25%), with the next move likely in May. Economist Rupert Seggins shows how UK mortgage approvals and house price growth are both weaker than a few years ago: Today’s figures also show that more people remortgaged their homes last month. They may be looking to ‘lock in’ today’s low interest rates, before the Bank of England raises borrowing costs. Simon French of Panmure Gordon predicts that this trend will continue, especially as a May hike is looking more likely.... Here’s a chart showing how UK mortgage approvals (in green) rose in January after cooling towards the end of 2017. Breaking: British mortgage approvals have risen, for the first time in four months. Some 40,117 mortgage loans were approved in January, new industry figures show. That’s an increase on December’s 36,085 -- which was the weakest since April 2013. However, this is still down on January 2017, when 44,259 mortgages were agreed with lenders. The pound is gaining ground this morning, after a senior Bank of England policymaker hinted that interest rates will rise soon. Deputy governor Dave Ramsden told the Sunday Times that: “Relative to where I was, I see the case for rates rising somewhat sooner rather than somewhat later”. That’s significant, as Ramsden opposed last November’s interest rate hike, meaning he’s seen as a dovish member of the Monetary Policy Committee. Traders have driven sterling up by 0.5% this morning, or three-quarters of a cent, to $1.4042. Some City experts believe the Bank will hike interest rates, currently 0.5%, in May. Kit Juckes, foreign exchange expert at Societe Generals, says that “Dave the Dove” has helped the pound overcome “the usual depressing Monday morning Brexit headlines”. Every major European share index has risen this morning, pushing the pan-European Stoxx 600 index up by 0.6%. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says: The DAX was the region’s most robust index, surging nearly 1% to tickle 12600 for the first time since February 7th, while the CAC posted a respectable, 5350-crossing 0.7% increase. It’ll be interesting to see whether Mario Draghi’s testimony in Brussels changes the day’s cheery sentiment. Last year’s brutal hurricane season and other natural disasters wiped more than 90% of insurance firm Hiscox’s annual profits. The Lloyd’s of London firm, which provides cover for anything from burst water pipes to hurricane damage and kidnappings, said 2017 had been a “historic year for catastrophes”. The industry as a whole footed a $140bn bill – the worst year ever for natural disasters. Hiscox’s pretax profits shrank to £30.8m from £354.5m in 2016. Its London market cut premiums by 20% but is now raising them following last year’s hurricanes, earthquakes and wildfires. Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria battered the Caribbean and US Gulf coast in a month. Hiscox shares fell 8% in early trading and are now down almost 5% at £13.29. “Market pricing has improved and as a consequence we have growth ambitions for every part of our business,” said chief executive Bronek Masojada. Some solid corporate results are pushing the London stock market higher this morning. Associated British Foods shares are up 1.5% after it told the City that profits at its Primark fashion chain are expected to accelerate over the next six months. Business supplies company Bunzl have inched up 0.3% after reporting a 13% rise in profits for the last year. Mining companies are also helping to keep the FTSE 100 up this morning. They’re rallying because the US dollar has weakened today (which pushes up commodity prices). Rebecca O’Keeffe, Head of Investment at interactive investor, says: Equity markets in the UK and Europe are off to a good start, following on from a late surge in the US on Friday and a positive start to the week in Asia. Britain’s biggest shopping centre owner Hammerson is adding adventure games and mini golf centres to its malls, after reporting a 6.8% rise in profits to £246m last year. The owner of the Bullring in Birmingham and Brent Cross in London is focusing on providing “experiences” to draw shoppers in, such as ice-skating in the winter and a beach in the summer. Hammerson has just signed up Escape Hunt, which offers games where players solve a crime story or mystery, at Cabot Circus in Bristol and Martineau Galleries in Birmingham. Hammerson’s chief executive David Atkins brushed aside talk of the death of the mall. He told the BBC’s Today programme. “Around 85% of all retail sales do still touch a physical store, so we’re very firmly of the view that the physical store has a genuine place to play.” Hammerson said 98.3% of its space was occupied, a 17-year high. “Our portfolio is focused on the better, bigger shopping centres and we try and provide more than just retail by offering experiences for our shoppers that provide more than just the physical shops,” Atkins added. The company is letting about 40% of its space to fashion, down from 60% a few years ago. At the same, space taken up by leisure and dining has gone up by a third to 14%. A Hammerson spokeswoman explained there was less space allocated to cheaper “fast fashion” (with the notable exception of Primark) while shops selling “athleisure” were taking more space. The chief executive of Bank of Ireland has warned that the uncertainty over Britain’s exit from the European Union is hitting business confidence. Bank of Ireland restored its dividend this morning, for the first time in a decade, after posting an underlying profit of €1,078m last year. But while it hasn’t suffered any ‘material’ hit from Brexit, it can see that companies in Ireland are nervous. CEO Francesca McDonagh told Reuters that some firms, particularly smaller ones, are holding back from investment until they know how Brexit will pan out. McDonagh said: “While uncertainty remains for our UK business, we’ve seen nothing material today with regards to asset quality, there’s nothing that gives us concern. “For our customers in Ireland, there is an element of uncertainty, particularly for smaller businesses. We do see that two out of three business customers intend to invest in their businesses in the coming years but some of them are applying a wait and see approach.” The UK government says it’s committed to avoiding a ‘hard border’ with the Republic of Ireland after Brexit. However, it’s not clear how this can be achieved if Britain leaves the Single Market and the customs union. Research has shown that Ireland could be the EU member most badly affected by Brexit. Two weeks ago, taoiseach Leo Varadkar warned that achieving a frictionless Irish border was “the tricky bit” of the Brexit talks.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Traders faced a chilly commute into the City this morning, as the Beast from the East brings a blast of icy weather - freezing fingers and causing some delays on the rail network... But once they get in, investors are expected to push stocks higher. The main European indices are all rising in early trading, as confidence returns to the markets after the wobbles earlier this month. In London, the FTSE 100 has gained 0.5%, or 38 points, to 7278. Analysts at Royal Bank of Canada say: Equity markets are likely to continue benefitting from the strong economy and thus strong earnings growth despite higher bond yields acting as a drag on P/E ratios. Yet, with corporate bond yields still low, there seems no imminent risk for corporate funding, corporate profits and the economy as a whole.

The latest fortnightly survey of 1,028 respondents suggests voters are more worried about Campion being moved between offices after she left the employ of Joyce as a consequence of their intimate relationship (50%), and by the potential for the excessive use of taxpayer-funded travel entitlements (60%), than they are about Joyce having a sexual relationship with a subordinate (23%). Joyce being given free accommodation in Armidale after his marriage breakup by his friend and prominent local businessman Greg Maguire also rated ahead of the relationship (45%) on a list where respondents were asked to nominate their concerns. With the media frenzy around Joyce’s travails gathering pace over the past fortnight before his resignation as National party leader and deputy prime minister, voters were asked their view about whether journalists should expose the private affairs of politicians. Politicians have been critical, both publicly and privately, of the intrusive media reporting of the Joyce-Campion relationship. The Guardian Essential sample split, with more people approving of the media scrutiny (44%) than disapproving (41%) of it. Coalition voters were more likely to disapprove of the coverage than Labor or Greens voters, or people intending to vote for someone other than the major parties, and older people (55 and over) were more disapproving than voters aged between 25 and 44. The poll was in the field as Joyce confirmed his intentions late last week, with some responses logged before that development, and some after it. The sample split again over what actions Joyce should take as a consequence of the affair and the issues surrounding it becoming public – with 19% believing he should remain Nationals leader and 26% supporting the decision he took last Friday – to resign as party leader but remain in parliament. The biggest slice of the sample, 34%, thought Joyce should leave both the national party leadership and the parliament, while 21% of the survey was undecided. Looking at the results in aggregate, 60% felt he should resign as leader, while 45% think he should stay on in parliament. Voters were also asked their views on a decision by Malcolm Turnbull to ban sexual relationships between ministers and their staff, a regulation unveiled at the height of the controversy. Half the sample (50%) supported the prime minister’s decision to ban office liaisons (32% opposition), while 44% of the sample would support a total ban on politicians having extramarital sex (36% opposition). The survey produced similar numbers about banning sexual relationships between managers and their staff in a workplace environment (48% support and 35% opposition) – but voters weren’t at all keen on a sex ban between workmates, with only 22% supporting that idea while 55% opposed it. Voters were asked whether they agreed with the prime minister’s ban on sexual relationships between ministers and their staff because of “the power imbalance in the relationship” – with 39% saying that statement was close to their view. A higher proportion agreed with the statement “the government had no right to ban consensual relationships between adults, the ban is unenforceable, but they do have the right to insist that such relationships are declared”– with 48% nominating that as their view. The Nationals and the Turnbull government attempted to push past the controversy on Monday, with Joyce moving officially to the backbench, and the party room anointing the New South Wales lower house MP Michael McCormack to replace him. McCormack has taken on Joyce’s former portfolio of infrastructure, and another National will shortly take up the new leader’s former portfolio as minister for veterans affairs. On Monday, it was revealed in Senate estimates that the prime minister ordered a departmental investigation into whether Joyce breached the ministerial code of conduct at the height of the controversy, despite publicly defending him. But Turnbull’s departmental head has now canned the inquiry on the basis that there is “little to be gained” now that the former Nationals leader has moved to the backbench. The independent authority charged with administering parliamentarians’ expenses is meanwhile continuing to audit the taxpayer-funded travel undertaken by the member for New England and Campion."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/grogonomics/2018/feb/27/low-wage-growth-remains-a-problem-affecting-all-levels-of-employment","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-26T23:37:46Z","webTitle":"Low wage growth remains a problem affecting all levels of employment | Greg Jericho","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2018/feb/27/low-wage-growth-remains-a-problem-affecting-all-levels-of-employment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/grogonomics/2018/feb/27/low-wage-growth-remains-a-problem-affecting-all-levels-of-employment","fields":{"headline":"Low wage growth remains a problem affecting all levels of employment","bodyText":"The latest detailed data employment data has revealed that in 2017 full-time median earnings rose by less than inflation as the low wages growth problem flowed through all segments of employment while at the same time the levels of casualisation continue the trend upwards. Last year, median full-time earnings was $65,577 – a 1.5% increase on the $64,584 recorded in 2016. But that 1.5% growth in the 12 months to August last year was below the 1.8% increase in inflation in the 12 months to September. This marked the third year since 2012 that full-time median earnings had not kept pace with inflation: Partly the cause is the increase in the number of women working full-time. Women as a general rule earn less than men even when working full-time. Across Australia, median full-time earnings for men is 13% higher than for women. Last year the median full-time earnings for women was $61,724 compared with the men’s $69,784. The biggest difference was in Western Australia, where male full-time median earnings of $78,000 was 20% above women’s $65,000 median: And thus when more women move into full-time work, it lowers the overall median full-time income. But even when we look at the growth of median earnings by gender and by full-time or part-time status, we see that growth in 2017 was well below the average that occurred from 2005 to 2012, when the wages growth began to fall to the current near record low levels: Only the median earnings for part-time women saw an increase above the 2005-2012 average – and even that only occurred after two years where there was no increase at all. These annual figures also allow us to compare the difference between average earnings and median ones, to show just what “middle Australians” are earning. Because high incomes skew average earnings higher, talking of average earnings as “middle incomes” gives a distorted picture – which is helpful when suggesting for example that raising the second-highest income tax level from $80,000 to $87,000 was helping such middle Australia. Such was the case when Malcolm Turnbull in 2016 argued that “middle-income Australians, those that are on average full-time earnings, which as you know is nudging $80,000 ... ”. And he is right about full-time average earnings – they are currently $84,661, but “middle-income Australians” are earning nowhere near $80,000, let alone the new threshold of $87,000. In 2017, the median full-time earnings in people’s main job (thus excluding those who work more than one job) was $65,577, and for all workers – both full-time and part-time – the median earnings was $52,988: The data also shows that the biggest gaps between men and women’s full-time earnings occur at high incomes. While the median full-time income for men is 13% higher than the median for women, the amount earned by men among the top 10% is nearly 20% more than is earned by the top 10% of women working full-time: Because of the higher proportion of women working part-time the gap is accentuated when looking at overall earnings. The median earnings for men of $62,400 is a third higher than the $46,800 median earnings for women. The biggest earnings disparity occurs in the professional, scientific and technology industry, while the smallest gap occurs in the public administration and safety industry – reflecting the better gender diversity hiring practices within the public sector. The data also showed that the level of casualisation remains a growing concern. Whereas throughout the first decade of this century the percentage of women working casual slowly fell, since 2012 it has been on the rise. As the level of men working casual has been rising for 25 years, this has meant that the overall level has risen since 2012 from 23.5% of all employees to 25.1% last year – the equivalent of around 155,000 more workers being employed on a casual basis: Casual workers are also more likely to be employed in industries with lower skill levels. For example not one of the industries with above-average levels of employees with bachelor degrees or five years’ worth of industry experience has above average numbers of casual workers. Such workers are also much more likely to be working on weekends, with 30% of all casual employees working both weekends and weekdays, compared with 21% of employees who are employed with leave entitlements: But for all workers, casual or not, the latest data only serves to reinforce how stagnant living standards have been over the past five years and will only add fuel to fire of the debate over how to solve the problem."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/feb/26/charities-good-work-put-at-risk-by-inept-coalition-laws-labor-says","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-26T05:02:13Z","webTitle":"Charities' good work put at risk by 'inept' Coalition laws, Labor says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/feb/26/charities-good-work-put-at-risk-by-inept-coalition-laws-labor-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/feb/26/charities-good-work-put-at-risk-by-inept-coalition-laws-labor-says","fields":{"headline":"Charities' good work put at risk by 'inept' Coalition laws, Labor says","bodyText":"Labor has accused the Coalition of putting the “good work” of Australian charities at risk through its “inept” handling of foreign interference laws. The foreign interference legislation before parliament puts significant curbs on not-for-profits, including to prevent charities from using foreign donations for political campaigning. The opposition leader, Bill Shorten, continued his tough rhetoric on the foreign donation bans in parliament on Monday, after saying on Sunday he would not support changes that silenced charities. “Why is the good work of Australian charities being put at risk because of the prime minister’s inept handling of foreign donation laws?” Shorten asked in question time. Malcolm Turnbull said the bill would have no effect on foreign donations to charities, as long as they did not use it for political campaigning. The prime minister said only 0.1% of charities would be affected, with only seven out of 55,500 registered charities reporting political expenditure last financial year. “Surely, surely we have enough pride in ourselves, in our nation, that we would say it is Australians that should be determining who is sitting on the treasury benches here,” Turnbull said. “And that we shouldn’t have foreign organisations or foreign billionaires pouring money into Australian political campaigns.” The Greens, meanwhile, have called for Labor to reject the bill outright. Senator Rachel Siewert said the opposition’s current position left open the possibility of amendments. Siewert said the bill was “so flawed it needs to be rejected”. “The current moves by the Government to silence charities and not-for-profits is a clear part of their campaign to silence civil society,” she said. The changes have united a diverse range of not-for-profits in opposition, including GetUp and the Institute of Public Affairs. A key threshold question about the legislation is how it would define political campaigning. On Monday the Australian reported that the Liberal MP Ben Morton had written to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to express concerns about $2m in grants it gave to Campaign for Australian Aid. Campaign for Australian Aid advocated to boost aid expenditure at the last federal election. Morton is one of 10 members of the parliamentary joint standing committee on electoral matters, which is scrutinising the foreign donations bill. He was reportedly concerned that Campaign for Australian Aid had produced a policy rating guide, which marked Australian political parties with a smiling or frowning face, depending on their commitments to boosting the foreign aid budget. The group had also doorknocked and distributed printed material, Morton said. But the Australian Council for International Development, a peak group for aid organisations, has previously said that Campaign for Australian Aid’s actions met all legal and regulatory requirements. The council recently told the parliamentary committee that the material produced by Campaign for Australian Aid at the last election could not be described as “how-to-vote cards”. The documents simply assessed and compared the various foreign aid policies of the different parties, and were considered permissible materials under Australia’s charities laws and the guidelines issued by the charities regulator. “[The Australian Council for International Development] has sought to keep the government regularly appraised of the campaign since its inception and as the aim of the campaign is to promote the government’s official aid program every effort is made to ensure the campaign does not inadvertently undermine government aid efforts,” the council said in a submission. “By our charitable nature, member organisations of the campaign will not seek to act in a partisan way.” On Sunday Labor declared it would not support foreign interference laws that silenced charities and not-for-profits. “I believe we can clean up donations without silencing our charities and not-for-profits,” Shorten said. “Labor is not interested in laws which punish Australian charities.” His comments came after GetUp decided to target the ALP in its campaign against the proposed laws."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/feb/26/hell-of-a-time-big-wave-surfer-ross-clarke-jones-nearly-drowns-at-nazare","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-26T04:56:14Z","webTitle":"'Hell of a time': big-wave surfer Ross Clarke-Jones nearly drowns at Nazaré","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/feb/26/hell-of-a-time-big-wave-surfer-ross-clarke-jones-nearly-drowns-at-nazare","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/feb/26/hell-of-a-time-big-wave-surfer-ross-clarke-jones-nearly-drowns-at-nazare","fields":{"headline":"'Hell of a time': big-wave surfer Ross Clarke-Jones nearly drowns at Nazaré","bodyText":"The waves at Nazaré in Portugal are notorious but it wasn’t a monstrous swell that nearly did for Australian big-wave surfer Ross Clarke-Jones on Sunday. The 51-year-old was lucky to escape with just concussion and a possible broken leg after being dragged underwater and then pulled by a strong rip into the danger zone – a rocky area of shallow water where it was impossible for help to reach him. The veteran knows Nazaré well, having become the only surfer to ride over Big Mama – the wave peak closest to its famous lighthouse that’s considered to be one of the most dangerous in the world – but admitted to complacency after the early-morning drama on the Atlantic coastline. “I caught my first wave on the second peak, which I went right,” Clarke-Jones said. “Bailing off the wave, I was pulled under the water for about 30 seconds, using my Quiksilver Airlift to inflate me to the surface. I came up looking directly at the cave and rocks.” Clarke-Jones, who has been nominated for five XXL Big Wave awards this year, was pounded by waves as he was dragged into the rocks and back out again, sustaining blows to his head and body. He likened the experience to being in a washing machine. But drawing on his considerable experience of the ocean, he forced himself to stay conscious before a flashback to his youth – when he used to hide behind the rocks at Terrigal on the New South Wales central coast – pointed to a way out of the situation. “Clutching to the rocks, I stayed there for a minute to get my breath back and to orientate myself,” he said. “As I watched the set coming towards me, I waited then scrambled to the cliff to start scaling the 30-metre sheer drop up. “You know what you sign up for when you surf Nazaré; I always have a hell of a time, but this was a nice reminder that you never take it for granted. Especially on the smaller days like today where you can get complacent … it was a big mistake.” The underwater terrain at Nazaré can produce massive waves of up to 30 metres (100ft), but the one Clarke-Jones was surfing was comparatively small – a medium-sized 25-footer. But having been dragged 200 metres by a heavy current towards the rocks at the base of the cliffs, he found his life in danger, with the support jetskis having lost sight of him. “This is the first time I’ve seen someone get caught in this zone,” said Axi Muniain, one of those trying to help the surfer. “There were five of us on jetskis trying to find him and we couldn’t reach him, or even see him. “I personally think that there aren’t many surfers that could have gotten themselves out of this situation. It was RCJ’s age and wave knowledge that saved him. He used the waves and water to his advantage.” Clarke-Jones eventually managed to secure his footing on the rocks and haul himself to safety up the cliffs. “It was Ross against mother nature,” said Alexander Triebel, who was filming Clarke-Jones. “I was so relieved to see the devilish grin on his face when he crawled up over the cliff with limbs intact.” It is not the first time Clarke-Jones nearly drowned during his lengthy career. Nor is it the first time he has sustained injury – he counts numerous spinal and neck injuries, separated and fractured ribs, a snapped bicep, and torn ASLs and MCLs among his war wounds. In November 2017 British surfer Andrew Cotton broke his back after falling from his board while riding one of Nazaré’s huge waves."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/feb/26/bob-day-points-finger-at-finance-department-over-lease-arrangement","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-26T03:42:24Z","webTitle":"Bob Day points finger at finance department over lease arrangement","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/26/bob-day-points-finger-at-finance-department-over-lease-arrangement","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/feb/26/bob-day-points-finger-at-finance-department-over-lease-arrangement","fields":{"headline":"Bob Day points finger at finance department over lease arrangement","bodyText":"Former senator Bob Day has accused the finance department of failing to warn him that a lease arrangement for his electorate office may breach the constitution, and said officials were on notice he still had an interest in the building. The explosive testimony is contained in a submission to a parliamentary committee which seeks to revisit the issue that saw the high court rule in April 2017 that Day was ineligible to be elected to the Senate. Day suggests the department and the former special minister of state, Michael Ronaldson, were more concerned with whether the arrangement was a “good look” than its legality, until advice in 2016 caused the government to dramatically change course and warn him it breached the constitution. The joint standing committee on electoral matters is considering the Senate’s decision to refer Day to the high court, and is now likely to call finance department officials to quiz them about whether they knew the lease could constitute a disqualification and whether they warned Day and Coalition government ministers. When Day resigned from the Senate in November 2016, it was revealed the government believed his election may have been invalid because he had an indirect pecuniary interest in the lease of his electorate office. Day’s family trust had sold the 77 Fullarton Road property that housed his electorate office on a vendor finance basis. The high court held the arrangement was a disqualification because rent from the commonwealth was to pay back the trust, although no rent was ever paid. Day claimed that in September 2013 the finance department explicitly warned senator-elect David Leyonhjelm that leasing offices he owned would breach section 44 of the constitution, but told him only that it “would not be a good look”. In February 2014 the finance department advised Ronaldson to reject Day’s attempt to set up his electorate office in the building because of “concerns about how such a transaction might be perceived”. Day revealed that he met Ronaldson in March 2014, and the minister advised him that the commonwealth leasing the office from a sitting senator would “not pass the pub test”. “Ronaldson told me that if I wanted to be located in that building, I needed to sell it. Which I did,” Day said in his submission. During discussions with the department regarding the lease, officers conducted visits to the premises and “it was quite clear that whilst I had sold the property, I still retained a significant interest in the premises”. That was clear “through the occupancy of my various other activities: my political party, Family First, the Bert Kelly Research Centre and the Samuel Griffith Society, and that I was the contact person for all discussions with respect to the building and lease. The department raised no concerns with me about this.” He said that from September 2013 to December 2015 the department did not mention section 44 “at any stage”. “Had the department told me, as they did senator Leyonhjelm, about section 44, I would not have proceeded with the leasing arrangement.” Day quoted passages from Hansard in November 2016 when the finance minister, Mathias Cormann, told the Senate that even after the department knew of the vendor finance arrangement in February, its advice was that it was open to him to make rental payments from March. “The issue, to be frank, was not a concern to the department at that point in time,” he said. “As I have said previously, it is not a matter for the government to make judgments on who is eligible and who is not eligible to sit in the Senate.” Scott Ryan took over as special minister of state in July 2016, and reviewed the arrangements. After Ryan took over the portfolio, the finance department was given advice in October 2016 from both the solicitor general, Justin Gleeson, and David Jackson QC. Their advice concluded Day was in breach of the constitution. Day said that the Senate president, Stephen Parry, then warned him he intended to tell the Senate about the government’s advice that he was ineligible. “In light of this bombshell, I felt I had no choice but to immediately resign,” Day said. “Notwithstanding the department’s actions over the previous three years, and the authority of three special ministers of state to proceed with the lease as arranged, the attorney general, [George Brandis,] instructed the solicitor general of the commonwealth to argue in the high court that I should be disqualified.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"culture/2018/feb/27/perth-festival-helen-garner-and-kim-scott-share-their-literary-wisdom","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-26T17:00:18Z","webTitle":"Perth festival: Helen Garner and Kim Scott share their literary wisdom","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/feb/27/perth-festival-helen-garner-and-kim-scott-share-their-literary-wisdom","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2018/feb/27/perth-festival-helen-garner-and-kim-scott-share-their-literary-wisdom","fields":{"headline":"Perth festival: Helen Garner and Kim Scott share their literary wisdom","bodyText":"The keynote topic of writers’ week at the Perth festival was “why literature matters”. But with Helen Garner and Kim Scott taking the stage, the topic was immaterial: Garner could deliver her shopping list – indeed, she recently did just that – and we would still be on the edge of our seats. Scott, meanwhile, is the author of some of the most beautiful and urgent missives from Indigenous Australia, and is a truth teller about this country’s history of conflict. To see them both together, having just met each other for the first time, was a treat. Scott initially confessed to feeling some anxiety about being on stage, as if he was about to take some exam. But before long he was on a roll, speaking powerfully about the “the psychosis in the relationship between Aboriginal society and white Australia”. The pair talked for just over an hour, covering topics from being pigeonholed as a writer to the #MeToo movement, but we could have listened for at least twice as long. Here’s an edited version of some of the best parts of the talk. The intimacy of novels Scott: Writing is an offering; it’s an intimacy – a one-on-one we are creating, and sharing some sort of inner voice. I don’t think of being a literary writer in a pejorative way – it’s like being a sportsperson. You have to work at it … A lot of males don’t read fiction because it’s an intimate encounter. Garner: But do you think people are afraid of feeling things? Scott: I was thinking about the vulnerability in writing and reading. It can unsettle. Say a character is not very nice – “here I am with someone, identifying with someone who is an unpleasant character”. Garner: I always get disappointed when people say of my books, ‘Oh I couldn’t go there!’ But that’s why I write the way I write, so that people can go there! When you open a book, you’re throwing yourself into the arms of a writer. It should say, ‘I’m here! Come in!’ [That said], most writers could lose the first page. Young writers Garner: In my experience blokes feel confident writing young, in their 20s. Women take a while to get up the nerve to write their book. Writing for your community Scott: Unlike some Aboriginal writers, I feel like I’m not staunch enough, because I don’t feel like I am writing for a community. It’s one-on-one. I am accountable, but sometimes I’d rather not be. Garner: When I started out I was called a “woman writer” – there were writers and there were women writers. Not so any more when I wrote The First Stone. After that book came out I copped a huge blast of hostility and hate from women. It was shocking. But after it came out and the dust settled, I felt free. I knew what hate was. It was very shocking and painful. But I thought, ‘Now I can say what I like.’ It was bracing. It was a really awful experience [and] I felt fantastic afterwards. Since then, I felt I could say what I wanted to. I was no longer speaking from a position. I didn’t feel like I had a leg-rope on me any more. Finding stories Garner: I’m not on social media; it’s passed me by. I’m 75 and OK with that. A good, interesting place for me is the law courts. It’s presented in a way that’s highly formalised, with lots of character and drama and people suffering and in tremendous pain. But I feel very privileged to discover it. I feel surprised so few people go to court. People – some with PhDs – say, ‘But don’t you have to get permission?’ No! You just go in there. #MeToo Garner: The world seems to be speeding up and going crazy and there are still eternal human sufferings … I look back and I see feminism going through spurts and spasms. When #MeToo first started, I was exhilarated. It was the sound of a million chickens coming home to roost. But then we get to a point where the movements become about trivial things or men cannot speak. The #MeToo movement is a huge and ongoing struggle between men and women for power. It’s not going to end, and it does help to accept that these struggles will never end, because otherwise you’ll fall into despair. Every now and then there’s a beautiful moment and the shooting and the raping stops – and then it starts again. And that’s what life is on this planet. The #MeToo thing is like the Arab spring: there was something unexpected and joyful about it. Then the bombs started falling again. So why write? Scott: To think about who we are and what it means to be human. Who am I? Does this help someone work out who they are? Books can do that. And not all books have to be tragedies. Garner: One of my favourite lines in your book, Taboo, is where a character said, ‘Go on, pick a stick, just pick your favourite one.’ I really like that, the idea of having a favourite stick. There’s an idea that you have to write painful things as tragedies. I disagree. A woman came up to me once and gave me the highest compliment, although it sounds like a bit of a backhander. She was talking about my columns that I used to write in my hometown newspaper, the Age, and she said, ‘Your columns are like a little bit of nothing – then there’s a story.’ • Guardian Australia was a guest of Perth festival"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"fashion/2018/feb/26/its-not-a-hairstyle-its-a-lifestyle-scenes-from-australias-first-mullet-festival","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-26T00:51:11Z","webTitle":"'It's not a hairstyle, it's a lifestyle': scenes from Australia's first mullet festival","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/feb/26/its-not-a-hairstyle-its-a-lifestyle-scenes-from-australias-first-mullet-festival","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2018/feb/26/its-not-a-hairstyle-its-a-lifestyle-scenes-from-australias-first-mullet-festival","fields":{"headline":"'It's not a hairstyle, it's a lifestyle': scenes from Australia's first mullet festival","bodyText":"“Last call for rangas! Rangas, last call!” Word goes round the front bar of the Chelmsford hotel, an old-style beer barn on the corner of Kurri Kurri’s main street, and there’s a flurry of activity. The third round of the inaugural mullet festival is about to begin, and contestants and spectators are ready to get serious. A mining town of 6,000 half an hour west of Newcastle in New South Wales’ Hunter Valley, Kurri Kurri has been searching for the magic formula other regional towns have hit on to draw in tourists and reinvigorate its economy. Since 1993 Parkes has had the Elvis festival; Trundle, a minuscule town an hour west, struck gold in 2012 with the Abba festival. Deniliquin in the state’s south-west has reaped the benefits of the Deni Ute Muster since 1999. The Chelmsford hotel’s owner and local hairdresser, Laura Johnson, hit on the idea of a festival celebrating Australia’s most loved and loathed hairstyle – long at the back, short at the top and sides – while brainstorming with a friend and co-organiser, Sarah Bedford. “Aussies love an icon,” she says. “We have so many mullets in town, and in my family. My father-in-law had one for 60 years.” The glowing press Mulletfest generated when it was announced raised expectations for a bumper event. But the real test was always going to come on the day. At Kariong, an hour down the Pacific Highway, John Farnham – Australia’s King Mullet himself – is headlining the Red Hot Summer festival, with Daryl Braithwaite in support. Being double-booked against that kind of star power is a big ask. Would internet and media hype translate into mullets on the ground? As it turns out, yes. Kurri Kurri called, and they answered. In the Chelmsford hotel’s beer garden, a concrete and corrugated iron annex with a Bundaberg Rum polar bear feature wall and no air conditioning, mullets of every stripe have come. Blond surfie mullets; greasy biker mullets; filthy dreadlocked mullets. Achingly sculpted, or boldly free-flowing. Vigorously shampooed or proudly unwashed. Punk and bogan and hipster. When the contest gets under way at 10.30 in the morning, the pub is already heaving with punters and competitors. In the 35C heat, broiling in the beer garden’s confines, the mullets on display wilt like bedraggled peacocks. Those less interested in formal competition can measure their mullets by buying T-shirts and singlets bearing the official Mullet-Meter: a measuring system running down the back of the shirt ranging from the relatively sedate “neck warmer” through to “Joe Dirt”, “ape drape”, “shagable” and the ultimate length, “lifetime legend”. First up is the junior mullet category. Contestants: 22. A scrum of mullet-bearing kids trip down an impromptu catwalk formed by the crowd and line up onstage, their hair resplendent. They’re prompted to dance by Karuah cover band the Stunned Mullets – on retainer for the day – striking up Keep Your Hands to Yourself by the Georgia Satellites. They bop eagerly, revelling in the attention – all except a lanky teenager with a lustrous brunette spread who stands stock still, silently mortified as only teenage boys can be. The winner, 12-year-old Alex Keavy, wins on a combination of mullet strength and showmanship. He alone thought to use his mullet to its full potential in the dance-off, moshing theatrically to spread it down his front. He began cultivating the style 18 months ago, because “Dad always used to cut my hair, and it was always terrible”. Alex is gracious in victory, pledging to use some of his $50 prize money to buy his girlfriend a pie. “It’s not a hairstyle, it’s a lifestyle,” he declares. “Thanks to the judges, and to the hotel.” The trio of judges sit to one side of the stage, quietly deliberating among themselves. Two of them are openly baffled by the situation they’ve found themselves in. Meryl Swanson, the local Labor MP, has never even had a mullet, although she admits to sporting some big hair in the 80s. “It’s certainly been an eye opener”, she says of the festival. “I’m looking for pride, people embracing the mullet, finding self-worth in it.” Brett Mullins, a former fullback for the Canberra Raiders and the NSW Blues who owns a gym in town, is similarly bemused at where life has taken him. “They unearthed a photo of me with a mullet from when I was 18, so that was it,” he says. “I have no idea what I’m looking at.” They largely take their cues from Dan Brown, a Newcastle barista known as the Mullet Lord for obvious reasons. He lists an exhaustive set of criteria he’s checking: “Level of maintenance, split ends, length of time, density, lusciousness,” he rattles off, looking out into the crowd. “Feels good. Like I’m with my tribe.” Tragically, there is only one entrant in the “ladies’ mullet” category, and she is 11 months old. But the dedication shown by contestants in other rounds makes up the shortfall. Cougar, a 20-year-old sporting a long red number, drove 14 hours from his native Frankston to take part. He drove his ute, licence plate MU113T. “Can’t drive anywhere. Cops see ya, ‘Whoop!’” he complains. Laurie Manuele, who travelled from Gippsland and quickly endears himself to the crowd with his pro-mullet speeches, is anointed Mulletfest’s unofficial mascot after it is pointed out he bears a striking resemblance to the festival’s logo. “The mullet will live forever,” he proclaims. “And Kurri Kurri is the home of the mullet!” But it is someone closer to home who takes the grand prize. Shane “Shagger” Hanrahan of Denman, who has been growing his mullet since 1986, is awarded best mullet by crowd ovation, and delivers a Churchillian address after sculling Jim Beam from his trophy. “I dunno what to say, I’m fuckin’ pissed,” he tells the crowd. “Rock on! Fuck you! Fuck youse all!”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"environment/2018/feb/27/nsw-ombudsman-investigating-waternsw-over-misleading-data","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-26T17:00:19Z","webTitle":"NSW ombudsman investigating WaterNSW over misleading data","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/feb/27/nsw-ombudsman-investigating-waternsw-over-misleading-data","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/feb/27/nsw-ombudsman-investigating-waternsw-over-misleading-data","fields":{"headline":"NSW ombudsman investigating WaterNSW over misleading data","bodyText":"The New South Wales ombudsman is investigating whether WaterNSW – the body responsible for compliance with the state’s water laws – has misled it when it provided data last year on the number of prosecutions and enforcement actions it had taken in the 15 months prior. The ombudsman confirmed a second special report will be tabled in the first week of March, but declined to outline its contents. Special reports are a last resort when the ombudsman deems that a report to the minister is insufficient. The new report will say that statistics provided to it by WaterNSW on prosecutions and compliance activities since July 2016 were seriously overstated by the agency. They were then used in the ombudsman’s earlier special report to the state parliament in November last year, which outlined the ombudsman’s frustrations in getting adequate action on complaints over the past decade. The November 2017 report outlined the handling of several specific examples of breaches of the water laws highlighted by the ombudsman since 2007. These included reports of illegal structures being built to divert water and other serious breaches of NSW’s water laws. Three earlier reports had gone to the minister and the head of the department with little effect. In July 2017 Four Corners aired an explosive report on the management of the Barwon-Darling system that featured NSW water compliance officers saying that despite reporting wrongdoing, they received little support from their superiors to take action. This prompted the ombudsman to go public with the special report in November. As well as detailing its findings in the three earlier reports, the ombudsman zeroed in on systemic failures. It said the constant bureaucratic shuffling of responsibilities between agencies had been “devastating” and had resulted in “a shell game” when it came to enforcing the law. But it now appears the statistics provided to the ombudsman may have been inaccurate and the record on prosecutions is even worse than outlined. The ombudsman’s November report revealed that in 2009 only 20% of 600 breach allegations were investigated – a rate it considered inadequate. In response, a strategic investigations unit was established, which led to improvements until the unit was depleted of staff during yet another restructure in 2015. The compliance function was transferred to WaterNSW. The ombudsman said under WaterNSW there had been a 72% drop in enforcement actions between 2015-16 and 2016-17. There were no prosecutions in 2016-17. However, the ombudsman noted WaterNSW had assured its office that it had taken “significant steps” to resource and perform the compliance function since 1 July. The adjusted number of enforcement outcomes for the period 1 July 2016 to 3 November as provided by WaterNSW were 115 formal warnings, 192 advisory letters, 105 penalty infringement notices and 12 prosecutions. It is these figures that are now under scrutiny by the ombudsman and whether the error was deliberate. A spokesman for WaterNSW said the organisation “is not aware of the ombudsman making any such findings”. A third body, the Natural Resources Access Regulator, has recently been established to take over some of the compliance functions, after stinging criticism by both the NSW ombudsman and Ken Matthews, who chaired an independent inquiry. Despite the Four Corners program going to air seven months ago, there have been no prosecutions arising from the allegations of water theft and meter tampering raised by the program."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/feb/26/with-mccormack-nationals-reject-maverick-experiment-for-conservative-guy-in-a-suit","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-26T01:02:12Z","webTitle":"With McCormack, Nationals reject 'maverick' experiment for conservative guy in a suit | Katharine Murphy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/feb/26/with-mccormack-nationals-reject-maverick-experiment-for-conservative-guy-in-a-suit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/feb/26/with-mccormack-nationals-reject-maverick-experiment-for-conservative-guy-in-a-suit","fields":{"headline":"With McCormack, Nationals reject 'maverick' experiment for conservative guy in a suit","bodyText":"Michael McCormack, a man most voters would struggle to recognise, has been handed one of the biggest jobs in Australian politics. If Australia’s new deputy prime minister has registered with folks outside the Riverina at all in his relatively short political career, it will be because of a homophobic rant he dashed off in 1993 as the editor of Wagga Wagga’s local paper the Daily Advertiser. “Unfortunately gays are here and, if the disease their unnatural acts helped spread doesn’t wipe out humanity, they’re here to stay,” McCormack observed in the deeply unfortunate column – comments he has apologised for on many occasions. McCormack follows a leader in Barnaby Joyce who is less cookie-cutter politician than cult of personality. Joyce’s shtick resonated at a time when voters, particularly in the bush, are alienated with politics-as-usual. The Liberals will doubtless be relieved to be in partnership with a less chaotic figure than Joyce, but viewed from the vantage point of voters, McCormack currently presents as just another guy in a suit rather than someone you would look up and listen to. We can have a laugh about George Christensen throwing his hat in the ring at the special party room meeting on Monday morning (just another bit of attention-seeking from the “look at me” merchant from up north) but it’s less chuckle-worthy than it might seem. What Christensen offered his colleagues was the opportunity to persist with the Joyce “maverick” experiment, and push it into a new phase, a phase of genuine independence from the Liberals – but the colleagues rejected it. David Littleproud, a Queenslander elevated by Joyce in the poisonous ministerial reshuffle last year, also hung in the leadership field until the very last minute because of similar motivations – the instinct to punch up and differentiate. But battered by the Joyce imbroglio of the past few months, the breath-holding phase before it all became public, and then the brutal aftermath, the Nationals played it safe on Monday morning and picked another conservative guy in a suit. So now the guy in the suit has some choices to make. Does he remain the reassuring guy in the suit in implicit contrast to the chaos of the Joyce end, or does he try and transition into something more than that? With a federal election on best-case scenario only 12 or 18 months away, McCormack has an urgent imperative of boosting his personal profile as a means of boosting the Nationals post-Joyce, both in regions outside the Riverina and around the country. He will need to convince people in the regions that the bush has a champion in Canberra after the personnel change. McCormack also has to bring a bunch of fractured party colleagues together. His capacity to do that will depend at least in part on the willingness of his colleagues to get past the torrid events of recent times and focus on the future. Politics being a performance art form, the preparedness of colleagues to focus on the future will relate to how well he ultimately performs in the job, and how much authority and heft he can develop with the Liberals. McCormack also faces a really challenging time for the Nationals in the regions. Joyce understood that the Nationals hegemony in the bush faces all kinds of threats – from One Nation, to the Shooters, Fishers and Farmers party, to the Greens who have been working farming communities furious about coal-seam gas development, to rural independents, many of whom have compelling things to say about the closed and combative culture of the National party, and the tendency of the junior coalition partner to take the regions for granted. The former deputy prime minister understood that to hold your place in the disrupted political firmament you have to cut through, you have to be memorable. With their new leader, the Nationals are starting this process of being memorable all over again – and they are starting it from behind."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/feb/26/who-is-michael-mccormack-the-life-and-controversies-of-australias-new-deputy-pm","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-25T22:49:48Z","webTitle":"Who is Michael McCormack?

The life and controversies of Australia's new deputy PM","bodyText":"Michael McCormack is the new Nationals leader and deputy prime minister. Never heard of him? Never fear. We’ve compiled this handy assortment of tidbits and controversies to bring you up to speed. The McCormack basics From Wagga Wagga in New South Wales’ Riverina region, McCormack is a Nationals MP with a fairly typical history. He grew up on family farms at Marrar and Brucedale and still lives in the Riverina with his wife and three children. McCormack began working life as a cadet journalist with the local Wagga paper, the Daily Advertiser. McCormack shot through the editorial ranks to become editor at just 27. McCormack first came to parliament in 2010, having fought off both Liberal and Labor candidates in his seat. It was unusual, in a sense. The Liberals hadn’t run a candidate in Riverina for 12 years. It didn’t change the result. McCormack won with a huge margin, taking the seat from the retiring Kay Hull, who McCormack previously worked for as campaign director. He’s held various roles in the junior ministry since, including assistant defence minister, small business minister and assistant to the deputy prime minister. He is currently minister for veterans affairs and defence personnel. Labor have been quick to point out McCormack is “the first non-farmer to lead the Nationals since Charles Blunt”. Blunt led the party in 1989 and 1990. The homophobic editorial In 1993, while still editor of the Daily Advertiser, McCormack penned a hugely controversial editorial about gay Australians and HIV/Aids. The editorial was profoundly homophobic and offensive. McCormack argued that “a week never goes by anymore that homosexuals and their sordid behaviour don’t become further entrenched in society”. “Unfortunately gays are here and, if the disease their unnatural acts helped spread doesn’t wipe out humanity, they’re here to stay.” McCormack soon apologised for the piece, which sparked several complaints to the Australian Press Council. He apologised again last year when, as small business minister, he had ministerial responsibility for the Australian Bureau of Statistics as it administered the postal vote. McCormack said in August that his views have changed in the decades since the editorial. “I have grown and learned not only to tolerate but to accept all people, regardless of their sexual orientation, or any other trait or feature which makes each of us different and unique,” he said. McCormack voted yes to same-sex marriage in parliament last year, following the will of his electorate. The bungled census McCormack held the small business portfolio during the notorious #CensusFail of 2016. He oversaw the attempts to move the census online, which failed spectacularly and led to significant outages, jeopardising the collection of vital population data. McCormack was put in the invidious position of defending the government’s handling of the debacle, which Labor described as the “worst-run Census in the history of Australia”. The knighting of Prince Philip McCormack was not shy in making his views known about Tony Abbott’s knighting of Prince Philip in 2015. As a frontbencher in Abbott’s government, McCormack publicly complained that the decision had exposed the Coalition to ridicule. He urged Abbott to visit country pubs to learn what Australians really wanted from their politicians. “It is out of touch and out of touch with modern Australian thinking,” he said. “We’ve got a good story to tell but these sorts of decisions that are made … it just sets you on the back foot. It’s not going to affect my life, your life or anyone’s life.” The comments showed McCormack’s willingness to publicly stand up to his Liberal colleagues. Will that attitude be reflected as leader? We’ll soon find out. The small business roadshow Last year, McCormack faced allegations that he was taking a small business roadshow primarily to Coalition seats. The roadshows are used to get feedback from small business but also to spruik government policy. They are attended by public servants from Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman and the Australian Tax Office. Twenty-seven of the first 30-odd roadshow events were held in Liberal or National seats. Labor suggested Coalition voters were being rewarded with better access to services Leadership ambitions McCormack has stood for party leadership positions twice previously, narrowly losing the deputy role to Bridget McKenzie late last year. He was involved in an embarrassing exchange on Sky News last week, at the height of the Joyce controversy, in which he failed nine times to back his leader. McCormack was widely considered the frontrunner to take Joyce’s leadership, and became a certainty over the weekend, when David Gillespie and David Littleproud pulled out of the race."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/feb/26/australian-media-companies-join-forces-to-appeal-rebel-wilson-damages-payout","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-26T03:16:42Z","webTitle":"Australian media companies join forces to appeal Rebel Wilson damages payout","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/feb/26/australian-media-companies-join-forces-to-appeal-rebel-wilson-damages-payout","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/feb/26/australian-media-companies-join-forces-to-appeal-rebel-wilson-damages-payout","fields":{"headline":"Australian media companies join forces to appeal Rebel Wilson damages payout","bodyText":"Major Australian media companies have lined up with the magazine publisher Bauer in its appeal against the record amount of damages awarded to actor Rebel Wilson last year. The payout of $650,000 in general and aggravated damages and $3.9m in special damages was the biggest defamation win in Australian legal history, but is now subject to appeal by the publishers of Woman’s Day and the Australian Women’s Weekly. On Monday News Corp Australia, Fairfax Media, Macquarie Media, the ABC and the Seven and Nine networks asked the Victorian appeal court for leave to intervene, in an effort to prevent defamation payouts escalating. The media companies are worried the decision to award Wilson $650,000 in general and aggravated damages – when general damages are supposed to be capped at $389,500 – will lead to plaintiffs seeking ever higher payouts. The lawyer for the joint media group, Justin Quill from Macpherson Kelley, said the rare move was triggered by the media’s desire to protect free speech and to keep legal costs from spiralling out of control. “The media parties seeking to intervene in the case are seeking a ruling that the damages cap – currently at $389,500 – applies to any award of general damages even if aggravated damages are awarded separately,” Kelley told Guardian Australia. “Media organisations regularly join forces on matters of extreme public importance. An example of that would be when they band together to fight suppression orders, which regularly happens. But it is rare for media companies to come together in a defamation action.” In their affidavit the parties said they were concerned the Wilson decision would “remove the certainty otherwise provided by the statutory cap on damages”. In the short months since the decision by Justice Dixon in the Victorian supreme court, plaintiffs were already relying on the Wilson decision to claim that they were no longer constrained by the statutory cap. Dixon ruled that Wilson was entitled to a substantial payout because the damage to her reputation from the Australian articles in Hollywood was unprecedented. Wilson, who was accused in a series of articles of being a serial liar about her age, real name and childhood, has said she would not be keeping any of the money. “The jury found each of the articles was defamatory, and rejected the defendants’ triviality defences,” the judge wrote in his judgment. “The sting was serious, likely to be injurious and understood as such by the defendants prior to publication. “I do not accept that the articles were published for a local Australian audience. The internet cannot be so classified. ”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"money/2018/feb/26/households-could-save-100-a-year-as-energy-price-cap-moves-closer","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-26T08:47:53Z","webTitle":"Households could save £100 a year as energy price cap moves closer","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/feb/26/households-could-save-100-a-year-as-energy-price-cap-moves-closer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2018/feb/26/households-could-save-100-a-year-as-energy-price-cap-moves-closer","fields":{"headline":"Households could save £100 a year as energy price cap moves closer","bodyText":"Legislation to cap energy prices for 11m households across Britain will go before parliament today. The Domestic Gas and Electricity (Tariff Cap) Bill compels regulator Ofgem to implement the cap once the law has given it new powers. The tariffs, which could save people up to £100 a year, would be limited until 2020, with the option to extend the cap annually until 2023. Announcing the bill, which the government hopes will become law before next winter, Theresa May said it would “force energy companies to change their ways”. A 2016 report found consumers were paying £1.4bn a year over the odds via energy companies’ standard variable tariffs (SVTs). The prime minister said: “It’s often older people or those on low incomes who are stuck on rip-off energy tariffs, so today we are introducing legislation to force energy companies to change their ways. “Our energy price cap will cut bills for millions of families. This is another step we are taking to help people make ends meet as we build a country that works for everyone.” The idea of energy price freezes was originally floated in 2013 by then Labour leader Ed Miliband. He faced criticism from the Conservatives at the time but a plan for a universal price cap appeared in their manifesto last year. After the election the prime minister passed responsibility to Ofgem, which faced criticism for only coming up with proposals to protect the most vulnerable. Frustrated by the lack of progress from the regulator, May announced legislation to crack down on “rip-off” bills in her keynote speech at the Conservative party conference. Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, said the bill was welcome but criticised the government for not acting sooner. “The government promised action on energy bills a year ago yet energy costs are still spiralling and four million households live in fuel poverty. “A price cap is simply a temporary sticking plaster and the government must realise that they need to do much more to fix our broken energy market.” Lawrence Slade, chief executive of Energy UK, which represents power companies, said: “It’s vital the cap doesn’t halt the growth of competition which is helping customers to find a better deal and save on their energy bills. “It’s also important that the cap accurately reflects suppliers’ costs, most of which are out of their direct control.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"weather/2018/feb/27/ice-skaters-poised-for-rare-spin-on-the-fens","type":"article","sectionId":"weather","sectionName":"Weather","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-27T15:50:57Z","webTitle":"Ice skaters wait for spin on the Fens","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/weather/2018/feb/27/ice-skaters-poised-for-rare-spin-on-the-fens","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/weather/2018/feb/27/ice-skaters-poised-for-rare-spin-on-the-fens","fields":{"headline":"Ice skaters poised for rare spin on the Fens","bodyText":"The cold spell and the forecast of further icy weather has encouraged hopes of being able to skate on the Fens, in eastern England, for first time in eight years. Roger Giles, who posts regular updates on the condition of the ice near his home in Welney, Cambridgeshire, said he thought there was a 70% chance of skating by the end of the week. “I’m damned excited. We all are,” he said as forecasters extended warnings of snow and ice for later in the week and temperatures dropped to -8.9C (15.9F) in some areas. Giles said: “A couple more days of -5C like last night and we could be skating on the very shallow patches, so we are quite close. You really need -8C frost at night for two or three nights to really get a good skating surface, but -5C, like it was last night, for three days would give us something.” Giles is among people in fen skating who will decide if the ice is thick enough. Three others will decide if a speed skating race meeting can be held. He explained: “Malcolm Robinson, Dave Smith and our chairman, Nigel Blake, are the big cheeses that give it the check out before we can race. I’m about 70% sure that we’ll be on the ice in some shape or form. I doubt if we’ll be racing this week, but we’ll probably have a few skaters on some of the safer patches.” The challenge will be sweeping the snow off the ice. Giles said: “We have boards on long sticks to push the snow off to make a 400m track. It can be quite difficult.” However, he urged skaters not to visit the Fens for such action just yet. “Everybody is getting excited and they all think they are going to jump on a train from London and get off at Littleport [Cambridgeshire] and come and skate. But not for two or three days.” He added: “You have to be careful, even at Welney where the water is only a few feet deep, because there are deeper ditches criss-crossing the field and rivers at the edges. So you could waltz up on to a river. You’ve got to be so careful.” The Guardian covered the last Fen skating meeting in January 2010. Giles said: “Your chap from the Guardian came down in 2010 and got stuck in a snowdrift and our girls from the office had to pull him out and save him from a snowy death in a fen drove.” In the Netherlands the cold snap prompted hopes of the first Elfstedentocht this century. This marathon 125-mile (200km) ice-skating race between between 11 Friesland towns last took place in 1997. But Dutch officials have warned that the chances of a race this year are small."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"games/2018/mar/02/best-new-android-iphone-games-2018","type":"article","sectionId":"games","sectionName":"Games","webPublicationDate":"2018-11-20T16:55:31Z","webTitle":"The best new Android and iPhone games for 2018","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/mar/02/best-new-android-iphone-games-2018","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/games/2018/mar/02/best-new-android-iphone-games-2018","fields":{"headline":"The best new Android and iPhone games for 2018","bodyText":"Stardew Valley iPhone, £7.99 Farming’s far from the whole story in this charming sim: there’s plenty of crop management and animal-rearing, but getting to know the other inhabitants of the town around you is just as important, with some touching stories to be uncovered.

Football Manager 2019 Mobile Android/iPhone, £8.99 The 2019 edition of this ever-popular football management sim adds new features to an already excellent game. Those include a new training system, the ability to manage in Russia or China, and transfers negotiated in real-time for quicker offers and counter-offers. Otherwise, what’s not broken ain’t been fixed: FMM zeroes in on tactics, transfers and training, so you can blast through seasons quickly whether you’re playing on a train, in front of the TV or (heaven forbid) at work. Reigns: Game of Thrones Android/iPhone, £3.79/£2.99 The Reigns and Reigns: Her Majesty games are marvellous, using a Tinder-style interface to test your skills as a monarch by swiping left or right on binary decisions. The third game in the series comes with a high-profile licence: HBO’s Game of Thrones. You’ll be ruling Westeros as Cersei, Jon, Daenerys, Tyrion or Sansa, making your decisions ahead of the ever-coming winter. It’s a perfect fit, and while you will regularly meet an untimely, brutal end, the game’s structure means you’ll face new situations every time you replay it. And you’ll want to do that a lot. Pocket City Android/iPhone, £3.49/£3.99 There is an official version of the classic town-planning game SimCity on mobile called SimCity BuildIt, but its freemium moneygrubbing makes my teeth itch. Pocket City is a great alternative. This is a loving homage to classic SimCity, as you plan residential, commercial and industrial zones, plus the utilities and entertainment required to keep your growing population healthy and happy. It’s sensibly stripped down for phones, too, never burying you in sub-menus or overloading the economic complexity. Whether you work your way through its quests to build a megalopolis or let loose in its no-restrictions sandbox mode, it’s a reminder of why virtual town planning was so addictive all those years ago. Donut County iPhone, £4.99 You wait ages for a game where you play a hole in the ground, then two come along at once. Donut County heavily “inspired” a similar game called Hole.io, which topped app-store charts earlier this year. Donut County the better of the two, thanks to a storyline that amps up the quirk factor with its anti-hero, a scenery-swallowing raccoon (he “drives” the hole) called PJ, who is trying to make amends for landing his friends and their homes 999 feet underground. The physics are the satisfying thing here: swirling your hole underneath objects to tip them in feels just right, while the way it grows each time turns the levels into a careful puzzle of progression from small to big items, rather than a pure rampage. Wonder Blade iPhone, £2.99 Its princess-rescuing trope may feel over-familiar, but there’s nothing else tired about Wonder Blade. It’s a sparky side-scrolling action game in which you set about groups of enemies with sword-swipes, magic spells and Mortal Kombat-esque execution moves. There’s plenty of humour in the bug-eyed characters you meet. On the grounds that there aren’t enough games that also feature chase scenes where you ride a pig, dressed as a block of Swiss cheese, pursued by a giant castle-shaped monster, this one’s a keeper. One Hour One Life for Mobile Android/iPhone, £4.99 This PC-game port starts with an inventive premise: you play a character for 60 years from baby to old age, with each year taking a minute of real-world time. When they die, you start again as a baby – but benefiting from the actions and inventions of your first character. This, in a massively multiplayer world where other players are buzzing about with their own life cycles – including some who will be parenting you when you respawn as a helpless infant. The fascination comes from exploring the world and its objects, and figuring out how you can break them down and then recombine them to create new items that will help you and your descendants. Unselfish planning for future generations? Given current issues from Brexit to climate change, it’s a timely conceit for a game. Asphalt 9: Legends Android/iPhone, free (with in-app purchases) The Asphalt racing franchise is firmly in Need for Speed street-racing territory, featuring physics-defying jumps and drifts, as well as nitro boosts that remain sadly unavailable for your real-world hatchback. Asphalt 9 has been engineered for mobile gamers who aren’t that experienced with racing games: it can optionally handle acceleration and steering automatically, leaving you to focus on the stunts and scenery – even if that scenery is often about to slam itself into your bonnet. The game’s system of in-app purchases also seems fairly tuned. Its timers system means you’ll need to switch cars sometimes to keep playing, but you’re not overly pressured to pay. Alphabear 2 Android/iPhone, free (with in-app purchases) Mobile games where you make words from letter tiles with a Scrabble-style points system are 10-a-penny. Alphabear, launched in 2015, was one of the better ones, and this sequel builds on it well. It’s designed as a single-player game, with a story mode leading you through levels with various gameplay restrictions to keep you on your toes – from time limits to bonuses for specific kinds of tiles. Around this, there is a system of cartoon bears to be unlocked. These have their own special powers and score-multipliers (such as earning you extra points for words ending with ‘s’). If turn-based multiplayer word games such as Words With Friends feel a bit intimidating, this is a more relaxed alternative. My Child Lebensborn Android/iPhone, £2.59/£2.99 Lebensborn was an initiative in Nazi Germany that involved sending children to be adopted by “racially pure” parents, both within Germany and occupied countries. Factor in themes of bullying and abuse, and it’s no wonder that a content warning about potential distress is the first thing you see. The game has you trying to parent a Lebensborn child in Norway, and their experience at school is far from idyllic. In fact, you’ll probably feel increasingly bleak the more you play, as your desire to fix things surges at the same rate as your fury that you can’t. A worthwhile, if not always pleasant experience. Read the full review Pocket-Run Pool iPhone, free Pocket-Run Pool seems very simple: it’s a top-down, drag-to-aim pool simulator with decent ball physics. But there are some twists that make it much more interesting. There are score-multiplier pockets, which rotate after every shot – hitting the 10-ball into the 10x pocket scores 100 points. High Stakes mode introduces a gambling element where you play for chips with quirky challenges such as bumpers on the table, or “death balls” that instantly end your game. Insta-Tournament gets you competing in your own time against other players’ best scores. It’s ideal for quick goes when you have five minutes to kill, and more than capable of making you miss your train stop or bedtime. Space Pioneer Android/iPhone, free (with in-app purchases) This is a game about exploring an infinite galaxy, exploring planets, collecting loot and uncovering the odd ancient mystery. It’s firmly action-focused: when you beam down to a planet, you’ll run around blasting aliens while keeping a close eye on your health, sometimes encountering satisfyingly big bosses to take on. What keeps you playing is everything around that – turning loot into upgrades for your weapons and fighting skills, for instance, or building a space base. Space Pioneer is not aggressive about asking for money, either. There are no sudden difficulty-level lurches to nudge you towards in-app purchases, so you can play at your own pace. The Sims Mobile Android/iPhone, free (with in-app purchases) Mobile gamers have been playing neighbourhood-god in The Sims: FreePlay, a cut-down version of the life-simulator Sims games on PC tuned for smartphone habits, since late 2011. It’s now been superseded by The Sims Mobile, which is much closer to the bigger, better PC games. It suits the rhythm of mobile play (short bursts rather than long sessions), letting you micromanage your Sim people and see their work, love lives and home decor evolve. There are energy meters and a timer that locks you out of the game, both designed to nudge you towards in-app purchases, but it nonetheless retains the magnetism of the PC games as your community develops. Evoland 2 iPhone/Android, £6.99 The first Evoland was essentially a megamix of the best bits from the history of role-playing games, from monochrome Game Boy questing to Final Fantasy-style battles. The sequel continues in that vein, packing in knowing references for long-time game and anime fans without bamboozling everyone else. From pixel-art platforming to 3D open-world exploring, Evoland 2 sends you through a montage of fun moments, both familiar and novel. Fortnite iPhone, free (with in-app purchases) A playground craze the likes of which we’ve not seen since Minecraft, Fortnite is a colourful, rather creative battle-royale shooter: 100 players begin a match, one remains at the end. Where Fortnite prevails over its rival PUBG, which also appeared on phones this month, is that it feels natural on a touchscreen, from the smart placement of the on-screen buttons to double-tap gestures that make aiming while running painless. You might download it for your kids, but you’ll want to play it yourself. Alto’s Odyssey iPhone/Android, £4.99 Alto’s Adventure, from 2015, was a beautiful-looking, endless snowboarding game, but developer Snowman has swapped snow for sand for the sequel, with a desert theme providing plenty more scenery to gawp at. You’ll be swooping down slopes, flipping somersaults while airborne, and avoiding obstacles from rock-piles to chasms, taking in sunsets and storms. It’s calming and meditative, with a zen mode that strips out the scoring aspect for an even more relaxed experience. The Room: Old Sins iPhone/Android, £4.99 The fourth in a series of super-tactile puzzle-box games, Old Sins bucks the law of diminishing returns: it’s the best yet. Exploring a ghostly doll’s house, you solve a physical puzzles by manipulating the objects you find there, sliding open secret compartments, rotating statues and ringing bells. Experimental tapping will only get you so far: real progress (and intense satisfaction) comes once you tune in to The Room’s twisty logic. Hero Academy 2 Android/iPhone, free (with in-app purchases) This turn-based strategy game sits somewhere between Hearthstone and Clash Royale, because you battle with fantasy character cards. There’s a well-designed solo mode to teach you how to fight and build a decent deck, ready for taking on other players online. There’s a lot of scope to sculpt a deck for your preferred battling style, using archer- and spell-heavy ranged attack tactics to up-close brawny brutes, but the intricacies don’t feel overwhelming. Meteorfall: Journey Android/iPhone, £2.59/£2.99 More fantasy deck building here, but Meteorfall is focused on solo play, with elements of dungeon adventuring woven in to its card battling. You choose a character, get a basic deck of attack cards, then swipe your way through fights with monsters, stopping off to expand and upgrade your deck and level-up your hero. Deaths are unavoidable, but you can save the gems earned by playing to unlock some new cards for the next time round. It’s a tight, cleverly focused card battler with an irresistible one-more-go factor."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/ng-interactive/2018/mar/03/stephen-collins-on-thinking-of-leaving-twitter-cartoon","type":"interactive","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-03T06:00:10Z","webTitle":"Stephen Collins on thinking of leaving Twitter – cartoon","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/ng-interactive/2018/mar/03/stephen-collins-on-thinking-of-leaving-twitter-cartoon","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/ng-interactive/2018/mar/03/stephen-collins-on-thinking-of-leaving-twitter-cartoon","fields":{"headline":"Stephen Collins on thinking of leaving Twitter – cartoon","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/feb/27/worlds-oldest-art-is-in-africa-not-europe","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-27T18:21:47Z","webTitle":"World’s oldest art is in Africa, not Europe | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/feb/27/worlds-oldest-art-is-in-africa-not-europe","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/feb/27/worlds-oldest-art-is-in-africa-not-europe","fields":{"headline":"World’s oldest art is in Africa, not Europe","bodyText":"Given all the recent publicity about the attribution of European cave paintings to Neanderthal artists at an earlier date than expected for Homo sapiens (Neanderthals were artists 65,000 years ago, 23 February), it is a pity the Guardian does not recall its own previous headlines.

It’s something sensible parents teach their children not to do. But Finn Russell did on Saturday night, and he got it just right. The ball flew up over Jonathan Joseph, who stretched for it like a toddler reaching for the cookie jar, and down into the little patch of empty space just beyond him, where Huw Jones gathered it in, clutched it to his gut without breaking stride, then burst upfield. It was a fine, foolish pass, a high, wide and handsome folly of a throw. Just like a few that Gregor Townsend made back in his day. Townsend is unusual among international coaches in that he had a long Test-match career himself, 82 games for Scotland and a couple more for the British &amp; Irish Lions on their famous tour in 1997. Eddie Jones has a theory that men who don’t quite cut it as players make good coaches because they’ve got so much left to prove. Townsend won more Test caps than the other men coaching the world’s top 10 teams did between them, but you wonder if he felt unfulfilled when he quit playing. Scotland only won 32 of those 82 games, after all. Townsend has always had a very clear idea of the kind of game Scotland should play – “a great brand of open rugby” – but often seemed to be working from a different script to his coaches, sometimes even his team-mates. He was often switched to centre, even full-back, because his coaches didn’t always trust him to run the game from fly-half. Now he’s in charge, he can get them playing his way at last. And you can see how his own experiences as a player influenced the way he handled Russell in these past few weeks. Townsend was quick to support Russell after he played poorly in the opening match of the Six Nations tournament against Wales, swift to dismiss questions about his place after his middling performance against France the following week. Because any fool can think to throw a pass like the one Russell did to Jones in the England match. But it takes a lot of confidence to pull it off. And Townsend knows himself just how hard it is to make the game look that easy. The moment that made Townsend’s career as a player lasted just under three seconds. He was one of those happy athletes who seemed to run on a different clock to the rest of us, who have a radically different sense of how much can be done in the briefest moment. It was during Scotland’s match in Paris back in 1995. They were five points down and there was a minute or so to go. Townsend took the ball on the French 10m line, stepped off his left, and was swallowed up in a tackle. As he fell, he curled his arm around and flicked the ball up into the air to his right side. Then came Gavin Hastings, with such a head of steam on that he sped through and scored under the posts. Scotland won. Townsend’s pass was so good that they christened it, the ‘Toonie flip’. It looks like an instinctive, intuitive piece of play. Until you hear Townsend talk about just how much thought he put into it, describe the granular detail of it, tell how he cut in because he could sense the defence drifting, how he made sure to wrest free his elbows in the tackle and hold contact for a split second to buy time, then changed his mind which way to pass when he heard Hastings call over his shoulder. “Things do not happen by luck,” Townsend says, “they happen by learning, by experience, by improving technique in these situations.” Good judgment comes from experience, and experience comes from bad judgment. Like Russell, Townsend made a lot of costly mistakes, especially in those early days. There was a bad one in that very same match, which he calls his “breakthrough game”, when he missed touch, a mistake Russell’s often made, and flopped a weak kick straight to Philippe Saint-André, who ran it back for a try. So as a coach Townsend has a different approach to Jones, who is on record as saying that his ideal team includes 13 players who will rate seven out of 10 in every match, because “if we have that, we’re going to be in the game”. The other two are what he calls his “x-factor players”, men who will play at “nine out of 10 performance then the next week may drop to a four.” Only, “you can’t have more than two of those, because otherwise you get too much variation in your performance.” It’s worked for him, and won him 24 games out of 26. Townsend has gone in another direction. Which may be why his side can be pummelled by Wales one week, then wallop England another. After that match, the game where Townsend used the Toonie flip, the President of the French Federation, Bernard Lapasset, told the players that the result was a reminder that “rugby is not for the country that is richer, or stronger, it is for the country that shows the greater courage, discipline, and teamwork over 80 minutes”. Which, Townsend will tell you, still holds true today. We saw that on Saturday night."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"social-care-network/2018/mar/08/learning-disability-care-faces-disaster-over-back-pay-bill","type":"article","sectionId":"social-care-network","sectionName":"Social Care Network","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-08T09:07:00Z","webTitle":"Learning disability care faces disaster over back pay bill | Martin Green","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2018/mar/08/learning-disability-care-faces-disaster-over-back-pay-bill","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/social-care-network/2018/mar/08/learning-disability-care-faces-disaster-over-back-pay-bill","fields":{"headline":"Learning disability care faces disaster over back pay bill","bodyText":"Thousands of people with learning disabilities and other needs depend on support provided via a care worker sleeping overnight, but these services are under threat because of a huge back pay bill. Social care faces a funding gap that has been described by the Care Quality Commission as pushing provision to a “tipping point”; we cannot afford continuing uncertainty around how to fund the estimated £400m cost of back pay for sleep-in shifts. This crisis has arisen due to lack of clarity in national minimum wage regulations and inconsistent government guidance. The result is an impending disaster for learning disability care. Services are closing and providers are handing back contracts. We are asking the government to ensure that funding is made available to cover this liability – which could stretch to up to six years of back pay. While the government has waived financial penalties over back payments, it has not presented a solution or funding to settle the bill. Instead, it has instituted the Social Care Compliance Scheme, which encourages care providers to calculate the extent of their own liabilities and pay them to HMRC by the end of March 2019. As Matt Wort, a partner at Anthony Collins Solicitors, wrote last November: “Forcing care providers to pay for the government’s own mistakes and leaving essential services at the mercy of HMRC is both unethical and nonsensical.” So what are the hopes of a resolution to this increasingly worrying and seemingly intractable situation? One of the irons still in the fire is an impending Mencap court of appeal case due to be heard in March. The case concerns the specifics of whether a Mencap employee was “working” when she was on a sleep shift. Care England has been given the right to intervene in the Mencap appeal hearing and has submitted written evidence, with the support of Anthony Collins Solicitors, to the court. We argue the national minimum wage regulations were intended to allow the practice of making a flat-rate payment to a sleep-in worker (much like an allowance paid to on-call staff) and that they were not intended to apply to periods staff spent asleep at a place of work (the position the government guidance took until March 2015). We want the court to understand that the lack of clarity means learning disability service providers have to continue to work in a confused situation. Without a more straightforward interpretation of the regulations, the consequences of government guidance – acknowledged as “misleading” by the government itself – and the resulting back pay liability will remain. Clear guidance from the court of appeal for the sector on whether staff who sleep in are entitled to the minimum wage while asleep will be invaluable. Many local authorities and clinical commissioning groups do not fund sleep-ins at a national minimum wage/“national living wage” rate – for over a decade their interpretation and understanding of the law was that sleep-ins were not working time unless a worker was required to perform active duties. We hope the court can provide much-needed clarity and guidance following the Mencap appeal case that will allow services and people in receipt of care and their families to feel secure that their ongoing care and support needs are protected. The original minimum wage legislation was intended to implement recommendations by the Low Pay Commission, which said people who were sleeping on duty could be paid an agreed set amount, as happened then, provided they were paid the appropriate rate if they had to be awake and working. We hope the appeal court will accept this was the intention behind the regulations and, if it does not, that the government will recognise that this is a problem it has caused and act to fund any liabilities providers have as a result. • Martin Green is chief executive of Care England Join the Social Care Network for comment, analysis and job opportunities, direct to your inbox.

A media titan can’t even break up his own empire these days without gatecrashers turning up to spoil the show. Comcast’s £22bn bid for Sky is bold, aggressive and cutely timed – qualities associated with Murdoch in his pomp – and, very probably, marks the start of a shootout for the UK satellite broadcaster. The open question is who will to go head to head with Comcast. Should it be Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox, whose current £10.75-a-share cash offer for Sky has been trumped by 16% by Comcast? Or should Disney, in the process of trying to buy the bulk of Fox via a deal that includes the 39% stake in Sky, take matters into its own hands and make a direct counter-offer? Therein lies the cleverness of Comcast’s timing. Brian Roberts, the chairman and chief executive, has a decent chance of exploiting the confusion in the opposition camps. Does Fox, given the importance of the Disney deal, have a completely free hand to raise debt and get into a bidding war for Sky? And does Disney, whatever it says about Sky being a “crown jewel”, really regard the UK TV company as fundamental to its wider purchase of Fox assets in the US? The very worst outcome for Murdoch would be to lose to Comcast in the battle for Sky and then see his Disney deal scuppered by US regulators, which is still a possibility. In that case, as Jefferies analysts put it, Fox would be left as “a subscale collection of mainly US assets with India as the only material international exposure”. Put another way, in that scenario Murdoch would have been outmanoeuvred in the current frenzy of deal-making in the international media industry. It is why he is highly unlikely to shrug his shoulders and just accept Comcast’s cash for Fox’s current 39% stake in Sky. He will want to stay in this fight. For Sky’s non-Murdoch shareholders, life is working out splendidly. Comcast, as a $184bn US cable giant, is plainly a serious bidder with little regulatory baggage. Critically, it would even be prepared to have majority control of Sky with Fox or Disney as a co-traveller – it has set the threshold for acceptances at just 50.1%. In the stock market, Sky’s shares shot up to £13.30 on Tuesday morning, anticipating that the bidding will go higher than Comcast’s £12.50 offer. Wind the clock back and shares in Sky, amid worries about competition from Netflix, had slumped to 750p before Fox pounced in December 2016. The long, winding and still-unresolved UK regulatory process has not helped Murdoch’s cause, but he knew the risks. Events happen. Perceptions of Sky’s value have also been boosted by a successful renewal of Premier League rights at a lower price than last time. Everything now points to an almighty two- or three-way scrap for Sky. This cannot be the ending Murdoch expected. He assumed Fox’s 39% stake in Sky meant he was the only possible bidder. He was wrong. Provident taken to the cleaners The directors of Provident Financial, a high-interest-rate lender to “non-standard” borrowers, now know how it feels to be taken to the cleaners. Their company is paying £31m in underwriting and advisers’ fees to get a £331m rights issue out of the blocks. Given that the new shares will be issued at 315p, versus a share price that shot up 70% to £10, the underwriting risk is negligible. Investment bankers win again. Provident can have no complaints, however, about the £169m it will pay in compensation to credit card borrowers in cases where the full price of an add-on product, called a repayment option plan, was not disclosed. For official purposes, the bulk of the sum is being returned voluntarily since it relates to events before 2014, which is when the Financial Conduct Authority took over regulation of consumer credit. In practice, the company had little choice. It was in a hole and the FCA could dictate the price of extraction: full redress for customers, a stronger balance sheet, and a board spouting lines about the need “to rebuild trust with our customers, regulators, shareholders and employees”. The last reference is to Provident’s botched shakeup of its doorstep lending division, the other factor behind profit warnings that have seen the shares crash from £32 last spring. If the new management can avoid similar calamities, which shouldn’t be too hard, Provident clearly has a future. And the FCA is right to let it have a go. Some of the interest rates Provident charges aren’t pretty – but there are uglier operators out there, not of all of whom respond to a regulatory whip."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/mar/03/the-seven-deaths-of-evelyn-hardcastle-by-stuart-turton-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-03T07:30:11Z","webTitle":"The Seven Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle by Stuart Turton review – Quantum Leap meets Agatha Christie","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/mar/03/the-seven-deaths-of-evelyn-hardcastle-by-stuart-turton-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/mar/03/the-seven-deaths-of-evelyn-hardcastle-by-stuart-turton-review","fields":{"headline":"The Seven Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle by Stuart Turton review – Quantum Leap meets Agatha Christie","bodyText":"Some books are a gift to the marketing department. The folks at Raven, a newish crime imprint at Bloomsbury, have described this one as “Gosford Park meets Inception, by way of Agatha Christie”. It’s a good tagline, but they might just as well have chosen “An Instance of the Fingerpost meets Battle Royale via Punchdrunk theatre”, or “Quantum Leap crossed with The Bone Clocks and Zork”, or “Cluedo meets Groundhog Day by way of The GCHQ Puzzle Book (with a twist!)”. So yes, it is derivative, but that’s not meant as a criticism. Stuart Turton, a debut novelist, has drawn on half a dozen familiar tropes from popular culture and reworked them into something altogether fresh and memorable. His murder mystery takes place in the classic setting of the 1920s country house, but right from the start, you know you’re far from Hercule Poirot territory. The narrator wakes up in a dripping forest, wearing someone else’s dinner jacket and, he soon realises, someone else’s body. He has no memory of who he is or how he came to be trapped inside this stranger. Twigs crack behind him. A heavy object is dropped into his pocket and a voice rasps in his ear: “East.” Once alone, he pulls out the object; it’s a silver compass. Eventually our man learns that his name is Aiden Bishop, and he is here for a reason. A masked figure informs him tersely that today, a murder will be committed – a murder that won’t seem like a murder. Bishop has eight chances to solve it. He will relive the same day eight times, but each morning he’ll wake up in a different body, or “host”. He’ll remember his experiences in the previous hosts, but if he doesn’t give the masked figure the name of the killer by day eight, he’ll be returned to day one, memory wiped, and have to start all over again. As indeed he already has done, hundreds, perhaps thousands of times. In due course, Bishop is told he has rivals: two of the other members of the country house party are also hosts to foreign souls, tasked with unveiling the murderer. Only one of the three can succeed and thereby be freed from the time loop. And, just to keep him on his toes, he is being sought by a psychopath, a knife-wielding footman who targets each of the hosts in turn. Looks like a busy day for Mr Bishop. This summary can hardly do justice to the mind-boggling complexity of the plot. There is a twist on nearly every page, and there are more than 500 pages. It’s a rare reader who won’t be hopelessly flummoxed well before the halfway point. And what a pleasure it is to give oneself up to the book, to be met with discoveries and thrilling upsets at every turn in the labyrinth. Not only is nothing what it seems, it’s not even what it seems after it’s been revealed to be not what it seems. “Fate’s leading me around by the nose,” says Bishop ruefully, and we can only sympathise. There is more to chew on here than just the mechanics of a time-travel detective story. Bishop, to his dismay, finds that his hosts’ personalities threaten to overrule his own at times, and some of them are nasty pieces of work, making him do things he would never normally countenance. “Every man is in a cage of his own making,” a character sagely remarks, and haven’t we all felt at times like impostors in our own bodies? There’s a moral aspect to Bishop’s dilemma, too. He likes Evelyn, and feels bound to prevent her murder – but how can he unmask her killer, and thus gain his freedom, unless the killing takes place? Here, Turton touches on a problem central to his genre: you can’t have a murder mystery without a murder, which is by nature a brutal act that doesn’t always fit within the confines of a traditional detective story. He ingeniously uses his time-loop idea to get around it. Several times he likens his characters to “shadows cast upon the wall” – and indeed, since each morning brings the victims back to life, the act of murder here comes to seem no more dreadful than flicking off a light switch. The price Turton pays for this is a loss of emotional engagement on the reader’s part. But as an intellectual thriller, the book can’t be faulted, and in the end, it’s the story that triumphs, with a series of last-minute revelations as dazzling as the finale of a fireworks show. I’m not sure it entirely makes sense, when all’s said and done – but who cares? If you want to work it all out, you’ll need to buy an entire sticky-note factory.

We need action now","bodyText":"At 11pm last Tuesday, I said goodnight to a friend outside a pub in Kentish Town in north-west London. By the time we both got home – about a mile in distance – each of us had passed a murder scene: four young men were stabbed that evening, in at least three different locations. Two of them died. At the police cordon by the junction of the nearby Islip and Bartholomew Road and the Peckwater estate, a large group of Somali women spoke anxiously into their phones. It felt like so many of the scenes we’ve seen in London over the past year: a shocked community coming together from different backgrounds to deal with tragedy. A young boy, now known to be Abdikarim Hassan, 17, had been fatally stabbed outside a corner shop. There was further trauma to come. News spread first of another stabbing in King’s Cross – a 16-year-old boy who escaped with his life – and then the killing of Sadiq Aadam, 20, in Camden. Word got round on Snapchat and Facebook as plugged-in teenagers told each other to stay home. Sadiq was the third member of his family to be killed by knife crime; his brother was killed before Christmas. These deaths hit a community already reeling from the ”wrong place, wrong time” murder of local rapper, Lewis Blackman (aka ‘Dotz’), 19, who was killed in Kensington last Sunday. How has this situation come about? It’s easy to jump to conclusions in emergencies, and tempting to blame cuts to local authority funding. But it’s not a cliche to examine youth services or policing and how they’re funded. Local residents told me that there were issues with policing, and with cuts to youth services, and that “there was nowhere for kids to go”. Camden is in many ways like any central London borough. It contains micro-communities with different kinds of housing, people from different socioeconomic backgrounds with different spending power living next to each other. At St Mary’s Church in King’s Cross Father Pascale told me: “People are affected, they are anxious about their children. They can become resigned to the frequency of violence after a while.” In Kentish Town, I spoke to a local youth worker who said that lack of housing and lack of opportunities were to blame. There was no long-term plan for community cohesion. “We need more community police officers. They’re shutting down police stations – it worries me. We are going in the opposite direction. We need a better prevention strategy.” He told me that the police have no relationship with young people and that they only attend emergencies. It’s no surprise to learn that knife crime has risen across the capital. According to the Office for National Statistics data released in January 2018, knife crime increased by 21% to 37,443 incidents in the 12 months to September 2017. 15% of young people have told the Ben Kinsella Trust that they have friends who have carried knives. This was a story I heard echoed around Kentish Town all weekend – the majority of those who carry knives sit somewhere on a spectrum between criminal intent and self-protection. A report into youth service provision by Green London assembly member Siân Berry last year, showed that more than 30 youth centres had closed across London since 2011-12. Funding to voluntary sector youth services had gone down by 35%, and half of reporting councils were planning more cuts in 2017/18. A council spokesman told me that Camden had spent £5.1m on integrated youth support services in 2016-2017. “This includes services aimed at addressing youth offending and substance misuse, supporting youth clubs and projects, and schemes like Connexions.” Spending on youth services did appear to be higher than some other London boroughs, and Camden set up a taskforce to look into the rise in knife crime in December. But this problem is bigger than any one borough. It demands a coordinated response. It’s true that across London services for young people have been decimated. Council budgets have been reduced by government year on year, and even those councils that are committed to maintaining a high level of service have to innovate and do the best they can. Doing “more for less” is a mantra within councils that comes straight from the coalition government playbook. It’s also clear that there are not enough police. Addressing a packed community meeting last Friday, local MP Keir Starmer admitted that funds for policing had been slashed by central government. The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has said that the Met has faced £600m of police cuts in recent years. The funding gap must now be faced by the taxpayer and increases in council tax. The Labour MP for Croydon, Sarah Jones (chair of the all-party parliamentary group on knife crime), has called knife crime “an epidemic spreading through our communities”. It feels like normal London communities are now living in a state of emergency, a consequence of failed domestic policies, lack of funding, and institutional indifference. What’s needed now is a strategy to combat this. For now, the immediate focus given the number deaths in the community must be to reassure people that they are safe. Resources must be provided for children who have had to go to the funerals of their friends and family members. Over the weekend, the playgrounds were unnaturally quiet around these areas of north London. All that can be heard in the area now are sirens and helicopters overhead. Flags hang on the railings of the Peckwater estate. “Together,” they read, “You hurt one of us you hurt us all”, “You boys matter”, “We stand together”, “A child lost to a family is a child lost to a community”. If it feels like our communities are becoming unsafe spaces for our young people, that’s because they are. We need change and we need investment. We need it fast. • Seraphima Kennedy is a writer and academic researcher"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"higher-education-network/2018/feb/28/qs-world-university-rankings-2018-natural-sciences","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-28T13:30:18Z","webTitle":"QS world university rankings 2018: natural sciences","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2018/feb/28/qs-world-university-rankings-2018-natural-sciences","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/higher-education-network/2018/feb/28/qs-world-university-rankings-2018-natural-sciences","fields":{"headline":"QS world university rankings 2018: natural sciences","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/mar/04/a-face-gym-is-a-fad-i-can-get-behind","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-04T06:00:39Z","webTitle":"A face gym is a fad I can get behind | Gemma Cairney","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/04/a-face-gym-is-a-fad-i-can-get-behind","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/04/a-face-gym-is-a-fad-i-can-get-behind","fields":{"headline":"A face gym is a fad I can get behind","bodyText":"OK, so I went to the gym.

FaceGym is inspired by an ancient Chinese practice that consists of an amalgamation of massaging and sculpting the 40-plus muscles of our face in various ways, as well as rubbing a healing jade stone into its crevices in order to release tension. The concept is quite different to what’s associated with your usual ‘pampering facial’ – it’s bit more of a butt-kicking approach. When my ‘trainer’ (yes, it is a gym after all) held a mirror up, after having one half of my face ‘worked out’, it was pretty fun to see that the eyebrow on the massaged side was higher than the other – something had clearly worked.

Opponents are entitled to their opinions; but they are not entitled to their own facts.

Cllr Bryan Lodge Labour, Sheffield city council • Rather than castigating Sheffield for being a one-party state, perhaps Green councillor Alison Teal should consider the implication of her party’s failure to gain more seats on the city council, and what this says about how most residents feel about the tree protests. Could it be that people are more concerned about the effects of austerity – poverty, unemployment, somewhere to live – than the retention of some dying and dangerous trees in more affluent areas of the city, many of which will be replaced? I suspect her history is also misinformed: the Victorians may have wanted to improve quality of life when they planted trees, but I’m not sure their effect on pollution was a priority for 19th-century civic leaders. Jeff Skinner Exeter • I wish the people of Sheffield every success in their struggle to save the trees. But I think Alison Teal might be pushing it a bit when she says that “Life expectancy if you live on a street with trees is around seven years longer; better mental health; more likely to exercise, more likely to walk”. My guess is that middle-class people already enjoy these benefits, as well as the income needed to afford houses in leafy avenues.

Having won in 2006 for his mordant half-hour death study Six Shooter, McDonagh joins Andrea Arnold, Peter Capaldi and Jean-Claude Carrière on the motley list of Oscar champs in the short film categories – largely overlooked each year because the nominees have been so hard for audiences to access. The advent of online viewing has done much to change that in recent years, though: gone are the days of having to predict the short-film winners based on which title you most like the sound of, or which one appears to be even tangentially about the Holocaust. Thanks to leading online short-form platform ShortsTV, this year’s nominees for best live action, animated and documentary short are available for download via Amazon Video – and it’s a compellingly varied pick-and-choose buffet, with a number of titles of interest to more than just obsessive Oscar completists. Only that group need bother with Dear Basketball, an icky animated tongue-bath of an ode to NBA star Kobe Bryant – written, as it happens, by NBA star Kobe Bryant – even if it is widely tipped to win, overcoming lingering sexual assault allegations against Bryant in the process. But everyone should seek out the corresponding frontrunner in the live-action category, Reed Van Dyk’s DeKalb Elementary, and not just because the cloud of recent events in Parkland, Florida make this stark, sober two-hander between a teenage high-school shooter and a terrified but coolly empathetic school secretary particularly throat-grabbing. Gutsily acted and freezingly tense without dipping into sensationalism, it’s a bare-bones 20-minute affair that lingers longer in the mind than some of this year’s best picture nominees. It’s the best of several shorts on this year’s slate addressing America’s current maelstrom of social crises. The short categories are usually where international cinema gets to compete on equal footing with US fare, but unless the japey, clever-cleverness of Australian entry The Eleven O’Clock – an amusingly ambiguous shrink-versus-patient riff – triumphs on the basis of its tonal light relief, it seems like a solemn, inward-looking year. The two strongest entries on the documentary side follow suit: Traffic Stop is a bleak, seething account of an African-American woman’s mistreatment by white policemen in response to a minor traffic arrest, while Heroin(e) transcends its corny title with its tough-minded, process-fixated portrait of three women battling an epidemic of drug overdoses in their West Virginia town. Even my favourite of this year’s animated nominees, Max Porter and Ru Kuwahata’s Negative Space, is far from a romp. (Though if that’s what you’re after, Garden Party, an impressively photo-real frogs-on-the-loose jamboree, does the job to eye-popping, toe-tapping effect.) But Porter and Kuwahata’s gorgeous slip of a heart-tugger, detailing the relationship between a son and his oft-absent father through a pragmatic suitcase-packing tutorial, shows just how much a movie can get under your skin in a mere five minutes. It’s a medium we still give unduly, well, short shrift, and I’m as guilty as anyone: the Academy Awards shouldn’t be the one occasion a year to draw film lovers’ attention to non-feature cinema, but they’re a good place to start. Also new to streaming &amp; DVD this week Call Me By Your Name (Sony, 15) Speaking of the Oscars, if you haven’t caught up with the woozy, winter chill-beating pleasures of Luca Guadagnino’s lovestruck best picture nominee, you can now do so at home. The Killing of a Sacred Deer (Curzon Artificial Eye, 15) Or bring the chill irrevocably indoors with Yorgos Lanthimos’s headily brilliant, black-hearted contemporary twist on a Greek tragedy. Thelma (Thunderbird, 15) Now available to stream on Mubi, Joachim Trier’s queer Nordic riff on Carrie got too little attention in cinemas: it’s cool and delicate and brittle as frost on a windowpane.

Researchers at the National Bureau of Economic Research think they might have found a new way to spot recessions early, based on a long-running truism that birthrates fall during recessions. They have gone one step earlier and looked at conception rates instead, and found these drop several months before any other signs of a recession – meaning we might have a new way to see them coming. However, as a sign no indicator is perfect, the US conception rate appeared to drop sharply late in 2014, with no corresponding recession having followed – yet. It’s not the first attempt to find a nontraditional way to spot recessions – here are a few others. The hemline index This disputed measure was first proposed in 1926, and suggests that the hemline of women’s skirts inch their way up (into miniskirts) during economic boom times, and become longer during recessions. More recent evidence has suggested that while there is an effect here, skirt length only changes a few years after the economic cycle – making it pretty useless for prediction. The skyscraper index Proposed – tongue firmly in cheek – by Barclays, this index posits that the construction of a new world’s tallest building heralds the coming of a recession; a pleasing theory to those who think recessions follow periods of irrational excitement with too much money flowing to grand projects. In its favour, this index has the completion of the Chrysler building and Empire State Building during the great depression, but more scientific analysis has not been so supportive. The “R-word” index This unusual win for media accuracy comes courtesy of the Economist, which checked the simple observation that when financial newspapers start talking about recessions – the “r-word” – one usually follows. They’re not usually very well ahead of the curve, but if you spot that spike, bad times may be ahead. The coupon index This one is quite neat: sites tracking the redemption rate of online coupons might help to show the start of a recession – as it’s a good sign that consumers are starting to watch the pennies, which doesn’t bode well for confidence. That said, there was a big spike in coupon redemption late in 2012, which wasn’t followed by a downturn. The divorce index There are two competing arguments about what recessions do to divorce rates: one is that because they make us miserable, we split up more. The other is that because divorces are expensive, people delay them during recessions. The evidence is on the side of the latter: during the last recession, divorces fell in both the US and the UK– so if couples start staying together, even that could be bad news. That’s economics for you."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/feb/27/customs-union-brexit-european-union-eu-turkey","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-27T13:35:58Z","webTitle":"A customs union won’t help – there is no such thing as a ‘soft’ Brexit | Vernon Bogdanor","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/27/customs-union-brexit-european-union-eu-turkey","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/27/customs-union-brexit-european-union-eu-turkey","fields":{"headline":"A customs union won’t help – there is no such thing as a ‘soft’ Brexit","bodyText":"The Labour party now supports Britain remaining in a customs union after Brexit. That is also the view of at least 10 Conservative MPs, such as Anna Soubry and Nicky Morgan, who have put an amendment to this effect in the Commons. Theresa May’s government therefore faces a real danger of being defeated on this issue by a cross-party coalition. It is easy to see why continued membership of a customs union appears so attractive. It would seem to allow frictionless trade without committing Britain to free movement, budget payments to the European Union, or supervision by the European court of justice (ECJ), and no hard border in Northern Ireland. The only major country outside the EU with which it has a customs arrangement is Turkey. This was proposed when it was believed Turkey might eventually join the EU. It is unclear whether this would be available for a country that had decided to leave Europe. But even if it were, the deal is highly disadvantageous to Turkey, and would be even more so to Britain. Intrinsic to the idea of a customs union is that goods cannot enter into it without paying the agreed common external tariff. Therefore only the European commission, and not individual countries, can negotiate trade deals with third countries. So Britain would not be able to negotiate independent trade deals with third countries that involved the lowering of tariffs. That would remove one of the principal advantages of Brexit: the opportunity to secure lower prices for consumers by importing goods tariff-free from outside the EU. In addition, when the EU negotiates a trade deal with third countries, the deal would open up British markets to these countries; but it would not open up their markets to Britain, since Britain would not be a member of the EU. The Turks were worried that, should the US-EU negotiations over the proposed Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership prove successful, American goods would be able to enter Turkey tariff-free, but Turkish goods would still face US tariff barriers in the US. A customs-union Britain would therefore have to conclude separate trade agreements with third countries so as to secure the benefits of the EU deal. But there would be little incentive for third countries to conclude such agreements, since their goods would already be able freely to enter Britain. We would be, as Barack Obama said in another context, at the back of the queue. While it is true that membership of a customs union outside the EU would free Britain from the jurisdiction of the ECJ, there would have to be some sort of body capable of arbitrating disputes between Britain and the EU. That body might be the court of the European Free Trade Association (Efta), or it might be a nonjudicial body. But whichever it was, it would in practice have to broadly follow ECJ rulings, as the Efta court does. There cannot be different sets of standards or regulations between different members of a customs union, for that would allow a country to subvert the common tariff. So Britain would have to align itself not only with EU trade policy but also with the laws of the EU in certain areas: not only as they are now but also as they may be altered in years to come – except without a vote to help decide on them. Britain would be subject to regulation without representation, the very relationship that led the North American colonies to break away from Britain over 200 years ago. But perhaps the greatest illusion shared by supporters of a customs union is that it would promote a frictionless border. Anyone who has seen the queue of Turkish lorries at the Bulgarian border, sometimes extending 10 miles – a two-mile queue is considered a good day – will realise that this is not the case. The 60,000 lorries sent from Turkey to the EU every year are required to carry a host of documents, including an export declaration, invoices for the products they are carrying, insurance certificates and a transport permit for each EU nation they intend to drive through. These permits, which are set by agreement with individual countries, can be made subject to quotas. The EU has so far agreed to frictionless trade and open-access road transport only for countries that accept free movement – members of the European Economic Area (Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein) and Switzerland, which has bilateral agreements. The truth is that there is no such thing as a “soft” Brexit without making Britain in effect a client state of the EU. From that point of view, May was absolutely right to have declared that Brexit means Brexit. The real choice facing Britain is stark: between a “hard” Brexit, and remaining in the European Union. A hard Brexit – in which the UK retains complete freedom to diverge as much as it likes from the EU – would work only if we were to follow the example of New Zealand and seek to become a global hub by adopting a free-market policy of radical deregulation, drastic cuts in personal and company taxation, the ditching of agricultural subsidies, and the unilateral removal of tariffs. It is, however, difficult to believe the British public would be prepared for so drastic a dose of renewed Thatcherism. But the choice should be made by the people and not by parliament. And in due course not only the remainers but perhaps also the government – deeply split, like the country, on the issue – will realise that it is in their interests to call a second referendum. • Vernon Bogdanor is professor of government at King’s College London"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"music/2018/mar/02/gwenno-le-kov-review-cornish-identity","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-02T09:30:44Z","webTitle":"Gwenno: Le Kov review – Cornish identity in full-colour psychedelia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/mar/02/gwenno-le-kov-review-cornish-identity","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/mar/02/gwenno-le-kov-review-cornish-identity","fields":{"headline":"Gwenno: Le Kov review – Cornish identity in full-colour psychedelia","bodyText":"The fourth track on Gwenno Saunders’ second album raises a question about whether lyrics really matter. Saunders narrates the verses of the brilliant Eus Keus? in a monotone, before the sung bursts into colour at the chorus, a euphoric series of chords with Saunders suddenly urgent over the top. She’s singing in Cornish – after the Welsh language of her debut album, she’s switched to her second mother tongue (English is her third language) – and one wonders quite what she’s singing about: something vital and urgent, surely? Then one checks the lyric translation. The verses are a roll call of Cornish towns and that thrilling chorus actually runs: “Is there cheese? / Is there or isn’t there? / If there’s cheese, bring cheese / And if there isn’t cheese – bring what’s easy!” Is the song diminished by being a lyrical throwaway, the way the Smiths’ Some Girls Are Bigger Than Others was? No, because you can imprint your own meaning on it. That’s not to say there isn’t seriousness of purpose behind Le Kov (which translates as “The Place of Memory”). It’s an exploration of Cornish identity, from feelings of post-Brexit-vote isolation, to calls to arms, to the status of minority languages. But casual listeners are unlikely to pick up on those themes (and the lyrics are sufficiently allusive that you need Gwenno’s explanations to get the point). It’s the melodies that will keep people coming back: purposeful and direct, but deliciously blurry, reminiscent of Broadcast in their creation of a psychedelia that looks backwards and forwards simultaneously."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/mar/02/gave-up-drink-carbs-iphones-boring-new-puritans","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-02T14:00:09Z","webTitle":"So you gave up drink/carbs/iPhones?

How about the things you don’t do? Carefully clearing every pleasure and convenience from your life, and wearing this sacrifice as a badge of honour, is a great way to bolster an otherwise lacking personality. In 2018, giving up is the new going out, and the new puritans aren’t suffering in silence: they want you to know all about it.

Even though trash culture is everywhere, detoxers revere books, candlelight and notepaper as wholesome and romantic. Meanwhile, their online lives represent a sickness that can be cured only by locking their phones in a drawer. Thank goodness for that, you think, as they troop off on their detox, to stay in a luxe-shabby cottage. When they return, they’ll tell you how incredible and inspiring it was to be switched off from the rat race while you stare at the top of their head as they hunch over their phone, uploading all the photos they didn’t have the chance to post while away. The poor souls look utterly glum in every single snap: no amount of Facetuning could fix that abject analogue misery.

Among the newly booze-free, there’s an unspoken rule – because, perhaps, alcohol loosens the tongue but theirs remains perfectly in control – you need to get evangelical if you’re going to make it work. In our booze-obsessed culture, anyone knocking back a lime and soda will be instantly accused of being pregnant, a secret alcoholic or, more usually, booooring, so the non-drinker’s defence mechanism is quickly to turn the tables and clamber up to the pulpit. No more gentle ribbing and batting off peer pressure to “go on, just have one, it won’t kill you”; they’re about to unload soul-baring confessionals, in agonising detail, about why they’ve given up the demon drink. I didn’t touch booze for much of 2017, and I have to say it’s hard not to appear sanctimonious when enthusing about clear-headed mornings to a lineup of ashen-faced booze-hounds.

Despite early signs of a backlash against #eatclean, self-flagellation masquerading as healthy eating continues to be popular.

They begin to shop locally – admirable – and gently rib friends for their certified Starbucks addiction. They finger fast fashion with distaste and wax lyrical about buying secondhand – although their attire looks more pricey vintage chic than a morning’s root through the “just in” pile in the local British Heart Foundation shop.

But Su Gorman, whose husband has endured years of ill health as a result of haemophilia treatment, does not believe this adequately describes Britain’s contaminated blood scandal. As far as she is concerned, it is simply a crime. In the 1970s and 80s, 4,689 haemophiliacs became infected with hepatitis C and HIV after they were treated with contaminated blood products supplied by the NHS. Of those infected, 2,883 have since died. Gorman, who works with Tainted Blood, the national campaigning group for infected haemophiliacs, refers to the Nuremberg Code created at the end of the second world war. “It states that nobody will be experimented on medically without their consent.” She believes what happened with haemophiliacs given contaminated blood products was experimentation. Haemophilia is a genetic condition that causes a lack of the essential blood-clotting protein known as factor VIII, so even a small injury can result in dramatic blood loss. In the 60s, a frozen blood product called cryoprecipitate was introduced, which could stop bleeding. But this could be administered only via transfusion, in hospital, and because it was produced from a small number of donors, it was always in short supply. But in the 70s, a major breakthrough in the mass production of freeze-dried factor concentrates, made by distilling the plasma of large groups of donors, meant haemophiliacs could now live normal lives. When a cut or bruising led to bleeding, they could simply take a bottle containing factor VIII out of the fridge, inject themselves, and their blood would start clotting. But the miraculous new treatment carried hidden dangers. British laboratories were unable to keep up with demand and in 1973 the government started buying cheap blood products from American drug companies. Much of the blood sold to British hospitals came from prisons in Arkansas, where a high number of inmates were infected with hepatitis and HIV. Whereas in Britain blood was given on a voluntary basis, in the US donors were paid for it – including prisoners. Many of those who most needed the money led chaotic lives and were likely to have infected blood – drug addicts, sex workers or alcoholics, all of whom were at risk of contracting blood-borne diseases. A single batch of factor VIII would include blood from up to 20,000 donors. If only one donor was infected, the whole batch could be contaminated. After Britain started importing blood products from America, there was an outbreak of hepatitis B in haemophiliacs. A 1975 World In Action TV report exposed the fact that the contaminated products had been harvested on “skid row” in America, and asked why Britain was putting its haemophiliacs at risk by not producing enough of its own factor VIII concentrate. But even after the programme aired, most haemophiliacs remained oblivious to the dangers. A few doctors explained the risk to their patients; many didn’t. To call the use of contaminated blood a “tragedy” suggests nothing could have been done to prevent it, Su Gorman says – and that could not be further from the truth. At best, the government, medical experts and drug companies were reckless and incompetent. At worst, they treated patients as unwitting guinea pigs and for the past 40 years have continued to cover it up. Su Gorman’s husband, Steve Dymond, 61, is a haemophiliac whose mild symptoms allowed him to lead a full life until he was infected with hepatitis C. He played school rugby, studied Russian at university and worked as a teacher before joining Cambridge University Press in France. He looked after himself, and rarely needed treatment. By 1983, government experts knew that those receiving clotting factor concentrates were at risk of Aids (this was revealed in minutes from a meeting of the Committee on the Safety of Medicines in July 1983, obtained by the Guardian in 2007). Medical experts recommended that factor concentrates undergo heat treatment to kill infection-causing viruses, but implementation was delayed because of the expense. After a British haemophiliac who had contracted HIV from blood products died of Aids in August 1983, the government still refused to accept HIV was blood-borne. Even though heat treatment was widely introduced in Britain over the next few years, drug companies were treating the concentrates at different temperatures and older, untreated ones were retained to save money. It wasn’t just haemophiliacs who were at risk: contaminated blood was also used in transfusions for the general population. About 35,000 people in Britain are believed to have contracted hepatitis C from contaminated blood, including Body Shop founder Anita Roddick, who was infected by a transfusion of British blood after the birth of her daughter in 1971 and died in 2007. In 1984, the US Food and Drug Administration banned medical use of blood from high-risk groups including prisoners. But the British Department of Health continued to import blood from US prisons, as Steve Dymond was to find out to his cost. ••• In the mid-80s, Dymond bashed his hand in the garden and it bruised. There was no bleeding and he was tempted to leave it. “It was fairly minor, so I was going to wait till the next day,” he says. “Su was more worried, so we erred on the side of caution.” “Some stupid A&amp;E registrar panicked, took a bottle of factor VIII off the shelf and treated him,” Gorman says. The next day Dymond went to the haemophilia centre at St Thomas’ hospital and was told he should not have been given factor VIII for such an inconsequential injury. He was also told that the factor VIII had not been heat-treated, so he may have been exposed to HIV. “That was another cost-cutting measure,” Gorman says. “The untreated stuff was put in the A&amp;E departments of non-specialist hospitals for use in life-saving emergencies. If there was, say, a haemophiliac in a car crash who’d die anyway, they thought it was worth the risk of giving them this factor VIII. It should never have been given to a mild haemophiliac or to treat a bruise.” Shortly after this, Dymond fell ill. The change was dramatic, physically and mentally. His muscles were sore, his joints ached, he was permanently exhausted. He would fall asleep anywhere. “Ten o’clock on the dot, he would always fall asleep. It was so regular it became known as ‘doing a Steve’,” Gorman says. His memory deterioriated. He would be on the motorway in France, travelling for work, and could not remember where he was going. Not surprisingly, he lost his job. In the early days, Dymond and Gorman had so much fun. They went to the theatre, travelled widely, laughed all the time. Back then, Gorman says, they could even laugh about his haemophilia. She regarded it as exotic. “When he told me he was haemophiliac, I was totally impressed. Queen Victoria passed it on to most of the royal families in Europe. The son of the last tsar was a haemophiliac!” Haemophilia didn’t seem so exotic now. Dymond was tested for HIV – which back then took 18 months. He became withdrawn. “I thought for a while he was being unfaithful because he had no time for me at all. The minute they told him he might have HIV, he took the most basic step to avoid infecting me. I had decided if it was confirmed he was HIV positive, I’d get myself infected, too, so he couldn’t shut me out and we would go together.” She gave up her job as a social worker to look after him. “During the 18 months waiting for the result, I lived in fear,” she says. “We had friends who were dying of Aids, so we had no illusions about what the endgame would be.” Eventually Dymond was told he was not HIV positive. That was in 1985. His symptoms persisted but it was not until 1997 that he was diagnosed with hepatitis C. Two days later he was seeing a liver specialist. “I said, ‘Have I got cirrhosis?’ And the doctor said, ‘Of course you do.’ It’s almost a straight line. You get cirrhosis, liver cancer, you’ll probably need a transplant.” “His liver is like a bunch of grapes,” Gorman says. “The medical term is nodular. Each nodule is a breeding ground for cancer.” Gorman is a small woman with piercing eyes and a fierce intellect. Dymond is a big, handsome man with a quiet voice and understated eloquence. Today, after punishing treatments, he is clear of hepatitis C (though it was a close-run thing: in 2016 he had a near-fatal stomach bleed). He is still suffering side-effects, including hearing loss, from the drugs he was given. But for the first time in decades he has the energy to discuss the scandal at length without falling asleep or losing focus. It is August 2017 and we are sitting outside a pub that looks over Pegwell Bay in Kent. The weather changes by the minute from sunny to thunderous. A little like Gorman. Forty years on, she is still seething. Dymond’s fury is more contained. He believed he had been desperately unlucky to be infected and that nobody was to blame. But over the years, documents have emerged that show the government was aware that there were risks with this treatment. Factor VIII concentrate was initially produced in 1966, more than a decade before the first Aids case was diagnosed, but as early as the 50s, experts had warned of the risk of hepatitis from mass-produced blood products. In 1974, American scientist Judith Graham Pool – who had discovered cryoprecipitate – described the payment of blood donors as “dangerous” and “unethical”. The World Health Organisation warned the UK not to import blood from countries that paid donors and had a high incidence of hepatitis, such as the US. America was not alone in exporting bad blood. Following an investigation, the Canadian company Continental Pharma Cryosan pleaded guilty in 1980 to falsely labelling blood intended for human beings as coming from donors in Sweden when in fact it came from cadavers in Russia. The blood was then repackaged and exported to Europe to be made into factor VIII concentrate. The danger of pooled blood products from abroad was acknowledged by British politicians as early as the 70s. In 1975, health secretary David Owen promised a £500,000 programme to boost plasma collection. He pledged Britain would be self-sufficient in factor VIII by 1977. But when he moved to the Foreign Office, the decision was reversed. By 1980, Britain was importing twice the amount of blood products it produced. In September 2016, Lord Owen addressed an audience of campaigners and victims of the contaminated blood scandal, referring to a “cover-up” and saying “incriminating evidence” had been suppressed by the government. “At every single stage, the truth has been there and people have evaded it, and that must carry a penalty.” Lord Owen was visibly distressed as he said: “I have failed and I feel very miserable about it.” Perhaps the most serious warning came in May 1983 from Dr NS Galbraith, founding director of the Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre in England and Wales. After hearing of the first death of a haemophiliac from Aids in the UK, he wrote a paper for the Department of Health and Social Security, saying: “All blood products made from blood donated in the US after 1978 should be withdrawn from use until the risk of Aids transmission by these products has been clarified.” But they were not withdrawn. The Department of Health considered his advice “premature”. Six months later, the then minister of state for health, Kenneth Clarke, told the House of Commons: “There is no conclusive evidence that Aids is transmitted by blood products.” In 2007, after a freedom of information request, Tainted Blood received hundreds of documents relating to the scandal. In one, dated 22 January 1985, Clarke had written: “Before we all panic further, it is presumably the case that the ending of the collection of blood from homosexuals greatly reduces the risk from blood collected in this country. Also, as only haemophiliacs have died and they may have had factor VIII from American blood, is it the case that we have not had one Aids fatality from blood donated in this country yet? Do we need this and heat treatment of the blood?” The suggestion seemed to be that heat treatment may be one expensive precaution too many. Not surprisingly, the discovery of this letter many years later caused great hurt in the haemophilia community. Gorman spits out the phrase: “Only haemophiliacs.” Between 1988 and 1990, Clarke was secretary of state for health. In 1990, he was advised by the then chief medical officer, Sir Donald Acheson, to settle claims with those affected out of court, to prevent the government being forced to hand over sensitive documents. It was reported at the time that Clarke was reluctant to settle, insisting haemophiliacs had to prove their case in court. In the early 90s, pharmaceutical companies began to produce synthesised factor products in labs, which prevented nearly all forms of disease transmission. But by then the damage had been done. *** The blood scandal was not confined to Britain. But in other countries officials and drug companies were held to account. In France, which was self-sufficient in blood, about 4,000 people, many of them haemophiliacs, were infected with HIV and hepatitis C through contaminated blood. France’s former health secretary was found guilty of manslaughter but not jailed; the former head and deputy head of the blood transfusion service were sent to prison. In America, the companies that supplied infected products paid out millions in out-of-court settlements. Japan continued to import untreated blood factor products from the US until 1985. Of about 4,500 haemophiliacs there, an estimated 2,000 contracted HIV and hepatitis C. Renzo Matsushita, former head of the Ministry of Health and Welfare’s Pharmaceutical Affairs Bureau, and two colleagues were found guilty of professional negligence resulting in death. But in Britain, nobody was made liable. In 2007, Labour peer Lord Archer of Sandwell launched a privately funded inquiry, but it held no official status and was unable to subpoena witnesses or demand the disclosure of documents. In 2009, Archer concluded that the government was slow to react to the crisis but no one was to blame, except the US suppliers of contaminated blood. In 2008, the Scottish government announced a public inquiry into the scandal there, to be chaired by Lord Penrose. It lasted seven years, cost £13m, made just one recommendation and failed to apportion any blame. Campaign groups called it a whitewash. On 26 April 2017, Andy Burnham used his last speech in the House of Commons to demand a Hillsborough-style inquiry into the contaminated blood scandal. Burnham, a former health secretary, said “all of us here are collectively culpable” for failing thousands of victims. He called the use of contaminated blood a “criminal cover-up on an industrial scale” and threatened to pass his evidence to the police if the government did not act. Three months later, in July 2017, a public inquiry was announced. Campaigners such as Tainted Blood had spent decades fighting for this, but the news was met with suspicion. The government initially said the inquiry would be managed by the Department of Health, which Tainted Blood denounced as a conflict of interest (how could the department investigate its own failings?) and called for an independent judge to handle the inquiry. Last November, it was announced that the inquiry would move from the health department to the Cabinet Office, and would be led by a judge. *** Lauren Palmer radiates optimism. Her sentences are punctuated with laughter and the walls of her Bristol flat are papered in feel-good sayings – Believe in your Dreams, Dream Big, Love Always, Shine Bright. It is this positivity that has helped her cope with a shocking childhood trauma. In August 1994, her mother and father died within eight days of each other. Her father was a severe haemophiliac. With hindsight, she thinks that is why they never had a close bond – young Lauren was a handful and one friendly knock could have made him bleed. But she was extremely close to her mother and her two older half-brothers, and life was fun. Then one day her mother called a family meeting. Palmer was nine, and she knew it was serious by the expression on her mother’s face. “Dad was living back with his parents because he was quite ill. Mum sat us down and said she had this disease, HIV. I burst into tears. I didn’t know what it was, but I knew that she was going into hospital and she wouldn’t be getting better. That was in our summer holidays.” Within weeks both her parents were dead. Her father had been infected after receiving contaminated factor VIII and had unknowingly passed it to his wife. It is only recently that Lauren learned her parents also had hepatitis C, which is much more contagious than HIV. Palmer, now 34, heard talk of contaminated blood, but she did not want to know more. On the other hand, she could not totally avoid the consequences of what happened: as the daughter of a haemophiliac, she would be a carrier of the gene. As a young girl she was told this meant that if she had children, there was a high chance any boys would be infected. Her parents’ deaths tore her life apart. Palmer’s half-brothers went to live with their father in Wiltshire, while she moved in with her mother’s sister and her family in West Sussex. She couldn’t sleep, struggled with eating and started to wet the bed. She never spoke about how her parents had died because her aunt told her she shouldn’t mention it. “She said we couldn’t talk about HIV with anybody because it wouldn’t be accepted, so I never did.” Last year, she was forced to confront the horror of what happened when she found herself watching a Panorama documentary about the contaminated blood scandal. Palmer had no idea that thousands of haemophiliacs lost their lives in a similar way to her father. She decided she could not stay silent any more. After her parents died, she found letters her mother had written to MPs and celebrities, trying to draw attention to the scandal. Now, 24 years after her parents died, it is time for Palmer to fight for them. “I couldn’t believe so many people had died and so many were still suffering. It’s ripped apart the lives of every single family I’ve spoken to.” Palmer recently took a less demanding job, so she can devote more time to campaigning. *** It is not simply what happened that is so shocking, but the scale of it. Treloar College was a boarding school for disabled children with a specialist haemophilia centre. Ade Goodyear joined the school at the age of 10. He adored his time at Treloar, a former stately home in Hampshire. After a lifetime wrapped in cotton wool, he now felt he could live independently – the teachers were supportive, the new revolutionary clotting factors meant there was no cause for panic if he bled, and he made many wonderful friends there. Goodyear says it was like being at Hogwarts. Ten other haemophiliacs arrived at Treloar at the same time, in September 1980. They were called the “golden boys” and treated with great love, he says. Of 89 haemophiliac children who attended Treloar from 1975 onwards, all were infected with hepatitis B and C, and 64 contracted HIV. Only 16 are alive today. Goodyear, aged 47, had three brothers who were also haemophiliac, although they did not attend Treloar. Two of them died after treatment with factor VIII – Jason from Aids, aged 28, in 1997; Gary from complications related to hepatitis C, aged 53, in 2015. While at Treloar, Goodyear was infected with both HIV and hepatitis C. He became a tour manager in the music industry, but had to quit because of the stigma attached to HIV – nobody would insure him. Back in the early days at Treloar, the “golden boys” were laden with gifts from drug companies. “We were given watches, stationery kits, backpacks and so on, branded with American pharmaceutical company logos by the very conglomerates that ended up killing us,” Goodyear says. “Looking back, it was a little like being groomed by pedlars of death, but at the time we were happy with the freebies. Little did we know what was to come.” Goodyear talks heartbreakingly of the day he was told he was HIV positive. “The haemophilia team just didn’t know how to tell us nor where to begin. We were summoned to the clinic one bright spring day in 1985. They said, ‘You’ve probably heard that factor VIII isn’t as healthy as it should be.’ They talked to us about hepatitis and HIV. Me and a mate looked at each other. Although there was this comfortable atmosphere, we knew the doctors weren’t messing around. They were talking about Aids. They went around the room and said, ‘You have, you haven’t, you have, you have, you haven’t,’ in that order. They gave us about two to three years to live and said they would do their best as always for us, but to make the most of our lives. I remember walking through the office and the sun was beating through the blinds, and I thought, ‘How many days will I be seeing the sunshine for?’” Of the five boys in the room that day, Goodyear is the only survivor. Documents obtained by campaigners through freedom of information requests have since revealed that government officials were wondering exactly the same thing. In one particularly callous memo, written in March 1985, an official discusses data suggesting that 40% of those infected with HIV by contaminated blood products will go on to develop Aids and die (a vast underestimate, as it turned out). While acknowledging the “strong cost-benefit plus”, in terms of lives saved, of taking steps to prevent the remainder of the haemophiliac population becoming infected with Aids, the memo points out that if the anticipated number of infected haemophiliacs’ deaths is reached, this will be financially advantageous. “Of course, the maintenance of the life of a haemophiliac is itself expensive, and I am very much afraid that those who are already doomed will generate savings which more than cover the cost of testing blood donations.” That document does not surprise Goodyear. “We were constantly reminded how much we cost. As a child I knew how much factor VIII cost because I was always reminded by doctors. It was around £7,000 a year at the time, about £20,000 today. It was drummed into us how much we cost the state, and how much could be saved if we weren’t here.” Goodyear says many doctors made it clear they believed haemophiliacs were not worth the money spent on them. “A doctor in the 70s once said to my dad, ‘The best thing for haemophiliacs would be to let them all go because it’s a terrible condition.’” *** At home in Newport, Colin and Jan Smith are surrounded by reminders of their son, also called Colin – framed photos of their beautiful blond boy, pictures he painted, toy cars. On Jan’s arm is a tattoo of a witch framed by neat handwriting which reads: My Witch By Colin. The picture is the last one Colin drew. “He was a cheeky little boy,” Jan says. When he was a baby, Colin woke up one day and couldn’t move his legs. His nappy had been wrapped too tightly, giving him internal bleeding in his groin. At the age of 10 months, he was diagnosed with haemophilia and treated with cryoprecipitate, administered in the form of a transfusion. It was time-consuming and had to be given at the hospital, 11 miles away in Cardiff: “We could be up and down to Cardiff three times a day,” Jan says. But then they were introduced to the miraculous factor VIII concentrate. If Colin hurt himself, instead of rushing to the hospital, his parents could inject him at home. At the age of two, their son was diagnosed as HIV positive. “When they told us, we didn’t realise it could be a death sentence. We were just told it’s another problem we’ve got to cope with, and he can be treated for it,” his father says. “They told us in the hospital corridor, with kids running past,” Jan says. “They didn’t take us to a room, just said, ‘Oh, by the way, Colin has tested positive for HIV.’” If there was a stigma attached to hepatitis C (people made connections with drug addiction or alcoholism because of the liver damage), it was nothing compared with the prejudice the Smith family faced. HIV was regarded as the “gay plague” and sufferers were demonised. “It was a bloody nightmare. Friends stopped coming to the house,” Colin says. “I got up to let the dog out one morning and there was AIDS written across the side of the house in six-foot letters. Another day there was a scratch across the bonnet of my car – AIDS DEAD scraped into the paintwork. Anonymous callers rang four or five times in the middle of the night, saying, ‘How can you have him in the house? He should be locked away somewhere safe where he can’t cause trouble.’” Few friends stood by them. “They didn’t know what to say to us, so they’d walk across the road.” The Smiths ended up moving away. Colin had a tremendous zest for life. But the last months were torture, Jan says. In December 1989, they were told he was not going to get better. He was in hospital and the medical team were performing test after test on him. His parents did not understand what the point was if he was dying. They told the hospital they were taking him home to die but were refused permission by the head of the haemophilia department, Professor Arthur Bloom; he said haemophiliacs had to die in hospital. They ignored him and on 19 December 1989, Colin came home. He died a month later, at the age of seven, weighing 6kg (13lb). “Towards the end we had to pick him up in two big sheepskins because if we picked him up in our hands it would hurt him so much,” Jan says. Bit by bit, over the past 28 years, Colin’s parents have been piecing together the full story. Three years after his death they discovered he had hepatitis C as well as Aids. Documents have since been disclosed that show Professor Bloom, who died in 1992, had been fully aware all along of the risk of hepatitis from contaminated factor products. In January 1982, more than a year before Bloom treated Colin, he and his then boss at the Oxford haemophilia centre wrote to all the centres in the country, telling them new preparations of factor VIII were going to be processed through heat treatment, “to reduce the risk of transmitting hepatitis B and non-A non-B”. (Seven years later, hepatitis non-A non-B became known as hepatitis C.) They explained that initial batches had been tested on chimpanzees but “it is unlikely the manufacturers will be able to guarantee this form of quality control for future batches… It is therefore very important to find out by studies in human beings to what extent the infectivity of the various concentrates has been reduced. The most clear-cut way of doing this is by administering those concentrates to patients requiring treatment who have not been previously exposed to large pool concentrates.” The acronym used was Pups – previously untreated patients. They were in effect being experimented on. A year after writing this letter, Bloom became director of the Cardiff haemophilia centre, where Colin was one of his pups. Another document about the factor VIII concentrates was recently discovered in Colin’s notes, written by Bloom in August 1983, shortly after he had started treating Colin. “All these materials carry the risk of hepatitis… but this is something haemophiliacs have to accept.” His parents were never told of this risk. The more the Smiths discovered, the more outraged they became. One internal document revealed Colin had been given factor VIII concentrate after he had fallen and hit his head “without any evidence of intracranial bleeding”. “We then found out he had a treatment for a swollen finger,” Jan says. “He had a bruise on his bum and they gave him a treatment.” The Smiths believe Colin was a guinea pig; that he was often given factor VIII when he did not need it, simply to advance the study into the toxicity of the products. Six years after Bloom wrote the initial note saying Colin’s treatment carried a risk, the Smiths took him out of hospital to die at home. Bloom wrote to pharmaceutical companies saying that he was unable to provide more “samples” because Colin had been withdrawn from his facility. The Smiths are distraught when they talk about it. Colin is purple with rage, Jan so upset she can barely speak. “We now know they used factor VIII on new patients to see if they would get infected,” Colin says. “They weren’t heat-treating it long enough. So for the sake of a couple of pence a unit they killed thousands of people in this country. We don’t think the batch that killed Colin was heat-treated at all.” At the moment, the government insists on dealing with haemophiliacs and those who were infected by whole blood transfusions in a single inquiry. Many of those affected believe they should be scrutinised separately, as conflating the two will make it harder for both parties to achieve justice. But the main reason haemophiliacs demand a separate inquiry is that they believe they were deliberately targeted and experimented on without their consent. They were never told of the risks involved, so they couldn’t make an informed decision: “A small community was targeted and betrayed. We were experimented on, then systematically abused by the government through silence about diagnoses, testing and monitoring,” Steve Dymond says. The Arthur Bloom haemophilia centre, which is part of the University Hospital of Wales, was named in honour of Bloom after he died. The Smiths are now trying to get his name removed from the centre. A spokesperson for Cardiff &amp; Vale University Health Board said: “We have not been made aware of a petition to change the name, but would be very open to discussions with patients and their relatives about this issue.” In 1991, a year after Colin died, the government made ex gratia payments to haemophiliacs infected with HIV, averaging £60,000 each. Stringent conditions were attached: everybody had to accept the deal for it to go through, victims could not take the government to court for any subsequent infections discovered and the government accepted no liability. It was not then public knowledge that the factor concentrates were contaminated with hepatitis C, though Department of Health officials knew. “It was a one-off payment,” Colin says. “A non-discretionary payment, they called it. We all had to sign a disclaimer or nobody would get anything. Men had died, wives were losing their homes and were desperate. We didn’t want to do it, but we couldn’t do that to them, so we signed. As it turns out it’s illegal because they didn’t give us the full information at the time.” In 2004, a further payment of up to £45,000 was made to those infected with hepatitis C. Again the government accepted no liability. Last year, Kenneth Clarke was forced to retract claims that victims of the contaminated blood scandal had been compensated. The word “compensation” was removed from his autobiography, Kind Of Blue, and replaced with “ex gratia payment”. Like Gorman and Dymond, the Smiths believe the Department of Health knew the risks and ignored them because they were determined to treat haemophiliacs on the cheap. For the Smiths, the forthcoming public inquiry is not so much about financial compensation but liability. What would justice look like? “I would need them to admit they killed Colin,” Jan says. *** When asked to respond to the allegations made in this article, a government spokesperson said: “The infected blood scandal of the 1970s and 80s is an appalling tragedy which should simply never have happened, which is why this government committed to a full inquiry to ensure that victims and their families finally get the answers they have spent decades waiting for.” Kenneth Clarke told the Guardian: “The allegations made by the victims of the blood products tragedy are completely inaccurate. I was not the secretary of state for health at the relevant time. I was a junior minister, as minister for health, and blood products were not one of my responsibilities. “In my opinion, victims have made attempts in recent years to bring me into their campaigns because I am the only person left who was at the Department of Health at the time and who is a minor celebrity still, so they could obtain more publicity for their complaints if they associated me with them. The two public inquiries that have been held so far have never seen the need to call me to give evidence because I have no close connection with the subject. I am of course waiting to see whether the new public inquiry that has been announced will wish to hear me, but I really do not think I will be able to tell them anything particularly relevant to the subject from my own first-hand experience.” *** In response to a freedom of information request, the Department of Health and Social Care revealed on 7 February that since the public inquiry into the scandal was announced in July 2017, 60 more victims have died in Britain. • Commenting on this piece?

Chief football writer, Daniel Taylor was recognised twice, winning both sports writer of the year and football journalist of the year awards. The wins are testament to a stand-out body of work which included Taylor’s revelatory coverage of the Eni Aluko affair and his interview with Rhian Brewster in which the Liverpool player revealed he had experienced racial abuse. SJA President Patrick Collins commented “Daniel Taylor is one of the truly distinguished journalists of his generation. His courage, persistence and flair make him a worthy winner of the highest honour that British sports journalism has to offer. And to win a second trophy in the hotly contested category of Football Journalist is further testimony to Taylor’s brilliance.” Donald McRae won the sports feature writer of the year award with judges commenting that his work shows “a rare sensitivity as well as writing style across areas as diverse as MMA, being gay in sport and mental health issues” and that he is “an incredibly warm and empathetic interviewer who writes with verve and bite.” The scoop of the year award was given to Martha Kelner and Sean Ingle for revealing Chris Froome’s failed drug test. The judges said it was “one of the stories the rest of the media were scrambling to catch up with. It was unearthed from a quagmire of confidentiality.” Sean Ingle was also honored with the specialist correspondent of the year award, with judges commenting that he “captured huge moments and took the reader there with descriptive, emotional writing.” The full list of winners can be found here."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"higher-education-network/2018/feb/28/qs-world-university-rankings-2018-chemistry","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-28T13:30:22Z","webTitle":"QS world university rankings 2018: chemistry","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2018/feb/28/qs-world-university-rankings-2018-chemistry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/higher-education-network/2018/feb/28/qs-world-university-rankings-2018-chemistry","fields":{"headline":"QS world university rankings 2018: chemistry","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/filmblog/2018/feb/27/uk-box-office-black-panther-the-greatest-showman-hugh-jackman","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-27T13:35:03Z","webTitle":"Black Panther digs its claws into the top spot at UK box office","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2018/feb/27/uk-box-office-black-panther-the-greatest-showman-hugh-jackman","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/filmblog/2018/feb/27/uk-box-office-black-panther-the-greatest-showman-hugh-jackman","fields":{"headline":"Black Panther digs its claws into the top spot at UK box office","bodyText":"The winner: Black Panther Having already impressed with its £10.5m UK opening, plus previews, Black Panther signals its likelihood for sustained success with second-weekend takings of £6.86m – a relatively slim 35% decline from the opening session. After 13 days, the Marvel film has notched up £29.5m. For comparison, Marvel’s Avengers Assemble fell 39% in its second session, by which time it had reached £29.9m. Captain America: Civil War plunged 67% with its second frame, reaching £27.4m – although it’s worth considering that this was just a 10-day figure, since there had been no preview play for that title. The biggest tally for a Marvel film after two weekends of release was achieved by Avengers: Age of Ultron. It fell by 41% on the second weekend, reaching £32.3m at that time. Globally, Black Panther is at $709m, with $404m from the US and the rest in foreign markets. The UK is currently the top territory for the film outside the US, with South Korea in second place. The phenomenon: The Greatest Showman Boosted by its release in a singalong version, The Greatest Showman saw box office rise again at the weekend – up 4% on the previous session. The film managed an impressive second place in the UK box office chart. That lofty chart position, and also a weekend box office above £2m, are both almost unprecedented for a film in its ninth week of release. Long-running hits include Frozen (£778,000 and fifth place in its ninth weekend of play), Skyfall (£555,000 and sixth place for its ninth session), The King’s Speech (£1.08m and fifth place at this stage of its run) and Toy Story 3 (£583,000 and fourth place in its ninth weekend). To find a film doing better than The Greatest Showman at this stage of its run, you’d have to go all the way back to February 2010 and Avatar. James Cameron’s groundbreaking film grossed £3.32m in its ninth session. At that stage sitting in second place, the film then returned to the top spot for its 10th and 11th weeks of release. The Greatest Showman, which has reached £33.6m, has achieved extraordinarily consistent UK box office throughout its run. Its maximum for a single weekend so far is £2.58m, and its minimum £1.93m. The indie hit: Lady Bird Expanding from its initial tiny platform of 10 cinemas to 190 sites, Lady Bird delivered an impressive £942,000 for its first weekend of relatively wide play. Its site average of £4,959 is beaten only by Black Panther – although the Marvel film benefits from multiple screen occupancy in multiplexes. Despite appearing in our Other Openers chart last week, Greta Gerwig’s coming-of-age comedy-drama has now been reclassified as a new release for the current session – and any previous box office now counts as preview takings. Including previews, the film opened with £1.23m. Lady Bird was the highest-grossing title at the weekend among the major awards contenders, ahead of The Shape of Water (£900,000). I, Tonya, starring Margot Robbie as US ice skater Tonya Harding, grossed £835,000 from 318 cinemas at the weekend, but previews push its opening tally to £1.05m. Among the major awards contenders, Paul Thomas Anderson’s Phantom Thread fell by a troubling 66% at the weekend, dropping to 21st place in its fourth week. The film has its enthusiastic champions, but naysayers include Oscar voter Jennifer Lawrence, who apologised for failing to last more than a few minutes when watching her awards screener. The Baftas bounce: Three Billboards Major wins at the Bafta film awards the previous Sunday, including for film and actress, saw a spike in attendance for Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. Box office for Martin McDonagh’s film rose 24% from the previous session, for seventh-weekend takings of £514,000. Total so far is £12.5m, which compares with £4.9m lifetime for McDonagh’s previous biggest hit, In Bruges. Big wins at this Sunday’s Oscar ceremony could prolong its life. The market Thanks to the relative dearth of commercially potent new films, UK box office fell by 43% from the previous frame, but the market was nevertheless an encouraging 33% up on the equivalent weekend from 2017, which was similarly light on strong new releases. Cinema bookers now have hopes pinned on the coming weekend’s new titles, which include Jennifer Lawrence as a Russian spy in Red Sparrow and well-received US comedy Game Night.

Chelmsford City, however, will race on the all-weather as planned, which means that with Lingfield also getting the go-ahead, racing will defy the Beast with a total of 13 races on Tuesday. Jorvik Dancer (4.15) is probably the pick of the prices in the sprint handicap at Chelmsford City. He completed a swift hat-trick in late December and early January but remains fairly weighted on the pick of his recent form and is a fair bet at around 11-4. Carolinae (3.30) should also go well at Lingfield, but with the Cheltenham Festival now imminent, punters may well spend some time instead looking at the ante-post markets. Willie Mullins, the leading trainer at the Festival in four of the last five seasons, opened his doors to the media on Monday, and here is a round-up of his comments on some of his leading contenders. Un De Sceaux (Ryanair Chase): “He’s done tremendously well all season. He’s the ultimate iron horse and he’s in great condition, though we’ve still plenty to work on before Cheltenham. Everything is going well with him.” Douvan (Champion Chase): “He’s been doing everything right and has a few more bits of work to do this week. I’d imagine he’d go for the Champion Chase all being well, and so far, all is well. He had a problem in his hind end last year, and this year, it was his front. But he seems to be fine at the moment and everything is holding shape. I don’t think he needs to school. I don’t want to jump him, I don’t want to risk it.” Yorkhill (Champion Hurdle or Ryanair Chase): “He’s not a great work horse at home. He’s very lazy and on the racetrack he idles a little bit when he gets to the front. I’ve always thought maybe we should have a crack at a Champion Hurdle with him, but he would be a nice one to have along with Un De Sceaux in the Ryanair. We’ll leave a decision until much later but I’d say it’s probably 60-40 for the Champion Hurdle.” Djakadam (Gold Cup): “He’s been disappointing this year but this could be the most open Gold Cup he’s competed in. His form hasn’t been good enough on the track, he hasn’t fired like he has in other seasons.” Killultagh Vic (Gold Cup): “I thought he looked in a very good position jumping the last [in the Irish Gold Cup, where he fell]. He had the momentum going to the last and looked like he was going away. I’m hopeful he will have learned.” Total Recall (Gold Cup): “Our aim with him is the Grand National, but I thought we probably needed to go for the Gold Cup. He’s a relaxed horse, he jumps very economically, and I think that will suit him around Cheltenham.” Footpad (Arkle Trophy): “He has a beautiful method of jumping. He always had ability over hurdles but his method of jumping has catapulted him right to the top [over fences].” Faugheen (Champion Hurdle): “It was great when he came out the first day [in the Morgiana Hurdle] and won, and he ran a grand race, way better than at Christmas anyhow, last time. But he’ll have to up his game to go and win at Cheltenham. He might not need to be as good as he once was, and I think he’s still competitive.” Melon (Champion Hurdle): “He didn’t face his hood when we tried him in it last time so we’ll take all the gear off at Cheltenham.” Rathvinden (RSA Chase/National Hunt Chase): “He could go any trip, and I think the four-miler [National Hunt Chase] could be the way that we’ll go.” Penhill (Stayers’ Hurdle): “All his work has been good. The aim all year was to get him to Cheltenham and Punchestown and if all goes well, he’ll saddle up and go there.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"music/2018/feb/28/les-talens-lyriques-rousset-wigmore-hall-london","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-28T12:57:24Z","webTitle":"Les Talens Lyriques/Rousset review –  17th-century Venice comes to musical life","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/feb/28/les-talens-lyriques-rousset-wigmore-hall-london","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/feb/28/les-talens-lyriques-rousset-wigmore-hall-london","fields":{"headline":"Les Talens Lyriques/Rousset review –  17th-century Venice comes to musical life","bodyText":"Christophe Rousset’s latest concert with Les Talens Lyriques was titled Love and Death in Venice and it was a beautifully programmed exploration of the Italian city’s baroque legacy that emphasised its liberal, cosmopolitan appeal for composers in the 17th century. Monteverdi was represented by duets from his Seventh Book of Madrigals and scenes from L’Incoronazione di Poppea. There were extracts from operas by his younger contemporaries Luigi Rossi and Francesco Cavalli, along with instrumental works by Dario Castello and Johann Rosenmüller. We know little about Castello biographically; Rosenmüller, who was gay, left Leipzig for Venice after effectively being outed. Rousset’s singers were sopranos Jodie Devos and Judith van Wanroij, both fine artists, though their voices didn’t always blend ideally. Devos has a cutting, laser-like brightness of tone, while Van Wanroij possesses greater warmth and a wider expressive range. The contrast proved telling in the operatic extracts. Devos made a calculating Poppea opposite Van Wanroij’s ardent, besotted Nero in L’Incoronazione, and was an impulsive Eurydice to Van Wanroij’s introspective Orpheus in scenes from Rossi’s Orfeo. In the duets, however, Devos’s penetrating tone occasionally became over-prominent. Pur Ti Miro from Poppea was neither as evenly balanced nor as sensual as it might have been. Rousset directed the proceedings from the harpsichord, meanwhile, with his customary sensitivity and elan, and the instrumental contributions gave great pleasure.

Cousins, a former president of the Australian Conservation Foundation, who accompanied Shorten to north Queensland in January to explore the various policy options for the Adani project, used a television interview on Tuesday night to publicly blast him for a lack of leadership. “Sooner or later you’ve got to take your heart in your hands if you want to be a leader,” the businessman told the ABC on Tuesday night. “You actually have to face down those people who won’t allow you to lead and say, ‘I’m sorry, this is where we’re going.’” Cousins said it was clear Shorten had met institutional resistance inside the party, forcing him to step back from the clear direction he had telegraphed to him in January. He noted Shorten had “made steps towards having a policy, but you can’t say those kinds of statements form a policy”. Cousins said Shorten had been asked by journalists repeatedly what he would do in government to stop the Adani project from going ahead, “and he has stepped away from it”. In a statement to the ABC in response to the Cousins interview, a Shorten spokesman said Labor was deeply sceptical of the Adani mine proposal and if it doesn’t stack up commercially or environmentally it shouldn’t go ahead, but “Labor doesn’t rip up contracts and we don’t create sovereign risk”. Guardian Australia reported the Queensland sortie by Shorten in late January. After he returned to Canberra for the opening of the new political year, the Labor leader telegraphed a shift in position on Adani after delivering a scene-setting speech at the National Press Club. In response to a question, Shorten dumped the oft-repeated Labor formulation on Adani, which was the project could proceed on its merits but should not be given taxpayer support. Shorten hinted for the first time an incoming Labor government might attempt to stop the controversial mine. He made it clear Labor was considering the issue “closely”. “If it doesn’t stack up economically and environmentally, it won’t get our support,” Shorten said in the last week of January. Labor sources subsequently confirmed Labor was considering legal options to stop the project, including inserting a “climate trigger” into the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, or triggering a reassessment within the existing framework using a trigger of the impact of the project on water, or on the health of the Great Barrier Reef. With the pivot underway, Shorten jumped on a report by Guardian Australia suggesting that Adani had submitted an altered laboratory report while appealing a fine for contaminating wetlands near the Great Barrier Reef. “If Adani is relying on false information, that mine doesn’t deserve to go ahead,” the Labor leader said. Labor’s pivot on Adani went for discussion to shadow cabinet in early February, but no decision was taken. Internal views within the ALP have been divided from the outset about how far to go in opposing the project, with some insiders concerned blocking a project after it has been through environmental approvals process will trigger a backlash about sovereign risk, and others concerned a hardline stance against Adani will cost Labor votes in Queensland. There have also been concerns that some of the potential legal triggers, including the options being pushed by the Australian Conservation Foundation, might not be effective. In the middle of February, the powerful mining union declared in an interview with Guardian Australia there was no need for Labor to toughen its stance, warning there was no point in winning the Melbourne seat of Batman, which is currently in play in a by-election, while losing seats in central Queensland. The CFMEU’s national president, Tony Maher, said if Labor took the hardline stance it was currently telegraphing, promising to stop the mine if it won the next election, then “what do you do with the next [coalmine], and the next one, and the one after that?” “I see no reason for Labor to toughen its position,” Maher said in an interview. “Why win Batman and lose in central Queensland? The CFMEU’s intervention was followed up a week later by the frontbencher Anthony Albanese arguing that Labor should not single out existing projects, like the Adani coalmine, that have already gone through approval processes “and then retrospectively change existing laws, which would have ramifications across the board”. Albanese effectively ruled out Labor overhauling the Environmental Protection Biodiversity and Conversation Act as part of a strategy to boost legal options of killing the Adani project. Shorten spent last week in Queensland coastal seats attempting to reassure blue collar workers. The Labor leader argued that his concerns about the Adani project did not mean he was negative about coal, or about the future of mining. The Greens have been campaigning against Labor on Adani within the Batman electoral boundaries for months. As Shorten has equivocated on his stance on the project, the Greens and local activists have ramped up their ground campaign in the seat, with the vote due on March 17."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/feb/26/florida-shooting-survivors","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-26T14:38:44Z","webTitle":"Florida shooting survivors have a voice because they believe in change | Sam Wolfson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/26/florida-shooting-survivors","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/26/florida-shooting-survivors","fields":{"headline":"Florida shooting survivors have a voice because they believe in change","bodyText":"Anyone who has attempted public speaking, especially to make a contrary point in a room full of unsympathetic ears, will know that however much you prepare, there is a moment where you just have to jump on to the live wire of the moment, when your mouth starts to run while your brain fades to white. That is what is so rousing about the speeches and media appearances made by the students of Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school since the mass shooting in Florida earlier this month. In nearly all of them their voices are breaking, they scream with rage, then they pause to gulp air and weep. They are riding the thinnest crest of a wave between abject grief, righteous anger and political will, seeming at any point as if they may by dumped by the weight of their own emotion. Yet despite this, they are able to argue their case in simple terms and identify the weakest link in the oft-perfected Republican script following a mass shooting. At a televised debate, for example, when Marco Rubio tried his usual “this is a tough issue, gun control won’t stop someone like this” spiel, student Cameron Kasky was meticulous. He first lavished praise on the senator for showing up and then asked him, repeatedly, whether he would refuse money from the NRA. It immediately exposed Rubio’s fraudulence, using sympathetic language with the students while still taking donations from rabid gun advocates. Rubio couldn’t find a workable response as jeers rang round the stadium. Most shootings like this stay in the news for a few days, normally accompanied by a half-hearted gun control debate, before falling further and further down homepages. So how have these students been able to progress this issue when so many before them have failed? Part of the reason is demographics: none of the children killed in the Sandy Hook school shooting of 2012 were over seven years old; these are middle-class students preparing for college. Their school was a place where political debate was encouraged, and there had been plenty of on-campus debates about gun rights when it was still an abstract issue for most of the students. Of course, many of America’s most effective pieces of activism have come from its most disenfranchised citizens, but as Trevor Noah, host of the Daily Show, put it: “A lot of these kids come from wealthy backgrounds. The school in Parkland is in an affluent neighbourhood … This is people using their privilege, if that makes sense. Because these kids are like, ‘No, I don’t accept this world.’ And the parents and the politicians are like, ‘Well that’s not how it works.’ And they’re like, ‘Well you need to change it. I don’t care. I want to see the manager.’” Both the media and the students themselves have suggested that the reason they’re being listened to is because they have grown up digital natives and they have been able to harness the power of social media. While it’s true that internet access will have exposed them to the power and techniques of activism, it does these teenagers a disservice to say they are merely wily online operatives. If anything, their success has been to avoid keeping protest inside echo chambers on Twitter and Snapchat, and reach out to normal Americans on TV news and mainstream shows like Ellen and the Today Show. Even in Britain, they have been a constant feature of Radio 4 news shows and the evening news on every channel. They have shrewdly understood that all media outlets are all hungry for access to the victims, and if they are willing to sacrifice their right to private grieving, there will not be a shortage of places willing to give them a platform. Another smart move was to set the date of their planned nationwide anti-gun protest more than a month after the shooting, giving the story an extended news cycle and infuriating the gun lobby which had hoped that national anger would dissipate as it had in the past. But perhaps the most crucial thing that makes them effective advocates for change is the basic belief that change is possible. One of the defining malaises of our age is the feeling that we can do nothing about the horrors we are exposed to every day. The American psychologist Martin Seligman called it “learned helplessness”, the documentarian Adam Curtis called it “oh dearism” – it is a feeling that intensifies over decades of repeated failures: if you have seen enough cases of police brutality, or horrifying wars in the Middle East or mass shootings you start to believe that nothing will ever change. These students are not only too young to have lived through the many times this has happened before, they have also grown up in an era of radical change: the first black president, the first president with no political experience, the legalisation of gay marriage and, yes, the rise of social media and its ability to give a voice to anyone. They have not yet succumbed to the idea that nothing can be done. One of their most popular chants, heard at rallies and vigils, ringing around the American news channels and no doubt in the White House, is “we have a voice”. On paper it seems like an odd phrase: it’s non-specific, it doesn’t demand anything of any power like most protest slogans do. But when you see it spat from the mouths of otherwise peaceful young people, you realise it’s not aimed at any one lawmaker, but the fabric of reality itself. These survivors are experiencing their agency, destroying the very deep psychological barrier that says no person can change certain inalienable truths about American politics, reminding themselves that every great change in history happened just after a thousand missed opportunities when things stayed exactly the same. • Sam Wolfson is a freelance journalist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"film/2018/feb/26/rotten-tomatoes-hollywood-love-hate-relationship","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-26T15:25:11Z","webTitle":"Ripe for a kicking: Hollywood’s love-hate relationship with Rotten Tomatoes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/feb/26/rotten-tomatoes-hollywood-love-hate-relationship","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/feb/26/rotten-tomatoes-hollywood-love-hate-relationship","fields":{"headline":"Ripe for a kicking: Hollywood’s love-hate relationship with Rotten Tomatoes","bodyText":"Twenty years ago, the internet was a very different place. Google was a fresh rival to Alta Vista and Lycos. Apple computers looked like boiled sweets, and we dialled up to “surf the net”, having installed the software via CD-Rom. The movie world of 1998 was also somewhat different: the box office was ruled by meteorite movies and Adam Sandler; Harvey Weinstein was an Oscar winner; and The Avengers was a lame, retro spy comedy with Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman. It was into this climate that Senh Duong launched Rotten Tomatoes – known in the business as RT – a site that has transformed both worlds, although nobody seems quite sure if it has done so for better or worse. Duong’s idea was simple – to compile movie reviews – and it still drives Rotten Tomatoes. He was inspired by his love of Jackie Chan and Jet Li movies and would scour the internet looking for reviews of them. So why not put them in one place? Duong already had a full-time job, he says. “Rotten Tomatoes was a side project I worked on in the evenings.” He single-handedly designed and coded the site in just two weeks. “It was very laborious. Every page was manually assembled using HTML. Every review was manually searched for, read and quoted.” In the same way that, say, lastminute.com and Expedia compare plane ticket prices, Rotten Tomatoes’ review aggregation has turned out to be super-useful, particularly as it boils all those reviews down to a single, convenient percentage score. It then boils down that score even further, to a simple graphic of a tomato. In the same way that Siskel and Ebert gave a “thumbs up” or a “thumbs down”, or the man from Del Monte tasted a pineapple and said “yes” or “no”, so Rotten Tomatoes’ “Tomatometer” separates movies into “fresh” or “rotten”. If at least 60% of a movie’s reviews are positive, it is graded “fresh”, signified by a ripe, red tomato. Less than 60% and it is “rotten”, signified by a green splat. Over 75% gets you a “certified fresh” logo, like a sticker on a quality piece of fruit. (The 1998 Avengers movie, if you were wondering, scored a supremely rotten 5%.) Today, movies supposedly live or die by the ripeness of that virtual fruit. Rotten Tomatoes has become the one movie site to aggregate them all. The Tomatometer appears not only on Rotten Tomatoes’ site but also on ticketing sites such as AMC cinemas and Fandango (which has owned Rotten Tomatoes since 2016). It comes up on Google searches, iTunes, SoundCloud, in Twitter and chatroom discussions and (as long as the rating is “fresh”) in movie studios’ marketing campaigns. It is a news item when a movie achieves a “100% fresh” rating, as recently happened with Paddington 2 and, before that, Greta Gerwig’s Lady Bird. With its dominance and prominence, Rotten Tomatoes is becoming the story – and not always in a good way. After Lady Bird got its 100% score, for example, one critic opted to lob a green splat into the mix, not because he hated the movie, but because everyone else liked it so much. “I had to consider whether to cast Lady Bird as fresh or rotten in the context of a perfect score that people were using to trumpet Lady Bird as the all-time best-reviewed movie on RT,” Cole Smithey tweeted. In other words, Rotten Tomatoes’ status as a neutral measure of critics’ opinions comes into question when it starts to influence those opinions. The possible gaming of Rotten Tomatoes scores has taken on more sinister aspects lately. Earlier this month, Facebook announced it had taken down the page of a group called Down With Disney’s Treatment of Franchises and Its Fanboys, which was attempting to orchestrate a mass troll assault on the Rotten Tomatoes score of the superhero movie Black Panther. Alongside the critic-designated Tomatometer score, Rotten Tomatoes also gives each movie an “audience score”, determined by registered users and represented by a popcorn bucket: red and full for positive; green and tipped-over for negative. The anti-Black Panther group sought to lower the movie’s audience score by bombarding the site with negative reviews. It claimed to have programmed bots to create fake user accounts. It also said it was acting in the name of DC comics, the main rival to Black Panther’s (Disney-owned) Marvel, but suspicions of far-right motivations persist, particularly because the same group had previously targeted Star Wars: The Last Jedi (also Disney-owned) on account of its supposed “social justice warrior concepts”. Rotten Tomatoes has denied the attacks succeeded, but at present The Last Jedi’s Tomatometer score is 91% (a critical “Yay!”) while its audience score is 48% (a public “Meh”). Was this discrepancy the result of far-right bots or genuine audience division? Either way, it didn’t matter much: The Last Jedi is now the ninth-highest-grossing movie in history. Black Panther is likely to be a billion-dollar movie, too. When movies bomb, however, the studios have been quick to blame Rotten Tomatoes. Last summer, Hollywood resorted to tomato-shaming to spare its own blushes over colossal failures such as Baywatch (Tomatometer score: 18%), The Mummy (16%), King Arthur: Legend of the Sword (29%) and Pirates of the Caribbean 5 (30%). “The critic aggregation site increasingly is slowing down the potential business of popcorn movies,” complained the website Deadline. Director Brett Ratner called Rotten Tomatoes “the worst thing we have in today’s movie culture” and “the destruction of our business”. He may have been stung by the fate of Warner Bros’ blockbuster Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, which Ratner’s company co-produced; it earned a malodorous 27%. The situation came to the boil with Batman v Superman’s 2017 follow-up: Justice League. For Warner Bros, the movie was a big deal: a superhero team-up with an estimated $300m budget. So, eyebrows were raised when Justice League’s Rotten Tomatoes score did not appear on the site as expected, once an embargo on critics’ reviews lifted. Even when those reviews were available on other sites and the movie was previewing in cinemas, Rotten Tomatoes’ webpage for Justice League was blank. Instead, the excuse ran, Justice League’s score was to be announced on Rotten Tomatoes’ new web show, See It Or Skip It, in which presenters provide “context and conversation” around the movie of the week before revealing its all-important Tomatometer score. For Justice League, that score was a decidedly unripe 43%. By the time it appeared on the website, it had dropped to 40%. Some observers smelled a conspiracy, since Warner Bros holds a 30% stake in Rotten Tomatoes’ parent company, Fandango (Universal owns the other 70%). Rotten Tomatoes, however, denied Warner Bros had anything to do with the decision: “We are absolutely autonomous, like any news organisation,” it said. “There is no outside influence on anything we put on the site.” If the studio was secretly trying to bury bad news, it didn’t work. The incident ultimately generated negative publicity for Justice League, Warner Bros and Rotten Tomatoes. Duong left Rotten Tomatoes in 2007 to pursue other digital media projects. “When I started it,” he recalls, “I was only thinking of its positive impact – that it could be really useful to film fans. And to studios: they could use the Tomatometer to promote their good films. I wasn’t thinking at all about how they would react to the poorly reviewed ones.” He notes that Warner Bros didn’t complain about Wonder Woman’s 92% rating, which it used in its own promotion. Often, though, studios find subtle ways to control Rotten Tomatoes’ message, or, if necessary, stop it getting through at all. They may screen a movie before its release to a receptive crowd – a fan-filled festival screening, say, or a cherrypicked selection of sympathetic critics – to get a decent Tomatometer score on the board early and hopefully set the tone. The biggest blockbusters are withheld from critics, or their reviews are embargoed, until very close to the movie’s release date. Occasionally (when the studio knows it’s got a real stinker on its hands) they are not screened for critics at all. As a result, no Tomatometer score appears until the very last minute. Last summer, for example, Sony embargoed reviews of The Emoji Movie in the US until just a few hours before its release. Critics gave the movie an RT score of just 6%, but it achieved a healthy opening weekend of $24.5m (£17.5m) in the US. Family movies are generally less susceptible to the power of the tomato, anyway: few parents ever dissuaded an eager six-year-old by arguing the data. Can Rotten Tomatoes really make or break a movie? It definitely has an impact, says Ethan Titelman, a senior vice-president at the Hollywood market research firm National Research Group (NRG). According to NRG’s annual survey, 50% of regular moviegoers frequently check the site, often immediately before buying their cinema tickets. And 82% are “more interested” in seeing a movie if it has a high Tomatometer score, while two-thirds are deterred by a low score. Furthermore, Titelman adds, “its influence is growing and broadening out. Once it would have been for your tech-savvy early adopters, but it has actually doubled its influence over moviegoers aged over 45 in the last couple of years alone.” Then again, a study by University of Southern California’s Entertainment Technology Center crunched the data on box office returns v Tomatometer scores for the biggest 150 movies of 2017 and found the correlation to be pretty much zero – meaning that, in general, Rotten Tomatoes doesn’t affect movies positively or negatively. Despite anomalies such as The Last Jedi, it also found a high correlation between critics’ scores and audience scores, which suggests that everyone tends to agree when a movie sucks. “When Hollywood executives complain about Rotten Tomatoes scores,” the researcher concluded, “they’re really complaining about their audience’s tastes because it’s basically the same thing.” Steven Gaydos, the executive editor of Variety, dismisses the studios’ complaints out of hand: “It’s really a case of ‘shoot the messenger’,” he says. “If Rotten Tomatoes reflects the consensus of opinion on a movie and the movie is bad and therefore doesn’t do well, what part of that is Rotten Tomatoes doing something nefarious or terrible?” Studios today bank on fewer, bigger movies, each of which can represent an investment of half a billion dollars in production and marketing costs, Gaydos points out. Also, a movie’s opening weekend typically accounts for one-third of its total box office. “So, you can imagine how much pressure there is to get an opening weekend that has not been damaged or diminished by a bad Rotten Tomatoes score. Everything is at stake.” Rotten Tomatoes may not be killing movies, but it could well be killing movie criticism. Not only by attempting to bypass professionals and build buzz with the fans, but also by its inherent premise. Rotten Tomatoes only registers if each review is positive or negative (its rival Metacritic, by contrast, assigns a percentage score to each individual review, then calculates the average). A movie that everyone agrees is simply “quite good” could therefore be 100% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes, while movies that are more challenging, controversial or experimental are more likely to divide critics and get a lower score. The system favours safety and consensus. As well as movies, Rotten Tomatoes is grading the critics: if a reviewer goes against the grain, the Tomatometer score is “proof” that they are “wrong”. “It’s self-censorship,” says Variety’s Gaydos. “Critics have trained themselves to [pretend to] take seriously movies that they don’t take seriously because the danger is not having a job and not being ‘relevant’, being aged out of the discussion.” The numbers bear out this trend. The median Tomatometer score for movies grossing more than $2m was 51% during the 2000s and 53% during the 2010s. In 2017, though, the year of crashes such as Baywatch and Pirates of the Caribbean 5, the median was 71%. Either critics are enjoying movies more or movies are better than ever. Gaydos’s fear is that Rotten Tomatoes is replacing nuanced, thoughtful film writing. “We used to read Andrew Sarris and Pauline Kael arguing, and now we’re looking at a picture of a green tomato or a red tomato. We have to see what we’ve lost here, people!” Film-makers have expressed similar sentiments. Martin Scorsese complained that sites such as Rotten Tomatoes have “absolutely nothing to do with real film criticism. They rate a picture the way you’d rate … a household appliance in Consumer Reports … The film-maker is reduced to a content manufacturer and the viewer to an unadventurous consumer.” Others disagree. The New Yorker critic Richard Brody argued that Rotten Tomatoes “has the merit of putting reviews by critics who write for smaller outlets alongside those who write for more prominent ones, which is all to the good”. Duong also defends his brainchild: “In regards to this fear that people would only look at the score and not read the reviews, it’s not supported by data. When I was there, 85% to 90% of users who went to a movie page on Rotten Tomatoes clicked on a review and left the site. It’s not surprising when you think about it: it’s a page full of links with enticing quotes.” When Duong created Rotten Tomatoes in 1998, Hollywood released many more titles than it does now, and they were reviewed by a handful of significant critics: major newspapers and magazines, syndicated critics such as Siskel and Ebert. The media elite, you could say. Today, the situation has flipped. Hollywood releases fewer movies and they are reviewed by hundreds, possibly thousands, of critics. You could see this as democratisation and diversity of the media, or the emergence of a cacophony of critical voices. However, the proliferation created an opportunity at the top to simplify and aggregate the multitude into one overarching meta-entity: essentially, a new media elite. Depending on how you look at it, Rotten Tomatoes either showcases organic, heirloom varieties like an upmarket grocery store, or it blends all difference into one homogeneous, easily digestible puree. The fruit is either half-ripe or half-rotten; it’s all a matter of taste."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/feb/27/share-your-experiences-of-making-friends-later-in-life","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-27T17:20:01Z","webTitle":"Share your experiences of making friends later in life","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/feb/27/share-your-experiences-of-making-friends-later-in-life","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/feb/27/share-your-experiences-of-making-friends-later-in-life","fields":{"headline":"Share your experiences of making friends later in life","bodyText":"Making friends beyond the heyday of our youth, teens and 20s can be a challenge for many people.

Meal for two, including drinks, service and chicken $180 (£130) How do you roast a chicken? Every meat eater has a method. Here’s mine. First I spatchcock the bird, by cutting down the backbone and opening it up so it looks like a huge albino toad. It roasts quicker that way, and where roast chicken is concerned quick is your friend. I smear it with olive oil, squeeze over the juice of a lemon, then season it with salt and pepper. I sprinkle it with fennel seeds. You want amounts don’t you, but I’ve never measured it. How about two tablespoons full? That sounds all grown up and precise. I stuff large knobs of butter into the bird’s crevices, while shouting at whichever tosspot pro-Brexit Tory MP is being interviewed on Radio 4’s PM. Finally, I shove it in a hot oven and forget about it for 45 minutes. After that it gets 10 minutes on its back. I turn it back over, baste it a bit and wait until it’s crisp. I check this by stealing the parson’s nose. My kitchen, my perks. And that’s it, in two short paragraphs. The recipe for the famed roast chicken served at the equally famed Zuni Café in San Francisco, fills four and half pages of the Zuni Café Cookbook. According to the revered Zuni chef Judy Rodgers, who died in 2013, it involves pre-salting at least 24 hours before you want to roast it. You also have to probe the space between skin and breast with nimble fingers, so as to stuff it with herbs. Next you have to take it to a retrospective of Woody Allen movies, followed by a feverish debate over whether the man’s work can be separated from his alleged behaviour. You might as well do that; you’ll be spending a lot of time with this chicken. There’s also a salad of old, rough bread, pine nuts and currants to be made, a kind of stuffing that never makes it inside the bird. All these things take time, conviction and a sense of unease that you’ve roundly screwed up what should be very simple. The most familiar dishes are always the most controversial where restaurants are concerned, and there are few more familiar than a chicken, roasted. It is the dish most likely to bring out the joyless inverse snobs who want you to know that they could do this at home at a fraction of the cost. Such people are of course welcome to stay home and enjoy their bitter, strangulated lives. The rest of us are welcome to find out if the professionals really can make the quotidian into the extraordinary, if we have the cash. The Zuni roast chicken is certainly a thing. It has featured on myriad lists of greatest restaurant dishes, compiled by the sort of magazines that put pictures of eroticised cheesecake on the cover. It has been like that pretty much since Rodgers arrived there from Alice Waters’s famed Chez Panisse just across the bay in 1987. The restaurant, occupying its triangular corner space on Market Street, is dominated by a wood-fired oven. Logs are piled around it. We are in a faux peasant, faux rustic fantasy. Along with the cooking of other Chez Panisse alumni, such as chefs Jeremiah Tower and David Tanis, Zuni has long been regarded as a standard bearer for a refined Californian-Italian style of cookery. The menu references tender herbs, and fennel, which is always shaved. It is not merely a list of dishes. It’s a way of life. Here then am I, in San Francisco. I have never before tried the Zuni roast chicken. It must be done. Five of us order two of them the moment we sit down. It always takes 60 minutes, so you have to get ahead of the game. Each one costs $58. This includes the bread salad under the bird and a thicket of dressed salad leaves on top, which changes with the seasons. At the moment it’s frilly mustard greens, and very pretty it is, too. That price does not include service, an obligatory 20%. So that’s $70. In mitigation each chicken can easily feed three. So how is it? Sensational? Not quite, but it is very, very good. They cook it fast and untrussed. The skin is properly crisp. The meat is not at all dry and, praise be, it tastes of something. The great failing is the lack of lubrication. No gravy, jus or juices. It cries out for a drenching, not to make it less dry but to make it more thrilling. Happily, though, there is the bread salad, full of crisped croutons dressed first in the molten chicken fat and then a fine vinaigrette, with hits of sour and sweet from the currants. On the side is a rustling heap of matchstick-like shoestring potatoes, at another $8. My suspicion is that to replicate this at home really would take a couple of days, and even then you wouldn’t quite be there. But it is one of those bucket list jobs. I’ve done it. I don’t quite feel the need to do it again, not at that price. Curiously, I would rush back for many of the other things: the perfect, unviolated caesar salad, possibly the best version I’ve ever eaten. There are crisp leaves of romaine, garlicky croutons, a simple dressing of olive oil, vinegar, a touch of mustard and minced anchovies. It reminds you why it is a classic that needs no adornment. I love the plate of their own cured anchovies, alongside finely sliced parmesan and celery, bathing in a pool of peppery olive oil. A pizza laid with “wagon wheel cheese” – if only they knew what bursts of sweaty-palmed nostalgia those words conjure in the UK – sliced roast pork, garlic and orange zest is exceptionally good. The thin crust is blistered from its journey through the ferocious heat of the wood-fired oven. Desserts are good, too, especially a Pavlova built around a crisp and soft snowy-white meringue, with the plump burst of purple huckleberries, and a Gateau Victoire of the very darkest chocolate. It looks like it will be heavy and cloying. It is lightness itself. Of course, the final bill for all this is of a sort that a city in thrall to tech Leviathan money will encourage, though you can eat there for much less. What’s striking is that a restaurant that has been around for decades is still doing the thing. It’s not become a parody of itself, knocking out greatest hits. The chicken makes its own case. That’s a remarkable achievement. Jay’s news bites Back in London, and at the other end of the financial scale, is the rotisserie chicken outfit Cocotte, with both a restaurant in Westbourne Grove and a delivery-only kitchen. A full bird costs £22, gets a proper seeing to on the rotisserie, and comes with, among other things, a punchy gravy. Side salads are hearty and they serve terrific roasted new potatoes (mycocotte.co.uk). A Swedish app called Karma, enabling customers to buy discounted restaurant food that might otherwise be thrown away, has launched in London. According to Wrap, the Waste and Resources Action Programme, wasted food costs UK restaurants £700m a year. Already 50 restaurants, including Aquavit and Calcutta Street, have signed up.

The game will be played at RFK Stadium, formerly home of the US capital’s NFL team and the DC United Major League Soccer franchise. The first minister of Wales, Carwyn Jones, and South African US ambassador Mninwa Johannes Mahlangu spoke at the South African embassy in Washington, at the start of Jones’s trip to promote post-Brexit trade and ties with the US and Canada. “The visit is about raising the profile of Wales and the Welsh,” Jones told the Guardian. “For a long time we did not have a political identity so our sporting identity was hugely important. South Africa are one of our oldest rivals – we didn’t beat them for 93 years – so a sporting occasion against them is great for raising our profile.” The game will be the first standalone event run by Rugby International Marketing (RIM), a company set up by USA Rugby in 2014 with investment from Wales’s keenest rivals: England. RIM also runs therugbychannel.tv, a streaming service available to US fans. Wales will travel on to play twice in Argentina, in San Juan on 9 June and Santa Fe a week later. Welsh Rugby Union leaders have suggested senior players, particularly those who toured with the British and Irish Lions to New Zealand in 2017, may not travel. Washington has been a rumoured home for a Pro14 franchise, in one of a number of attempts to establish professional rugby union in the US. Super Rugby was due to hold a preseason fixture in Los Angeles in February, only for the game to be called off. The Rugby World Cup Sevens will be hosted in San Francisco in July. Major League Rugby, a domestic attempt to replicate the growth and success of Major League Soccer, will kick off in seven mostly western cities in April. New York confirmed entry for 2019 this month while the former England coach Mike Ford is part of ongoing preparations in Dallas. “The game will be great for rugby in the States,” Jones said. “There is a real thirst for rugby here now.” According to USA Rugby figures, Washington is home to 94 rugby union clubs and school or college programmes, making it the No2 US rugby market behind New York City. Reports of Pro14 interest in DC have focused on Audi Field, the new 20,000-capacity home of DC United which is due to open in July close to Nationals Park, the home of the city’s baseball team, in the redeveloping waterfront district. The storied but somewhat ailing RFK has a capacity of more than 45,000, which DC United struggled to fill. Crowds for pro rugby in the US have been mixed. The USA and Ireland attracted 61,000 sell-outs to Soldier Field in Chicago for games against the All Blacks in 2014 and 2016, but only 23,112 watched the Eagles lose to the Wallabies there in 2015. The USA have done well for games against the Maori All Blacks at Chicago and Philadelphia’s MLS venues. Recently, though, Aviva Premiership games in soccer stadiums in New Jersey (14,811) and Pennsylvania (6,271) struggled to find big audiences. “Soldier Field was filled for USA v the All Blacks and for Ireland v the All Blacks,” Jones said. “There are obviously many more Americans of Irish descent than Welsh but the game is growing. “RFK is a big stadium but it is smaller than Soldier Field. I think there is every prospect that the stadium will be full. You would not have said 20 years ago that 60,000 people would be watching a rugby game in America.” Jones said outreach work would be done by the Welsh government’s office in Washington and the South African embassy, in part focusing on Welsh-American communities. According to the US Census Bureau, 1.8m Americans claim Welsh ancestry. The nearest concentration of Welsh culture to DC is to be found in Pennsylvania. That state will host a major event of its own on the weekend of 2 June, the Collegiate Rugby Championship sevens at the Talen Energy Stadium near Philadelphia. Wales (No7 in the World Rugby rankings) and South Africa (6) last met in Cardiff in December, Wales winning 24-22. South Africa last played in the US in 2001, beating the US Eagles 43-20 in Houston. Wales were last in the country in 2009, beating the Americans 48-15 in Chicago. The USA (18) have two home Tests this summer: against an as yet unannounced team in Denver on 9 June and against Scotland (5) in Houston on 16 June."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2018/feb/26/len-mccluskey-repays-400000-unite-put-towards-his-flat","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-26T18:14:01Z","webTitle":"Len McCluskey repays £400,000 Unite put towards his flat","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/feb/26/len-mccluskey-repays-400000-unite-put-towards-his-flat","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/feb/26/len-mccluskey-repays-400000-unite-put-towards-his-flat","fields":{"headline":"Len McCluskey repays £400,000 Unite put towards his flat","bodyText":"Len McCluskey has repaid more than £400,000 contributed by his union towards the purchase of a £700,000 London flat, leaked documents disclose. The leader of Unite, who is a close ally of Jeremy Corbyn, returned the union’s entire contribution to his apartment last month, according to internal union minutes. It comes as McCluskey faces an official probe into his re-election as leader of Britain’s biggest trade union. His rival, Gerard Coyne, has questioned whether union resources were properly used to assist with the London flat. The money was paid in February 2016 towards the purchase of a two-bedroom apartment near London Bridge, just south of the river Thames. When the Guardian disclosed the contribution in September 2016, the union said the purchase agreement was not a loan but an equity share arrangement that would be repaid 12 months after McCluskey’s employment ended. McCluskey’s repayments were announced earlier this month at a finance and general purposes committee meeting by the executive finance director, Ed Sabisky. It is believed that he has repaid more than the union’s initial contribution to reflect an increase in the value of the property. “On 26 January 2018, the general secretary had paid the last amount owed and had purchased from the union its remaining share in his flat,” the minutes from the meeting noted. “The union no longer owns a share in the general secretary’s flat.” The flat is two miles from the union’s offices in Holborn. According to Land Registry documents, Leonard McCluskey became the registered owner of the £695,500 flat in February 2016. Unite paid £417,300 towards the flat and signed the agreement with McCluskey. Some union executive members complained that the flat had been purchased without their knowledge. However, the union said the deal was completed with the “full authority” of its executive council. According to an estimate on the property website Zoopla, the property is now worth £748,000. The minutes state that Sabisky told officials the union had profited more from the scheme than if it had banked the money. “The executive director further pointed out that under the formula where the union had a share in the equity of the flat, the union had realised seven times more money than would have been earned in interest,” the minutes said. “The equity share scheme has again been shown to be helpful to union officials required to live where housing prices are high as well as a benefit (and certainly no detriment) to members who have gained from the property’s appreciation.” However, the minutes do not explain how the union calculated McCluskey’s final contribution. The Guardian has asked for a full breakdown of the figures explaining how much was repaid by McCluskey. Howard Beckett, executive director for legal services at Unite, told the Guardian in 2016 that the full agreement signed with McCluskey, which has not been disclosed, ensured that the union would not lose out. The union’s influence over Corbyn’s Labour came under increased scrutiny last week after Iain McNicol stood down as the party’s general secretary. Unite official Jennie Formby has been tipped as the favourite to replace him. Unite is the party’s most generous financial backer and McCluskey’s support has been seen as vital to the Labour leader over two years of challenges from some of his MPs. Retired high court judge Jeffrey Burke has been appointed by the certification officer to hear claims from Coyne that McCluskey and his staff manipulated union procedures to win the vote instead of him. The complaints centre on alleged breaches including allowing McCluskey to use databases while stopping Coyne from doing the same during the campaign and union employees seeking to prevent Coyne raising the question of whether union resources were improperly used to assist with the purchase of the flat. Unite insisted that the deal had been a “sound and prudent investment” involving a “modest flat”. A Unite spokesperson said: “The arrangement between Len McCluskey and Unite with regard to his flat has been one of shared equity ownership. This arrangement has been to the financial benefit of the union and was agreed and endorsed by the appropriate union structures. “The continued efforts of the Guardian to misrepresent this arrangement is not only unworthy; it suggests a willingness to oblige those who seek to bring our union into disrepute for their own ends. “It is common for unions to make such shared equity arrangements in order to help senior employed officials live and work in the capital. This modest flat was essential to allow the general secretary to work in London at Unite’s head office. “It is for the union to decide whether to sell its interest to the employee over the years of their employment for financial benefit to the organisation.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2018/feb/26/isabella-rossellini-isabelle-huppert-one-woman-shows-london-southbank-centre","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-26T12:48:47Z","webTitle":"Isabella Rossellini and Isabelle Huppert take one-woman shows to London","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/feb/26/isabella-rossellini-isabelle-huppert-one-woman-shows-london-southbank-centre","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/feb/26/isabella-rossellini-isabelle-huppert-one-woman-shows-london-southbank-centre","fields":{"headline":"Isabella Rossellini and Isabelle Huppert take one-woman shows to London","bodyText":"Two celebrated European actors are taking one-woman shows to London: one of them is bringing her pet dog on stage and the other will play sisters created by the Marquis de Sade. The Italian star Isabella Rossellini is presenting the UK premiere of Link Link Circus. Rossellini will portray Aristotle, Descartes and Charles Darwin, among other characters, as she explores what distinguishes humans from animals. It seems her dog, Pan, will also be taking on a number of roles. “I cannot have on stage all the animals I will talk about in the play,” Rossellini has said, “so Pan and I will dress up and interpret several different species. Link Link is in fact a little circus. Pan and I will address the newest scientiﬁc discoveries about animal minds, intelligence and emotions.” Rossellini previously explored the sex lives of animals in a surreal lecture, Green Porno, incorporating her series of short films. Link Link Circus will run at the Southbank Centre’s Queen Elizabeth Hall in October. Before then, France’s Isabelle Huppert will also alternate between characters in her show at the Southbank Centre. The Oscar nominee will play both Justine and Juliette, sisters representing vice and virtue, in Isabelle Huppert Reads Sade, adapted by Raphaël Enthoven and staged at the Queen Elizabeth Hall in June. It is the UK premiere of a work that she first performed several years ago. Huppert’s last London stage role was in Phaedra(s) at the Barbican in 2016. Rossellini and Huppert’s performances are part of the Southbank Centre’s 2018-19 season in which choreographer Holly Blakey and composer Mica Levi will explore the western film genre in their show Cowpuncher, and Scottish Dance Theatre present the UK premiere of Velvet Petal, inspired by the artist Robert Mapplethorpe. The centre’s Christmas shows include Rumpelstiltskin, a co-production by Australian theatre companies Windmill Theatre Company and State Theatre Company South Australia.

The Russian president’s move, which was announced by his defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, highlighted in stark terms Russia’s primacy in Syrian affairs and the UN’s failure to impose an end to the fighting in the area bordering Damascus. More than 500 people have been killed in eight days of one of the deadliest bombing campaigns by the regime of Bashar al-Assad and his allies during the seven-year war. The move by Moscow follows mounting condemnation of the violence, with the UN secretary general, António Guterres, describing the situation in Ghouta as “hell on earth”. Shoigu said a ceasefire would begin on Tuesday in the Damascus suburb and would take place from 9am until 2pm (7am GMT to 12pm) daily, according to a transcript of his remarks published by the Russian news agency Interfax. Russia, a key ally of the Syrian regime, would also help create an evacuation route for civilians in the area, he added. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said calm had generally prevailed in eastern Ghouta since midnight, though four rockets had hit the town of Douma on Tuesday morning. The announcement on Monday came after at least 29 people were killed in eastern Ghouta despite a UN security council resolutionthat demanded an immediate cessation of the fighting. Local doctors and monitors said at least 18 people had been injured by a suspected chlorine attack in eastern Ghouta on Sunday evening. Residents have condemned the international community’s inability to put an end to the fighting. “I am embarrassed for the UN security council,” said Ghanem Tayara, the chairman of the Union of Medical Care and Relief Organisations, which helps run dozens of hospitals in Syria. “The mightiest nations on the planet cannot enforce the most basic standards of human rights and decency.” The latest deaths in eastern Ghouta brought the weeklong carnage in the enclave to more than 500 killed in airstrikes and shelling by forces loyal to Assad. The security council resolution, which was unanimously approved on Saturday, called for a monthlong ceasefire “without delay”. “Eastern Ghouta cannot wait. It is high time to stop this hell on earth,” Guterres told the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva. Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein, the high commissioner for human rights, condemned the security council’s failure to end seven years of “unremitting and frightful mass killing”. He said: “Second to those who are criminally responsible – those who kill and those who maim – the responsibility for the continuation of so much pain lies with the five permanent members of the UN security council. So long as the veto is used by them to block any unity of action, when it is needed the most, when it could reduce the extreme suffering of innocent people, then it is they – the permanent members – who must answer before the victims.” The violence has highlighted the Syrian government’s desire, alongside its allies in Moscow and Tehran, to score a military victory in the area, which has been under a tightening siege for nearly a year and is strategically significant owing to its proximity to Damascus. Reports of an attack using chlorine, which has been used frequently in the past by the Assad regime, would represent a further escalation if confirmed. Doctors said they had treated patients in the town of Shifounieh after a bombing. The patients exhibited symptoms consistent with exposure to chlorine, including respiratory problems, inflammation in the eyes and mucous membranes, as well as cases of hysteria and dizziness, the doctors said. A video released by the Syrian American Medical Society, which also helps run hospitals in opposition-held parts of Syria, showed children and first responders doused with water and breathing through oxygen masks. “The most heartbreaking thing is the children and infants who are brought into the hospital from under the rubble and their entire family has been killed – mother, father and siblings,” said one doctor in Ghouta. “Where do we go with this child? Children whose age is in the single digits who have known nothing except fear and terror and death and shelling. “The humanitarian organisations have failed. I wonder if we can appeal to the animal rights organisations,” he added. The watered-down resolution passed by the security council did not have a timeframe, though it called for a ceasefire “without delay” and the lifting of sieges as well as the delivery of humanitarian aid. On Monday, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, told his Turkish counterpart, Reçep Tayyip Erdoğan, that the UN’s proposed 30-day ceasefire must be applied across the country, including in Afrin, where Turkey is waging an offensive against a Kurdish militia. It “must be put into effect everywhere and by everyone without delay”, Macron said in a telephone call to Erdoğan, adding that Turkey, Russia and Iran, the three countries overseeing talks in Astana aimed at ending the civil war, “have a direct responsibility in this regard that must be applied on the ground”. Ankara launched an offensive last month against the Kurdish People’s Protection Units (YPG) in Afrin in northern Syria. On Sunday the Turkish government said the UN ceasefire would not affect its operation, which it claims is aimed at fighting “terrorist organisations that threaten the territorial integrity and political unity of Syria”. Turkey sees the YPG as the Syrian branch of the Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK), which for more than three decades has waged an insurgency against the Turkish state and is classified by Turkey, the US and the European Union as a terrorist group. But the offensive has raised tensions with Washington, which works closely with the YPG in the fight against jihadists in Syria.

It’s rare that one of his customers realises that their driver is an Ethiopian musical legend, the keyboardist and accordionist of the Walias Band, one of the most popular groups from the country’s 70s golden age. When Mergia speaks of that era – growing up near Addis Ababa, raising goats and sheep, singing traditional folk music, joining the military, forming the Walias Band and eventually leaving Ethiopia for good – the dates get fuzzy, but the experiences remain clear. He is not even sure how old he is – either 71 or 72. When he was born, birth certificates weren’t always issued. He wishes that he had footage of the Walias Band’s 12-hour concerts at the Addis Ababa Hilton hotel: all-nighters for club-goers seeking refuge during the curfews that Ethiopia’s Derg government enforced for 16 years. “Maybe we didn’t care,” he says, “or maybe we didn’t think we’d get this far.” By “this far”, he means his new album – his first in more than 30 years. Mergia slides the CD of Lala Belu into his cab’s stereo and presses play on some of his most incandescent and exploratory music. As we drive past faceless strip malls, warm, brushing chords and accordion fill the air, Ethiopian pentatonic rhythms mingling with American bop and fusion. Mergia’s car is a good place to hear his new music because it’s where he writes it. “After I drop my customer, I grab my keyboard from the trunk and sit in the car and practice,” Mergia says. Since 1998, he has been picking up fares from Washington’s Dulles airport; he spends the downtime in the company of his battery-powered Yamaha. “When I compose, I record it with my phone. I do it with my voice, whistling, whatever; and then I put it on the keyboard and record it in my car. I send it to the other musicians in my trio: ‘Learn this line.’” Mergia pauses and smiles. “I always think: if you have a good bassline you can create anything.” The perfect groove has steered Mergia since the Walias days. The band’s eight members had each worked in the city’s bustling scene – playing for a few dollars on borrowed instruments at whichever club paid the most. They agreed to become a group, pooling their earnings to buy their own gear. “We were an equal band,” Mergia says. “Everyone got paid the same, everyone took turns as the bandleader. Everyone dressed sharp. We each had three suits. We wore black and white.” They named themselves after an endangered species found in the mountains of Ethiopia, and, as their popularity grew, so did the duration of their shows. At the Hilton, they had to adapt to broad international tastes. From 7pm to 10pm, it was dinner music for the diplomats and rich globetrotters: “Stranger in the Night; New York, New York; Yesterday,” Mergia recalls. “Japanese songs, French songs – even Je t’aime, Moi Non Plus – and Arabic songs.” Then came the dance crowd, prompting the Walias to tap into their love of the soul and jazz records that friends brought back from their travels; they improvised on melodies by James Brown and Booker T and the MG’s. (Mergia still thinks Green Onions contains the world’s best bassline.) Recorded music was strictly controlled by the Derg government. “Any song you wanted to release, you had to first take it to the minister of information; if the lyrics were not acceptable, you could not release it,” Mergia recalls. In 1979, he recorded an album of pro-revolution songs that he had collected during the first five years of the regime. The government took a liking to them, he says, distributing them as gifts to diplomats, and invited the Walias to play a state dinner. “When I listen to it now, I have so many memories,” Mergia says. “The good, the bad. You have to memorise the bad times, too.” Half a million Ethiopians were killed under the Derg regime. Mergia left Ethiopia with the Walias in 1981, as the country entered a devastating famine, and he has only returned for visits since. Shortly after their first tour in the US, the original Walias Band broke up. They had become a family as well as a business and creative project. “It was a hard, hard day,” says Mergia. He recorded his first solo album, Hailu Mergia and His Classical Instrument, in 1985, during the tough period that followed in Washington. “It came out of a time of being really alone,” Mergia says. It’s a contemplative album, just Mergia in the studio. “The accordion and the Rhodes [piano] were old, the Moog was a new instrument,” Mergia says. “I really liked it, the mix of those vintage and modern sounds.” He released Classical Instrument on cassette and played a few concerts in Paris, London and Addis Ababa, but in 1991 he stopped performing. “I don’t know why,” he says. “I never gave up playing music – I just didn’t play in a club.” With friends in Washington’s growing Ethiopian community, he opened a restaurant. Six or seven years later, he bought his first taxi. Along the way, he reconnected with a girlfriend he hadn’t seen since his youth in Ethiopia and they got married. Mergia drives to their suburban house, which is filled with portraits of his wife, Ayu Abegaz, and photos from the old days. In the basement, his Rhodes piano and drum set are set up for weekly practices with his local trio. Abegaz collects new Ethiopian music, but Mergia prefers his old vinyl – Count Basie, Gladys Knight, Oscar Peterson and his beloved Frank Sinatra. “The Lady Is a Tramp – I love that one! My favourite is old jazz. Maybe because I am old!” Brian Shimkovitz, a music blogger who started the reissue label Awesome Tapes from Africa, came across Classical Instrument in a cassette bin in Ethiopia and was hooked. When Shimkovitz rereleased the album in 2014, Mergia was invigorated enough to tour again and to write new songs. Lala Belu was recorded in London with drummer Tony Buck and bassist Mike Majkowski; Mergia took it back with him to DC for “the colouring parts”. Back in the cab, Mergia cues up Lala Belu again. “What I want now,” he says out of the blue, “is for someone to help me tell my story, my whole life.” He points his taxi back over the bridge to Maryland and the stereo lights up on cue. Lala Belu is out now on Awesome Tapes from Africa"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"cities/2018/mar/08/where-world-noisiest-city","type":"article","sectionId":"cities","sectionName":"Cities","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-08T11:00:03Z","webTitle":"Where is the world’s noisiest city?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/mar/08/where-world-noisiest-city","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/cities/2018/mar/08/where-world-noisiest-city","fields":{"headline":"Where is the world’s noisiest city?","bodyText":"The constant roar of traffic, incessant construction noise, piercing sirens, honking horns, shrieking loudspeakers – noise in cities is clearly a nuisance. But it’s also a danger. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has described noise pollution as an underestimated threat that can cause hearing loss, cardiovascular problems, cognitive impairment, stress and depression. Some experts go further: they believe exposure to environmental noise could be slowly killing us. “Noise pollution causes hypertension, diabetes, obesity, heart attacks, strokes and death,” says Dr Daniel Fink, chairman of the Quiet Coalition, a community of health and legal professionals concerned with the adverse impacts of environmental noise. Noise pollution is often cited as one of the main factors in the reduced quality of life in large, 24-hour cities like New York (where more than 200,000 noise complaints were recorded in 2016). It causes stress, which has its own adverse effects on health. While the impact of noise on mental health has not been studied extensively, research has shown that “strong noise annoyance is associated with a twofold higher prevalence of depression and anxiety in the general population”. A recent study by experts at the American College of Cardiology linked noise pollution to increased cardiovascular problems (high blood pressure, heart attacks, stroke, coronary heart disease) through the body’s stress mediated response – resulting in the release of the stress hormone cortisol, which in turn damages blood vessels. At a conference on noise organised by the European commission in April 2017, noise was regarded as “the silent killer”, with potentially severe consequences for our physical and mental health. And yet its impacts remain unreported and underestimated. Worst offenders Dr Eoin King, assistant professor of acoustics and author of the book Environmental Noise Pollution, calls noise the ignored pollutant. “Environmental noise still continues to be poorly understood by practitioners, policymakers and the general public,” he says. Most worrying, says King, is the impact on children. “Studies considering the effect that noise may have on children have found that tasks such as reading, attention span, problem-solving and memory appear to be most affected by exposure to noise.” The issue is compounded by debate over how much noise it is safe to be exposed to. In its Make Listening Safe guide, WHO states that 85 decibels is considered the highest safe exposure level, up to a maximum of eight hours. However, others – Fink among them – argue this is still too loud. A car measures 70 decibels, a jackhammer 100, and a plane taking off 120, according to the WHO. “Though there is no set threshold to establish risk, we do know that anything above 60 decibels can increase risk for heart disease,” Dr Thomas Münzel, from the Mainz University Medical Centre, has said. A recent report by the BBC found that parts of the London Underground were “loud enough to damage people’s hearing”, with noise levels greater than 105 decibels on many lines. The report stated that some were “so loud they would require hearing protection if they were workplaces”. Concerned about increased risk of hearing loss in cities, last year Mimi Hearing Technologies created a World Hearing Index to draw attention to the issue. With the results of hearing tests of 200,000 of their users worldwide and data on noise pollution from WHO and Sintef, a Norwegian research organisation, the index plotted levels of noise pollution and hearing loss in 50 cities. The study found that, on average, a person living in the loudest cities has hearing loss equivalent to that of someone 10-20 years older. Overall the results showed a 64% correlation between hearing loss and noise pollution. Guangzhou, China, ranked as having the worst levels of noise pollution in the world, followed by Cairo, Paris, Beijing and Delhi. Of the 50 cities, Zurich was found to have the least noise pollution. Participants in Delhi recorded the highest average hearing loss – equivalent to someone 19.34 years older than them. Vienna had the lowest hearing loss – but still, on average, that of someone 10.59 years older. “We were able to collect quite a unique hearing data warehouse on hearing abilities across countries and continents,” says Henrik Matthies, managing director of Mimi Hearing Technologies. “There is an obvious known correlation between being exposed to noise and decreased hearing ability. “However, mapping this correlation to cities helped us to get the message out, sparking a debate about noise pollution and hearing in megacities like Hong Kong and Delhi.” But what can be done about it? Political will “The EU are probably the world leaders at setting out a process to tackle noise pollution,” says King. In 2002, it issued an environmental noise directive that requires member states to map noise exposure in urban areas holding upwards of 100,000 people, to develop noise abatement action plans in these areas and to preserve quiet areas. Action plans usually incorporate a variety of measures such as traffic management strategies, promoting light rail systems and electric buses, reduced speed limits, introducing noise barriers and improved planning processes. But good intentions only go so far. “The problem is that there is no real enforcement associated with these action plans,” says King. “Until there is more of a political will to drive planning decision related to noise, I don’t think much will change.” With road traffic by far the largest source of noise pollution in Europe, affecting an estimated 100 million Europeans, concepts like Paris’s car-free day could have an impact. For one day every month in the French capital, 30% of the city becomes off limits to vehicles. The project has seen sound levels in the city centre drop by half. “The most effective way to control noise is at the source. If we could make planes, trains and cars quieter we would solve a lot of our problems,” says King. “If all vehicles in a city street were electric, noise would be significantly reduced.” Increasingly citizens can also do their bit to monitor noise pollution in cities by transforming their smartphones into sound level meters. The NoiseTube app, developed by researchers at the Free University of Brussels in Belgium, enables users to record where and at what times decibel levels are highest to produce a detailed “noise map” of the city. Councils can use the data to target noise pollution more effectively, using sound absorbent materials such as foam and fibreglass precisely where they are needed most. King says there are many such projects looking to harness the potential of big data in the fight against noise – “for example, noise complaint data, or social media chatter related to noise, to better assess public sentiments towards soundscapes. There is a lot going on – which I suppose gives us some hope.” Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2018/feb/26/north-korea-cyber-attack-threat-russia","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-26T10:58:52Z","webTitle":"North Korea is a bigger cyber-attack threat than Russia, says expert","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/feb/26/north-korea-cyber-attack-threat-russia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/feb/26/north-korea-cyber-attack-threat-russia","fields":{"headline":"North Korea is a bigger cyber-attack threat than Russia, says expert","bodyText":"North Korea poses a bigger threat of large-scale cyber-attacks than Russia, according to the co-founder of the information security firm that investigated the 2016 Democratic National Committee hacks. Speaking to the Guardian, Crowdstrike’s Dmitri Alperovitch said: “In 2018, my biggest worry is actually about North Korea. I worry a great deal that they may do a destructive attack, perhaps against our financial sector, in an attempt to deter a potential US strike against either their nuclear facilities or even the regime itself. “Regardless of whether a military strike is actually on the cards or not, what matters is whether they think one might happen. And given all the rhetoric over the last year or so, it wouldn’t be irrational for them to assume that.” North Korea has been implicated in a number of major cyber-attacks over the past few years, primarily against South Korea. They came to a head in 2017, when the “Lazarus group”, an elite North Korean hacking unit, is believed to have created and deployed the WannaCry ransomworm. The malware spread rapidly, taking down IT systems worldwide and forcing a number of NHS trusts in the UK to close temporarily, before it was defused by a young British security researcher. Alperovitch was speaking before the launch of Crowdstrike’s annual “threat report”, which assesses the state of the hacking industry. Over the past year, the report says, “not only did the volume and intensity of cyberattacks hit new highs, [but] the overall level of sophistication across the global threat landscape experienced a meteoric rise”. The report suggests that in the future, it won’t just be nation states who wield the most damaging hacking tools: technology developed by the world’s militaries will inevitably make it into the hands of criminal groups and other attackers. In 2018, the report says, “DPRK-based adversaries are likely to continue malicious cyber activity against entities in South Korea, Japan and the US. Network access obtained via remote access tools … may be used to deploy wiper malware. “This specific targeting may represent DPRK posturing … that could deliver destructive effects against the US critical infrastructure, should a military conflict occur.” WannaCry, Petya, NotPetya: how ransomware hit the big time in 2017"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/mar/08/you-expect-us-not-to-call-you-out-camp-cope-and-the-australian-musicians-fighting-industry-sexism","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-08T18:30:16Z","webTitle":"‘You expect us not to call you out?’ – Camp Cope and the Australian musicians fighting industry sexism","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/mar/08/you-expect-us-not-to-call-you-out-camp-cope-and-the-australian-musicians-fighting-industry-sexism","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/mar/08/you-expect-us-not-to-call-you-out-camp-cope-and-the-australian-musicians-fighting-industry-sexism","fields":{"headline":"‘You expect us not to call you out?’ – Camp Cope and the Australian musicians fighting industry sexism","bodyText":"In 2015, a meme began circulating showing posters advertising some of the world’s biggest festivals with the male acts erased from the lineups. The few female musicians were left floating amid a sea of incriminating blank space. Since then, festivals have been under the scrutiny of people quick to howl down imbalance. Those conversations mostly happen online, but over the new year, Melbourne trio Camp Cope took the issue onstage. To a packed tent in Lorne, Victoria, at their first show of Falls festival, singer Georgia Maq changed the lyrics to their song The Opener. “It’s another man telling us we can’t fill up a tent / It’s another fucking festival booking only nine women,” she belted out, challenging Australia’s largest touring festival while playing one of its stages. Seven months earlier, the band had sold out two nights at Sydney Opera House; now they were playing early afternoon in a tent at an event with no main-stage female headliners. “You booked us, and expect us to not call you out?” says Maq. The band risked alienating not just Australian festivals – vital for musicians in a country so vast that touring costs can be prohibitive – but also Falls’ majority owner, Live Nation, the world’s largest promoter and venue operator, with Lollapalooza and Bonnaroo under its belt, too. The Opener is the single from Camp Cope’s second album, How to Socialise and Make Friends, released on 2 March. Even without altered lyrics, the song is a searing condemnation of music-industry sexism. It arrives at a time in Australia when attention on the issue – steadily climbing since 2014 – feels as if it is at a peak. When the album was premiered on NPR last week, the author Nina Corcoran noted that “rock trio Camp Cope look like diehard activists”, but their activism is not a “look”. In 2016, they spearheaded It Takes One, a campaign to make festivals safer by establishing ways to report incidents on the spot. The initiative was adopted as a hotline by Laneway festival, which also tours to New Zealand and Singapore. “The politics and the music definitely go hand in hand,” says the band’s bassist, Kelly-Dawn Hellmrich. “We were brave, strong women before we were a band,” she says. “When we combined forces, we became fearless. We don’t doubt ourselves any more. Once we were a band, it was like ‘Boom!’” She claps. “No one is going to push us around any more because we have each other.” “It feels untouchable,” says Maq. “I feel very touchable,” counters Hellmrich. “Stronger together, then,” says Maq. “Like Hillary Clinton’s campaign,” says drummer Sarah Thompson. The band’s self-titled debut of raw melodic rock came out in 2016 on Melbourne indie label Poison City Records, causing a fervour among fans that must be seen to be believed – ecstasy is one way to put it. At shows, Camp Cope enforce zero tolerance for any behaviour that compromises the enjoyment of any individual. Some call it rock’n’roll, but Maq calls crowd surfing “dangerous and non-consensual”. On Twitter, after a show, she wrote: “Call me a buzz kill, whatever. No one is going to get kicked in the head at our shows.” Camp Cope is adamant about ensuring the movement is inclusive of all marginalised groups, including people of colour and queer communities. Two hours after Falls’ first lineup came out last August, Thompson emailed organisers. “I said … ‘It’s this big, white male thing … we never play shows like that.’ They said: ‘We have more bands to add, we’re working on it.’” When the full lineup was issued, however, the freshly added female acts languished towards the bottom of the bill. So as Falls rolled on, Maq kept changing the lyrics, and by the time the tour reached Fremantle in western Australia this January, Camp Cope had made T-shirts saying: “The person wearing this shirt stands against sexual assault and demands change”, and were asking headline acts to wear them. The progression from exposing inequality to opposing sexual assault showcases how the two issues rapidly blur, with #MeToo a platform from which to say it all. For Maq, the issue is personal. On a new song called Face of God, she sings about her sexual assault by another musician. “[#MeToo] gave me a push, like: ‘This song needs to be heard,’” she says. “I thought if we released it, people would pick it apart and question me and all this scary stuff that usually comes … with sexual assault. But now I feel really good.” It wasn’t until early January, when the band Instagrammed a video showing fans yelling in delight at the altered lyrics, that Falls issued a statement: “We book the best bands available at the time of booking taking gender balance into consideration, which can be challenging. Whilst we have a very conscious and strong agenda to book female talent, it isn’t always available to us at that headline level.” They added: “We have seen other bands who are passionate about this topic go out and start their own events ... taking control yourself is a great way to effect change.” “If it wasn’t for that statement this would have disappeared,” Thompson says. “That pathetic statement,” Maq adds. “That’s when shit got real,” says Hellmrich. They remain astonished at how closely Falls’ statement resembles the lyrics to The Opener. Many in Australia share their incredulity. When Maq snarls: “Yeah, tell me again how there just aren’t that many girls in the music scene,” she speaks for a generation of women who are literate in, yet wholly intolerant of, the excuses for inequality they keep hearing. In 2014, another Australian musician, Evelyn Morris, formed a grassroots group, Listen, in response to a book that diminished women’s contribution to Melbourne’s underground music scene. It wasn’t the first or only initiative but it was a major catalyst. Since then, the issue “is just everywhere”, says musician Lindy Morrison, drummer for the Go-Betweens and Alex the Astronaut. “Every conference has panels about gender diversity. Every boardroom in the music industry is talking about it. It has absolutely accelerated in the past two years.” In February, Grammy-nominated Melbourne songwriter Courtney Barnett released Nameless, Faceless, the first single from her new record, due in May. On it she quotes Margaret Atwood: “I wanna walk through the park in the dark / Men are scared that women will laugh at them / I wanna walk through the park in the dark / Women are scared that men will kill them.” Barnett is one of 360 prominent women in the Australian music industry – including Tina Arena, Sarah Blasko and Isabella Manfredi of the Preatures – to sign an open letter in December that, in place of #MeToo, adopted a positive, future-facing hashtag: #MeNoMore. “In the face of uncountable discrimination, harassment, violence and the general menace of sexist jargon, we have gritted our teeth and gotten on with the job. But today we say, no more.” Two weeks later the letter had 1,000 signatures. Leanne De Souza is the executive director of the Association of Artist Managers and a long-term advocate for women in the industry. “Even with internet globalisation, we’re still isolated as Australians,” she says. “And isolation is the mother of invention. It forces you to solve problems, break barriers and be heard.” So it makes sense that Australian women were quick to follow the open letter example set by 2,000 women in the Swedish music industry, who addressed sexual harassment and assault in the workplace last November. As the MeNoMore collective, who did not want to be identified, say: “The Australian music industry is smaller than those overseas and we’re connected mostly through personal relationships, so trust and a sense of solidarity exists. You start hearing about who is doing what and the current members of the group saw it fit to join forces.” All the activity has whet an appetite for change in Australia that is not being satiated by a mainstream music industry in which the gears grind slowly. The industry, says MeNoMore, “is one of the few entertainment industries dominated by companies, and we’re seeing that many people are bound by confidentiality”. This complication is echoed by De Souza. “You’ve still got the major labels and the big, well-resourced, powerful organisations, where the women – the employees – are quite silent. It’s the women outside the formal structures who have stepped up. It is a movement – you can taste it and feel it in the air, and things are on tables with government ministers now.” In the fallout on social media after Falls, Camp Cope, usually fiercely independent, virtually begged for industry support – especially that of men, which they believe is crucial. “I kept tweeting, saying: ‘Where are you?’” says Thompson. “There is an opportunity here. Any man that stood up would have been a hero … They had nothing to lose and yet they did nothing.” The men who did act, the band noted, were largely men of colour, such as Gang of Youths’ singer Dave Le’aupepe and indigenous hip-hop artist Adam Briggs. “Briggs straight away stood up for us and he gets death threats every day.” Regardless, Camp Cope are confident their criticism was heard. “I am happy to take the bullet for being the bad guy or being whiny because I know the safe-spaces and gender-diversity message reached so many people,” says Hellmrich. Maq adds: “They won’t get away with a lineup like this next year.” How to Socialise and Make Friends by Camp Cope is out now on Run for Cover"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2018/feb/26/beast-from-the-east-brings-snow-and-frosty-weather-across-europe","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-26T10:55:16Z","webTitle":"Homeless to be detained in Brussels as cold snap moves across Europe","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/26/beast-from-the-east-brings-snow-and-frosty-weather-across-europe","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/feb/26/beast-from-the-east-brings-snow-and-frosty-weather-across-europe","fields":{"headline":"Homeless to be detained in Brussels as cold snap moves across Europe","bodyText":"Homeless people in parts of Brussels will be detained overnight if they refuse shelter to protect them from sub-zero temperatures this week. A weather front nicknamed the “beast from the east” has hit Europe, bringing snow and strong winds, adding a further chill factor. In Brussels, temperatures are set to fall as low as -10 degrees Celsius. The mayor of Etterbeek, a Brussels neighbourhood that is home to many European Union offices, said he had asked police to take all homeless people to shelters even if they were unwilling. “The mayor has authorised, in case of absolute necessity, the detention of homeless people who are acting in a way that would endanger their safety by refusing shelter,” Etterbeek council said. The mayor of Brussels City, one of 19 councils that make up the greater Brussels region, said he had given similar orders to police and asked them to prioritise children sleeping outside. Officials in Lithuania say this winter’s record low temperatures claimed the lives of at least three people over the weekend in Vilnius. Seven people have received treatment for substantial frostbite to their hands and feet in the past few days. Estonia’s state weather service is forecasting the cold spell to remain in the Baltic region throughout this week, with temperatures expected to drop to -29 degrees Celsius. The impact of the cold weather has been felt across the continent, although not as severely as in the Baltic states. Schools have been disrupted across Italy and Romans woke to the rare sight of the capital city covered in snow on Monday. It was the heaviest snowfall in Rome in six years and the largest for the end of February in decades. The city, which is not well equipped to deal with snow emergencies, asked other areas to send in snowploughs to help clear roads. Only one runway was operating at Rome’s main airport, Fiumicino. Its second airport, Ciampino, was closed overnight allowing workers to clear a runway so it could reopen on Monday morning. Italian aviation officials said Ryanair, which uses Ciampino as its Italian hub, cancelled all flights to and from the airport but most of Italy’s other main airports were operating with delays to some flights. The UK’s Meteorological Office said: “The high pressure over Scandinavia bringing the cold easterly flow is expected to remain in place for several days.” Italian police asked residents to stay at home if possible, but that did not stop people taking the opportunity to enjoy a snowball fight in St Peter’s Square in the Vatican. On Sunday night, temperatures in Moscow dropped to nearly -20C, the coldest night of the Russian winter so far. Roman Vilfand, the chief of the Russian meteorological office, said Muscovites should brace themselves for frosty weather in early March and could only “count on the warmth of the soul”, not higher temperatures outside. France’s national meteorological service Météo-France warned that temperatures would be between 8C and 10C below the average for the season. In Germany, meteorologists reported a record cold for this winter of -27C on Zugspitze, the country’s highest peak. In the UK, the bookmaker Coral slashed the odds on March being recorded as the country’s coldest ever month. “It’s going to be a bitterly cold start to March, with the cold showing no signs of letting up and we think there’s now a real possibility of it being a record-breaking month for the low temperatures,” said the firm’s Harry Aitkenhead. In Romania, where temperatures plunged to -8C on Monday, the mayor of Bucharest, Gabriela Firea, announced schools would be closed in the capital for at least two days. Schools were also closed elsewhere in Romania. In Croatia, about 1,000 soldiers joined efforts to clear the snow in the worst-affected areas where more than 1.5 metres of snowfall has been reported. Schools have been closed in the north-west and heavy vehicles have been banned from all roads leading toward the coast."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/feb/26/how-have-you-been-affected-by-the-icy-cold-weather-in-the-uk","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-26T09:42:32Z","webTitle":"How have you been affected by the icy cold weather in the UK?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/feb/26/how-have-you-been-affected-by-the-icy-cold-weather-in-the-uk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/feb/26/how-have-you-been-affected-by-the-icy-cold-weather-in-the-uk","fields":{"headline":"How have you been affected by the icy cold weather in the UK?","bodyText":"The Met Office has issued yellow and amber weather warnings for snow across the UK as parts of the country will feel colder than areas in the Arctic circle.

Lewandowski, 29, has spent the thick end of a decade in Germany but his change of representation has prompted no end of talk that he’s ready to leave Bayern Munich and try his luck elsewhere. Real Madrid has been mentioned as one possible destination, while Zahavi’s close relationship with Roman Abramovich means the Polish international is also being linked with Chelsea. More accustomed to snapping up talent than letting it go, Munich is rumoured to be the next destination of Malcom, the Brazilian winger unsuccessfully courted by Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur in January. Liverpool are believed to be interested in Napoli midfielder Jorginho, according to The Times, but will have to take a number and wait in line for their turn to woo the Brazil-born Italy international, who is also wanted by Manchester United. José Mourinho is believed to have identified Jorginho as a potential replacement for Michael Carrick, who is not getting any younger. Focused on trying to win Napoli’s first scudetto in 30 years, the player insists he is happy at the club and in no rush to leave, but may be moved on to help finance a summer move for Sampdoria’s Lucas Torreira. With Emre Can looking likely to go to Juventus this summer, Liverpool are eyeing up potential replacements and have decided Bournemouth midfielder Lewis Cook fits the bill. The 21-year-old, who captained England to Under-20 World Cup victory last year, has a long-term admirer in Jürgen Klopp and could find himself the subject of a £20m bid this summer. Swansea midfielder Ki Sung-yueng is out of contract in June and free to talk to foreign clubs, a state of affairs Milan hope to take advantage of by securing the 29-year-old South Korea captain’s services on a free transfer. Cash-strapped Milan are also hoping to bring Pepe Reina to the San Siro for nowt once the Napoli goalkeeper’s contract expires come season’s end. Napoli president Aurelio De Laurentiis is unwilling to offer Reina a new deal of more than 12 months but in the event of his expected departure he will replace him with Bayer Leverkusen goalkeeper Bernd Leno. Spurs are hitching their skirts in the direction of Sheffield United’s Wales international striker David Brooks and will bid £10m for the 20-year-old in the summer. Elsewhere in north London, Arsenal are making overtures to Paris Saint-Germain teenager Yacine Adli, but will have to fight off interest from Manchester City, Barcelona and Juventus. And finally, Chelsea and Barcelona are among an array of clubs keeping tabs on £25m-rated 19-year-old Caen winger Yann Karamoh, who is quietly impressing on loan at Inter."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"environment/2018/feb/26/antarcticas-king-penguins-could-disappear-by-the-end-of-the-century","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-26T16:40:54Z","webTitle":"Antarctica's king penguins 'could disappear' by the end of the century","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/feb/26/antarcticas-king-penguins-could-disappear-by-the-end-of-the-century","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/feb/26/antarcticas-king-penguins-could-disappear-by-the-end-of-the-century","fields":{"headline":"Antarctica's king penguins 'could disappear' by the end of the century","bodyText":"Rising temperatures and overfishing in the pristine waters around the Antarctic could see king penguin populations pushed to the brink of extinction by the end of the century, according to a new study. The report, published in the journal Nature Climate Change, found that as global warming transforms the environment in the world’s last great wilderness 70% of king penguins could either disappear or be forced to find new breeding grounds. Co-author Céline Le Bohec, from the CNRS/University of Strasbourg in France, warned the species “could disappear” unless urgent steps were taken. “If no actions aiming at halting or controlling global warming, and the pace of the current human-induced changes – climate change, overfishing – stay the same, the species may disappear in the near future.” The findings come amid growing concern over the future of the Antarctic. Earlier this month a separate study found that a combination of climate change and industrial fishing is threatening the krill population in Antarctic waters, with a potentially disastrous impact on whales, seals and penguins. But today’s report is the starkest warning yet of the potentially devastating impact of climate change and human exploitation on the Antarctic’s delicate eco-systems. Le Bochec said: “Unless current greenhouse gas emissions drop, 70% of king penguins – 1.1 million breeding pairs – will be forced to relocate their breeding grounds, or face extinction before the end of the century.” King penguins – the second largest type of penguin – only breed on specific isolated islands in the Southern Ocean where there is no ice cover and easy access to the sea. As the ocean warms a body of water called the Antarctic polar front – an upwelling of nutrient rich sea that supports huge abundance of marine life – is being pushed further south. This means that king penguins, that feed on fish and krill in this body of water, have to travel further to their feeding grounds leaving their hungry chicks for longer. And as the distance between their breeding grounds and their food grows, scientists predict entire colonies will be wiped out. Le Bohec, who led the study with Robin Cristofari from the Centre Scientifique de Monaco and Emiliano Trucchi from the University of Ferrara in Italy, said the plight of the king penguin should serve as a warning about the future of the entire marine environment in the Antarctic. “Penguins, like other seabirds and marine mammals, occupy higher trophic levels in the ecosystems: they are what we call bio-indicators of their ecosystems,” she said. “Thus, penguins, as sensitive indicators of changes in marine ecosystems, are key species for understanding and predicting impacts of global change on the marine biome, and on polar regions for species living in sub-Antarctic and Antarctic areas.” The report found that, although some king penguins may be able to relocate to new breeding grounds closer to their retreating food source, suitable new habitats would be scarce. “The main issue is that there are only a handful of islands in the Southern Ocean and not all of them are suitable to sustain large breeding colonies,” said Cristofari. Le Bohec added: “There are still some islands further south where king penguins may retreat but the competition for breeding sites and food will be harsh, especially with other species like the chinstrap, gentoo or Adélie penguins, even without the fisheries. “It is difficult to predict the outcome, but there will surely be losses on the way – if we are to save anything, proactive and efficient conservation efforts but above all coordinated global action against global warming should start now.” Scientists and environmental campaigners are pushing for the creation of the world’s biggest marine protection area in the Antarctic. If successful the 1.8m sq km fishing-free zone would protect species, such as penguins, leopard seals and whales. Experts say it would also help mitigate the effects of climate change, soaking up huge amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and locking it away in deep-sea sediments.

His second album, You Will Not Die, documents a turbulent adolescence spent wrestling with sexuality and Christianity, and is delivered with heart-stopping fragility. He has been openly gay since his 20s, but there was a time when, he has said, “I was convinced I would be able to ‘heal’ my homosexuality. I lived in constant fear; controlling myself at all times.” By contrast, his music is fearless – emphatic Perfume Genius pop chronicling a journey to self-acceptance via sweeping strings, 80s synths, mbira-style percussion and the eventual rejection of his religious beliefs. The electronics are a recent addition, after years as an acoustic singer-songwriter in Johannesburg. But after making a club hit with house DJ Black Coffee in 2015, and becoming disillusioned with the folk scene, he ditched the twiddly guitars for strutting glam and electro flourishes. His album is a fitting accompaniment to another move that’s ratcheting up his notoriety: he also has a starring role in The Wound, a film about the taboo of being a young gay man in the Xhosa community (South Africa’s second largest ethnic population, to which Nakhane also belongs), and as a result has been subject to months of protests across the Cape. But Nakhane isn’t about to let small-mindedness hold him back “I refuse to hide who I am,” he wrote on Facebook recently. That’s the talk of a real star in the making. • Nakhane plays at the Hoxton Square Bar &amp; Kitchen on 20 March.

Being outspoken, you get that'","bodyText":"I think the main challenges to women progressing in the business world are structural imbalances. The gatekeepers to funding and capital are usually men, who often (though not always) aren’t as interested in backing women-led businesses. One female entrepreneur I know always takes a male partner in with her to investment meetings when she’s pitching for funding. She says that even though she is the one in charge, male investors often won’t address their question to her and they’ll take her more seriously when there is another man in the room – regardless of the fact that she runs the company. It is just ingrained sexism. A recent study showed that women are just as likely to ask for a pay rise as men, but are less likely to actually receive one, which reflects ingrained patriarchal values. Employers also often don’t champion women in the same way, because they’re worried they might go on maternity leave. There are all sorts of societal issues at play, based on the perception of women. I’ve always been a feminist and interested in working with other women. I started Women Who, a community for creative working women because I wanted to connect with other like-minded women who are figuring things out, trying non-traditional career paths, or starting their own businesses or communities. The support of other women has been incredibly important to its success, especially in the beginning. I’m a pretty confident person and for the most part I’ve been surrounded by people who have been very supportive and encouraging of my talents and ambitions. But, of course, I’ve also been in situations where I’ve been treated differently to my male counterpart because of my gender at various points in my career. Being an outspoken and reasonably young woman, you can get that with some people. But I don’t think of it as my problem and I’m not going to let it influence my behaviour. My advice to women striking out on their own in business is to research the type of people you want to connect with, then ask them to meet you for a coffee. That’s a very underrated way of building your network. If they’re really busy, ask to jump on the phone with them instead. Also, figure out and benchmark what the going rate is for what you’re doing. Women often tend to undersell themselves. Some people might assume that you must already have a network to run a business, and to be successful. But a lot of people come at it from an angle of not knowing anyone. Just start being proactive, and the next thing you know you’ll have a really wide network.

Fast forward 22 years and the Nokia 8110 has been reloaded. The Nokia 8110 was groundbreaking in its day as one of the first to feature an ergonomic shape, with the slider shooting down and out curving gently towards your mouth. But it will always be remembered for that moment when Reeves shoots down the slider picking up the phone to Morpheus before dropping it from the ledge of a tall skyscraper after he has stepped out the window of his office. That is the kind of nostalgia HMD Global, the company now operating the Nokia phone brand, wants to rekindle. It succeeded with last year’s Nokia 3310. Now it’s time for a slightly more sophisticated reboot. The new Nokia 8110 is still just a feature phone, running a forked version of the dead Firefox OS created by KaiOS that HMD is calling “Smart Feature OS”, but it has a few things you might not expect from a phone with a real numeric keypad and polycarbonate slider. It’s got 4G, for one. Facebook will also be available through an app store at some point and there will be some form of access to Google’s Assistant, Maps and search, as well as email, texts, Twitter and even Snake. “The Nokia 8110 comes with the craftsmanship you expect from a Nokia phone, delivering durability and reliability as standard,”HMD said. “With a familiar and easy to use interface, it features intuitive tactile mechanics, with slide to answer and end calls, as well as an addictive helicopter style spin on its axis.” HMD suggests the 8110 is a great “weekend phone” that gives people the “chance to switch off, have fun and relax in the knowledge that all your smartphone essentials are there when you need them”. Whether there will be as many people attracted the reboot of 1999’s coolest phone as last year’s 3310 remains to be seen, but the new Nokia 8110 will be available in black or “banana yellow” in May for €79 (£69).

Che Troppo Ineguali. But at Bath’s annual Bachfest, in the Academy of Ancient Music’s concert entitled Mortal Voices, the voices of soprano Keri Fuge and countertenor Tim Mead did indeed verge on the celestial. Under the guest directorship of Christian Curnyn at the harpsichord, the AAM had set the tone of the evening with a beautifully calibrated performance of Corelli’s Concerto Grosso in D, Op 6; Fuge’s Ah! Che Troppo then found a comparable balance of instrumental clarity and expressive tone. Mead joined her to portray the lovers Daliso and Amaryllis from Handel’s operatic scena Il Duello Amoroso, HWV 82, no shepherd/shepherdess happily-ever-after pastoral but a full-scale lovers’ stand-off, violence threatened, knife to hand. With characterisations sharply defined, emotional tension was sustained to the bitter end and Amaryllis’s rejection of Daliso. The Italian bias of this programme reflected this year’s festival’s theme – examining Bach’s relationship with other national styles. Pergolesi, dead at 26, was long gone when Bach arranged and parodied the Italian’s Stabat Mater in his cantata Tilge, Höchster, Meine Sünden, BWV 1083. Performed here as originally conceived for two soloists, Pergolesi’s music carried a rare intensity. The bloom of Fuge’s sound was the perfect foil for Mead’s countertenor timbre, so that their duetting achieved moments that were simply sublime: Curnyn ensured this was matched in the AAM’s playing. Bach was core to recorder player Michala Petri’s excellent earlier recital with harpsichordist Mahan Esfahani. In the Partita in C minor for recorder, BWV 1013, Petri eloquently laid bare the harmonic structure implied in the melodic line, while the partnership with Esfahani, already well established, was implicit in the A major sonata BWV 1030, finely shaped and weighted. If Esfahani had thrown nonchalant thunderbolts in Rameau’s Les Cyclopes, it was he who egged Petri on to play her equally virtuosic solo encore. Both were Olympian feats that rightly had the audience roaring approval. • The Academy of Ancient Music perform Mortal Voices at Turner Sims Concert Hall, Southampton, on 1 March.

In a post on his Facebook page, the bestselling Sword of Truth author called his book Shroud of Eternity “a great book with a very bad cover. Laughably bad”. Offering 10 randomly selected readers a chance to win a hardback copy in return for their thoughts on the cover, Goodkind published a poll that included the voting options “laughably bad” or “excellent”. While almost 12,000 readers took part in the vote, some pledged to never buy another book by Goodkind again. The cover’s illustrator, Bastien Lecouffe-Deharme wrote on the poll: “It was nice working with you Terry. What you are doing is totally disrespectful. As if I didn’t create those covers accorded to exactly what I was told to do. In my entire career I have never seen an author behaving like that.” The artist, who has designed book covers for authors including Philip K Dick, Chuck Palahniuk and Frank Herbert, later issued a statement, writing: “Now the narrative of the author is that ‘I got offended’ or that I am using this as some kind of self promotion. Two things: First, I did not get offended, I just appreciate respect. Second, I never needed drama to promote my work … I just don’t like to get spit on.” Thanking his supporters, he added: “The rest of the story will unfold privately, between adults, as it should have been the case from the start.” Authors and illustrators came out in support of Lecouffe-Deharme, including science fiction author Chuck Wendig and artist Leesha Hannigan, who tweeted: “Artists DIRECTLY follow a brief they are given by YOUR publisher. Publicly dragging the work they do for you is a dick move, not to mention incredibly unprofessional.” On Saturday, Goodkind shared an apology on Facebook, writing: “The contest and poll below is poking fun at my own book. The artist is obviously an exceptionally talented creative. The problem is with the publisher. I created the poll as a way to poke fun at the cover art, because it is a poor representation of characters within the book. Characters I am deeply passionate about. It’s impossible not to be emotional about such things, when I’ve spent the last 30 years of my life devoted to their every nuance. “In no way do I feel the quality of the art is rendered poorly,” he continued. “For any misunderstanding, I apologise to the artist, his friends, and of course my own community here.” Goodkind wrote that he had told his publisher, Tor Books, that he was unhappy with the art before publication. “We all expressed our dissatisfaction with the character representation of the artwork and we protested the printing. We were overruled and the book went to print as-is. Sometimes that happens. It stings to see a publisher not always seem to care as much as we do.” However, the author left the poll up, writing that he had promised to give away the books. A New York Times bestselling author of fantasy novels and thrillers, Goodkind has sold more than 25m books over his career. He is best known for his 11-volume Sword of Truth series, the first volume of which, Wizard’s First Rule, was adapted into TV series Legend of the Seeker."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/blog/2018/feb/26/talking-horses-monday-tips-plus-our-latest-trainer-form-table-best-bets-racing","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-26T09:55:28Z","webTitle":"Talking Horses: Monday's tips plus our latest trainer form table","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/feb/26/talking-horses-monday-tips-plus-our-latest-trainer-form-table-best-bets-racing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2018/feb/26/talking-horses-monday-tips-plus-our-latest-trainer-form-table-best-bets-racing","fields":{"headline":"Talking Horses: Monday's tips plus our latest trainer form table","bodyText":"Monday’s best bets, by Greg Wood Cold weather is expected to wreak havoc with the National Hunt programme over the next few days, but both of Monday’s cards over jumps have survived morning inspections and will go ahead as planned. Wrap up warm if you are going to either Plumpton or Ayr, though – the clerk of the course reported that it was 1C at the Scottish track at 9.30am and will not get any higher than 5C later on. Kempton’s card on Saturday marked the start of pre-Festival purdah, with few if any jumps horses of any quality likely to be setting foot beyond the boundary of their stable this side of 13 March. But it is a rare day that does not throw up at least a couple of runners at interesting prices, and One For Harry (4.20) is a case in point up at Ayr. Nicky Richards’s runner is has reached the veteran stage at the age of 10, but he was a winner off 135 at Haydock in December and was only three lengths behind the winner over this course in early January. Bulls Head is the obvious danger, but may not have as much in hand of One For Harry as the odds suggest. On the all-weather Flat cards, Atletico (8.15) looks like the best bet of the day at around 7-4 at Wolverhampton. Reflektor should set a fair pace for Roger Varian’s runner to chase, and while he has finished second twice since winning at Newcastle in November, he looked unlucky last time out when he was left with plenty of ground to make up in the last quarter-mile. Mouchee (4.00) was just a half-length behind Father Ailbe last time out and the winner there ran well to finish second next time up. Ertidaad (2.25) is fairly reliable in low-grade company and should be good enough to win on the same card, while Invicta Lake (4.05) goes well at Plumpton and looks overpriced as the outsider of four."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/live/2018/feb/27/uk-weather-beast-from-the-east-hits-britain-with-snow-and-freezing-temperatures-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-27T19:39:19Z","webTitle":"Freezing temperatures and snow hit Britain – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2018/feb/27/uk-weather-beast-from-the-east-hits-britain-with-snow-and-freezing-temperatures-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/live/2018/feb/27/uk-weather-beast-from-the-east-hits-britain-with-snow-and-freezing-temperatures-live","fields":{"headline":"Freezing temperatures and snow hit Britain – as it happened","bodyText":"Live coverage continues here: Back in Blighty, meanwhile, Met Office forecaster Mark Wilson says the UK is facing an “exceptionally cold” night, with the potential for temperatures to plunge as low as -10C in parts of Scotland. There is further heavy snow forecast overnight for the north east and eastern parts of Scotland and isolated showers elsewhere, he added. That’s all from our live coverage of #Snowmageddon for today - thanks for reading. At least 24 people have died in mainland Europe in the past four days as freezing temperatures brought snow as far south as the balmy Mediterranean islands of Corsica and Capri. Some of the iciest conditions were reported in Italy, where many schools and daycare centres were closed, frustrating parents already preparing for closures next week linked to this weekend’s general election. Italians’ anger was also growing over nationwide disruptions to rail services as a lack of defrosting equipment on the tracks meant workers having to clear snow and ice manually. A driver in Turin got a fright when a stalactite broke off from an overhead bridge and shattered his windshield - though he managed to keep control of his vehicle. Russia’s Gazprom, a major gas supplier to Europe, said it had sent record exports to the continent over the past six days as people turned up their thermostats. Meteo France has forecast heavy snowfalls arriving from Spain that will blanket most of the country later this week. There’s plenty more snow forecast this week, as the Met Office is warning: Yes it’s rather chilly in the UK, but as always they do winter far better on the Continent, as this image from the Italian province in which Florence is located attests. The extreme cold expected to hit many parts of Europe could send temperatures plummeting to lows not seen for a decade. Southeastern is warning passengers that if conditions deteriorate significantly it may need to run an emergency timetable. The “beast from the east” has already disrupted train services, forced schools to close and caused airlines to cancel flights. But what sort of consequences could there be for the UK economy? Periods of extreme wintry weather are rare in the UK, but one of them hit the UK in December 2010, and its impact on the economy was later investigated by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Its findings suggested that the cold snap caused a temporary drop in overall economic growth, along with dips in the growth of output for retail sales and the UK’s service industries. The distribution, hotel and restaurant sector showed evidence of an impact, as “customers postponed discretionary trips because of the bad weather”. Overseas travel and tourism was also affected, with the cold weather having a “detrimental effect” on the number of UK residents travelling abroad. There was “no apparent effect” on the average number of weekly hours worked in the country, however, while higher activity was recorded in “computer programming, consultancy and related activities” - an area that could be “less prone to weather disruption”. December 2010 was the coldest December for more than a century, according to the Met Office, with snowfalls occurring on several days in almost all areas of the country and temperatures plunging as low as minus 21.3C at Altnaharra in the Highlands. The current cold snap is not forecast to be quite so severe or last as long, and so far this week temperatures have fallen only as low as minus 8.9C, recorded at Farnborough in Hampshire. What we know so far Heavy snow and freezing conditions has prompted widespread travel disruption and several serious road accidents. Three people died Lincolnshire in a crash involving a lorry and Renault Clio on the A15. In neighbouring Cambridgeshire, one person suffered life-threatening injuries in one of three collisions on the A47. And in Essex 17 cars were involved in a pile up on the A120. Hundreds of schools have been forced to close because of bad weather. They include 131 schools in Kent, 62 in East Sussex, more than 200 in Wales and 44 in North Yorkshire. The Met Office has expanded its amber be prepared warning for snow on Wednesday and Thursday to cover most of eastern Scotland and north-east England. Up to 40cm of snow is forecast for some areas. Scotland’s transport minister, Humza Yousaf, urged Scots to be prepared for “an acute weather challenge over the coming days”. An updated amber, be prepared, warning for snow and ice has also been issued for Friday for most of Wales, western England and parts of the West Midlands. The Met Office says as the remains of Atlantic Storm Emma clash with cold air over the UK, there is “potential to produce widespread snow, accompanied by strong to gale force winds”. Dozens of rail services have been cancelled or disrupted. Greater Anglia has suspended several branch lines in East Anglia and warned of cancellations at late notice. Southeastern, which operates in Kent, cancelled several services into London St Pancras, London Victoria and Cannon Street. British Airways has cancelled dozens flights from Heathrow Airport, while easyJet warned disruption to its flights was expected. Fen skaters are hopeful of skating on the iced-over flooded flatlands south of the Wash for the first time in eight years. Organisers said if overnight temperatures of -5C continue there is 70% chance of skating on the fens by the end of the week. This is an interesting statement from the Stansted Express. It says services are returning to normal for the rest of the day but admits that in cancelling earlier trains it was preparing for the worst “in the light of the forecast severe weather” - in other words the fact that it did not turn out as bad as anticipated meant it could have run more services. It’s not a good day to be doing this job: Southeastern trains has warned of more cancellations on its network during the evening rush hour: Amid the pretty pictures, a reminder of how difficult it is for rough sleepers in these conditions. The sub-zero temperatures mean keepers at Bristol zoo gardens are taking extra measures to ensure animals keep warm during the freezing weather, including giving some animals peanut butter. Small primates such as the zoo’s squirrel monkeys and tamarins are given small amounts of peanut butter as a special fatty treat, while gorillas are given extra bedding. Many of the animal enclosures are also heated. Bristol is set for snow on Thursday and the sub-zero temperatures are expected to continue for days to come. Lynsey Bugg, curator of mammals at Bristol zoo gardens, said: Many of our other animals are provided with supplementary heaters at this time of year, such as our capybara, tapirs and warty pigs. They also get much bigger straw beds outside to help them snuggle in. Some animals, such as the zoo’s two red pandas, positively welcome the conditions. They are native to the mountainous regions of Nepal and Southwest China and their fur is long and thick to protect against rain and cold. To say the weather has been changeable would be an understatement. Readers around the UK have been sharing images of the scenes where they are – what they can make out, at least.

Kent Police are urging drivers to take extra care after dealing with 160 collisions and 60 other weather related calls since midnight. It said that none of the incidents have caused serious injuries but they also a series of delays on the roads. The Maidstone and Swale areas are worst affected and there are currently a number of incidents on the M20 between junctions 7 and 9 in both directions. There are also traffic issues affecting Detling Hill, Bluebell Hill, the A20 in Charing and Lenham and the M2 between junctions 5 and 6 in both directions. All the main roads and motorways in the county are currently open, but there are some lane closures in place which may cause delays. The cricket season is only two months away.

An updated amber, be prepared, warning for snow and ice has been issued for Friday for most of Wales, western England and parts of the West Midlands. The Met Office is warning of widespread snow as the remains of the Atlantic Storm Emma clashes with cold air over the UK. It said: As it comes into contact with the very cold air resident over the UK, it has potential to produce widespread snow, accompanied by strong to gale force winds. As less cold air follows from the south, there is a chance of snow turning to freezing rain bringing an additional significant ice risk. There is still uncertainty in how this system will develop, but there is a chance that the combined effects of snow, strong winds and ice will lead to severe impacts.

One person has suffered life-threatening injuries after three crashes on the A47 in Cambridgeshire which are all believed to have involved the same vehicle, police said. Cambridgeshire Police said the collisions all took place on the same stretch of the road near Peterborough. The third crash involved three vehicles and led to the serious injury, the force said. The A47 has been closed in both directions between the A1 at Wansford and the A1260 in Peterborough to allow police, fire crews and an air ambulance to deal with the incident. The cancellation of trains due to snow could add to the millions of pounds rail companies receive each year in compensation, according to PA. Operators in England and Wales received £181m from Network Rail for unplanned disruption in the 2016/17 financial year, but paid out just £74m in compensation to delayed passengers. Greater Anglia - which cancelled more than 200 trains in anticipation of the Siberian blast - received £4.4m during the period. Public transport campaigners have called for automatic compensation to be introduced across the rail industry, to ensure more passengers receive what they are entitled to. Just over a third (35%) of passengers are claiming compensation, according to a study by Transport Focus published in November 2016. This was compared with 12% in 2013. Network Rail makes payments to train companies when the aggregate length of delays exceeds a performance benchmark over a certain period. Stephen Joseph, chief executive of the Campaign for Better Transport, said: “Passengers see train operators profiting from delays and are rightly angry. What we need is automatic delay-repay, already run by some companies, rolled out across the system and for the Department of Transport (DfT) to stop blocking much needed fares reform.” A spokesman for industry body the Rail Delivery Group said: “These payments are overseen by the rail regulator which says that they keep costs down for taxpayers and fare payers, and they are completely separate from the money customers rightly receive for delays. “The payments compensate train operators for lost revenue when fewer people travel due to disruption and they encourage rail companies to work together to improve punctuality.” Three people have died in a crash on the A15 in Baston Lincolnshire this morning. The collision involved a blue Renault Clio and a white Scania lorry, according to Lincolnshire police. Lead Investigator, Sergeant Helen Alcock, said: “Sadly three people have lost their lives this morning and several people have faced the shock of witnessing or coming across the scene. I appeal to anyone who was driving in the area or saw the collision to contact me. I also ask if drivers can check their dash cams for footage of either of the vehicles involved. This will help our investigation.” The road is closed in both directions. Police in the county have urged drivers to take care in icy conditions. Seventeen cars were involved in a pile-up on the A120 between Colchester and Elmsted Market, according to Essex Police. One person suffered minor injuries in the incident on the Clacton-bound carriageway, which occurred at 10am on Tuesday morning amid heavy snow. Images posted on social media showed a lorry among the vehicles at a standstill on one side of the road. Police urged drivers to avoid the route, with one lane currently closed eastbound and a warning that the entire road “may need to be closed for recovery”. East of England Ambulance Service said it had almost 30 call outs to traffic collisions this morning. Pupils from 131 schools in Kent are off school today after the heavy snow. They are not complaining in Knole Park. The Met’s chief forecaster is warning of up to 40cm of snow in some areas of Scotland and north east England on Wednesday and Thursday. The latest assessment says: Snow showers will bring variable snow cover, but parts of northeast England and Scotland are expected to see the most frequent snow showers from Wednesday morning to Thursday afternoon. During this time, 5-10 cm of snow is expected quite widely. Where showers become organised though, most likely across Scotland and over the hills of northern England, some places are likely to have an additional 15-25 cm of snow, locally as much as 40 cm. Strong winds will lead to drifting of snow and severe wind chill, while lightning could be an additional hazard, particularly near coasts. The Met Office has expanded its amber be prepared warning for “significant accumulations” of snow on Wednesday and Thursday to cover most of eastern Scotland and north-east England. The warning says: Frequent and heavy snow showers are expected on Wednesday and Thursday leading to some significant accumulations developing. Long delays and cancellations on bus, rail and air travel could occur. Roads may become blocked by deep snow, with many stranded vehicles and passengers. Some rural communities might be cut off for several days. Long interruptions to power supplies and other services such as telephone and mobile phone networks, could occur. PA has a round up of the latest disruption: Heavy snow has forced hundreds of schools to close and caused disruption to travel. The icy blast overnight has caused misery for morning commuters with scores of trains cancelled. Many schools across the country shut on Tuesday, including more than 200 in Wales, 131 in Kent and 62 in East Sussex. Some roads were closed after a blanketing of snow, with police forces reporting treacherous driving conditions and blocked routes. The Met Office said several centimetres of snow had fallen in some parts overnight - with between 3cm and 4cm in Newcastle and Northumberland. Farnborough in Hampshire saw the lowest overnight temperature of minus 8.9C. Trains have also been affected by the snowfall, with cancellations and disruptions on lines across the country. Southeastern, which operates in Kent, has cancelled dozens of trains, including several to London St Pancras, London Victoria and Cannon Street, while other companies affected include Southern, Greater Anglia and Great Northern. British Airways has cancelled dozens flights from Heathrow Airport, while easyJet warned disruption to its flights was expected. Fen skaters are hopeful of skating on the iced over flooded flatlands south of the Wash for the first time in eight years. Roger Giles, who posts regular updates on the state of the ice near his home in Welney, Cambridgeshire, reckons there is a 70% chance of skating by the end of the week. “I’m damned excited, we all are,” he told the Guardian. He added: “A couple of more days of -5C like last night and we could be skating on the very shallow patches, so we are quite close. You really need -8C frost at night for two or three nights to really get a good skating surface, but -5C like it was last night for three days would give us something.” Giles is one of the senior figures in fen skating who will decide if the ice is thick enough for skating to go ahead. Three others will decide if a speed skating race meeting can be held. He explained: “Malcolm Robinson, Dave Smith and our chairman Nigel Blake are the big cheeses that give it the check out before we can race. I’m about 70% sure that we’ll be on the ice in some shape or form. I doubt if we’ll be racing this week, but we’ll probably have a few skaters on some of the safer patches.” The challenge will be sweeping the snow off the ice. He said: “We have boards on long sticks to push the snow off to make a 400m track, it can be quite difficult.” However, he urged wannabe skaters not to travel to the fens just yet. “Everybody is getting excited and they all think they are going to jump on a train from London and get off at Littleport and come and skate, but not for two or three days.” He added: “You have to be careful even at Welny where the water is only a few feet deep, because there are deeper ditches criss crossing the field and rivers at the edges. So if you are not a local you could waltz up onto a river, so you’ve got to be so careful.” But Giles predicted that some experienced skaters may have already have discovered secret patches to skate in case there is a race meeting in the next few days. He said: “One or two fen men find patches where they can practice without telling anybody else. They all say to each other ‘Oh we haven’t been doing any training’, but when it comes to racing they’ve all been training like the devil.” The Guardian covered the last fen skating meeting in January 2010. Giles said: “Your chap from the Guardian came down in 2010 and got stuck in a snow drift and our girls from the office had to pull him out and save him from a snowy death in a fen drove.” Time for a selection of snow videos from Maidstone in Kent; Manchester; Seaton Carew, south of Hartlepool; and York. Some 45 school children in Lincolnshire are suffering shock after their school bus collided with a car north of Peterborough and ran off the road in heavy snow. Lincolnshire police said none of the children were injured but “they are obviously shocked”. It added: “It will take some time to recover the bus and the road will be closed later to complete this. Emergency services are still at the scene dealing with this.” The accident was one of 20 collisions this morning on Lincolnshire’s roads. The number of school closures in now running into the hundreds. Here are some of the latest closures to add to the growing list: Anglesey 34 Kent 131 Lancashire 27 West Yorkshire 22 Staffordshire 4 Stockport 3 Conwy 58 Gwynedd 67 A sustained cold snap could be especially costly for the farming sector, particularly sheep farmers, some of whose flocks have already started lambing. The rural insurer NFU Mutual warns that the cost of burst pipes could run into thousands for individual farms. The National Sheep Association said snow and low temperatures had the potential to cause real problems for its members as lambing season approaches. Speaking to the Guardian, a spokeswoman said: New born lambs are vulnerable to hypothermia and frozen water makes jobs take 10 times longer than normal. There is a potential for losses especially for those lambing outside. If sheep are caught in snow drifts they can easily become buried. And when they are heavily pregnant they not as mobile as they usually are. Getting feed to them can also be very difficult in snow. Sheep farmers in upland areas probably won’t have started lambing yet, but problems with feeding could have an impact. And some in south will have started lambing. At this stage it’s hard to say whether it will have an impact on the whole sector. “Rug up” in sensible shoes, plenty of warm clothes, gloves and a beanie, advises a hatless and gloveless Ian St John, deputy director of operations at London Ambulance. Photographer Grey Hutton has spent the winter photographing homeless people with a thermal imaging camera to highlight the hardship that so many face on the streets. On Monday, London Mayor Sadiq Khan announced that emergency shelters for rough sleepers will be open all week. The number of schools closed is rising and now well into three figures. 44 in North Yorkshire. 4 in Gateshead 68 in East Sussex Seven in Calderdale All schools on Guernsey This was the scene at dawn in Tunbridge Wells in Kent, courtesy of our picture editor Guy Lane. A horse race meeting at Catterick, North Yorkshire has abandoned after heavy overnight snow. Dozens of schools have been forced to closed because of snow and freezing temperatures. The latest closures include: 35 schools in Norfolk (including my old primary school of Hapton, and secondary school Long Stratton). 14 schools in Essex, including Fingringhoe, CoE school, south of Colchester which blamed the closure on roads not being fully gritted around the school. 19 schools in Flintshire, north Wales, all citing “weather conditions”. Seven schools in Surrey, including one because of a broken boiler Heating problems have also closed three schools in Cornwall. Four schools and a college in County Durham. Seven schools and three pupil referral units in Suffolk, according to the BBC. With local authority websites suffering under the demand for updates, the Department for Education has a postcode system for checking whether schools in your area have been closed. Look out for “more organised snow” in parts of Scotland, northern England and Wales. Scotland’s transport minister, Humza Yousaf, has urged Scots to be prepared for “an acute weather challenge over the coming days”. He warned of “significant disruption to the transport network” especially on Wednesday when an amber, be prepared, warning is in place from the early hours until 9pm. In a statement Yousaf added: “Whilst the worst of the weather is predicted to impact the east of Scotland, the rest of the country is also likely to face wintry conditions, so I’d ask travellers to consider if they need to make their journeys during the amber warning periods. If you do choose to travel during those times, you are very likely to face delays and disruption.” Some good news on the roads and railways: But the situation is not at all good at Essex Road in north London: These maps show just how cold and snowy it has been across the UK. Temperatures dropped to minus 6 in some parts of the south-east. The Press Association reports that police forces across the UK have recorded a number of crashes on the roads as driving conditions worsen. Lincolnshire Police tweeted that they were already dealing with five collisions by 6.30am on Tuesday morning and said roads were “particularly hazardous”. Merseyside Police urged people to take care while driving, and said the force had received reports of a crash on the M62 just before junction 5. And the North West Motorway Police tweeted that it was on the scene of a crash on the M6 eastbound at junction 5 after a car span across all three lanes and hit a tree. The view from Manchester, with thanks to reader Luke Watson: Struggling to stay warm and look cool? Unsure if it is acceptable to wear a thermal onesie to work in the snow? The Guardian has the answer. Read on for our guide to snow-day style: More good tidings from Newcastle airport: Here’s a bit of good news: Luton airport is operating as normal! However, passengers are advised to check with their airline and allow extra time before travelling to the airport. The view from Blackpool: And the snow is looking pretty deep here too: More bad news for commuters in the capital: And for those relying on Greater Anglia services: Oh dear this is not good timing at all: This is where things stand before rush hour gets under way: Roads across the UK have already seen a blanketing of snow, with police forces reporting treacherous driving conditions and blocked routes. Highways England said the M20 in Kent had become blocked by a “number” of stranded lorries overnight, while the A249 was shut due to a crash. Areas around Harrogate and Craven were also particularly treacherous, according to North Yorkshire Police. The Met Office said several centimetres of snow had fallen in some parts over the night - with 1cm in Kent by 5am, and between 3cm and 4cm in Newcastle and Northumberland. Trains have also been affected by the snowfall. Southeastern, which operates railways in Kent, has cancelled dozens of trains, including several to London St Pancras, London Victoria and Cannon Street, while other companies affected include Southern, Greater Anglia and Great Northern. British Airways has cancelled several flights from Heathrow Airport, while easyJet warned disruption to its flights was expected. School closures were also likely. Heavy showers are expected to continue throughout the morning. So just how cold is it going to get? Well, conditions are not likely to improve for several days, with forecasters warning that snow will continue will into the week and daytime temperatures would “struggle to get above freezing” across many areas. Forecaster Frank Saunders told the Press Association that parts of the country could see their “coldest spell of weather since at least 2013, and possibly since 1991”. It is expected that the mercury could plummet to minus 15C by midweek where there is snow on the ground, rivalling temperatures forecast for parts of northern Norway and Iceland. Rail updates: More trouble on the trains ... Some images from the frontline: Today’s papers predictably feature a flurry of stories about the weather. The Express leads with “Blizzards to sweep Britain”. The Star has “Snow joke” and says “pathetic” Britain has ground to a halt after a bit of bad weather. The i leads with “Arctic blast hits UK”. The Sun picks up the disruption theme and splashes with “The Great British Flake off” moaning that the country is in chaos before hardly any snow has fallen. Elsewhere, the Telegraph uses the weather to blast the rail operators who it says are getting compensation from Network Rail for cancelled services but who pay out far less than that to passengers. The problems on the roads are moving south, with Highways England saying the M20 in Kent had become blocked eastbound between junctions 8 and 9 by “a number” of stranded lorries. The Met Office says Kent and parts of the South East had already seen approximately 1cm of snow overnight, while the North East, including Newcastle and Northumberland, had seen between 3cm to 4cm. The London Overground has started to struggle: Here is the official word on driving and getting to school (via the Press Association): Met Office forecaster Marco Petagna said there would be some “quite treacherous driving conditions” due to the snow, as many make their way into work. “Most people will have to travel, but if you don’t have to travel - it is best to try to avoid if you can within those amber warnings,” he said. Paul Whiteman, the general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT), said: “Schools should stay open if they possibly can but safety concerns are the most important. “If it’s not safe for the school to be open then it is fine to close. You have to take into consideration journeys at the beginning and the end of the day, as conditions may change whilst the school is open. It is important that staff and parents can get home at the end of the day as well.” Police are already dealing with crashes on the A19 and A68 in the north-east. A reminder to please take care on the roads and only travel if absolutely necessary. So it begins ... So, which parts of the country are affected by the yellow and amber warnings? Behold: The ‘beast’ comes to Britain fresh from hitting Continental Europe. For a taste of what we can expect, our picture editor has pulled together some images of the freezing weather across the Channel. Good morning and welcome to our coverage of the most extravagantly named cold snap in British history – probably. Yes, today we greet ‘the beast from the east’, a blast of Siberian weather that the Met Office has warned will bring heavy snow and freezing conditions along the east coast of the UK and south-east England. There is likely to be disruption on the roads, railways and in the air. It is, indeed, a monster.

Find out at our live blog, where we are keeping an eye on developments including the transport situation, school closures and the areas most affected by the snow. The east coast is bearing the brunt from south-east England to Scotland, with yellow and amber weather warnings in place. NHS England has issued a level 3 cold weather alert, one notch below crisis level, while the Met Office has warned some rural and remote communities could be cut off by snowfalls of up to 15cm. Motorists have been told to stay off the roads if at all possible. By the middle of the week, there is potential for the majority of Britain to experience delays on the roads, trains and in the air. Blizzards, gales and freezing rain have been forecast for the end of the week as storm Emma moves north through Europe, hitting the UK on Thursday and Friday. Here’s how the Beast has manifested itself in Europe so far – and we have even compiled some wardrobe fixes for that snow-related fashion emergency (just don’t slip over while dashing to Topshop). * * * ‘A new UK-EU customs union’ – Jeremy Corbyn has, as expected, stuck a broom in Theresa May’s spokes by announcing as Labour policy a customs union with the EU and single market membership – a position supported by Tory rebels. But you might not have noticed, writes Rafael Behr, that “Corbyn delivered the most explicitly pro-Brexit speech of his leadership of the party. Its central premise was that the hazards of leaving the EU have been exaggerated, and that the only real risk comes from the whole thing being done by wicked Tories”. Liam Fox will today hit back at Corbyn – the international trade secretary will reprise the Brexiter theme that it’s better to leave the EU customs union and take our chances with a multitude of as-yet unspecified and un-negotiated trade deals. We will also soon find out how rigid the EU plans to be with Britain as the pivotal first complete draft of the divorce treaty is released. The need to maintain an open border in Ireland could bind the entire UK into some sort of continued union – not only on customs and trade, but any other EU rules that support the all-island economy and peace. That’s a big test for May: leaver Tories want a clean break, while her DUP coalition partners reject any deal that would delineate Northern Ireland from the rest of Britain. * * * ‘Significant and concerning’ – Far-right groups are gaining a similar potency to Islamic State in the threat they pose in Britain, the departing terrorism tsar has warned. Mark Rowley said four plots by rightwing extremists were thwarted in 2017, while a third of referrals to the government’s Prevent anti-radicalisation strategy involved such groups. The Finsbury Park mosque attacker, Darren Osborne, had grown to hate Muslims “largely due to his consumption of large amounts of online far-right material”. Rowley said that as he leaves there are more than 600 investigations of Islamist, extreme rightwing and other groups in train, with 3,000 people of immediate interest and files held on more than 20,000 others. * * * Worrying rise in diabetes cases – The diagnosis of diabetes has more than doubled in Britain over the last 20 years, with 3.7 million people aged 17 or older living with the disease. Diagnosis with type-2 diabetes has gone up the fastest, driven largely by a rise in obesity – mostly worryingly, among under-40s. There are estimates that a million more people in the UK might have undiagnosed type 2. James O’Neill has had type-1 since he was a child and an amputated toe has been among the health complications. He urges people at risk to make lifestyle changes, however difficult. “I have seen it in people, both type 1 and type 2, where people have lost limbs … if you can prevent that in any way, shape or form, then do so.” * * * Formula for poverty – Companies including Nestlé appear to be targeting poor and vulnerable mothers to convince them to buy baby formula, in apparent breach of World Health Organisation rules and local laws. A joint Guardian/Save the Children investigation has highlighted allegations that in the Philippines, Nestlé and three other companies have provided doctors, midwives and local health workers with free trips, meals and entertainment. In return, “if a patient decided to use formula milk I’d recommend their product and tell them ‘Nestlé is good’,” said midwife Grace Shelo Almarez, who now rejects the companies’ largesse. Nestlé and the other companies involved have denied any wrongdoing. Lunchtime read: Slow death of the establishment The “British establishment” today is somewhat removed from its origins in the class system and privilege. In government, explains researcher Aeron Davis, the change started in the 1980s when Oxbridge types began to be displaced from the upper rungs of Whitehall, as an emphasis on “meritocracy” and expertise represented by grammar school education, the professions and PhDs took hold. Then came change in the business world, where “flabby, inefficient old money was being run out of town by a new energetic breed succeeding on merit”. Thus the country’s elites became more disparate. Neoliberalism, the ideology of small state, free markets and low taxes, held promise of binding together these modern elites – but “after decades its flaws and contradictions are becoming too large to deal with,” writes Davis. “I have come to believe that the establishment is no longer coherent or collective or competent. Its failings are not only causing larger schisms, inequalities and precariousness in Britain; they also threaten the very foundations of establishment rule itself.” Sport Scotland, who stunned England in the Six Nations, included five players plus the coach, Gregor Townsend, who have been shaped by a spell outside domestic comfort zones. It’a s a lesson that could help English players grow. Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola’s yellow-ribbon display of political affiliation sits uncomfortably with a readiness to play ambassador for the Qatar World Cup, argues Richard Williams. Great Britain’s Olympic chiefs have launched an impassioned defence of their £28m winter sport funding and are undeterred in asking for more money for the four-year cycle to Beijing 2022. Meanwhile, Daniel Taylor picked up two of the seven prizes won by the Guardian at the Sports Journalists’ Association awards on Monday night, being named football journalist of the year and sports writer of the year. Business Asian markets have mostly extended gains after Wall Street finished higher overnight. The focus is on Jerome Powell’s congressional testimony later in the day – his first public appearance as chair of the Federal Reserve. Investors will want to know whether Powell thinks the Fed’s 2% inflation target is approaching and whether it might soon feel the need to speed up its rate increases.

And yet it winds up embracing a solemn, softly-spoken and slow-moving Christian piety of its own. Mary was a key apostle of Jesus, and intimate witness to some of the most important events in his life, but has been wrongly recast in popular tradition as a “fallen woman” and “prostitute”, perhaps because of a prurient need in the male religious hive-mind for a diametric opposite to the Blessed Virgin of the same name – a need to perpetuate the misogynistic ideology of madonna/whore, and simply to denigrate a woman’s importance. This caricature of Mary Magdalene probably reached its low point in the musical Jesus Christ Superstar with Mary’s song I Don’t Know How to Love Him, with its startling lines: “He’s a man, he’s just a man, and I’ve had so many men before, in very many ways...” Too much information. This film sets out to challenge all this: Rooney Mara brings her pupil-dilated intensity to the role of Mary, Joaquin Phoenix is a wan, introspective Jesus, Chiwetel Ejiofor plays Peter and Tahar Rahim is Judas. The drama plausibly suggests that Mary was a fiercely intelligent, resourceful woman who rejected the male norms of marriage and children laid down for her, and insisted on following Jesus. This was what caused her to be (at least initially) condemned as mad or possessed: it is entirely convincing. When she takes up her new position among the apostles, the film suggests that she does indeed become a favourite pupil, permitted à deux confidences on hillsides. But all this means for Mary is doing an awful lot of enlightened gazing at Jesus, who in turn does a good deal of infinitely knowing smiles back at her, while their dialogue is muted and restrained. The film takes us in reasonably short order through the familiar Sunday school events, like the raising of Lazarus, Palm Sunday, the expulsion of the money changers, the last supper and of course the crucifixion itself. But Mary washing Jesus’s feet with her hair has been removed and each of the big events seems weirdly low key and even anti-climactic. For all that the film revises our view of Mary simply by placing the narrative focus more on her, its more radical specific changes are actually connected with the men who are treated very leniently. Judas’s motives for the betrayal turn out to be wrongheaded but not culpable and there are no thirty pieces of silver. Similarly, Peter’s threefold denial has been abolished. The film suggests – quite persuasively – that the peace-loving and quietist message of Christianity was finally understood by Mary, but not the macho male apostles. But the drama’s need to forgive Judas and Peter makes the story toothless. And the dreamlike vision of Mary Magdalene floating underwater is a bit of a cliche. The performances of Mara and Phoenix are careful and respectful, though with nothing like the lightning-flash of energy and scorn that they have given to secular roles in the past. And this may be because the film needs to distance itself, a little high-mindedly, from that other vulgar Mary Magdalene tradition – the one about her actually having sex with Jesus, the idea posited in both The Last Temptation of Christ and The Da Vinci Code. It’s if the film feels the need to repudiate any suggestion of impropriety. What we’re left with is a platonic apostlemance."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/mar/01/whatever-happened-to-wage-rises-in-australia","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-28T18:57:53Z","webTitle":"Whatever happened to wage rises in Australia?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/mar/01/whatever-happened-to-wage-rises-in-australia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/mar/01/whatever-happened-to-wage-rises-in-australia","fields":{"headline":"Whatever happened to wage rises in Australia?","bodyText":"For the past four years workers across Australia have for the first time outside of a recession seen their living standards stagnate. Where once it was taken for granted that you would be better off now than you were in the past, the average Australian household has less disposable income in real terms than when the Liberal/National Coalition took power in 2013. And the major reason is persistent low wages growth. In a period where the cost of living for essential items such as energy and health have skyrocketed, workers’ wages have grown at record low levels that would have been considered implausible five years ago. For workers – especially those on low incomes such as Margaret Peacock at the Australian Paper factory in Preston – even the average growth figures seem implausibly high as they struggle in an industrial relations environment where negotiating a pay rise large enough to cover increases in cost of living is viewed as a luxury. This is the terrain on which the next federal election will be fought. A government that can go to the voters boasting of record levels of jobs growth, falling unemployment and rising workforce participation is also acutely aware that households are squeezed by a lack of income growth and rising non-discretionary household costs such as power, rent and housing. Being blasé about those trends risks looking out of touch. The persistent low wages growth has opened up ideological and policy differences between the major parties with Labor favouring a more interventionist method while the Coalition puts its store in the fundamentals of demand and supply balancing out. Margaret, and other workers like her across the private and public sector in Australia, live on the frontline of low wages growth in Australia, where workers are struggling not to go backwards. The issue is such a barbecue stopper the governor of the Reserve Bank has been urging Australians workers to demand larger wage rises. It is an issue that now colours all debate – whether it be over the worth of a company tax cut, or the level of immigration. It is an issue that sees households, despite living in a country in its 26th year without a recession, with a living standard no better than seven years ago. It is the issue that has workers wondering: “Am I ever going to get another pay rise, and why is it so much harder to get one than it used to be?” And in truth these are questions that have no easy answers – it is a mix of international and local factors, it is the product of coincidences in the economy that are happening right now and a consequence of policy over the past 30 years. The Turnbull government and Bill Shorten’s opposition are coming at the problem from different standpoints, proffering different solutions. With voters fatigued by the circus out of Canberra, and looking to their leaders for answers on the policy debates that matter – this will be the issue on which the next federal election turns. The view from the picket line For Margaret Peacock it is about a lack of respect and goodwill. The 57-year-old packer at Australian Paper’s Preston factory in Victoria struggles to hide her exasperation as she talks about the pay dispute that has dragged on for almost a year, and has seen nearly 90% of the 100-strong workforce go on strike for the past five weeks. Margaret, who has worked at the factory for 33 years, has never seen anything like this. For her the factory is like a family – she met her husband when he started working there just over 20 years ago, she knows other couples at the plant, and their children. She speaks with pride of the work they do – including manufacturing the envelopes that were used in last year’s marriage equality postal survey. Then we come back to the enervating wages dispute and the impact it is having on the workers. Never, she says, have wage negotiations hit such an impasse – not in the 1980s when strikes were much more commonplace than now, nor even during the time of WorkChoices. In her 10 years as a union delegate for the Australian Manufacturing Workers’ Union Margaret says this has been the first time any ongoing industrial action has reached the point where, as she puts it, “we’re out on the grass”. In the past there were occasional half-day stop-work periods or overtime work bans, but nothing approaching the current strike, nor the combative bargaining process that has led to it. All over a pay claim for a 2.5% annual wage rise over three years. The fact that a plant has been shut down by a fight over a pay claim no higher than inflation tells you something about how much industrial relations has changed over the past few years. The year wages stood still Since the early 1990s saw a move from centralised wage fixing to enterprise bargaining under the Keating government, wages policy has been relatively straightforward. The Liberal party, the business lobby and conservative media would continually shout about the possibility of a wages breakout around the corner, or express fear of unions destroying our international competitiveness – but mostly it was pretty simple. The formula was simple and time honoured. All you needed to do was have the economy grow sufficiently so that unemployment would fall and then wages growth would increase. If the economy slowed and unemployment rose, then wages growth would slow down. It was a nice, clean relationship and it saw wages in Australia grow from 1998 through to the end of 2012 – a period encompassing both the mining boom and the global financial crisis – at an average of around 3.5% each year. This wasn’t too exorbitant – the Reserve Bank aims to keep inflation around 2.5% so in effect workers were seeing a 1% annual increase in real wages. And then in the middle of 2012 something unexpected happened that most economists didn’t see coming, most politicians weren’t worried about, and which has both groups now scratching to explain what has happened, and to come up with solutions. The unemployment rate at the time was 5.2% – just below the 5.4% it is now – and private sector wages were growing at 3.8% – up from 3.7% in March. There was nothing unusual about that. But then it all changed: June 2012 was the last time the annual growth of private sector wages would rise for five years. The next time is rose, in June 2017, it went up from 1.8% to 1.9%: It means we have now not seen that former average wages growth of 3.5% since September 2012 – and worse, no one thinks we will see it for a very long time yet. Even the budget with its very optimistic wages growth figures suggests we won’t get back to that level of growth until June 2021 – by which time it will have been nine years. More than long enough to suggest a change has occurred. The IMF, just to throw cold water on even that sad story, last week predicted that wages in Australia will not grow above 2.9% until beyond 2023. ‘We’re standing strong’ When Margaret talks of the impact of going out on strike, it is quickly obvious how easily economic data can blow past people’s experiences with barely a sidelong glance. Talk of economic theory, of growing international competitiveness, of low levels of industrial disputation all run head first into the personal cost of bargaining for a higher wage. For workers at the Australia Paper plant, the issue is threefold. The company rejected the union’s offer of 2.5% a year for three years, and offered instead a four-year agreement with no pay rise at all in the first year, followed by a 2% rise in the second and third years and 2.5% in the fourth. That would translate to an average wage rise of just 1.6% over four years – below the record low wages index growth set last year of 1.9%, and at a level which would almost certainly see the workers worse off in real terms. Secondly the company sought to cut four rostered days off for workers on one shift, and yet Margaret notes that the workers suspect that if agreed to, the company would seek to move most workers onto that rostered shift. And thirdly, to grandfather in the pay rate for those earning the top amount in the factory – $28 an hour – until all other workers’ wages rose up to meet them. Margaret estimates that would mean around 80% of workers – including her husband – could actually receive no pay rise over the course of the agreement, given they would need to wait until those like herself on $21 an hour had reached $28 an hour. It is a negotiation tactic that seeks to divide the workers – offering some a pay rise, while denying it to others, offering some no change to rostered days off, while others lose four out of their current 16 a year. Instead the workers – after going to the Fair Work Commission three times – have united, dug in and gone out on strike. That kind of action carries great cost. Margaret estimates the strike has thus far cost her and her husband around $7,000 in pay, and that most on the picket are “doing it tough”. She notes that a few of the workers have had to go back to work due the need for money, even while the union is trying to help through a hardship fund for people and donations from other worksites. Last year during for the marriage equality postal vote, the company was contracted to produce all the envelopes used to carry the survey to the 16 million voters across the country. The work came in the middle of the wage negotiations, but rather than use the urgency of the postal vote as a negotiating tactic, workers instead did 12 hour shifts over two weeks to get the job done. But this effort did not engender goodwill. Margaret noted soon after that the company reneged on what the workers believed was a deal not to cut RDOs. Last year she and her husband had planned with friends to go on a cruise to celebrate the 20th anniversary of their own marriage and of their friends’ 30th. The deposit for the cruise needed to be paid by the end of the month, and the loss of pay during the strike has meant they have had to use their savings. But she says they are the lucky ones because they at least own their house, whereas she knows of some who are “six weeks behind in their rent”. And yet she is adamant that those on strike “are all standing strong ... because we know if we give up this time we won’t get anything ... and well, we might as well not have an EBA”. How workers were thrown a curve ball In September 2012 when wages growth started falling it was not too surprising – after all the unemployment rate was rising, so wages growth is supposed to fall. The relationship between unemployment and wages is one economists have long held dear. Called the Phillips curve (after New Zealand economist, William Phillips), it operates on the assumption that when the unemployment falls it means employers are fighting over fewer available workers and thus they offer better wages to either entice people to work for them, or to stop their current employees from leaving. Conversely when unemployment rises it means that more people are fighting over fewer jobs and thus employers do not have to offer better wages to attract workers, and similarly workers are not so eager to fight for higher wages as they are just happy to have work. So when the unemployment rate falls, wage rises should increase (and vice versa). And while it’s not a perfect relationship, from 1998 to mid-2012 it held up quite well. But then wages growth over the following two years began to slow by more than you would expect even with the unemployment rate rising. By December 2014, wages were growing nearly a full percentage point slower than we would have expected. That was worrying, but what happened next really sent things into a spin, because the unemployment rate started to fall ... and so did wages growth: We are now so far from the old trend that wages are growing at nearly half the pace you would have expected them to given the current level of unemployment. We are a long way from home as it were, and no one is particularly sure if we’ll ever get back there. Even the RBA says workers must ask for more One explanation for the departure from previous expected behaviour is underemployment, which occurs when workers want more hours. It is a good indicator of what is called “spare capacity” – because if you have an underemployed worker in your factory it means you have someone who is not being used to his or her full capacity. All economies exhibit underemployment, but in the past it was not a big issue. Back before the 1990s, most people worked full-time so more hours wasn’t something they worried about. And even when part-time work began rising in the 1990s and into the 2000s, it still wasn’t a big issue because it moved in line with unemployment. It meant that reducing unemployment would in turn reduce underemployment. From the end of 2007 until the middle of 2014 the relationship was almost perfect. The unemployment rate rose 1.7% percentage points from 4.3% to 6.0%, while the underemployment rate rose 1.6% percentage points from 6.1% to 7.7%. But then at the end of 2014 they parted ways. Unemployment began to fall but underemployment kept rising: This is so much of an issue that the governor of the Reserve Bank, Phillip Lowe, last year suggested workers might be trapped into forgoing wage growth in place of getting more hours – when you are underemployed you are more likely to seek more hours than the same hours and a higher wage. He argued workers needed to be bolder in their wage demands, because they were more concerned about the security of their job than getting a pay rise. “With a greater premium on security”, he suggested, “it’s plausible that workers are less inclined to take a risk by seeking larger wage increases”. But underemployment does not explain all of the change in wages. By the time underemployment split from unemployment at the end of 2014, the link between wages growth and unemployment had been fractured for nearly two years. What the split did do, however, was send wages growth downwards even while unemployment itself improved. Profits are up, but wages are down For many workers – including those like Margaret – the most exasperating thing about the lack of a wage rise is that the companies seem to be doing well. Last year the sense that workers were losing out while companies profited reached a peak when company profits grew by 22% – the second fastest annual growth in the past 30 years, while total wages and salaries grew by just 1.4% – the slowest growth outside of a recession or the GFC. Wages and salaries make up around 42% of Australia’s GDP, so when nominal GDP growth rises or falls, generally wages and salaries follow suit. But last year, yet again one of the wonderful long-held relationships in economic theory decided it was time for a trial separation: In March last year, nominal GDP grew by 6.8%, off the back of soaring profits from the mining sector and booming iron ore and coal prices – the fastest annual growth for four years. At the same time the annual growth of wages and salaries dropped to 1.7% in trend terms – the worst growth ever recorded outside of six months during the GFC and nine months during the 1991 recession. It was enough to make workers feel the economy is not working for them. And it is a feeling both sides of politics are vitally aware of. Last year full-time employment grew by more in one calendar year than it ever has on record. And yet the treasurer in September took great pains to make it clear he was listening to workers (ie voters) with a speech to the Business Council of Australia titled “More and better paid jobs”. He noted to the audience of business executives that “while the recent jobs growth has been great for those 800,000 Australians and their families, for eleven and a half million other Australian workers it has been a long time since most of them have had a decent pay rise”. Indeed for the average worker it has been a very long time. In the past wages and average earnings usually rose faster than inflation. This is good because it means you get a real wage increase, and thus improved living standards. But what has happened over the past few years is that inflation has risen faster or at the same pace as wages. And because there has also been a shift towards more part-time employment over the past four years, which invariably pays less than full-time work, combined with low wage growth, the average real earnings of Australian workers has actually fallen in the past four years: Among the solutions the treasurer proffered was improved productivity. And yet here again we find ourselves grasping for a solution using old relationships than no longer are as close as they once were. Wages have long been linked with productivity. In essence productivity growth means workers are producing more in the same amount of time, and as a result they should be rewarded for such improvements. And yet the evidence shows that falls in productivity are not to blame for the slowdown in wages growth – indeed since the GFC productivity has grown well ahead of real wages. As Jim Stanford from the Centre for Future Work has noted, labour productivity on average has not significantly slowed compared to the pre-GFC years, and thus it doesn’t appear that the reasons workers are getting lower pay rises is because they are less productive. And while the treasurer in his speech argued that “we can expect labour productivity to once again drive the growth in real wages”, the treasury’s own analysis notes that “weaker labour productivity growth seems unlikely to be a cause of the current period of slow wage growth” because “over the past five years, labour productivity in Australia has grown at around its 30-year average annual growth rate”. And for workers at the coalface, talk of the need for productivity improvements doesn’t lead to higher wages. For many workers, productivity improvements are code for loss of working hours – in the case of workers at Australia Paper, fewer RDOs – rather than any sense of them profiting from working more efficiently. Is it all about the robots? Workers in most developed economies are experiencing much the same issues. Last year the IMF wrote a report called the “Disconnect between Unemployment and Wages”, which noted that while partly it is all just a cyclical issue due to the global economy still recovering from the GFC, there are two big structural shifts: robots and globalisation. The issue of robots, or automation, is one that is probably more in the minds of workers than in actuality. But it is enough of an issue that workers are factoring it into their wage demands – the fear that you could be replaced by a robot is causing workers around the world not to ask for too big of a wage rise even if that fear is not yet likely to be realised. But the other fear of workers around the globe is other workers around the globe. The IMF noted “sizeable common global factors” are behind the slowdown in wage growth. That is, weak wages growth in one country is having a spill-over effect in other countries, notably trading partners as workers feel the pressure of losing their job to a worker overseas. Philip Lowe noted this concern last year when he argued that “workers feel there is more competition out there, sometimes from workers overseas and sometimes because of advances in technology”. And whereas in the past that fear was mostly limited to the manufacturing sector, it now includes services as well. When you read articles about robots making hamburgers, the sense of what jobs could be replaced by new technology starts to widen considerably. Businesses are also feeling this competition – think about the new entrants in the retail industry such as Amazon in Australia – and you get the sense that this isn’t just some temporary phase. Globalisation is not going away, and neither is automation. So while the economy might pick up that might not lead to wages growing like they used to. Yes, the unemployment rate, or productivity, or underemployment or profits might all improve, but wages growth will not return to where it once was. And all of this has had a significant impact on our standard of living. Wages and salaries account for the vast majority of household income, and thus low wage growth necessarily has a bigger impact on households than it does even on the whole economy – as we saw last year, if profits rise by enough they can overcome a lack of growth in wages to see the total economy grow strongly. The same cannot be said about household income. The four years of low wages growth has had a damaging effect on household standard of living. Data from the quarterly GDP national accounts, shows that in real terms, household disposable incomes are now lower than they were in 2011. In effect, the amount the average household has to spend will now buy less than it did nearly seven years ago. That is a horrid run, and one that would be understandable if we had suffered through a deep recession during that time, but we haven’t: The workers at Australian Paper are being offered a wage rise over the next four years that would average just 1.6% per annum – at a time when the government is predicting the average prices of goods and services will rise 2.5%. It is also an issue that public sector workers are dealing with. Earlier this month the Australian Public Service Commission announced that future EBA’s covering APS staff would be limited to a wage growth of 2% – meaning the government itself has signed off on delivering its own workers a real wage fall. That hardly sits with the treasurer’s prediction that “consumers will start to see their real wages growing in line with their productivity again”. The combination of all these factors – the breakdown of relationships between unemployment, profits and productivity with wages, and of the growth of competition and increased automation – leave workers, straggling to get a pay rise. But it is not only the change in the way the parts of the economy are working together. The way workers and employers within that economy interact has also changed. Margaret Peacock knows from experience that things have changed – even if the IR legislation has not. She finds herself out on the grass, forgoing pay purely to receive a pay rise that will in all likelihood merely keep her standard of living flat. The goodwill that was once present in the negotiations is gone. While the workers might feel the sense of family, management does not. Last year Lowe also suggested the combination of all these factors meant that “many workers feel like they have less bargaining power than they once did”. And as we shall see, even in cases with a strong union shopfloor presence as exists with Margaret and her fellow workers, it is not just a feeling of less bargaining power, but the reality. • On Friday: in the second part of series on wage stagnation, Greg and Gareth look at the implications for industrial relations and the labour movement • Support our independent journalism with a monthly or one-off contribution"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/feb/27/european-roundup-neymar-suffers-fractured-metatarsal-in-blow-to-psg","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-27T00:12:16Z","webTitle":"European roundup: Neymar suffers fractured metatarsal in blow to PSG","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/feb/27/european-roundup-neymar-suffers-fractured-metatarsal-in-blow-to-psg","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/feb/27/european-roundup-neymar-suffers-fractured-metatarsal-in-blow-to-psg","fields":{"headline":"European roundup: Neymar suffers fractured metatarsal in blow to PSG","bodyText":"Paris Saint-Germain have confirmed that Brazilian forward Neymar suffered a fractured metatarsal and sprained ankle in Sunday’s win over Marseille. Neymar, who joined PSG for a world-record transfer fee last summer, looks certain to miss the second leg of his side’s Champions League last-16 tie with Real Madrid on 6 March. Neymar was taken off on a stretcher during the 3-0 win at Parc des Princes and the club said that a scan has revealed a “fissure of the fifth metatarsal” – a bone on the outside of the foot – and a “sprain of the right ankle”. The French club did not say how long the forward will be out for, but the expected time for recovery and recuperation from a metatarsal injury is between two and three months. Neymar’s compatriot, Gabriel Jesus, missed 10 weeks for Manchester City last season with a fractured metatarsal. A similar length of time out for Neymar could result in the 26-year-old missing the rest of PSG’s season. Unai Emery’s side are 14 points clear in Ligue 1 but are chasing a domestic treble. PSG face Marseille in a Coupe de France quarter-final on Wednesday, and will play Monaco in the League Cup final on 31 March. Neymar could face a race to be fit for the Champions League quarter-finals, which begin on 3 April – if PSG can overcome a 3-1 first-leg deficit without him. Real Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane reacted to the news, saying “I don’t like it when a player hurts himself, I am not happy about the injury. We never rejoice when a rival is absent due to injury.” Dortmund drop points as fans stay away Borussia Dortmund were held to a 1-1 draw by Augsburg as almost 25,000 home fans boycotted the Monday night Bundesliga match. Marco Reus put Dortmund ahead in the 16th minute but Kevin Danso’s 73rd-minute equaliser left Dortmund 19 points behind leaders Bayern Munich and facing a tight battle for Champions League qualification. The match was played out in front of an official crowd of 54,300 – significantly down on the team’s average home attendance – while many fans displayed banners protesting the scheduling of the match on Monday evening. Frankfurt’s match with RB Leipzig last Monday saw protests that delayed the game on two occasions. The Bundesliga have introduced five Monday matches this season, a move met with fierce opposition from supporters. Schürrle’s cross to Michy Batshuayi was cut out by Augsburg defender Martin Hinteregger, only for Reus to steer the loose ball into the roof of the net. Dortmund dominated the rest of the first half but the visitors responded after the break. Austrian defender Danso tapped home the rebound from close range after Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Bürki had parried his header at a corner. Batshuayi and Mahmoud Dahoud both missed late chances to snatch a winner for the hosts. In Serie A, Napoli moved four points clear with an impressive 5-0 win at struggling Cagliari, extending their league winning streak to 11 games. First-half goals from José Callejón and Dries Mertens set the league leaders on their way before a Marek Hamsik thunderbolt, a Lorenzo Insigne penalty and a superb free kick from Mario Rui wrapped up the victory. Napoli have 69 points from 26 games, with Juventus on 65 points with a game in hand. Juve’s home game against Atalanta was postponed on Sunday due to heavy snow."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/feb/27/tv-industry-diversity-women-people-of-color-decline","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-27T10:01:00Z","webTitle":"Despite reckoning on Hollywood diversity, TV industry has gotten worse","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/feb/27/tv-industry-diversity-women-people-of-color-decline","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/feb/27/tv-industry-diversity-women-people-of-color-decline","fields":{"headline":"Despite reckoning on Hollywood diversity, TV industry has gotten worse","bodyText":"The television industry’s exclusion of female show creators and people of color has only gotten worse in the new season, according to a study that paints a grim picture even as Hollywood has made bold commitments to improve diversity and representation. Creators of new shows in the 2017-18 season were 91% white and 84% male, marking a step backwards for both gender and racial diversity behind the camera, researchers with the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) reported on Tuesday. Despite modest gains in the diversity of casts in film and TV – and widespread evidence that diverse content yields box office success and high ratings – white men still occupy the vast majority of creative positions, the study found. “There are all kinds of missed opportunities,” said Darnell Hunt, a UCLA sociology professor and the co-author of the annual Hollywood diversity report. “It’s an outgrowth of the executive suites and the fact that they are still overwhelmingly white and male and who is in a position to judge which ideas being pitched are viable … and whose pitches will be heard.” The report, which analyzed the top 200 film releases in 2016 and more than 1,200 television shows, comes at a time when the entertainment industry is grappling with gender discrimination and its legacy of sexual abuse amid the Time’s Up and #MeToo movements. The research highlights the persistent underrepresentation in film and television even as women-fronted films and movies like Black Panther, with a nearly all-black cast, continue to shatter box office records – while projects with mostly white casts are overall less successful. Of the 45 new scripted television shows approved for 2017-18 across broadcast, cable and digital platforms, there were only four creators of color, all of whom were black. There were also only seven female creators. With women behind only 16% of new shows and minorities behind just 9%, the outlook was worse than overall representation in the previous season, which was marginally better in both categories. All new broadcast shows had white creators, Hunt said. Women also claimed only 28% of leads for new shows, a significant drop from the previous season. There was, however, improvement in casting of people of color, who made up 28% of leads for new shows, an increase from the prior year. But, the report found, over the last five years, there has been a broader trend of increasing diversity in television creators, particularly in broadcast and digital. “We are seeing some sustained progress over time … but we were starting at such an abysmal location,” Hunt said. In film, people of color accounted for 13.9% of leads in the top movies of 2016, virtually the same as the previous year. Women made up 31% of top film leads, marking a slight increase. Between 2011, the first year UCLA produced the report, and 2016, there has been virtually no change in film directors of color, who continue to represent only 12% of the top films. Women also made no gains, directing only 6.9% of the top films in 2016. The study provided further evidence that audiences prefer diverse content. Films with casts that were 21-30% people of color had the highest median global box office returns and highest median return on investment. Meanwhile, movies with casts that were mostly white had the lowest median box office returns, but made up a majority of the 2016 films. People of color also accounted for the majority of ticket sales for five of the top 10 films. TV shows with mostly white casts also tended to have lower ratings than more diverse shows, which were popular among all racial groups. “People want to see themselves represented on the screen,” Hunt said. “It just makes bottom line sense.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/ng-interactive/2018/feb/27/the-guardian-essential-report-28-february-results","type":"interactive","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-26T23:24:46Z","webTitle":"The Guardian Essential Report, 28 February results","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/ng-interactive/2018/feb/27/the-guardian-essential-report-28-february-results","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/ng-interactive/2018/feb/27/the-guardian-essential-report-28-february-results","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian Essential Report, 28 February results","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/feb/26/fifth-briton-ellie-udall-dies-after-grand-canyon-helicopter-crash","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-26T22:16:12Z","webTitle":"Fifth Briton dies after Grand Canyon helicopter crash","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/26/fifth-briton-ellie-udall-dies-after-grand-canyon-helicopter-crash","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/feb/26/fifth-briton-ellie-udall-dies-after-grand-canyon-helicopter-crash","fields":{"headline":"Fifth Briton dies after Grand Canyon helicopter crash","bodyText":"Newlywed Ellie Udall has become the fifth Briton to die following a helicopter crash in the Grand Canyon, passing away just days after her husband. The 29-year-old died in hospital after failing to regain consciousness, the Foreign Office said, just over two weeks after the accident at the Arizona tourist attraction. She was on her honeymoon with her husband, Jonathan Udall, who died in a Las Vegas hospital on Thursday. “It is with great sadness that we have to announce the death of our daughter Eleanor Udall (nee Milward) as a result of the injuries she sustained in the Grand Canyon helicopter crash on 10 February 2018,” her family said in a statement. “The family are exceedingly grateful for everything done by rescue services and volunteers in the Canyon, and throughout the last two weeks by the exceptional staff at UMC,” they added. On the justgiving page set up to pay for the Udalls’ medical costs, their friend Chris Tucker wrote: “It deeply saddens me once more to update this page. Yesterday Ellie lost her battle to her injuries, the only consolidation I can muster is that she is no longer in pain and is, I hope, with Jon. “The continued support to this page is heartwarming during this tragic time. May we never forget this wonderful couple,” he added. The couple’s friends, Becky Dobson, 27, her boyfriend Stuart Hill, 30, and his brother Jason Hill, 32, also died when the Airbus EC130 B4 crashed shortly before sunset on 10 February. The group had been celebrating Stuart Hill’s 30th birthday, alongside the honeymoon, with a trip to Las Vegas. The Mohave County medical examiner said multiple injuries killed Becky Dobson and the Hill brothers, who are originally from Worthing, West Sussex. Two other people – Jennifer Barham, 39, and pilot Scott Booth, 42 – were also treated in hospital. The helicopter crashed on tribal land in a section of the Grand Canyon outside of the national park, where air tours are not as highly regulated. The cause of the helicopter crash is being investigated by the National Transportation Safety Board. A preliminary report said the helicopter did at least two 360-degree turns before hitting the ground, according to eyewitnesses. Investigators will interview witnesses, survivors, the helicopter operator and manufacturer, and others before issuing a full report on the crash, which is expected to take at least a year."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/feb/26/martin-shkreli-responsible-for-105m-in-securities-scheme-losses-judge-rules","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-26T21:03:55Z","webTitle":"Martin Shkreli responsible for $10.5m in securities scheme losses, judge rules","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/26/martin-shkreli-responsible-for-105m-in-securities-scheme-losses-judge-rules","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/feb/26/martin-shkreli-responsible-for-105m-in-securities-scheme-losses-judge-rules","fields":{"headline":"Martin Shkreli responsible for $10.5m in securities scheme losses, judge rules","bodyText":"In a significant blow to the fortunes of the disgraced “Pharma Bro” Martin Shkreli, a judge ruled Monday that he was responsible for nearly $10.5m in losses in a securities fraud scheme. The decision could result in a harsher sentence for the eccentric former pharmaceutical company CEO, who faces up to 20 years in prison. Shkreli’s defense had hoped the 34-year-old would get little or even no prison time and had argued that investors in two failed hedge funds did not suffer actual losses because they were compensated with drug company stock that more than covered their initial investments. But the US district judge Kiyo Matsumoto rejected their arguments in a written decision in federal court in Brooklyn, finding that Shkreli should be penalized for the losses because he made risky transactions with investors’ millions without their permission. Matsumoto concluded that after dipping into investor money from one of the hedge funds to keep his drug company startup afloat, Shkreli “used some the funds to satisfy both personal and unrelated professional obligations”, including a $900,000 debt for a bad stock market trade, she wrote. The ruling could allow for a 10-year or longer sentence – although Matsumoto is not bound by the guidelines on sentencing. Shkreli is perhaps best known for boosting the price of a life-saving drug, Daraprim, by 5,000% and for his aggressive attacks on critics on social media, where he became known as “Pharma Bro”. At a hearing last week, prosecutors asked the judge to order Shkreli to forfeit about $7.3m in assets, including a one-of-a-kind Wu-Tang Clan Once Upon a Time in Shaolin album that he has boasted he bought for $2m, as part of the punishment. The judge hasn’t ruled on that request but she rejected a bid by Shkreli’s lawyers to reverse his criminal conviction. One of Shkreli’s attorneys, Ben Brafman, said in a statement that he was “disappointed by the ruling but still hopeful that the court will find it in her heart to impose a reasonably lenient sentence”. Shkreli’s bail was revoked last year after he posted a veiled threat against Hillary Clinton on Twitter."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/feb/26/florida-shooting-madeleine-wilford-miracle-recovery","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-26T19:54:44Z","webTitle":"Parents talk about 'miracle' of daughter they thought had died in Florida shooting","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/26/florida-shooting-madeleine-wilford-miracle-recovery","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/feb/26/florida-shooting-madeleine-wilford-miracle-recovery","fields":{"headline":"Parents talk about 'miracle' of daughter they thought had died in Florida shooting","bodyText":"Doctors and first responders who treated a student initially thought to have died in the Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school massacre have spoken of their battle to save the teenager’s life, and her incredible recovery from multiple gunshot wounds. Madeleine Wilford, 17, and her parents also spoke at a Monday press conference at Broward North hospital to praise the ambulance crew, surgeons and medical staff who resuscitated and operated on her, and talked of the “miracle” that allowed her to be discharged barely a week after she was shot in the rampage that killed 14 classmates and three adult teachers. “When they were clearing the rooms, at first sight it was believed Maddy had deceased,” said Lieutenant Laz Ojeda of the Coral Springs fire rescue department, a member of one of the first medical teams to enter the school. “She looked very pale. At that point, Officer Fernandez shook her to elicit a response. She gasped or moved; she made signs of life.” Ojeda told reporters that a member of Broward sheriff’s Swat team put an emergency chest seal on the student to prevent air escaping from a collapsed lung. He said once she was in the ambulance and able to whisper her age, he made the decision to take her to Broward North’s trauma centre, 20 miles closer than the main Broward Health medical centre in Fort Lauderdale. “I’m not a doctor, but in my estimation that chest seal prevented the tension pneumothorax from progressing and perhaps killing her sooner.” Madeleine, a talented basketball player, spent the first days in hospital fighting for her life, receiving numerous units of blood and undergoing three major surgeries to repair “substantial damage” caused by bullets from the AR-15 rifle used by the killer. “She had major gunshot wounds to her chest, abdomen and arm and was also in haemorrhagic shock,” said Dr Igor Nichiporenko, medical director of trauma services at Broward North. “She was pale and not responsive. The wounds to her chest were very severe with massive bleeding. We placed a chest tube which relieved the tension pneumothorax, which actually saved her life. She’s lucky. Very, very lucky.” Nichiporenko said Madeleine was one of three students with gunshot wounds his team had saved. “Because we see these kind of injuries, gunshot wounds and penetrative trauma almost every day, because of experience, we did an outstanding job,” he said. “I’m pleased Maddy and her parents are here to celebrate her successful recovery.” Her father David said he felt his daughter was blessed. “It’s hard for me to feel anything but gratitude and thanks. This really has been a miracle,” he said. Madeleine thanked the “first responders and amazing doctors” who saved her. “All the love that’s been passed around, I wouldn’t be here without it,” she said. “I’m just grateful I’m making a full recovery and things have been going smoothly.” Meanwhile, pressure was continuing to grow on Monday on Scott Israel, the sheriff of Broward County, who has been criticised for alleged failures in preventing and responding to the shooting. An armed officer assigned to the school resigned after waiting outside while the victims were being shot. More than 70 Republican lawmakers wrote to the state’s governor, Rick Scott, on Sunday to demand that Israel be suspended for “dereliction of duty and incompetence” amid revelations that the Broward sheriff’s office had received 23 calls about Nikolas Cruz, the 19-year-old alleged killer, including some that suggested he was a potential school shooter. In an interview with CNN, Israel dismissed the criticism, claiming it was “politically motivated” and insisting he had shown “amazing leadership”. On Monday, investigators from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE) began an independent inquiry ordered by Scott into the shooting, including the actions of the Broward officers. Israel said in a statement he welcomed “full transparency and accountability” and that his office would cooperate fully with the investigation. The investigators will want to talk with Scot Peterson, the school’s assigned resource officer for almost a decade who has resigned from the sheriff’s office. Branded “a coward” by Donald Trump, Peterson was accused of hiding outside the freshman building. In a written statement released through his lawyer on Monday, Peterson denied the allegation, saying he had not entered the building because he thought the gunfire was coming from outside. “Let there be no mistake. Mr Peterson wishes that he could have prevented the untimely passing of the 17 victims, and his heart goes out to the families of the victims in their time of need,” the attorney, Joseph DiRuzzo, wrote. “However, the allegations that Mr Peterson was a coward and that his performance, under the circumstances, failed to meet the standards of police officers, are patently untrue.” Students of Stoneman Douglas are preparing to return to classes on Wednesday for the first time since the 14 February shooting. The building where most of the victims died will remain closed, pending demolition. In Tallahassee on Monday, about 100 parents of Parkland students lobbied lawmakers to approve gun reforms. Last week, Scott announced plans to raise the age for buying firearms to 21 and provide $500m for mental health and school security. Florida House speaker Richard Corcoran, a Republican and member of the National Rifle Association, said the measures could be approved shortly. “I don’t care what any special interest group thinks, what I care about is keeping our citizenry safe, what I care about is protecting every single school child so that what occurred never happens again,” he said. “I don’t care who comes against us, the package we have does that. I applaud the governor, we’ll get it done.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/feb/27/victim-blaming-science-behind-psychology-research","type":"article","sectionId":"inequality","sectionName":"Inequality","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-27T11:00:03Z","webTitle":"Why we're psychologically hardwired to blame the victim","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/27/victim-blaming-science-behind-psychology-research","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/feb/27/victim-blaming-science-behind-psychology-research","fields":{"headline":"Why we're psychologically hardwired to blame the victim","bodyText":"“Why I stayed” is the title of the blog entry. In it, Jennifer Willoughby, the ex-wife of former White House staff secretary Rob Porter, lists abuses she says she endured, including being called a “fucking bitch”, and being physically prevented from leaving the house. But even in the face of clear evidence of guilt by perpetrators, victims of domestic violence feel compelled to justify their actions. This is the culture of victim-blaming in action. Rape and sexual assault survivors are asked about what they wore and how they fought back. Poor people who work three jobs and still can’t support a family are blamed for “laziness” and failure, despite facing an economy that is stacked against them. Despite #MeToo and rising resistance to record inequality, victim-blaming remains a constant undercurrent. Research suggests that this is actually an odd side-effect of the human desire for fairness. Understanding why could lead to new ways to fight back. The “just-world bias” happens because our brains crave predictability, and as such, we tend to blame victims of unfairness rather than reject the comforting worldview suggesting that good will be rewarded and evil punished. “There’s just this really powerful urge for people to want to think good things happen to good people and where the misperception comes in is that there’s this implied opposite: if something bad has happened to you, you must have done something bad to deserve that bad thing,” says Sherry Hamby, a professor of psychology at Sewanee University. First formulated by Melvin Lerner in the early 1960s, the just-world bias can be seen in any situation in which victims are blamed for their own misfortune, whether it be abuse, sexual assault, crime or poverty. Lerner’s original experiments involved women, who were asked to observe what appeared to be learning by punishment. When the learner – actually an actor – gave a wrong answer, she received painful electric shocks. Afterwards, observers were asked to describe how they felt about the victim, how likable or morally worthy she appeared to be. One group of women that just saw the victim get repeatedly shocked tended to derogate her. But another group, which before being asked to characterize the victim was told that she was not seriously harmed, did not engage in victim-blaming. Lerner explained these results suggested that seeing innocent people get hurt with no resolution of the situation violated the observers’ sense of the world as just. In order to reduce the threat, they saw the victim as deserving of her fate. Several other iterations of his experiments showed that the more “innocent” the experimenters made the victim seem in an unresolved situation, the more she was devalued. Studies by others on various types of victimization – including poverty – have since borne these ideas out. The preference for fairness is almost universal among human children, with predictable stages of development. Nearly everyone who has a sibling or more than one child has seen this in action, though there is some cultural variance. “That’s not fair,” the three-year-old whines, seeing a sibling with a “better” toy. This behavior arises early in life. Initially, children only see unfairness when it harms them. By around age eight, however, they become sensitized to unfairness directed at others, too – and they start asking uncomfortable questions about circumstances like homelessness. So why do we seem to feel such a strong need to see the world as fair, given that it so obviously often isn’t? It comes in part from the fact that many of life’s rewards are delayed, according to Kees van de Bos of Utrecht University, who has studied how varying levels of this bias and different situations affect victim-blaming. He uses the example of working for good grades in order to get a high-paid job. If the world is unfair and unpredictable, delaying fun to do homework makes little sense. Indeed, research shows that people who grow up in chaotic circumstances, quite rationally from their perspective, are less likely to postpone gratification. “We want to think that if we do the right thing, it’s all going to be OK,” says Hamby. “It’s threatening to see other people not be OK, so we want to come up with an explanation of why that experience won’t happen to us.” Further studies find that believing in a just world is linked to health – unsurprisingly, you are less likely to be depressed if you believe things will work out for the best, and if you believe the future will be friendly, you’re more likely to take better care of yourself. Unfortunately, this creates a sense of threat when things don’t play out fairly, and a tendency to look for rationalizations, such as blaming the victim. “The derogation of the victim comes as a defensive reaction against [one’s] personal worldview unraveling,” says Laura Niemi, a postdoctoral student in psychology at Duke University, explaining that the process is typically implicit. Niemi conducted a series of experiments with her colleague Liane Young to try to better explain the tendency, which they published in 2016. They found that people who have higher levels of what are known as “binding values” – a set of moral principles which help groups cohere – are more likely to see victims as at least partially responsible for their fates. These may come into tension with “individualizing values”, which have to do with treating everyone fairly. People who have a high level of binding values, for example, might support severe punishment for disloyalty, because they view protecting the group as more important than sparing the individual. Research finds that these values track political orientation pretty closely: conservatives have traditionally placed greater emphasis on binding values while liberals tend to prioritize individualizing values. As we’re seeing now with regard to both poverty and violence against women, Republicans use the idea that victims are undeserving for political gain. For example, several red states are trying to impose work requirements for Medicaid, implying that many current recipients choose to be idle and therefore, don’t deserve healthcare. The Trump administration also rescinded Obama-era guidance on university policies on sexual assault, again, making it harder for victims. In their own study, Niemi and Young found that when presented with a story of either a rape or robbery, those who were higher in binding values were more likely to derogate and blame victims. According to Niemi, binding values accounted for a greater proportion of the variance in victim-blaming than other factors like gender and political orientation. But the fact that we have this victim-blaming tendency, which is enhanced when people fear threats to their group or society, does not mean that it is immutable. The authors found that there was a simple way to begin to minimize it. In another experiment in their study, Niemi and Young compared victim-blaming among people who had been exposed to stories that spotlighted either the perpetrator or the victim. When the language focused on the perpetrator’s actions – victim-blaming decreased. Instead of focusing on victims’ behavior, we need to ask more questions about why perpetrators continue to commit acts of violence, and why some are allowed to take far more than their fair share in a world that most of us would prefer to see as just."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/feb/26/john-gordon-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-26T18:24:23Z","webTitle":"John Gordon obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/26/john-gordon-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/feb/26/john-gordon-obituary","fields":{"headline":"John Gordon obituary","bodyText":"John Gordon, who has died aged 77, was the UK’s permanent delegate to Unesco from 1983 to 1985, and remained deeply committed to its principles of peace, security and sustainability throughout his life. His time there proved to be a turbulent one, during which the US government withdrew from Unesco and the UK threatened to follow suit, eventually doing so on 5 December 1985. This was difficult for John, obliged as a public servant to follow government policy. Writing many years after the event, he said: “Walking down the corridor, followed by BBC television cameras, to hand in our notice of withdrawal to [the director general], was the saddest day of my diplomatic career.” The son of James Gordon, a materials scientist and author of several popular engineering books, and his wife, Theodora, John was born in Fleet, Hampshire. He was educated at Marlborough college and Cambridge University and went on to undertake research in history at Yale University and the London School of Economics. In 1966 he joined the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, serving in Budapest, Geneva, Yaoundé, Moscow and Brussels before his appointment to Unesco. His main area of expertise was the Soviet bloc – and he built strong networks with dissidents in both Hungary and Russia, where he was the culture attache. John went on to head the FCO’s nuclear energy department, dealing, among other issues, with the consequences of the Chernobyl nuclear accident of 1986, followed by a secondment to Imperial College London’s centre for environmental technology. He retired from the FCO in 1990, which allowed him to pursue his interest in environmental issues as deputy and policy director of the Global Environment Research Centre, special adviser to the UK-UN Environment and Development Forum and president of the Council for Education in World Citizenship. A committed environmentalist, he campaigned for sustainable development in Oxfordshire, and planted thousands of trees on his property in the Lake District to replace those lost during the second world war. He was a staunch advocate for the UK’s return to Unesco in the years leading up to 1997, when the incoming Labour government announced that the UK would rejoin. John was a founder member of the UK Unesco Forum, and of the UK National Commission for Unesco, established in 2004 as a link between civil society, the British government and Unesco. He was an active member of the National Commission from 2004 to 2007, focusing in particular on Unesco’s role in promoting peace and security. He is survived by his wife, Elizabeth Shanks, whom he married in 1965, and their sons, Tim and Alex."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/feb/26/the-guardian-view-on-labours-custom-union-plan-realistic-and-smart","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-26T18:32:17Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on Labour’s custom union plan: realistic and smart | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/26/the-guardian-view-on-labours-custom-union-plan-realistic-and-smart","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/26/the-guardian-view-on-labours-custom-union-plan-realistic-and-smart","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on Labour’s custom union plan: realistic and smart","bodyText":"Jeremy Corbyn’s speech on Britain after Brexit is a milestone in the UK’s mistaken exit from the European Union. It was a daring address, situating Brexit among other foreign policy crises such as climate change and the refugee emergency. The oration was important because it revealed Mr Corbyn’s sceptical thinking on Europe: he accepts Britain is leaving the EU; he thinks the single market might stop Labour from implementing radical policies; and he is worried that free market orthodoxy is embedded in the EU. He may – or may not – have a point about all these things. But the salient detail was that Mr Corbyn would negotiate a new customs union with the EU. In saying so, Labour appears smarter and less fantastical than the Conservatives. Mr Corbyn is right for two reasons. First, a customs union would make it easier to avoid a hard border between Great Britain and the continent, especially in Ireland. Second, UK industry relies on cross-border supply chains, and without a tariff-free arrangement companies would face costly delays. By considering the issues of business and the peace process in Northern Ireland, Mr Corbyn’s Labour is revealed as a party of sensible thought in the face of adversity. The contrast with Theresa May could not be clearer. Mr Corbyn leads Labour while the prime minister is being led by Brexiter MPs who operate as a party within her party. Tory Brexiters believe that Britain can diverge in key areas from EU regulations and not face barriers to trade in Europe. This is an illusion: if Britain wants a close trading relationship with the EU, it has to cleave to EU standards. Mr Corbyn understands this. He knows that EU rules have become global standards and UK industries will wish to follow them. Thus Labour, sensibly, accepts EU jurisdiction over the production and trade of goods – committing itself to support EU agencies that regulate industrial sectors. This greases the wheels in any talks about a new customs union. The Tories have also bought the fiction that global deals with China or the US could replace trade flows with Europe. This fallacy is built on the idea that the UK could undercut and deregulate its way to growth. Labour recognises this is not possible nor desirable. Instead, it is refreshingly realistic and hard-nosed. Mr Corbyn wants an EU-UK customs union but only if the British can have a say – not a veto – in negotiating the bloc’s future trade deals. This would allow the UK to strike trade deals together with the EU. It would also give the UK the same market access as EU member states to third countries that have free trade agreements with the EU. This is a win-win policy for both sides: the EU can offer potential third partners the UK market, as well as its own, in new trade deals. Mr Corbyn should be congratulated for his pragmatism on the issue of the customs union – arguing for both workers and business amid the crass populist impulses of Brexit. His outbreak of reason should extend to the Tory party. As a first step, Downing Street could stop appeasing the group of MPs who are theologically opposed to the EU. These Tories will not take yes for answer – despite Mrs May being desperate to capitulate. The result is that her position is getting closer and closer to a hard Brexit that abandons the single market, the customs union and the European court of justice. This is popular only on the fringe of politics, so why make it government policy? Mr Corbyn’s offer on the customs union would command a majority in parliament, which ought to bother the Tory leadership. Mrs May should make up her own mind, rather than let irreconcilable opponents of the EU make it up for her."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/mar/03/andie-macdowell-actor-im-kind-of-goofy-interview","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-03T14:00:19Z","webTitle":"Andie MacDowell: ‘I’m kind of goofy’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/03/andie-macdowell-actor-im-kind-of-goofy-interview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/03/andie-macdowell-actor-im-kind-of-goofy-interview","fields":{"headline":"Andie MacDowell: ‘I’m kind of goofy’","bodyText":"I asked someone the other day what people think of me and they said: “Unattainable, but relatable,” which is an oxymoron. The pictures of me out in public are me all dolled up. What people don’t see is I’m kind of goofy. My kids can attest to that. And while I try not to take myself too seriously, I really think things over. I analyse my history and I bring it forward to make my present better. Watching the unfolding of my mother’s demise was hard. She was an alcoholic. She’d been a schoolteacher, but kept losing her job. We ended up working at McDonald’s together when I was 16. One day I was driving her in and thinking: “She’s not quite sober, but I think she’s sober enough,” and she got fired. I asked them to give the job back, but they wouldn’t, so I quit. It was her last job. When I was 17 I did an intervention with her, but it failed. Four Weddings and a Funeral was a luxury. The settings were so romantic, the writing was perfect and Hugh [Grant] was such a talent to be working next to. In Groundhog Day, Harold Ramis [the director] loved me as an actor, which makes it really nice to go to work every day. Nobody explained to me what I had to do. When I was 20, I left South Carolina for New York with $2,000. I didn’t know anybody outside my environment. On one of my first big jobs as a model I remember going to dinner and everyone was talking about plays and books and all this stuff I hadn’t been exposed to. I thought to myself: “I need to go to plays. I need to read more books.” It was brand new and I thrived. Have open conversations with your children about personal relationships. I talked to mine about what’s healthy and that it’s OK to enjoy kissing. When I was 14, I got diagnosed with mono [glandular fever]. My father drove me home from the doctor’s without speaking and made me feel dirty and like I’d done something terrible for kissing somebody. It taught me to never make my children feel bad about themselves for something like that. I think it was my sense of humor and realness that people liked. I’d turn up to fashion shows in a T-shirt and jeans. When I went for the interview for the Calvin Klein commercials they said: “We hear you’re funny,” so I showed them some made-up stories I used to do with my friends from home about two characters called Dot and Earl. They ended up using it in the commercials. I’ve thought a lot about the line: “Is it raining? I hadn’t noticed.” [MacDowell’s line to Grant at the end of Four Weddings.] I don’t think there’s anything wrong with it and I don’t know why people pick on it, but I’ve thought about what else I could have done. Should I have looked around and said it as a joke? I don’t think so. Caring for my father was a beautiful resolution to a not-always-perfect relationship. The last year of his life he had dementia and I got to spend a lot of time with him. That was cathartic for me. I don’t think he was great at a lot of stuff, but I still loved him and forgave him. I wanted to give my children a normal life. They rarely went to openings or premieres. We’ve never spent much time watching my movies. When I came home I never talked about my work, I just talked about them, and I was their mom.

This is always my cue to begin planting bulbs whose exotic flowers and warm colours help extend the season of interest in your plot later into the year. Many blooms can last right up until the first frosts of autumn. While I do love the old faithful favourites of dahlia, gladioli and canna, there are loads of more weird and wonderful options that, to me at least, never quite get the limelight they deserve. If you are up for experimenting with wild-card options, here are three quirky summer bulbs for you to try, both indoors and out. Between their impossibly exotic blooms and far-flung origins in the wilds of South Africa, you might imagine the pineapple lily (Eucomis sp) would be a difficult option on our chilly island chain. Yet these beauties come with a surprising built-in tolerance for the cold. After freezing winters that have laid waste normally reliable options, such as cordylines and phormiums, I have seen them spring up the next summer as if nothing had happened. The stout, fat flower heads of Eucomis bicolor are real showstoppers, each pale yellow petal lined with delicate burgundy on blooms that will last for weeks. If you want to kick it up a notch, Eucomis comosa ‘Sparkling Burgundy’ erupts out of the ground each spring with brilliant claret-coloured rosettes of foliage, topped with green, white and shocking pink flowers in the summer. Beautiful. Cobra lilies are true wonders of nature with architectural foliage that is beaten for bizarreness only by their astonishing urn-shaped flowers. Their pink mottling and weird stripes make them look distinctly reptilian. OK, they may not exactly have the longest flowering period, but boy do they put on a show when they do and, frankly, their foliage is so lovely I have grown many for the leaves alone. Plant these rhizomes outdoors in a shady spot in deep, rich soil to mimic their woodland habitat and they will come back year after year. Just one word of caution – these plants are martyrs to slugs in my experience, so make sure you keep on top of them by using an effective control, such as nematodes. Finally, if you have a conservatory or empty corner in a warm room, you would need to look pretty far to find a climber more dramatic and unusual than the gloriosa lily (Gloriosa rothschildiana) from Africa and Asia. Delicate, vining branches cling to any support using whip-like tendrils that sprout from the end of each leaf and, come the summer, offer a steady supply of spidery, Sputnik-like red and yellow flowers. That’s a weird description, I know, but flowers this wonderfully strange can be a challenge to the vocabulary! They grow so fast from inexpensive tubers that I can’t think of any similar-sized, exotic vine that will give you better results for your money.

Modigliani’s portrait of a girl was found concealed by his later portrait, also of a girl, which was painted in 1917 and is kept at the Tate Gallery in London. While the identity of the 1917 sitter is unknown, the hidden portrait is believed to depict the artist’s former lover and muse, Beatrice Hastings, a free-spirited writer. One theory is that, as their stormy relationship of two years had ended by 1916, Modigliani may have wanted to airbrush her out of his life. Nancy Ireson, the Tate’s curator of international art, said: “It’s a hypothesis, but I think it’s rather a nice one … It’s quite interesting to think that he might have painted her out. So often, when you see a canvas reworked, it’s impossible to actually read the image beneath. To be able to make out the figure is exciting. It’s almost a full-length figure.” The moment that x-rays unexpectedly showed the hidden portrait for the first time was exciting, she said. “It’s a ‘secret’ that a painting suddenly reveals through a different way of looking.” Modigliani is revered for his iconic elongated portraits and sensual nudes. Such is his popularity these days that his 1917-18 masterpiece, Reclining Nude, was sold in 2015 for £113m, making it at the time the second most expensive artwork sold at auction. Although the artist gained recognition during his lifetime, he faced financial struggles, selling drawings for a few francs and, in 1919, offering the entire contents of his studio for just £100. He was 35 when he died in 1920 of tubercular meningitis. Hastings came to an equally tragic end. Her health ruined by alcohol, she was terminally ill when, in 1943, in England, she took her own life. Theirs had been a two-year intensely passionate relationship, with rows fuelled by alcohol and drug use. He was a handsome bohemian Italian whom she once described as “a swine and a pearl”, but she inspired several portraits. The Tate describes how, even within the bohemian milieu of Paris in the 1910s, they were “a feral, wayward pair”. The gallery notes: “He lived in a haze of intoxication – absinthe, wine, hashish – and would dance on tabletops, howl out lines of Italian verse, and rampage through the streets at night. She had as many faces as voices. Modigliani’s portraits together convey a shape-shifting, highly volatile nature.” One contemporary described her as “an hysteric … intoxicated from nine o’clock on” and “infatuated with Modigliani”, adding: “There were frightful scenes of jealousy. They drank together, they fought, they beat each other.” Hastings described one of their fights: “We had a royal battle, 10 times up and down the house, he armed with a pot and me with a long straw brush …” But she added: “How happy I was!” The hidden portrait emerged during a technical research study. Museums and art historians worldwide are collaborating on a project initiated by the Tate n preparation for its current exhibition on Modigliani at Tate Modern until 2 April. It is among initial findings to be published this week in the Burlington magazine. In studying Modigliani’s materials and methods, museums and galleries have examined artworks with x-radiography, among other techniques. Modigliani has been described as one of the world’s most faked artists. Last year, an exhibition at the Palazzo Ducale, in Genoa, closed early after Italian prosecutors alleged that 21 of some 60 works were possible fakes. The latest scientific testing determines details such as the pigments and canvases used, which has helped to establish precisely what makes up an authentic Modigliani work. The new project paints “a far bigger picture”, scholars write in the Burlington: “The need for a better understanding of Modigliani as a practitioner is clear, not only because of the controversy that surrounds the question of autograph works, but also, and most importantly, because of the lack of technical research into his accepted œuvre.” The definitive study of Modigliani’s work is a 1970 catalogue raisonné, which is now widely accepted as being out of date. Kenneth Wayne, a leading Modigliani scholar, is leading a project to publish a new inventory. Up to 60 new works were likely to be added, he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/15/can-we-fix-it-the-repair-cafes-waging-war-on-throwaway-culture","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-15T06:00:16Z","webTitle":"Can we fix it?

This is the Reading Repair Cafe, part of a burgeoning international network aimed at confronting a world of stuff, of white goods littering dumps in west Africa and trash swilling through the oceans in huge gyres. The hair clippers belong to William, who does not want to give his surname but cheerfully describes himself as “mechanically incompetent”. He has owned them for 25 years, but 10 years ago they stopped working and they have been sitting unused in his cupboard ever since. He sits down at the table of Colin Haycock, an IT professional who volunteers at the repair cafe, which has been running monthly for about four years and is a place where people can bring all manner of household items to be fixed for free. In less than five minutes, Haycock has unscrewed and removed the blades, cleaned out some gunk from inside the machine, oiled the blades, and screwed it all back together. The clippers purr happily. William looks sheepish; Haycock looks pleased. “I wish they were all that simple,” he says. Today, the repairers will divert 24kg of waste from going to landfill and save 284kg of CO2. Some items can’t be fixed on the spot – notably a hunting horn split in two, which requires soldering with a blow torch – but very little needs to be thrown away. Gabrielle Stanley, who used to run a clothing alterations business, says she was drawn to volunteering at the repair cafe to combat the “throwaway culture” she sees. “You go into certain stores...” - she throws a dark look - “how they can sell clothes for that price, when I couldn’t even buy the fabric for that much? And then you hear about things that happen [in the factories] in the far east.” An estimated 300,000 tonnes of clothing was sent to landfill in the UK in 2016 and a report from Wrap puts the average lifespan for a piece of clothing in the UK at 3.3 years. Globally, the amount of e-waste generated is expected to hit 50m tonnes by the end of 2018. This is partly driven by consumers’ eagerness for new products, but there are also concerns about built-in obsolescence, in which manufacturers design products to break down after a certain amount of time and are often difficult or expensive to fix. In December, Apple admitted to slowing older models of phones, though it claimed it did this for operational not obsolescence reasons. Repair cafe volunteer Stuart Ward says that when fixing items is actively discouraged by manufacturers, repair becomes a political act. He is vehement about the “right to repair”, a movement opposed to the practices of companies like the machinery company John Deere, which, under copyright laws, doesn’t allow people to fix their own equipment or take them to independent repairers. “You own your equipment, you’re allowed to take a screwdriver to it and play with it,” he says. “It’s something fundamental.” Teaching people how to fix their own gear is at the heart of the Edinburgh Remakery, a store on the main street of Leith that is part repair shop, part secondhand store, part repair education centre. “We do the repair in front of a customer, not out in the back, not hidden,” says Sotiris Katsimbas, the lead IT technician at the Remakery. To do this, Katsimbas and his team conduct one-to-one IT repair appointments for a small fee, as do their colleagues who specialise in sewing and furniture repairs. “It’s a matter of confidence. It’s not magic. Someone put it together, someone can take it apart, you only need a Phillips screwdriver and some knowledge,” says Katsimbas as he shows Daniel Turner how to open up his laptop so he can clean out the fluff and dust that is causing the machine to overheat. Since it opened in 2012, the Remakery has diverted 205 tonnes of waste that would have ended up in landfill. But the Remakery is unique in that, unlike much of the repair movement, which is volunteer-led, it is a viable business, employing 11 staff and 10 freelancers. Last year the shop had an income of £236,000 – 30% from grants, 70% generated through sales of furniture and electronics, workshops and repair appointments. The financial viability of the shop makes it attractive as a model. In the last year, Sophie Unwin, the co-founder of the Remakery in Brixton and the founder of Edinburgh Remakery is setting up the Remakery network to replicate the work internationally. She has had 53 inquiries from groups interested in setting up similar enterprises in the US, New Zealand, Canada, South Korea, Austria, Ireland, Germany, Australia and elsewhere in the UK. The network will provide toolkits and advice to groups who want to recreate what she has done in Edinburgh. Unwin hopes that these resources will allow other groups to do in two years what it has taken eight years of trial and error and extremely hard graft to achieve. For repairers, fixing things is a way of doing something about an obsession with consumerism that Unwin calls “a kind of sickness in society”. “This is our little attempt to push a little bit in this direction,” says Ward. “To say, we can fix this, we can repair things, don’t give up hope.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

The Treasury select committee, which last week published a full report into the GRG scandal, said 136 of 182 employees at the current restructuring business and 30 out of 32 senior managers came from GRG. At a select committee hearing in January, the RBS chief executive, Ross McEwan, said he believed only two senior managers had come from GRG, including the head of restructuring, Laura Barlow. RBS now says this comment referred to only the most senior management grade. Nicky Morgan, the chair of the committee, said: “Mr McEwan has assured the committee that the culture at RBS Restructuring is fundamentally different from that of GRG. “The discovery that almost all the senior management in the new unit previously worked at GRG raises concerns that there has merely been a rebranding exercise. “I have asked Mr McEwan to set out how the training programme and performance objectives of these staff have been developed to address the toxic culture described in [last week’s] report.” The bank has so far paid £1m in claims to GRG’s victims, and expects that to rise to £5m, according to a letter from McEwan to the committee. Morgan said the payments so far were surprisingly low. She added: “There remains a substantial sum of money – up to £280m – within RBS’s earmarked budget for its complaints process, which could be paid out under consequential losses. “Mr McEwan has acknowledged that consequential loss is often far greater than direct loss. To provide confidence that fair and reasonable compensation is being provided, decisions on consequential loss must be subject to independent oversight. RBS shouldn’t be marking its own homework.” Last week’s report, commissioned by the City watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority, concluded that the behaviour of GRG staff was “endemic” and that managers ought to have been aware of the damage that was being done to small businesses. The Treasury committee labelled RBS GRG’s behaviour as “disgraceful”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/feb/27/leicester-explosion-rescue-continue-search-trapped-survivors","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-27T11:56:27Z","webTitle":"Leicester explosion: police name five missing people","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/feb/27/leicester-explosion-rescue-continue-search-trapped-survivors","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/feb/27/leicester-explosion-rescue-continue-search-trapped-survivors","fields":{"headline":"Leicester explosion: police name five missing people","bodyText":"Police have named five people who are missing after the explosion that destroyed a building in Leicester on Sunday night. They said on Tuesday that human remains had been recovered from the wreckage but given the devastation caused by the blast and subsequent fire it could take some time before the victims were formally identified. The missing include three members of the same family, Mary Ragoobeer, 46, and her two sons, Shane, 18, and Sean, 17, who lived in the flat above the Polish supermarket in the building flattened by the explosion. Shane’s girlfriend, Leah Beth Reek, 18, and 22-year-old Viktorija Ljevleva, who was working in the supermarket at the time of the explosion, are also missing. The rescue operation continued on Tuesday, as did efforts to establish what caused the blast. Leicestershire police said the relatives of all five missing people had been informed and were being supported by specially trained officers. One of the five people taken to hospital on Sunday night after the incident remained in hospital with life-threatening injuries, they added. Ragoobeer’s youngest son, Scotty, 15, was taken to hospital but his injuries were not serious, according to his uncle Krishna Rungen. Scotty’s father, Jose Ragoobeer, was at work at the time of the blast. “Scotty said the family were watching television when the next thing he knew, everything went black and there were bricks flying around him,” said Rungen. The 69-year-old, who said he was supposed to be going on holiday with his sister and her family in April, has been a regular visitor to the site of the explosion since Sunday, trying to find out information about his missing relatives. He said he was devastated by the thought that his sister and two of her sons could be among the dead. The owner of Zabka, the Polish supermarket, which opened in December, told ITV he had gone into the storeroom to get drinks for himself and Ljevleva when he heard a loud bang. He managed to escape but had not seen Ljevleva, who had only recently started work there, since. Police said the rescue operation was being complicated by expected heavy snowfall and as a result they expected Hinckley Road to remain closed for all or most of Tuesday. At a community meeting on Monday night, Matt Cane, the group manager for Leicestershire fire and rescue service, said the search was “dynamic and challenging”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2018/feb/27/harold-and-maude-charing-cross-theatre-review-sheila-hancock","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-27T12:30:49Z","webTitle":"Harold and Maude review – a honking seal can't save this clunky adaptation","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/feb/27/harold-and-maude-charing-cross-theatre-review-sheila-hancock","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/feb/27/harold-and-maude-charing-cross-theatre-review-sheila-hancock","fields":{"headline":"Harold and Maude review – a honking seal can't save this clunky adaptation","bodyText":"‘I can never understand someone refusing an experience,” chirps 79-year-old Maude, played by Sheila Hancock in this stage version of Hal Ashby’s 1971 movie. Maude is a woman who turns every day into an adventure, one that might include climbing trees, a little car theft or liberating a seal from the zoo. But Thom Southerland’s staging of a clunky stage version by Colin Higgins (adapted by Higgins from his own screenplay) may be one experience that even the indefatigable Maude would take a pass on – although I would defy anyone not to enjoy the honking seal. The story is about a rich unhappy teenager, Harold, with a death fixation and a passion for funerals, who is taught to live by the elderly Maude, who is facing up to her own mortality. Ashby’s movie was panned on its release (Variety dismissed it as having “all the fun of a burning orphanage”), but its dark, surreal humour has turned it into a cult classic that regularly features on cinephiles’ best-of lists. Its off-the-wall macabre comedy, which features Harold continuously trying to fake his death through decapitation, gunshot and noose to capture the attention of his distracted mother, was too much for some 1970s tastes. But that humour may now prove too tame for contemporary audiences weaned on Lynchian strangeness and the twisted, surreal visions of Charlie Brooker. This adaptation feels dated rather than retro – despite Jonathan Lipman’s spot-on costumes. It doesn’t help that the whole thing tries to walk a thin line between the quirky and creepy, the funny and fey – and often stumbles. And, for a play about love, it remains oddly coy about the burgeoning relationship between a younger man and older woman. Some things, though, do work well. Francis O’Connor’s design, in which the sky with its scudding clouds meets the suburban American living room, has a touch of Magritte about it. Composer Michael Bruce’s score boasts a jaunty wit, and it’s a nice touch to have it played live by the actor-musician cast. The way a musical instrument is used to stand in for a voice at the end of the phone is neatly done and comically revealing of Rebecca Caine’s self-obsessed mother, more concerned about her daffodils than her son. It’s not Hancock’s fault that her character, Maude, is largely a walking, talking new-age self-help book dispensing the kind of advice found in fortune cookies: “Try something new”; “How the world loves a cage”; “It’s best not to be too moral – it cheats you out of life.” Hancock is mostly charming, and is bold enough to occasionally risk being irritating. But with so thin a script she can only hint at a more tragic past and a woman whose carpe diem approach to life may stem from her experiences in the second world war. Bill Milner as Harold turns blankness into an art form – and I mean that as a compliment. He captures all the stiff, buttoned-up emotional repression of a teenager denied affection who sees faking suicide as the only way to get the attention he craves. He blooms like a sunflower turning its face to the warmth under Maude’s tutelage. If only the rest of the evening bloomed, too. • At Charing Cross theatre, London, until 31 March.

Jon Lansman, the founder of Momentum, has told friends he is considering a bid to replace Iain McNicol, who is standing down, and is expected to announce his intentions on Tuesday. Senior sources at the leftwing group, which has been a key backer of Jeremy Corbyn, said there was dissatisfaction that unions could in effect decide between themselves who would secure the position. A source close to Lansman said: “If he runs, it’ll be to ensure the members get an open contest rather than an anointed successor. If we’re trying to build a social movement-style party that can transform Britain, backroom deals are just not the way to go.” The source said Lansman would be a “unity candidate”. “He’s the only candidate who is both in touch with the membership and able to work with all the different unions that sit on the NEC [national executive committee].” Corbyn and the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, have so far supported Jennie Formby, a Unite official, to replace McNicol when his departure is agreed. If Lansman’s run is confirmed, the battle for the position will expose a faultline which has been quietly growing on the left of the party between Momentum’s desire to see Labour transformed into a member-led movement and the unions’ desire to tighten control on its key offices. Lansman, a veteran of the Labour left and close friend of Corbyn, is also set to urge the leadership to allow more involvement from members in approving the appointment of the next general secretary, though he is unlikely to suggest the position is elected. Such a change would be likely to require a rule change at the next annual conference. The general secretary position, one of the most powerful in the party, is decided via an application process to the NEC, which has agreed to a fast-track process which will fill the position by 20 March. Many in the party believe McNicol’s replacement should be a woman, given men hold most key positions, including those of the leader, deputy leader, shadow chancellor and leaders of its Welsh and Scottish parties. Applications opened on Tuesday. Formby is the first to have formally announced her candidacy, saying the party was “now united as it has not been for years under Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership”. In a statement, Formby stressed her experience as a member of the NEC and a senior Unite official in industrial, political and administrative posts. “I will work with all parts of the movement to ensure that the party democracy review empowers the party membership, opens up policymaking, and ensures democratic best practice throughout,” she said. “I will ensure our exciting new community-organising initiative is developed to help entrench Labour in the communities we serve and win the seats we need at the next general election.” Formby said she would stand up to antisemitism, racism and abuse in the party and would be proud to be the first woman in a generation to serve as general secretary, the second in Labour history. “I have fought for gender equality – often the hard way – throughout my lifetime in the labour movement,” she said. “Labour has only one objective – to bring to Britain the socialist change it desperately needs. And it has only one means of delivering that – electoral victory at all levels, and above all in a general election. As general secretary, I will devote all my time and energy to ensuring that we grasp the historic opportunity before us.” Others tipped for the position are the GMB political officer Lisa Johnson and Unite’s political director, Anneliese Midgley. Johnson, a potential compromise candidate, has told friends she is happy to remain in her role, but could be persuaded to stand. A senior NEC source said the support of the GMB union was key to whoever succeeded McNicol. “If GMB decided to back Jennie, she will get it. If they don’t, then it might be a compromise candidate. All of these candidates are experienced and from the left of the party. It would be really good to have a woman in the role.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/feb/27/50-cent-denies-reports-he-is-a-bitcoin-millionaire","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-27T11:00:00Z","webTitle":"50 Cent denies reports he is a bitcoin millionaire","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/feb/27/50-cent-denies-reports-he-is-a-bitcoin-millionaire","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/feb/27/50-cent-denies-reports-he-is-a-bitcoin-millionaire","fields":{"headline":"50 Cent denies reports he is a bitcoin millionaire","bodyText":"Rapper 50 Cent, AKA Curtis Jackson, has denied he is a bitcoin millionaire, after earlier reports stated he had around $8m in bitcoin earnings he had forgotten about. In 2014, he allowed fans to purchase his album Animal Ambition using the cryptocurrency. Earlier this year, the website TMZ reported that Jackson had earned around $400,000 of bitcoin from the transactions, but had forgotten about them, and his account was dormant. TMZ suggested that, with the recent spike in the value of bitcoin, Jackson had multiplied his initial stake many times over. In January, the rapper quoted the report on Instagram and wrote: “Not bad for a kid from south side, I’m so proud of me.” He added: “I’m a keep it real I forgot I did that shit.” In new court documents amid Jackson’s lengthy bankruptcy case, he has denied the reports. “The limited bitcoin transactions that occurred online were processed and converted to US dollars contemporaneously,” the documents state, suggesting that just a few thousand dollars were earned via the bitcoin transactions. Jackson has said that stories about his apparent bitcoin windfall were false. He reasoned, however, that: “So long as a press story is not irreparably damaging to my image or brand I usually do not feel the need to publicly deny the reporting. This is particularly true when I feel the press report in question is favourable to my image or brand, even if the report is based on a misunderstanding of the facts or contains outright falsehoods.” Jackson emerged from bankruptcy in February 2017, but certain details of his case continue to be ironed out, including ongoing disputes with Dorothy DeJesus and Candace Scott, who were injured after Jackson was involved in a brawl with audience members at a 2004 concert."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2018/feb/27/xi-jinping-what-is-behind-the-chinese-presidents-power-grab","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-27T10:05:12Z","webTitle":"Xi Jinping: what is behind the Chinese president’s power grab?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/27/xi-jinping-what-is-behind-the-chinese-presidents-power-grab","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/feb/27/xi-jinping-what-is-behind-the-chinese-presidents-power-grab","fields":{"headline":"Xi Jinping: what is behind the Chinese president’s power grab?","bodyText":"What’s Xi up to? By moving to abolish presidential term limits this week, Xi Jinping has obliterated any lingering doubts over his desire to remain China’s “unrivalled helmsman” for many years to come. “Unless he’s deposed, we’ve got this guy for the rest of our functional lives,” predicts Orville Schell, who has been writing books on Chinese politics for more than four decades. Why does Xi want to stay in power? The obvious explanation is his apparent conviction that he, and only he, can make the ideologically lax, corruption-riddled Communist party – and China – great again. Xi took power in 2012 vowing to restore the Middle Kingdom to its rightful place at the centre of world affairs; last year he declared the advent of “a new era” of global Chinese might. He seems determined to see that project through. But Xi’s resolve to remain may also be about self-preservation. He has purged, humiliated and jailed so many powerful foes that China’s best-known political prison is reportedly packed to the rafters. He may see everlasting power as the only way to prevent vengeful rivals one day condemning him to a similar fate. “The fear would be that potentially, if his reign doesn’t continue, people would try to settle scores,” says Carl Minzner, the author of a new book on China’s “authoritarian revival”. Are there upsides to China’s tack towards one-man rule? Possibly, depending on how much you value freedom. Some argue Xi’s supremacy will give him the authority he needs to vanquish rampant corruption and push through painful economic reforms. Others say it could benefit the rural poor, whose cause China’s populist leader has championed. With a climate sceptic occupying the White House, there are even those who hope Xi will emerge as the world’s most despotic eco-warrior, a tree-hugging tyrant willing to use his authoritarian powers to save the planet. “If you postulate that the world needs leadership, that America is in disarray and that Europe is a dish of loose sand, then maybe Chinese leadership has some virtues, particularly in areas like nuclear proliferation, climate change [and] pandemics,” says Schell. “Whatever you may think of his authoritarian kind of leadership, at least he can lead.” What are the dangers? For dissidents and liberals, already smarting from the harshest political crackdown in decades, the extension of Xi’s shelf-life is a nightmare. Qiao Mu, an exiled academic, said Xi’s move condemned refuseniks to a life of “darkness and fear”. But some also warn of calamitous consequences for the country as a whole, with contemporary Chinese history offering a potent lesson in the perils of one-man rule. Mao’s deranged push for industrialisation condemned tens of millions to their death during the Great Famine. A decade later, the Cultural Revolution turned China on its head and devastated the economy. Minzner is among those who fears a return to an era of “purges, political turmoil, and the writ of one man over everything”. Under Mao, Chinese politics was “like blood sport, where you really didn’t know what could happen to key people within the system from day to day”, he recalled, adding: “We had thought China was moving away from that.” James Palmer, the author of The Death of Mao, said he also feared China would pay a heavy price for its sharp regression into “full-blown dictatorship”. “With power now concentrated in a single man, and with nobody willing to challenge him, the likelihood of calamitous mistakes has soared,” he warned in Foreign Policy. So why hasn’t the international community condemned Xi’s power grab? The lack of censure is probably in part the result of the west’s growing nervousness about upsetting an ever more powerful and prickly China for fear of hurting economic ties. Minzner believes it also highlights the low regard in which most western governments already hold Beijing. “It would be different if some sort of democratic state cancelled elections [but] China was an authoritarian state to begin with, so there weren’t necessarily high expectations,” he says. A third explanation, however, may be the global ascendancy of authoritarian regimes from Moscow to Manila. “When the high school history books are written, this is not going to be the Age of Enlightenment ... it will be the Age of the Big Leader,” says Schell. Seen through that prism, Xi’s confirmation as the strongest of the 21st century’s strongmen looks less like an aberration and more like a mode."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/feb/28/one-in-six-australian-women-suffer-physical-or-sexual-abuse-from-partner","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-27T17:00:07Z","webTitle":"One in six Australian women suffer physical or sexual abuse from partner","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/feb/28/one-in-six-australian-women-suffer-physical-or-sexual-abuse-from-partner","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/feb/28/one-in-six-australian-women-suffer-physical-or-sexual-abuse-from-partner","fields":{"headline":"One in six Australian women suffer physical or sexual abuse from partner","bodyText":"One in six Australian women have experienced physical or sexual violence from a current or former partner, a new report has found. The research, released on Wednesday by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, paints a damning picture of the extent of physical and sexual violence in Australia. The report confirms violence is committed disproportionately against women. One woman was killed every week at the hands of a partner or former partner in 2012–13 and 2013–14, compared with one a month for men. One in six women have suffered family violence, physical or sexual, at the hands of a former and current partner whom they lived with since the age of 15. The White Ribbon chief executive officer, Libby Davies, described the findings as “devastating”, but said “sadly it is not surprising”. “Disrespect and violence against women is pervasive in our community and needs to be addressed as a national priority,” Davies told Guardian Australia. “This figure also underlines the significant investment needed by governments, business and community to reverse this trend immediately.” More than half of women who have experienced family violence do so repeatedly. About eight women and two men a day were hospitalised due to family violence on average in 2014-15. Police record an average of 52 sexual assaults against women every day. Some groups were found to be highly vulnerable. Indigenous Australians were far more likely to be affected by family violence, as were young women, pregnant women, women experiencing financial difficulty, and women with a disability. Indigenous women were killed more often in family violence, and were 32 times more likely than non-Indigenous women to be hospitalised. There were also clear intergenerational links identified in the research. Boys and girls who witnessed domestic violence before they turned 15 were more at risk of family violence later in life. About 2.1 million had witnessed violence towards their mother by a partner, and 820,000 towards their father, the report found. Those children were then two to four times more likely to experience partner violence themselves as adults. The cost of family violence to the nation is enormous, the report found. In 2015–16, violence against women and their children was estimated at $22bn. That includes direct costs like healthcare, counselling, and child and welfare support, and indirect costs such as lost wages, productivity, and potential earnings. AIHW spokeswoman Louise York said the impact of family violence on individuals was profound. It is the leading cause of homelessness, and causes more illness, disability and deaths than any other risk factor for women aged 25 to 44. “People who experience domestic violence are likely to need time off work as a result, and women affected by domestic violence experience significantly poorer health and mental health than other women,” York said. The report found significant gaps in the available data on family violence. The institute warned there was insufficient data on children’s experiences of family violence, and the impact on at-risk groups, including Indigenous Australians and the LGBTIQ community. Little is also known about the effect of key risk factors, like socioeconomic status, employment, income, and geographical location. The institute’s chief executive officer, Barry Sandison, said a “comprehensive source of evidence and analysis” was crucial to addressing the complex issue of family violence. “It’s important to note that, while looking only at the numbers can at times appear to depersonalise the pain and suffering that sits behind the statistics, the seriousness of these issues cannot be overstated,” Sandison said. White Ribbon said more coordinated investment was needed in frontline services and primary prevention programs. “We will continue to advocate to the government to put in place more resources and funding to tackle one the of Australia’s critical social issues,” Davies said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/feb/27/uk-economy-at-risk-outside-single-market-warns-former-trade-chief","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-27T08:44:53Z","webTitle":"Leaving single market 'like swapping a meal for a packet of crisps', warns ex-trade chief","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/feb/27/uk-economy-at-risk-outside-single-market-warns-former-trade-chief","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/feb/27/uk-economy-at-risk-outside-single-market-warns-former-trade-chief","fields":{"headline":"Leaving single market 'like swapping a meal for a packet of crisps', warns ex-trade chief","bodyText":"The former boss of Liam Fox’s international trade department has warned that life outside the EU single market is like swapping a three-course meal for a packet of crisps. In an intervention that could overshadow the international trade secretary’s speech on Tuesday, Sir Martin Donnelly said Britain faced a direct threat to its status as a leading service economy if it did not pursue close alignment with EU single market rules. Donnelly, who will give a speech on the subject on Tuesday evening, hours after Fox’s own speech laying out the case for leaving the single market and customs union, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme the UK risked being shut out entirely from its biggest market. “You’re giving up a three-course meal, the depth and intensity of our trade relationship across the European Union and partners now, for the promise of a packet of crisps in the future, if we manage to do trade deals in the future outside the EU which aren’t going to compensate for what we’re giving up,” he said. Donnelly, who was permanent secretary at the international trade department until last year, said the EU was “the only functioning market for services in the world” and key to Britain’s prosperity as an advanced service economy. “We risk losing that level playing field or being shut out entirely and we have got to look at how this really works in practice,” he said. “The challenge if we choose not to stay in the single market, is can we negotiate equal access in all those areas of services without agreeing to obey the same rules as everybody else? “I’m afraid I think that’s not a negotiation, that is something for a fairy godmother. It’s not going to happen.” Donnelly, a former Treasury adviser, said his advice could not be written off as pessimism from a Europhile mandarin, as ministers have attempted to do in the past. “We really have to focus on the realities of Brexit and the choices we’ve got ahead of us. If we leave the customs union and the single market, we are taking away the access that we’ve got to 60% of our trade, nearly half with the EU and the other 12% through EU preferential trade deals.”In his speech later, Donnelly is expected to pour scorn on the phrase “frictionless trade”, which ministers have said they want to have with the EU and third countries. “Having our cake and eating it is not an option in the real world; ‘frictionless trade’ is a phrase without legal content,” he will say, according to Politico. “Given the negative consequences of leaving, and the lack of any significant offsetting advantages, I believe it is likely the UK will seek to return to full membership of the EU single market in due course. But significant damage to employment, the structure of the economy and the competitiveness of UK firms can be expected in the meantime.” In his speech at lunchtime, Fox will say remaining in a customs union with the EU post-Brexit would leave Britain in a worse position than now, calling the prospect “a sellout of Britain’s national interests”. Flexibility will be key to any future trade policy, he will say. “We will consider multi-country alliances of the like-minded right down to bilateral arrangements,” he will say. “To do this, we need the ability to exercise a fully independent trade policy.” Agreeing to remain in a customs union with the EU would make Britain an unattractive trading partner and prevent future trade deals with non-EU nations. “As rule takers, without any say in how the rules were made, we would be in a worse position than we are today. It would be a complete sellout of Britain’s national interests.” The speech follows confirmation by the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, that it would seek “a new, comprehensive UK-EU customs union” after Brexit, opening a path for Labour to formally back a joint backbench Labour-Tory amendment to the forthcoming trade bill on the customs union. The foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, said Donnelly’s words were a “counsel of despair” and did not take into account the future demand for British services outside the EU. “I dissent very strongly from what he says. If you look at the real growth opportunities for this country, they are not in the EU … The great potential is in services and that is one of the things we have got to emphasise, data, banking, financial services. To say the world has exhausted its appetite for British-led services is absolutely a counsel of despair, the market is insatiable. It’s our capacity to supply that is the issue.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/feb/27/armidale-relocation-advisers-hotel-barnaby-joyce-friend","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-27T08:34:59Z","webTitle":"Armidale relocation: Canberra advisers stayed at hotel of Barnaby Joyce friend","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/feb/27/armidale-relocation-advisers-hotel-barnaby-joyce-friend","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/feb/27/armidale-relocation-advisers-hotel-barnaby-joyce-friend","fields":{"headline":"Armidale relocation: Canberra advisers stayed at hotel of Barnaby Joyce friend","bodyText":"The committee responsible for the relocation of the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Agency (APVMA) to Armidale held two meetings at the hotel owned by Greg Maguire, the man who provided a rent-free apartment to Barnaby Joyce and his partner Vikki Campion, Senate estimates heard today. APVMA chief executive Dr Chris Parker faced sustained questioning over the relocation and whether there were any benefits flowing to Joyce’s benefactor, who is the owner of the largest hotel in Armidale, the Powerhouse. Joyce’s decision to accept free rent on an Armidale town house from his friend Maguire after the breakdown of his marriage to his wife, Natalie, came under intense scrutiny until he resigned as deputy prime minister last week. Joyce’s 2016 decision to relocate the APVMA has also proved controversial with the organisation suffering an exodus of staff, including its former chief executive after the order to relocate. Parker declined to answer questions on who would develop the new offices for the AVPMA in Armidale, saying the organisation was in final negotiations with a preferred tenderer. An announcement is expected in two weeks, he said. Three sites have been identified. None appear to be linked with Greg Maguire. However Parker confirmed the committee advising on the relocation of the agency had held two meetings and stayed at the Powerhouse Hotel, including holding a reception for stakeholders at one. He has undertaken to provide more information on spending by staff on accommodation at the hotel. The Guardian was told by APVMA that staff had spent $14,700 on accommodation at the Powerhouse to date. Senate estimates was told 42 staff had left in the 2016-17 financial year and that “the majority” had left because they did not want to relocate. But Parker said the organisation was making progress on the move. He said there were currently 15 staff in the Armidale office who were working in the temporary office or working off site under e-working arrangements. Ultimately the organisation aims to have 150 staff in Armidale. So far only three staff have relocated from Canberra to Armidale, despite an incentive of up to $55,000 which will be paid towards costs of relocation. Senators were particularly concerned about the loss of scientists from the APVMA. Parker said there were 92 scientific positions and these were fully staffed. But so far only two regulatory scientists have moved to Armidale from Canberra and “half a dozen or so” had been recruited to work in Armidale. Nine scientists have resigned but more are expected to leave rather than relocate. The agency is conducting a survey to understand the staff intentions, Parker said. Asked whether it would be more sensible to have some scientific staff located in Canberra, Parker replied: “My responsibility is to implement the government policy order,” he said. Parker said he was being paid up to $32,000 a year toward his accommodation costs for the next two years in Armidale in order to run the organisation over two locations. “ I live in both places,” he said, adding that he was not being paid any travel allowances. The move to Armidale, which was directed by Joyce when he was agriculture minister, has also added to the financial pressures on the APVMA, which has run at a loss for the past three years. The organisation is required to raise about 85% of its budget from fees charged to industry."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2018/feb/27/comcast-murdoch-bid-sky-21st-century-fox","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-27T09:34:42Z","webTitle":"Comcast challenges Murdoch with £22bn bid for Sky","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/feb/27/comcast-murdoch-bid-sky-21st-century-fox","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2018/feb/27/comcast-murdoch-bid-sky-21st-century-fox","fields":{"headline":"Comcast challenges Murdoch with £22bn bid for Sky","bodyText":"Comcast is attempting to gatecrash Rupert Murdoch’s takeover of Sky, submitting a rival offer to the UK broadcaster’s shareholders worth about £22bn. The media and telecoms company, which owns NBC Universal and is the largest cable operator in the US, said its all-cash offer of £12.50 a share represented a 16% premium for Sky shareholders on the offer from Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox. Fox owns 39% of Sky and submitted its bid to take full control in December 2016, but the deal has been held up by regulatory issues. Comcast has reportedly been exploring a bid for 21st Century Fox’s entertainment assets, which include Sky and the 20th Century Fox film studio, since the company agreed a $66bn (£47bn) sale to its US rival Disney. The company, which has 1,300 employees in the UK including the production company behind Downton Abbey, promised that Sky’s headquarters would remain at Osterley in south-west London. “Comcast intends to use Sky as a platform for growth in Europe. We already have a strong presence in London through our NBC Universal international operations, and we intend to maintain Sky’s UK headquarters,” the company’s chairman and chief executive, Brian Roberts, said. “Adding Sky to the Comcast family of businesses will increase our international revenues from 9% to 25% of company revenues. “We would like to own the whole of Sky and we will be looking to acquire over 50% of the Sky shares. We are confident that we will be able to receive the necessary regulatory approvals.” Comcast would need approval from 82% of Sky’s non-Fox shareholders to achieve a 50% controlling stake. Sky’s share price surged by 18% in early trading on Tuesday after Comcast’s announcement to more than £13. This is well above both the £12.50 a share Comcast offer and Fox’s initial £10.75 bid, suggesting investors believe Murdoch will make an improved offer to keep his Sky takeover on track. Following Sky’s £3.57bn deal to secure the lion’s share of the Premier League rights at a 14% discount earlier this month, investors have already called for an increase of between 10% and 25%, up to £13.40 a share. Fox investors similarly believe Disney should also be paying more. “To avoid the risk of shareholder holdouts, Comcast’s offer needs to be seen as a knockout/full and final offer, as any hint that it would pay more to squeeze out further down the line could result in under 50% acceptances,” said Wilton Fry, an analyst at RBC Europe. “In our view, Fox will need to counter bid if it wants its offer to gain approval. The ‘wild card’ is whether Disney could make its own direct offer. We believe this unlikely as it is already bidding for Fox’s legacy assets.” 21st Century Fox said said in a statement that it remained committed to its December offer and noted that “no firm offer has been made by Comcast at this point … a further statement will be made as appropriate”. Murdoch’s protracted bid to take full control of Sky remains mired in regulatory red tape. The UK competition regulator has said the bid raises media plurality concerns because taking full control of Sky News would give Murdoch’s family too much control over UK news media. The family trust controls Fox and News Corp, the publisher of the Sun and the Times. Murdoch has offered to strengthen the independence of Sky News and fund it for 10 years to get approval for the takeover. Sky has previously told the Competition and Markets Authority that it could close Sky News if the deal is not cleared, which would eliminate the media plurality issue at a stroke. Comcast, which owns the MSNBC and CBNC news networks, said it did not foresee any media plurality or regulatory issues and has pledged to keep Sky News. “Sky News is an invaluable part of the UK news landscape,” Comcast said. “The company intends to maintain Sky News’s existing brand and culture, as well as its strong track record for high-quality impartial news and adherence to broadcasting standards.” Tom Watson, the shadow culture and media secretary, said that any Comcast deal would need to be very carefully scrutinised on plurality and broadcasting standards grounds. “Comcast must demonstrate its commitment to plurality by guaranteeing a properly funded Sky News for at least a decade as a key condition of the sale,” he said. Disney has signalled to the UK’s Panel on Takeovers and Mergers that if Fox’s deal to take full control of Sky fails, it does not wish to be forced to pursue a full takeover. Comcast is one of the world’s largest media and telecoms companies, with revenues of $84.5bn in 2017. The company’s US cable business, Xfinity, accounted for $52.5bn of those revenues with its TV, broadband and phone services. It has about 25 million high-speed internet customers. Comcast moved into broadcasting and film in 2011 with the acquisition of NBC Universal, the owner of the US TV network and Hollywood film studio behind Jurassic World and the Fast and Furious franchise. The company has said it will increase Sky’s spending on original shows such as Riviera and Fortitude. NBC Universal has spent more than $1bn on TV and film productions in the UK over the last three years. It owns Carnival Films, the UK production company behind Downton Abbey and The Last Kingdom; the Made in Chelsea producer, Monkey; and Working Title, the British film producer responsible for Four Weddings and a Funeral, Baby Driver and Darkest Hour. It also owns cable channels including Syfy and E!. “We hold the management of Sky in high regard and would welcome the opportunity to meet with them and the independent directors of Sky to discuss our plans for the business,” said Roberts. “In due course, we very much hope that the independent directors will recommend our proposal.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/live/2018/feb/27/comcast-murdoch-sky-takeover-bid-jerome-powell-fed-congress-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-27T18:09:44Z","webTitle":"Sky takeover: bidding war predicted as Comcast makes £22bn offer - as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2018/feb/27/comcast-murdoch-sky-takeover-bid-jerome-powell-fed-congress-business-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2018/feb/27/comcast-murdoch-sky-takeover-bid-jerome-powell-fed-congress-business-live","fields":{"headline":"Sky takeover: bidding war predicted as Comcast makes £22bn offer - as it happened","bodyText":"A late update: Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox have - finally - responded to Comcast’s offer. Fox says: New York, NY, February 27, 2018 - 21st Century Fox (“21CF”) notes the possible offer announcement made by Comcast Corporation (“Comcast”) for Sky plc (“Sky”). 21CF remains committed to its recommended cash offer for Sky announced on 15th December 2016. We note that no firm offer has been made by Comcast at this point. A further statement will be made if appropriate. Hints from new Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell that there could be four rather than three US rate rises this year have pushed up the dollar and left stock markets flagging. Despite Sky closing 20% higher at £13.31 - above the bid price from US group Comcast - the FTSE 100 ended in negative territory. European markets also ended the day marginally lower. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 7.13 points or 0.1% lower at 7282.45 Germany’s Dax dipped 0.29% to 12,490.73 France’s Cac closed down 0.01% at 5343.93 Italy’s FTSE MIB bucked the trend, up 0.08% at 22,724.46 Spain’s Ibex ended down 0.02% at 9900.2 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 21 points or 0.09%. On that note, it’s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we’ll be back tomorrow. Republican Claudia Tenney asks about more transparency during the blackout period around meetings. Powell says, I would have to look at what you’re proposing. The blackout gives us a chance to do our thinking and come out and make an announcement, then after a day or two people can make speeches. Generally it’s been seen as a good thing to step away for a period. Democrat Denny Heck asks when America will get a raise, saying 2.9% wage growth is well below historic averages. Powell says, in time wages should grow, but we really need to have more productivity. Republican Barry Loudermilk asks about what the Fed is doing on cyber security to protect its data. Powell says I’m going to put a high priority on it. We’ve done a good job but we can do better. Democrat Joyce Beatty asks if the stock market is an indicator for the economy. Powell says we don’t manage the stock market, it enters into our thinking, it’s not the economy but it plays a factor. Democrat Ruben Kihuen asks what Fed or congress can do to combat wage inequality? Powell says our part is to try and achieve maximum employment, which we are doing. The only way for wages to go up is for productivity to go up, which needs investment. Those are things congress and the administration would be well advised to focus on. Democrat Gwen Moore asks if inflation target should be say 2.5%. Powell says we are committed with a 2% goal, equally concerned about undershoots and overshoots. Moore asks about inequality in the US and brings up the tax reforms again. What concerns does the Fed have about income inequality. Powell says there has been a stagnation of middle class median incomes. We need to have a better trained workforce. Moore asks if we will have this tremendous GDP growth after tax cuts, or will it be under 1%. Powell says the tax bill and budget agreement came after the December meeting. There will be a meaningful increment in demand over next couple of years from these things. I expect wages to increase this year. Rothfus asked why is the inflation target 2%. Powell says it gives us more room for manoeuvre, in terms of cutting interest rates if necessary. It oils the wheels of the economy and gives us more ammunition. It has become the global standard and it would not be difficult for a central bank to move from it. Back on safer ground (probably) Republican Keith Rothfus says, there are four vacancies on Fed, can it fulfill its duties under those circumstances? Powell says he would like vacancies filled, We don’t need all seven [Fed members] immediately but would be good to have more faces on the hall. Here’s a tricky one for Powell. Democrat David Scott says Trump’s tax cuts help just 1%, budget cuts hit the Afro-American poor, there are changes to food stamp system. The Fed should get on our side. Trump is not on side of the American people. Powell hesitates. He says, these are very important issues, i take it to heart, but they are not issues we have authority over. Scott says he was waiting for that. He says, there is no one better suitied. When you sneeze, Wall street tumbles. I know you have a deep compassion for people. You should say, hold on Mr President, this isn’t right. Scotts time runs out before Powell can respond again. Democrat Stephen Lynch asks about whether the Fed is concerned about the risks of exchange traded funds [in the wake of recent market volatility] Powell says, the markets were generally orderly through the volatility, I don’t think etfs were at the heart of what went on. We are talking to other agencies, it’s a question to be looked into. Republican Frank Lucas asks about the outlook for the economy. Powell sayd, it does feel to me the next couple of years will be quite strong, should be good years for the economy and I would think should create a good environment. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, says: The new Fed chairman appears to have his feet firmly under the desk. Not only has he managed to send the dollar flying higher, unseating GBPUSD and EURUSD in impressive fashion, but he has added to this by boldly stating that QE remains a tool that will firmly remain in the Fed’s armoury. At a time when QE is coming under criticism again, his defence will be taken as a sign that the Fed has not abandoned this powerful weapon, tightening cycle or no tightening cycle. While equities wobbled as the Q&amp;A session developed, investors seem to have warmed to his tone and careful approach. This first date appears to be going well, with markets apparently content that Powell is firmly in the Bernanke/Yellen mould that they know so well, and isn’t about to rock the boat. Democrat Michael Capuano talks about the British ruling on the gender pay gap, and says there was a call for something similar in the US but the Trump administration stopped it. He says that is horrendous and for a fair economy, you need the numbers and the information for getting towards pay equity. Is the Fed interesting in pursuing some degree of investigation of how the financial institutions it oversees pay their employees. Powell says he is not familiar with these rules, this is for Congress. We have a job and we want to stick to that. I don’t think it’s a question for the Fed, it’s for others. Democrat Gregory Meeks asks how much of the corporate tax cuts will go to wages rather than stock buybacks or dividends? Powell says there are estimates out there but we don’t have a Fed estimate of that kind of thing. With the dollar rising and bond yields moving higher, equity markets are heading in the other direction. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is now down 78 points or 0.27%. Powell’s comments about the strengthening economy etc suggest he may be thinking of more than three rate rises this year, and the foreign exchange market thinks so, with the dollar gaining ground as he speaks. US bond yields are also rising, on the expectation of further interest rate rises. Carolyn Maloney asks, what would cause you to raise rates more than three times this year? Powell says at the December meeting, the median projection was three rises. There will be another projection in three weeks at the next meeting, but since [December] we have seen an increasing strengthening of the economy, inflation is moving to target, there is growth around the globe and fiscal policy has been more accommodative. He says, We will be reviewing our projections, [for the next meeting] and I would not want to prejudge it. Maloney asks, has the outlook changed in light of the tax reforms and the budget agreement? Powell says, my personal outlook for the economy has strengthened since December, we’ll be taking into account everything that’s happened since December. Republican Andy Barr says we have seen a wave of bonuses since tax cuts were announced, and will this increase wages? Powell says it is hard to trace through the effects of tax cuts on wages. Lower taxes should lead to higher investment, which should lead to higher productivity, which should lead to higher wages over time. Asked about risks of the unconventional monetary policy, Powell plays this down. He says the financial sector shows modest risk. There are some high asset prices, but no buildup of leverage among households. Following the testimony, the committee chair Hennsarling asks about the 2% inflation target and whether the Fed will move from it or replace the target with a range. Powell says the committee would be concerned about concerted deviation above or below the target. The market understands this. The congress meeting has begun, and a number of senators are having their say before Fed chair Jerome Powell gets to read his testimony. The Republican chair of the financial services committee Jeb Hensarling says there should be a sustainable path to a more normal policy and says the Fed should “stay in its lane.” Democrat Maxine Waters attacks the government’s policies and says it is trying to undermine the Fed. After a few more partisan comments, Powell is up. Following its move on Sky, Comcast shares have lost around 6% in early trading. 21st Century Fox is down 1% while Disney, which is bidding for Fox, has lost 1.9%. Following Jerome Powell’s comments on interest rates and the strength of the US economy, US markets are struggling for direction in early trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 24 points or 0.09%, while the S&amp;P 500 opened up just 0.03% and the Nasdaq Composite fell by a similar amount. ING Bank however expects four rate rises this year, with the first next month. Economist James Knightley says: Jay Powell’s first testimony before Congress as Fed Chair emphasises continuity from Chair Yellen with a repeat of the policy of gradual rate hikes. Ahead of his testimony there was some speculation that he could adopt a slightly more dovish stance, but the written submission doesn’t back this up. Instead, Powell suggests the economic outlook “remains strong” while stating ”some of the headwinds the U.S. economy faced in previous years have turned into tailwinds”, namely fiscal policy and foreign demand. He also hints that inflation is likely to rise, repeating Janet Yellen’s position that some of the “shortfall” in inflation likely reflects “transitory influences that we do not expect will repeat”. He also sounds fairly relaxed about the recent market volatility, saying that despite this, “financial conditions remain accommodative”. Moreover, financial conditions are not “weighing heavily” on the economy... As such, the tone of Powell’s written testimony suggests that the Fed position hasn’t really changed under its new leadership with gradual hikes remaining the theme. However, his hints at the upside potential for inflation and the increasing positives for growth suggest the risks are skewed towards a more aggressive monetary policy response. At the moment the Fed are projecting three rate hikes this year while financial markets are currently pricing in around 80bp of rate hikes. Given our above consensus 3% GDP growth forecast for 2018 and the potential for inflation to rise more quickly than many in the market anticipate (wages, dollar weakness, medical care costs, cell phone data distortions, commodity prices), we are now forecasting four rate rises this year. We look for one every quarter – starting with the March 21 FOMC meeting. Danske Bank reckons three US rate hikes are still on the cards this year: The full text of Powell’s testimony is here. More detail from Powell’s comments, including the expectation of further gradual interest rate rises. But he is not specific about whether that means three or four rises in the rest of the year, something which has been exercising investors: While many factors shape the economic outlook, some of the headwinds the U.S. economy faced in previous years have turned into tailwinds: In particular, fiscal policy has become more stimulative and foreign demand for U.S. exports is on a firmer trajectory. Despite the recent volatility, financial conditions remain accommodative. At the same time, inflation remains below our 2 percent longer-run objective. In the Federal Open Market Committee’s view, further gradual increases in the federal funds rate will best promote attainment of ... our objectives. As always, the path of monetary policy will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data. Breaking: The world’s newest and most powerful central bank chief has declared that America’s economic outlook remains strong. Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has told the US House Banking Committee that the Fed will “strike a balance” between the risk of an overheating economy and the need to keep growth on track. Powell’s testimony has been released ahead of his appearance at Congress in under 90 minutes time. Skimming it quickly, I can’t see any major shocks. Powell seem to be sticking to the same position as his predecessor, Janet Yellen; namely, that the recovery is robust, and borrowing costs should rise - in a careful fashion - to keep inflation under control. For example, Powell says: Against this backdrop of solid growth and a strong labor market, inflation has been low and stable. In fact, inflation has continued to run below the 2% that the FOMC judges to be most consistent over the longer run with our congressional mandate. Insisting that the economic outlook is strong, Powell adds: The robust job market should continue to support growth in household incomes and consumer spending, solid economic growth among our trading partners should lead to further gains in U.S. exports, and upbeat business sentiment and strong sales growth will likely continue to boost business investment. Moreover, fiscal policy is becoming more stimulative. In this environment, we anticipate that inflation on a 12-month basis will move up this year and stabilize around the FOMC’s 2 percent objective over the medium term. Wages should increase at a faster pace as well. The Committee views the near-term risks to the economic outlook as roughly balanced but will continue to monitor inflation developments closely. You don’t hear the words ‘poor old Rupert Murdoch’ very often (not since he almost got a pie in the face in 2011, maybe). But our financial editor, Nils Pratley, has summoned up a smidgen of sympathy.... Nils writes: Poor old Rupert Murdoch. A media titan can’t even break up his own empire these days without gate-crashers turning up to spoil the show. Comcast’s £22bn bid for Sky is bold, aggressive and cutely-timed – qualities associated with Murdoch in his pomp – and, very probably, marks the start of a shoot-out for the UK satellite broadcaster. The open question is who will to go head-to-head with Comcast. Should it be Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox, whose current £10.75-a-share cash offer for Sky has been trumped by 16% by Comcast? Or should Disney, in the process of trying to buy the bulk of Fox via a deal that includes the 39% stake in Sky, take matters in its own hands and make a direct counter-offer? Therein lies the cleverness of Comcast’s timing. Brian Roberts, chairman and chief executive, has a decent chance of exploiting confusion in the opposition camps. Does Fox, given the importance of the Disney deal, have a completely free hand to raise debt and get into a bidding war for Sky? And does Disney, whatever it says about Sky being a “crown jewel”, really regard the UK TV company as fundamental to its wider purchase of Fox assets in the US?. The very worst outcome for Murdoch would be to lose to Comcast in the battle for Sky and then see his Disney deal scuppered by US regulators, which is still a possibility...... More here: Shares in Comcast are down 2% in pre-market trading in New York, following its proposal to acquire Sky in an all-cash deal. Disney shares are also down, around 1%. Wall Street trading begins in 90 minutes.... Newsflash: Sky has issued a statement to the City, urging investors not to take any action following Comcast’s offer to pay £12.50 per share for the broadcaster. Here’s the full statement: The Independent Committee of Sky notes today’s announcement from Comcast regarding a possible all cash offer for Sky at £12.50 per share (the “Possible Offer”). The Independent Directors of Sky are mindful of their fiduciary duties and their obligations under the UK Takeover Code. Since no firm offer has been made at this point, shareholders are advised to take no action. A further announcement will be made as and when appropriate. Another hedge fund, Polygon Global Partners, has predicted a bidding war for Sky - echoing Crispin Odey’s forecast. Polygon portfolio manager Bechara Nasr has told Reuters that Sky could eventually fetch an offer of more than £15 per share (it’s still hovering around £13.30). These hedgies aren’t impartial, of course. Odey Asset Management own 0.9% of Sky’s shares, and Polygon has also held a small stake. It’s not even noon yet, but here’s the Evening Standard’s take on Comcast’s dramatic entry into the Sky takeover story: Here’s my colleague Mark Sweney on today’s Comcast bid: Comcast is attempting to gatecrash Rupert Murdoch’s takeover of Sky, submitting a rival offer to the UK broadcaster’s shareholders worth about £22bn. The media and telecoms company, which owns NBC Universal and is the largest cable operator in the US, said its all-cash offer of £12.50 per share offered Sky shareholders a 16% premium on the offer from Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox. Fox owns 39% of Sky and submitted its bid to take full control in December 2016, but the deal has been held up by regulatory issues. Comcast has reportedly been exploring a bid for 21st Century Fox’s entertainment assets, which include Sky and the 20th Century Fox film studio, since the company agreed a $66bn (£47bn) sale to US rival Disney. The company, which has 1,300 employees in the UK in broadcasting and film and TV production including the firm behind Downton Abbey, promised that Sky’s headquarters would remain at Osterley in south-west London. “Comcast intends to use Sky as a platform for growth in Europe. We already have a strong presence in London through our NBC Universal international operations, and we intend to maintain Sky’s UK headquarters,” said the Comcast chairman and chief executive, Brian Roberts. “Adding Sky to the Comcast family of businesses will increase our international revenues from 9% to 25% of company revenues. More here: Analysts at investment bank Jefferies have predicted that Disney could actually launch its own bid for Sky soon. That, they say, would resolve the danger that Disney complete its agreement to buy Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox -- but finds that Comcast snaffle Sky first. In a note to clients, Jefferies say that Disney is very keen to acquire Sky - so could offer shareholders a higher price than Comcast: FOX could in principle elect to accept Comcast’s offer. In that event, Comcast has reserved the right to switch from a simple takeover offer (requiring 50% plus 1 share acceptance) to a Scheme of Arrangement (requiring 75% approval of all Sky shareholders, including Murdoch Family Trust as they are not setting up this Scheme). More likely is that FOX will raise its offer well above £12.50, in our view. This would give unaffiliated Sky shareholders an incentive to hold out and see if CMA approval of FOX-Sky is forthcoming. The problem for FOX of merely cashing in its Sky stake is not that this derails DIS-FOX (we understand that there is no exit route for DIS, or no impact on offer value, if Sky assets are sold before DIS takes charge). Instead, the issue for FOX would be that if it sold out of Sky only then to find that DIS-FOX were blocked, FOX would be left as a sub-scale collection of mainly US assets with India as the only material international exposure. Likely DIS [Disney] response, in our view, will be to table a direct offer to Sky shareholders. DIS CEO has described Sky as the ‘crown jewel’ asset among the FOX operations he is seeking to acquire. Just as with Comcast, adding more international distribution (direct to consumer) and content production is strategic to countering Netflix, Amazon, etc. A counter-bid from DIS would avoid the regulatory complexities/delays in much the same way as the Comcast approach. Rupert Murdoch will be furious that Comcast has gatecrashed his takeover bid for Sky, according to hedge fund chief Crispin Odey. Odey (who was once married to Murdoch’s eldest child, Prudence), told Bloomberg: “This is tanks on their lawn”. Odey, I imagine, will be cock-a-hoop this morning. He’s been pushing for a higher bid for Sky, arguing that 21st Century Fox’s bid was too low. Sky’s share price is climbing higher, as City traders lick their lips at the prospect of a bidding war. After two hours of trading, Sky’s shares are now up 22% at £13.50, the highest since 2000 - and £1 or 8% above Comcast’s bid. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at financial services group Hargreaves Lansdown, says the market “clearly smells the scent of some more action before this saga draws to a close”. ‘Comcast has gazumped 21st Century Fox with a better takeover offer for Sky shareholders. The successful conclusion of the Premiership football rights auction has moved the dial for Sky, which secured more games at a lower cost than last time around. Indeed the fact that Sky shares were already trading at 30p above Fox’s offer price tells us the market was expecting an improved offer from somewhere. As it is, Comcast has thrown its hat into the ring and is now seeking to meet with the Sky directors to flesh out the deal. There may well be some reaction from 21st Century Fox. However, since the bid for Sky was launched, 21st Century Fox has agreed to sell many of its assets, including Sky, to Disney. It remains to be seen therefore what appetite Rupert Murdoch has to pursue Sky any further. Reuters’ Ben Martin agrees: European-based readers may not be totally au fait with Comcast, but it is undoubtedly a massive player. Valued at around $184bn (or six times more than Sky), Comcast owns the NBC TV network, the Universal Pictures film studio (owner of DreamWorks, and cable firms MSNBC and CNBC, the XFINITY telecoms service, plus several theme parks. It can trace its history back to 1963, when it began as a “single-system cable operator” in Tupelo, Mississippi. It was founded by Ralph J. Roberts, the father of current chairman and CEO Brian. My colleague Mark Sweney has more info: NBC Universal division has spent more than $1bn on TV and film productions in the UK over the last three years. It owns Carnival Films, the UK production company behind Downton Abbey and The Last Kingdom; Made in Chelsea producer Monkey; and Working Title, the British film producer responsible for Four Weddings and Funeral, Baby Driver and Darkest Hour. NBC Universal also owns cable channels including Syfy and E!. Tom Watson, Labour’s Shadow Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, has just commented on Comcast’s bid for Sky. He argues that Comcast must pledge to fund Sky News for at least 10 years (as Rupert Murdoch pledged last week). Watson says: “The UK’s media plurality and Sky’s high broadcasting standards are at stake in this bidding process. All bids including this new one from Comcast must be very carefully scrutinised. “Comcast must demonstrate its commitment to plurality by guaranteeing a properly funded Sky News for at least a decade as a key condition of the sale.” As flagged up earlier, Comcast have already promised to “maintain Sky News’ existing brand and culture” and its track record of excellence and impartiality. There’s no time-scale on that commitment, though.... In a fantastic twist, Comcast’s chief Brian Roberts says a London taxi driver played a key role in triggering today’s bid: Readers are split over the merits of Comcast’s offer for Sky. Here’s some reaction from below the line... Oh... and if Comcast could send an engineer round to Cobberthedog’s patch, we’d be most grateful.... Neil Campling of Mirabaud Securities says it makes a lot of sense for Comcast to acquire Sky: There is the attraction of diversifying away from the U.S. because of pressures on the cable industry there. The regular annuity stream that you have from the subscription business of Sky will be of primary appeal to Comcast. “The strategic fit of Sky for Comcast makes sense. Comcast has grown to become the number 1 cable company in the US so the company has a strong background in Pay-TV. Also Comcast has a large international operation through content of its NBCU assets and has previously stated interest in expanding the non-US asset base. Comcast EV (enterprise value) is $247bn so this is an easily absorbed deal. He also believes that Comcast is acting now, because Sky has just retained rights to show Premier League football, and before the UK regulators give their approval to Fox’s bid. Sky’s shares have hit their highest levels in almost 18 years, dating back to the end of the dot-com boom: If you’re just tuning in, here are the key points from Comcast’s surprise $31bn offer for Sky: Possible all-cash offer of £12.50 per share, premium of 16% to the current 21 Century Fox offer Minimum acceptance condition of 50 per cent. plus one share Confident in receiving all necessary regulatory approvals in a timely manner Strategic opportunity to acquire a leading content and distribution business in the UK and Europe Specific intentions to maintain a strong presence in the UK for the combined business: Continued investment in creative industries in the UK Support for high broadcasting standards and news impartiality in the UK The combined business will have the resources and capabilities across content, technology and service to compete and grow in a rapidly changing market Accretive to Comcast’s free cash flow per share in year one Richard Hunter, Head of Markets at interactive investor, says that Comcast’s proposed offer for Sky is a “fascinating development”, on many levels. The deal would have attractions on a number of fronts, not least of which would be the removal of complexity from the current tripartite discussions between Fox, Disney and Sky. In a land where, increasingly, content is king, there would be synergies from a creative programming perspective, whilst the potential showstopper of media plurality concerns would probably not apply to the Comcast bid. Meanwhile, the combined group would have a stable of media, production and technology outlets which would position it strongly in any number of countries. Hunter also points out that Murdoch’s 39% stake in Sky is an added complication: In a normal takeover situation, the potential acquirer would be extremely keen to have the support of the largest shareholder in an effort to ease the deal through. Unlikely though it seems, this could yet happen, but it is equally plausible that Fox will need to return with an improved bid, which the market was beginning to anticipate in any event. Indeed, the initial share price reaction suggests that this story has further to run, with Sky’s price leaping above the level of the already increased Comcast offer. Whatever the outcome, Comcast has put the cat amongst the pigeons with a move which should make for compulsive viewing.” Here’s more reaction to the Comcast deal, first from journalist Robin Powell: City veteran David Buik says the ball is firmly in 21st Century Fox’s court - will Murdoch boost his own bid, or accept Comcast’s offer? CNBC’s Geoff Cutmore flags up that we could get a full-blown bidding war for Sky Boom! Shares in Sky have jumped by 18% at the start of trading. They have surged to £13.10, up from £11.05 last night. That actually values Sky at more than Comcast’s new proposal (£12.50 per share), suggesting that the City believes Murdoch may have to increase his own offer (£10.75). Some quotes from Comcast are flashing up on my Reuters terminal now. Chairman and CEO Brian Roberts are saying that there are “strong strategic benefits” in combining its assets with Sky. The company didn’t speak to Sky until this morning, and hasn’t had any contact with the Murdoch family since Fox announced its deal to sell assets to Disney. Roberts also says Comcast is prepared to be co-owners of Sky with either 21st Century Fox, or Disney. [That could happen, if Comcast buy the 61% of Sky which 21C Fox doesn’t own, and Disney completes the existing deal to buy Fox]. Sky’s shares are likely to surge when trading begins on the London stock market in 10 minutes. They closed at £11.05 last night - ahead of 21st Century Fox’s offer (£10.75), but well short of Comcast’s offer of £12.50. The news that Comcast could take control of Sky is sending shockwaves through the media sector. The FT’s Arash Massoudi agrees that it could disrupt Rupert Murdoch’s bid, and even scupper his grand plan to sell much of his Fox empire to Disney: City analyst Louise Cooper says the deal has been triggered by pressure from new media. She suspects Comcast will have to fight hard to get the deal over the line. Comcast says it doesn’t expect to run into any of the ‘media plurality’ concerns that have dogged Rupert Murdoch’s attempts to buy Sky. Today’s statement includes a section called “Supporting high broadcasting standards and news impartiality in the UK”, which states: Comcast recognises that Sky News is an invaluable part of the UK news landscape and the Company intends to maintain Sky News’ existing brand and culture, as well as its strong track record for high-quality impartial news and adherence to broadcasting standards. While Comcast does own a substantial international operation in the UK, with more than 1,300 employees, the Company has only a minimal presence in the UK media market. Comcast therefore does not believe that this Superior Cash Proposal should create any media plurality concerns in the UK. Comcast is also pledging to use keep Sky’s headquarters in the UK, if its takeover bid succeeds. Chairman and CEO Brian Roberts says: “Comcast intends to use Sky as a platform for growth in Europe. We already have a strong presence in London through our NBCUniversal international operations, and we intend to maintain Sky’s UK headquarters. Adding Sky to the Comcast family of businesses will increase our international revenues from 9% to 25% of Company revenues.” NEWSFLASH: Comcast, the US cable company, has launched a takeover offer for Sky, in a challenge to Rupert Murdoch. Comcast is offering to pay £12.50 per share in cash for the British broadcaster, valuing it at $31bn, or £22.1bn. This is a 16% premium to the existing takeover bid from 21st Century Fox (£10.75 per share). Brian Roberts, Comcast chief executive, says “We think Sky is an outstanding company”, adding: “It has 23m customers, leading positions in the UK, Italy and Germany, and is a consistent innovator in its use of technology to deliver its customers a great experience.” That bid has been caught up in regulatory concerns -- last month, the Competition and Markets Authority ruled that it was not in the public interest for Fox to buy the 61% of Sky it doesn’t own, due to media plurality concerns. There’s an additional complication -- since bidding for Sky, Murdoch has agreed a deal to sell much of Fox’s assets to Disney. More to follow.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It’s Jerome Powell’s big day. The world’s most powerful central banker testifies to Congress, for the first time since replacing Janet Yellen as head of the Federal Reserve. Investors around the world will be watching closely, for hints about how quickly the Fed might raise interest rates if inflation picks up. Worries about rising borrowing costs caused the markets to plunge at the start of this month; traders will be worried about a repeat. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says: Although yields have fallen away from their recent 4 year high, there is still a level of caution among investors over the future of the US economy and monetary policy, which is keeping the market on edge. Therefore, it comes as no surprise that the most relevant event today will be new Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s appearance before Congress, in the Semi-annual Monetary Policy Report. This is his first official testimony in a highly anticipated event. However, given the backdrop of interest rate expectation sensitivity, which caused significant market disruption, Powell is unlikely to want to rock the boat. We also get new economic data from the eurozone, including the first estimate of inflation in Germany.

Snowfall made driving conditions treacherous in many parts of Britain, disrupted rail and air transport networks and forced hundreds of schools to close. More snow is forecast for the rest of the week. Lincolnshire police appealed for witnesses to contact them about the incident, which involved a blue Renault Clio and a white Scania lorry on the A15 shortly after 6am. The crash was one of 20 within three hours on Lincolnshire’s roads, including one involving a school bus with 45 pupils on board, police said. The children were unharmed after their bus collided with a car and veered off the road near Deeping St James. Officers in Cambridgeshire said another man had died in a crash, which had involved three vehicles on the A47 near Peterborough shortly before 10am. Essex police said one person was injured in a 17-car pile-up on the A120 between Colchester and Elmstead Market. About 500 homes in Newcastle were left without power after a fire on Ponteland Road in Cowgate disrupted power supplies. Crews had to turn off the supply to repair the damaged cables, leaving homes without heating and prompting police to declare a major incident. A reception centre for affected residents has been set up at a nearby Morrisons supermarket. At least 24 people have died in mainland Europe in the past four days as freezing temperatures have brought snow as far south as the Mediterranean islands of Corsica and Capri. Polish police said five people had died after temperatures fell as low as -22C, bringing to 53 the number of Polish deaths from freezing this winter. Three deaths were reported in Romania. Yellow warnings for snow remained in place in the UK on Tuesday, the Met Office said, and more were issued for later in the week covering parts of Scotland, northern England, south-west England and Wales. Scotland’s transport minister, Humza Yousaf, said amber alerts in Scotland for snow and freezing winds from the early hours of Wednesday could be changed to red for extreme weather in some areas. The Met Office said several centimetres of snow fell in some parts of the UK on Monday night and Tuesday morning, including in Newcastle and Northumberland. The lowest overnight temperature of -8.9C was recorded in Farnborough, Hampshire. Trains were affected by the snowfall, with cancellations and disruptions on lines. Southeastern, which operates in Kent, cancelled dozens of services, including several to London’s St Pancras, Victoria and Cannon Street stations. Southern and Great Northern services were also affected. Services on c2c, Greater Anglia, London Overground, South Western Railway, Southeastern, Stansted Express and TfL Rail had been affected and disruption could continue on Wednesday and Thursday, Network Rail said. Hundreds of schools across the UK have been closed, including nearly 350 in Kent and more than 220 in Wales. British Airways cancelled dozens of flights from Heathrow airport and said it was preparing for adverse weather until Friday, with some short-haul and domestic flights likely to be affected. EasyJet also said some flights could be delayed or cancelled. “There will also be further disruption throughout the day as these showers become widespread across the country,” said Emma Sillitoe, a Met office meteorologist. Forecasters had predicted 5cm to 10cm of snow in most areas of the UK. The Met Office forecaster Frank Saunders said parts of the UK could have their coldest spell of weather since at least 2013, and possibly since 1991. It was expected temperatures could dip as low as -15C by midweek where there was snow on the ground, close to temperatures forecast for parts of northern Norway and Iceland. Forecasters predicted that another weather system, Storm Emma, would bring blizzards, gales and sleet later in the week as that storm met the chilly “beast from the east”. The storm, named by the Portuguese met service, is expected to move north through Europe and reach the UK on Thursday and Friday. It could cause significant disruption, including power cuts and transport delays."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/feb/27/coalition-agreement-87000-in-public-funds-spent-keeping-document-secret","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-27T07:25:26Z","webTitle":"Coalition agreement: $87,000 in public funds spent keeping document secret","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/feb/27/coalition-agreement-87000-in-public-funds-spent-keeping-document-secret","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/feb/27/coalition-agreement-87000-in-public-funds-spent-keeping-document-secret","fields":{"headline":"Coalition agreement: $87,000 in public funds spent keeping document secret","bodyText":"The Australian government has spent $87,000 defending a case brought by Labor’s Joel Fitzgibbon seeking a copy of the Coalition agreement, Malcolm Turnbull has said. Turnbull revealed the cost in question time on Tuesday, but said it would be reduced by a costs order which the shadow agriculture minister first denied existed before he was forced to clarify that it did exist but he hadn’t been aware of it. The legal dispute for the Coalition agreement between the Liberal and National parties has been enlivened by Turnbull’s inability to discipline the former Nationals leader Barnaby Joyce and Labor probing the nature of the document in Senate estimates. Labor has sought the Coalition agreement under freedom of information, but the government refuses to provide it on the basis it is a party political document not a government document. Fitzgibbon is fighting that ruling in the administrative appeals tribunal (AAT). He suffered a setback in August when the federal circuit court concluded the AAT was correct to refuse to force Turnbull’s lawyers to show Labor’s lawyers the document. The court ordered Fitzgibbon to pay Turnbull’s costs “as agreed”. In question time, Turnbull said “the commonwealth’s legal fees so far have been $87,000”. “But they will be considerably reduced because of a costs order made against [Fitzgibbon],” he said. “We hope in the interests of preserving the public finances of the nation [Fitzgibbon] pays up in accordance with the court order.” Fitzgibbon then claimed to have been misrepresented because “there is no such costs order”. After two hours, Turnbull returned to the chamber to table the order, forcing Fitzgibbon to make an explanation. “As I understand it in a technical sense there is a costs order,” he said. “To the extent to which that’s true I apologise to the House if I misled the House. I wasn’t aware or fully understood that matter. “I can explain: there is no agreement between parties as to costs, there is no dollar figure, and there has been no demand on me for costs. I wasn’t aware a costs order had been made.” In Senate estimates on Monday, Labor probed the Nationals’ staffing allocation to determine if the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet had oversight of Joyce’s now partner, Vikki Campion, moving from Joyce’s employ to the resources and northern Australia minister, Matt Canavan. The finance minister, Mathias Cormann, conceded the Coalition agreement went to the running of government and also specified the “allocation of staff to the National party”. Labor’s Senate leader, Penny Wong, seized on the description, and told Cormann, based on his evidence to the committee: “There is no basis on which the government can continue to hide this document from the public.” Cormann said the agreement was a “political document” that “goes to how our parties work together in government and opposition”, including the proportion of ministers and opposition spokespeople and staff which are “administrative arrangements between two political parties”. Labor will continue to seek the Coalition agreement through the AAT case, after having asked for it unsuccessfully in Senate estimates. In a statement Fitzgibbon said the Australian people “deserve to know the basis on which their prime minister holds office”. “Australians shouldn’t have to blindly suffer the dysfunctional relationship between the warring parties in this Coalition government,” he said. “Turnbull spent the last two-and-a-half weeks claiming the Coalition agreement prevented him from sacking disgraced former deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce – when everybody knew it was really just because Turnbull was too weak to act.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/feb/27/nauru-mould-australia-spent-50000-on-steam-cleaner-it-never-used","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-27T06:57:56Z","webTitle":"Nauru mould: Australia 'spent $50,000 on steam cleaner it never used'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/27/nauru-mould-australia-spent-50000-on-steam-cleaner-it-never-used","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/feb/27/nauru-mould-australia-spent-50000-on-steam-cleaner-it-never-used","fields":{"headline":"Nauru mould: Australia 'spent $50,000 on steam cleaner it never used'","bodyText":"The Australian government bought a $50,000 industrial steam cleaner – “a giant water blaster” – to combat the mould growing throughout the Nauru immigration processing centre, but never used it because it was too dangerous, a former worker has said. The machine, paid for by Australia and shipped to the Pacific island, was too dangerous to employ in the camps, and was never used to clean mould from accommodation tents and from buildings. A former detention centre worker said the machine’s purchase was a “comedy of errors”. “It was too big, too bulky, you couldn’t get it down into the camps, besides the fact that it was dangerous as anything,” the worker told AAP. “It was a giant water blaster and if you used it inside the [asylum seeker] tents it was ripping the plywood floors up.” By the time the machine arrived on Nauru, the camp management company Transfield – now Broadspectrum – had begun a cleaning regime with tea tree oil. The machine has instead been used by mechanics to clean the mud off the bottom of buses before they are serviced. A Guardian investigation last week revealed the Australian government had been warned as long ago as 2014, in a report by BHS, that the mould growing inside the buildings within the Nauru regional processing centre presented a “major risk to the health and safety of the occupants”. At least a dozen former staff who have worked in the regional processing centre are understood to have developed conditions from exposure to mould and breathing the contaminated air in the buildings. The conditions include toxic mould syndrome, cognitive and neurological symptoms, chronic pain and chest infections. At least 330 refugees and asylum seekers, including 36 children, still live in mould-prone tents on Nauru. Pictures from the Nauru RPC this week show mould remains prevalent across the camp. The microbiologist contracted to assess the mould problem in 2014, Dr Cameron Jones, told the Guardian the mould problem he discovered “was a disaster waiting to happen”. “The mould was of epic proportions ... it was an absolute nightmare.” Some tents and work buildings were found to be “highly toxic” with the level of mould measured at up to 76 times the normal, safe level. During a senate estimates hearing on Monday night, the government conceded it had been told of the health risk posed by the mould in the 2014 report, but said it had adopted industry recommendations to alleviate the problem. But as late as December 2016, the government conceded to the Australian National Audit Office – which criticised the immigration department for failing to act on repeated warnings – “mould is a persistent issue at the Nauru RPC”. In estimates, the department’s first assistant secretary David Nockels said no former staff had complained to the department about mould-related illnesses, though he was aware of a complaint of a mould-related illness made to the government’s workplace safety agency, Comcare, that “was acknowledged and went no further”. Nockels said the government had implemented an extensive remediation program - including going to considerable expense - and had satisfactorily addressed the mould issue. Mould was removed from permanent buildings in early 2017, and “the service providers… have a fairly extensive cleaning regime in place to clean... marquees,” Nockels told estimates Monday night. “We purchased significantly large ... industrial-sized equipment... a massive steam cleaner at the cost of $50,000.” He said he didn’t know how machine worked because he hadn’t seen it in action. The Australian Lawyers Alliance said the Department of Home Affairs and its private contractors might have breached their legal duties of care in exposing refugees, asylum seekers, and staff to mould. A spokesman for Comcare told the Guardian it received a complaint in 2016 “from a worker employed by a contractor who advised they had been diagnosed with a respiratory condition after living in a water damaged and mould affected building at the Nauru RPC”. “Following inquiries, Comcare was of the view that ongoing measures were in place to deal with the problem of mould, which included replacing affected structures and installing new air conditioners.” Comcare has been monitoring mould issues at the Nauru RPC, including through onsite inspections in 2014, 2015, and 2017. “We are satisfied that reasonably practicable steps were taken to address problems with mould at the centre, and that the most recent site inspection in August 2017 found no significant issues.” AAP contributed to this story"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/feb/27/south-australia-election-xenophons-party-to-force-ice-users-into-rehab","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-27T03:25:06Z","webTitle":"South Australia election: Xenophon’s party to force ice users into rehab","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/feb/27/south-australia-election-xenophons-party-to-force-ice-users-into-rehab","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/feb/27/south-australia-election-xenophons-party-to-force-ice-users-into-rehab","fields":{"headline":"South Australia election: Xenophon’s party to force ice users into rehab","bodyText":"Ice users in South Australia will be forced into rehabilitation under an election policy announced by Nick Xenophon’s SA-BEST party. Xenophon made the promise during a social issues debate in Adelaide on Tuesday involving the three candidates for premier. Xenophon, Labor’s Premier Jay Weatherill and Liberal leader, Steven Marshall. Xenophon says he wants to slash the use of ice by half by 2020. “Successive governments at state and federal level have had not had effective strategies in place to tackle the scourge of ice,” Xenophon said. If his party has the balance of power, he will seek to pass legislation establishing mandatory rehab and detox facilities for ice users within the first three months. The debate was a picture of shifting alliances from one topic to the next, with Marshall and Xenophon teaming up to criticise Weatherill over child protection services. They argued the Labor government failed to adequately respond to the recommendations of a two-year royal commission prompted by the arrest of paedophile carer Shannon McCoole that concluded in 2016. Marshall criticised the Weatherill government for failing to have a dedicated child protection minister, and pledged that a Liberal government would appoint one. “You judge a state by how it defends its most vulnerable, and on that Labor stands condemned,” Marshall said. Weatherill was scoffed at by the audience when he attempted to respond to a previous question directed at Xenophon rather than address the child protection question that had been put to him. The alliance was temporary however, with Weatherill and Marshall joining forces to urge the focus on poker machines be moved over to online gambling rather than Xenophon’s approach to what the Labor leader described as Xenophon’s “backdoor” attempt to “close down venues by destroying their viability”. Xenophon said pokies “remain a going concern” and pointed to the Australian Hotels Association financially backing both the Labor and Liberal parties. The SA Best leader moved between gambling addiction and drug addiction, expressing concern that sewage analysis of Adelaide showed the city to have the highest methylamphetamine levels per person of anywhere in the country. “My concern is those country communities that don’t have wastewater systems but just septic tanks, and the fear that they have even higher use,” he said. He is also calling for a significant boost in funding for treatment programs and for monitoring of their effectiveness. The former senator said during a recent murder investigation in Murray Bridge, east of Adelaide, police were shocked at the extent of ice use in the regional centre. “The fact that a senior respected police officer was shocked by what was found is a wake-up call for all of us,” Xenophon said. Weatherill also referenced the “scourge of ice” when he used the debate to launch a $70m commitment to outreach and support services for suicide prevention. As ever in South Australian politics, energy was never far from the conversation. Marshall criticised Xenophon for a lack of detail of how his non-for-profit energy retailer would work, and attacked Labor for abandoning baseload power for intermittent renewables, pointing to his policy for a new interconnector with New South Wales and a $100m household battery storage scheme. Xenophon spruiked his role in securing a concessional loan from the Turnbull government for the Aurora solar thermal plant in Port Augusta, and said his support for a new interconnector would depend on it being “modelled appropriately”. Weatherill framed the power prices issue as one of a lack of competition, urging a rollout of more power generation. “The way you smash control of large gentailers is to introduce new forms of generation and retail it,” he said. “They’re screwing us because they’ve got the power to screw us.” Digital inclusion was another hot topic, with Weatherill pledging the Labor government would supply laptops to every year 10, 11 and 12 student in the state. Xenophon said SA-Best would focus on using libraries as hubs of digital inclusion, and Marshall highlighted a $10m commitment to rolling out better internet access in regional areas. Questions were sourced from online submissions made by the public and pulled out of red, blue and orange hats, representing the colours of the three major parties, to the amusement of Marshall. “It’s like we’re on a game show,” he said.

Speaking from her home in New Haven, Connecticut, Chua says: “There were all these nasty tweets afterwards, saying: ‘What does the Tiger Mother think she’s doing talking about nationalism?’ I remember thinking these people don’t even know I’m a professor and not just a parent. “I told my publisher and editor [about Political Tribes] and they weren’t so happy because they wanted a more lucrative follow-up to the memoir. I might do that down the line, but I just felt that for myself, I needed to go back and write a more serious book.” Her broad thesis in Political Tribes is that Americans are almost uniquely blind to the importance of group identities. The US has historically been a “super-group”, made up of a diverse population bound by a strong national identity of Americanness. Chua argues that US foreign policymakers have looked at other countries in the same way. She gives the examples of Vietnam, Afghanistan and Iraq where the tribal motives of the people whose lives were being thrown into chaos were ignored. Now the US itself is being pulled apart by tribal divisions and the “super-group” is breaking down. Race has split the poor and class has split white Americans. She writes: “Today, no group in America feels comfortably dominant. The left believes that rightwing tribalism – bigotry, racism – is tearing the country apart. The right believes that leftwing tribalism – identity politics, political correctness – is tearing the country apart. They are both right.” Identity has fascinated Chua for as long as she can remember. “I’ve always been very conscious of my identity because for most of my life I really stuck out,” she says. Chua, whose ethnic Chinese parents emigrated from the Philippines, spent the first eight years of her life in Indiana where she was bullied for being different. “We were the only Asian family for blocks and blocks. I had a funny accent to start with. I brought a Thermos with Chinese food to school. “When I went to Harvard, I stuck out again because I was this public school kid who had no idea about these private fancy schools.” Chua – who is a stimulating conversationalist: chatty, clever, enthusiastic and funny – says her true tribe is her family. “I’m very aware of tribalism, when you’re an outsider you stick with your own, your family. I view my whole life as slowly turning being an outsider into a source of strength instead of weakness, shame and insecurity – even with the Tiger Mom thing.” Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother provoked outrage when it was published in 2011. Rather than being a how-to manual, the book is an account of the rewards and costs – her daughter Lulu had rebelled – of her extreme parenting style. Details of her draconian rules, which included no sleepovers, no playdates and no grade less than an A, prompted a barrage of abusive emails and even death threats. The experience toughened her, she says, adding: “At first, I thought why did I do this? I didn’t know people were going to be so mad. But I look back and I’m proud I contributed to a big conversation that had to be had. “It wasn’t all negative. When my kids complained it was stressful I would say: ‘Oh come on, you just got to meet Mark Wahlberg.’ They’ll admit there was a fair share of fun things.” In terms of academic success, Chua’s methods appear to have paid off. Sophia, 25, is at Yale Law School and Lulu, 22, is majoring in history at Harvard. “I’m just relieved,” says Chua. “It could have gone either way. With Lulu especially, we had just come out of this very difficult stage, which is why I wrote the book. She had rebelled completely. I don’t want to sugarcoat it. Parenting is never easy. This is not a humble brag.” Now she’s an empty nester, she says, and has more time to write. She also enlists the help of her “brilliant” students as research assistants – she chooses “half conservative and half liberal, of all stripes and every religion”. She is evidently inspired by her pupils and enjoys mentoring. She is particularly interested in the “relatively few students from poor lower-class white backgrounds”. One of her former pupils is JD Vance who credits Chua for encouraging him to write Hillbilly Elegy. Her discussions with students, among other factors, helped her call Trump’s election victory. Chua, who says she is a socially liberal independent, says: “I talked to so many people who said, I couldn’t say this but my parents are voting for him. Even immigrants.” Trump’s rise caused her to rework Political Tribes. “I’d long been saying developing country political dynamics are so different from the US and that’s why we always get our foreign policy wrong because we don’t have these populist movements and demagogues and ethno-nationalists. Then I stopped, and I actually reworked the book. An early theme of the book is that the political dynamics in America are starting to resemble those in developing countries much more than ever before.” Chua tries to reach an optimistic conclusion in the book – described as a “little kumbaya” in the London Evening Standard – with the hope that in time Americans can overcome their divisions. She cites individual acts she’s seen among her students: a third-generation Holocaust survivor agreeing to disagree with an anti-Israel activist; the daughter of an undocumented worker from Mexico finding love with the son of a police officer from New Hampshire. These might seem like a “Band-Aid for bullet wounds”, she writes, but there is evidence that when individuals from different groups get to know one another, huge progress can be made. Chua admits to the Guardian: “If we’re going to get past this polarization, there will have to be a collective will not just at the individual level. We need courageous political leaders – it’s so much easier to appeal to the tribe, get emotions riled up.” Political Tribes is the second book Chua, 55, has written post-Tiger Mom. In 2014, she and her husband, Jed Rubenfeld, 59, also a Yale law professor, published The Triple Package, which argued that specific cultural traits made for group success. Clearly, Chua thrives on being busy. She is up at 6am. “I take care of the dog. I love that first cup of coffee. My brain slowly deteriorates from the moment I wake up so I try to do all my important writing and hard stuff until about 10am. I gradually shift to easier and easier things. On days I teach I focus on teaching.” And with her Tiger Mom television-free days behind her, she and her husband have also found another way to unwind: binge-watching TV. “We’re huge TV addicts now. I don’t think I watched a single show when the children were young.” Then we’re back to tribes. Peaky Blinders – the drama about gang warfare set in 1920s Birmingham, England – is her current favorite. “I watched an entire series in one night,” she says with a huge laugh."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/feb/26/ryan-wilson-cited-nathan-hughes-calcutta-cup-scotland-england","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-26T21:15:06Z","webTitle":"Scotland’s Ryan Wilson cited for Calcutta Cup clash with Nathan Hughes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/feb/26/ryan-wilson-cited-nathan-hughes-calcutta-cup-scotland-england","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/feb/26/ryan-wilson-cited-nathan-hughes-calcutta-cup-scotland-england","fields":{"headline":"Scotland’s Ryan Wilson cited for Calcutta Cup clash with Nathan Hughes","bodyText":"As the fallout from the tunnel fracas before England’s Calcutta Cup defeat rumbles on Ryan Wilson, the Scotland No 8 who clashed with Owen Farrell during the scuffle, has been cited for allegedly making contact with Nathan Hughes’s eye area in a separate incident shortly before half-time. Wilson faces a Six Nations disciplinary hearing on Wednesday when he will learn his availability for Scotland’s final matches against Ireland and Italy. If he is suspended, the low-end entry point is four weeks, while the high-end ranges from 12-52. New footage of Saturday’s bust-up in the tunnel involving Wilson and Farrell has emerged. Farrell can be seen running through a crowd of players from both sides while further ahead Wilson appears to say something to George Ford. When Farrell reaches Wilson a scuffle breaks out before the footage, which has been posted on social media, cuts out. It is understood the pair had to be separated by team-mates. England intended to argue Farrell did not instigate the fracas, following a demand from Six Nations Rugby for both unions to explain the incident. Six Nations Rugby will decide if disciplinary action is warranted after considering both responses. Hughes has not been cited for his role in the on-field incident with Wilson and was on Monday named in England’s 27-man squad alongside Elliot Daly, while the Harlequins prop Kyle Sinckler is also called up. Daly has been sidelined since December because of ankle and calf injuries but his inclusion suggests he will be available to face France on Saturday week when Eddie Jones’s side will seek to put the defence of their Six Nations title back on track. Daly was expected to miss the whole of the Six Nations but was temporarily back in camp with England before the victory over Wales. His return is a considerable boost for Jones. Daly started all five Six Nations matches last year, all three British &amp; Irish Lions Tests over the summer as well as the three autumn internationals, in which he was among England’s outstanding performers. Sinckler was named in Jones’s initial Six Nations squad but suffered a hamstring injury shortly before the pre-tournament training camp in Portugal. He was expected to be out of action for up to seven weeks but made his comeback for Harlequins earlier this month. Jones has been forced to adjust his initial plans for the second fallow week of the Six Nations owing to the bad weather sweeping across the UK and only 19 of the 27-strong squad – including Daly and Sinckler – will attend a three-day camp in Oxford. The remaining eight players will attend regional camps at England’s regular base in Bagshot and at Wasps, Leicester and Saracens with a focus on “reconditioning”. It is in contrast to the previous fallow week in which England arranged two full-blooded training sessions against Georgia. The Harlequins quartet of Mike Brown, Chris Robshaw, Danny Care and Joe Marler will be in Bagshot, while Mako Vunipola and Richard Wigglesworth will be with Saracens. Joe Launchbury and Dan Cole will be at Wasps and Leicester respectively. Wales have confirmed they will play a summer match against South Africa in Washington DC before their two-Test tour of Argentina. The game at Washington’s RFK stadium is expected to generate significant revenues with one of Wales’s main sponsors, Under Armour, based nearby in Baltimore. “The opportunity to expand the already great Welsh support base and Welsh brand is very exciting for us as especially in such a large demographic and audience as the US,” said the WRU chief executive, Martyn Phillips. The fixture could also indirectly benefit England with the Springboks beginning a three-Test series against Jones’s side in Johannesburg a week later."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"music/2018/feb/26/amy-winehouse-demo-recorded-at-17-to-attract-labels-is-released-online","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-26T22:39:08Z","webTitle":"Amy Winehouse demo recorded at 17 to attract labels is released online","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/feb/26/amy-winehouse-demo-recorded-at-17-to-attract-labels-is-released-online","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/feb/26/amy-winehouse-demo-recorded-at-17-to-attract-labels-is-released-online","fields":{"headline":"Amy Winehouse demo recorded at 17 to attract labels is released online","bodyText":"An Amy Winehouse demo recorded when the singer was just 17 has been released by a London producer. Winehouse’s unfinished demos were destroyed by her label after her death in 2011 to prevent the creation of posthumous albums, but Gil Cang, a composer and musician from Camden, has uploaded a recording of the singer as a teenager to YouTube. Cang told the Camden New Journal Winehouse sang the track ‘My Own Way’ – that he co-wrote with James McMillan – while trying to attract the attention of record labels prior to signing for Island Records in 2003. “We’d been writing quite a lot of pop tunes, doing a lot of pop promos with various artists who would come in, many of various, dubious talent. It was at a particularly dire time in the pop world – lots of terrible, terrible girl bands and boy bands and we had to make something for them. Amy came in to see us, opened her mouth and just blew us all away,” Cang told the local paper. “We were struck immediately by her talent – it was a real jaw on the floor moment. We were like wow, yes,” he added. Following the singer’s death in 2011, Universal released a posthumous album of B-sides and covers titled Lioness: Hidden Treasures. The album was not well received, so Universal UK CEO David Joseph destroyed the remainder of Winehouse’s unfinished demos. “It was a moral thing,” Joseph told the Guardian in 2015. “Taking a stem or a vocal is not something that would ever happen on my watch. It now can’t happen on anyone else’s.” On his decision to upload the song to the internet, Cang said: “I’ve had it knocking about for so long. I found it again last week and thought – I’ll put it out there so people could hear it.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"money/2018/feb/26/plans-to-cap-domestic-energy-bills-weak-and-confused-say-mps","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-26T20:34:26Z","webTitle":"Plans to cap domestic energy bills 'weak and confused', says watchdog","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/feb/26/plans-to-cap-domestic-energy-bills-weak-and-confused-say-mps","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2018/feb/26/plans-to-cap-domestic-energy-bills-weak-and-confused-say-mps","fields":{"headline":"Plans to cap domestic energy bills 'weak and confused', says watchdog","bodyText":"The evidence underpinning ministers’ plans to cap the energy bills of millions of people has been slammed as “weak and confused” by the government’s own watchdog. As the government laid the legislation for the cap in parliament, the regulatory policy committee delivered a withering verdict on the case for a measure that Theresa May said was necessary to stop “rip-off” tariffs. The committee said the government had not offered “any evidence in support” of its decision to cap the standard variable tariffs of 11m households, a move the competition watchdog expressly advised against two years ago. “In general, the evidence the Department [for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy] presents in support of its rationale and selected option is weak, and even confused,” the watchdog said. Officials were criticised for providing a limited and optimistic view of the possible market distortions the cap might have. The committee added that it was of “particular concern” that the business department had also failed to give even indicative costs of the scheme, such as those that might be borne by energy suppliers. A spokesperson for BEIS said: “The RPC rated our evidence to support plans to cap energy bills as green or ‘fit-for-purpose’.” However, the scathing report by the regulatory policy committee will be an embarrassment for the government, which published the legislation on Monday in order to impose the cap by next winter. Ministers argue consumers are overpaying for energy by £1.4bn a year because of the difference between the best and worst value tariffs. “It’s often older people or those on low incomes who are stuck on rip-off energy tariffs, so today we are introducing legislation to force energy companies to change their ways,” the prime minister said. Greg Clark, the business secretary, warned the big six energy companies against legal challenges to the cap, telling them in a letter on Monday that he hoped they would “work constructively” with government. Clark has also told Dermot Nolan, the chief executive of energy regulator Ofgem, to consult with firms on the cap while the legislation passes through parliament in the next five months. Under the plan, Ofgem will be required to review the level of the cap every six months. Analysts believe the cap could be set at around £1,050, about £100 lower than the most expensive standard variable tariffs. Consumer group Citizens Advice welcomed the government moving ahead with the cap. “This bill should go some way to ending the unacceptable overcharging of loyal customers, and will cut prices for 12m households currently stuck on poor value default tariffs,” said Gillian Guy, the group’s chief executive."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"sport/blog/2018/feb/26/english-players-back-yards-scotland-comfort-zone","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-26T20:48:00Z","webTitle":"Stepping outside their back yards could help English players grow | Robert Kitson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/feb/26/english-players-back-yards-scotland-comfort-zone","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2018/feb/26/english-players-back-yards-scotland-comfort-zone","fields":{"headline":"Stepping outside their back yards could help English players grow","bodyText":"Maybe it is just a coincidence but the following among Scotland’s weekend heroes all share something in common. What is it that links Finn Russell, John Barclay, Grant Gilchrist, Jonny Gray, Huw Jones and Gregor Townsend, not to mention Ireland’s latest man-of-the-match centre Chris Farrell? Here is a clue: all the leading modern Test coaches have also done something similar, as did England’s World Cup-winning captain, Martin Johnson. The answer is thought-provoking: each has been fundamentally shaped by a spell outside his domestic comfort zone. The smart, forward-thinking Townsend could have remained a big fish in the Borders for his entire career; instead he sought to experience club rugby in Australia, France, England and South Africa. Before returning to Scotland Jones shot to prominence with Western Province having headed to South Africa after school with no English clubs showing any interest. Farrell played 74 games for Grenoble in France; small wonder he looked entirely at ease on an unfamiliar stage against Wales last Saturday. Barclay, Gilchrist, Gray and Russell are all past recipients of the John Macphail Rugby Scholarship, funded by the Robertson Trust, which allows the most talented young Scottish players and coaches to spend a few months overseas having their eyes opened to top‑level rugby standards in the southern hemisphere. The quartet were dispatched to Canterbury in New Zealand in 2005, 2011, 2012 and 2013 respectively; the latest intake comprising Angus Fraser of Dundee HSFP, Andrew Jardine of Melrose and Guy Kelly of Biggar flew out to South Africa in January for five months. Johnson, famously, represented NZ Colts after initially heading down to play a bit of club rugby. The man who brought him over, John Albert, had written to the Rugby Football Union asking if it could forward his contact details to their age-group players; five ended up coming to New Zealand. For Johnson it was like stepping into a parallel universe. “We picked him up at Auckland and on the drive down to Taupo he kept flinching,” Albert said later. “Every time a logging truck went past he ducked. He was petrified.” The locals, apparently, were not instantly impressed. “They weren’t all brilliant rugby players but they were tough. They thought Martin was soft and told him to harden up.” The rest is rugby history. A shoulder injury frustrated any prospect of New Zealand poaching Johnson – “There’s nothing surer than he would have been an All Black,” said the late Sir Colin Meads – but the big man did arrive back in the Midlands with a keener appreciation of what properly aggressive forward play looked and felt like. Bumping into him outside Murrayfield on Saturday – and listening to him on television predicting a massive reaction in Paris on Saturday week – was to be reminded how much England relied on his rugby intelligence and leadership when he was captain. It feels like an area England should be re-examining now. Dylan Hartley is another example of someone whose Kiwi upbringing has shaped his hard-nosed rugby outlook – it is probably among the reasons why Eddie Jones appointed him captain. But how many of England’s younger players have had their characters forged outside the academy system, off the beaten track, away from the protective arms of their local club? Aside from the Fiji-born Nathan Hughes and Mako Vunipola very few of Saturday’s 23 have lived or played club rugby outside England for any length of time. Joe Launchbury had a short stint as a young man in South Africa and Sam Underhill has played and studied in Wales but the rest have predominantly learned all they know about rugby and life in their own back yards, save for tours and away games. Contrast that with Chris Ashton, Nick Abendanon, David Strettle, Jonny Wilkinson, James Haskell and Carl Fearns, all of whom have moved to France (plus Japan and New Zealand in Haskell’s case) and enjoyed a new lease of rugby life. It is a similarly revealing story with coaches. Stuart Lancaster, Andy Farrell, Ben Ryan and Richard Cockerill can all testify to the value of operating in a foreign environment, as would Jones, Joe Schmidt, Warren Gatland, Conor O’Shea, Mike Catt and others. Of the best up-and-coming young English coaches only Steve Borthwick, Dave Walder, Alex Sanderson, Joe Worsley and Rory Teague have spent significant spells overseas. It is an area the RFU is looking into, with talk of sabbaticals for aspiring homegrown coaches. As things stand no English players are permitted to play outside England if they wish to remain eligible for the national team. That stance clearly has its benefits but, equally, does not always foster the type of instinctive resourcefulness England needed to prosper in hostile, unfamiliar circumstances. It was also instructive to listen to Townsend, Barclay, Russell and Huw Jones after the match: all came across as impressively normal, well‑rounded human beings as opposed to endlessly briefed battery hens. A coincidence? Possibly not. BACK TO THE FUTURE Perhaps the most interesting aspect of Scotland’s Calcutta Cup success was the specialist type of player around whom it was based. Tearaway, ground-hogging flankers and free-spirited fly-halves have been out of fashion for some years; the modern Test lexicon is peppered instead with endless talk of “winning the collisions”, “physicality” and “pragmatism”. All hail, then, Hamish Watson, John Barclay and Finn Russell for showing games can still be won in other ways. Hopefully it will encourage others to question the orthodoxy that has latterly overlooked the value of quick thinking, pace off the mark, artful dodging and, when appropriate, the occasional visionary long pass. If it helps England, in particular, to unearth a modern-day successor to Neil Back, last Saturday’s defeat will not have been in vain. ONE TO WATCH There have been some very interesting results in the Premiership and Pro14 during the Six Nations and this weekend could also prove significant. In England the top two collide when Exeter face Saracens at Sandy Park; a Chiefs win could see the visitors edged out of automatic home draw territory. In Llanelli, Scarlets and Leinster will offer an appetising sequel to the Ireland-Wales game in Dublin, with both sides jostling for the leadership of Conference B."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"books/2018/mar/15/johnsons-brexit-dictionary-by-harry-eyres-and-george-myerson-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-15T10:00:33Z","webTitle":"Johnson’s Brexit Dictionary by Harry Eyres & George Myerson review – a satirical A to Z","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/mar/15/johnsons-brexit-dictionary-by-harry-eyres-and-george-myerson-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/mar/15/johnsons-brexit-dictionary-by-harry-eyres-and-george-myerson-review","fields":{"headline":"Johnson’s Brexit Dictionary by Harry Eyres and George Myerson review – a satirical A to Z","bodyText":"The official language of Brexit promotion has if nothing else been a masterclass in sonorously noncommittal windiness – who knows to this day what the “deep and special partnership” we seek with the EU actually involves? – allied to carefully implied falsehoods, as in the promise to “take back control” of what we already had perfectly good control over. It is a ripe subject for a case study in contemporary Unspeak by some cynical saboteur intent on talking down Britain’s glorious post-EU future. That indeed seems to be the aim of this tiny squib of a lexicon, the conceit of which is that it is written by the great Augustan lexicographer Samuel Johnson himself. So there is a sprinkling of 18th-century grammar and archaic spelling, along with invented quotations as if from Shakespeare et al. (Among its fictional characters is a certain “Sir Boris”, portrayed as a lying Shakespearean buffoon.) There is a mildly satirical tone throughout, as in the definition of “traitor”: “A person who being trusted betrays; one who disagrees in any way with Brexit”. Or “remain”: “To be left out of a greater quantity or number, as for example, 48% is left out of 100%.” Unfortunately for any ambitions the book might have as a contribution to the understanding of public language, the example quotations from actual Brexit arguments are made up, too, and attributed to newspapers such as “The Daily Chain Mail” or characters such as “Mistress May”. With no analysis of how Brexit terms have actually been used in context, the book falls back on the kind of pseudo-antiquarian weak humour that would probably amuse Jacob Rees-Mogg. Let us, then, turn with relief to the real Dr Johnson, who in his Dictionary defined “cant” as meaning “a particular form of speaking peculiar to some certain class or body of men”, or “a whining pretension to goodness, in formal and affected terms”, or “a corrupt dialect used by beggars and vagabonds”. The rhetoric of Brexit would surely have led him to exclaim that it was cant in all three senses simultaneously. Brexit Dictionary by Harry Eyres &amp; George Myerson (Pushkin, £7.99).

His life’s work found expression in his book Logic, Form and Grammar, published by Routledge in 2001. But this volume, groundbreaking and important as it was, gives only a partial impression of his personal style. Peter’s seminars on logical theory, Gottlob Frege and Ludwig Wittgenstein remain with me after 50 years as shining examples of creative thinking. Never didactic, he did philosophy in front of his students and encouraged us to join in: but in such a way that flattering imitation was never an option. Students who wanted something to write down and repeat got short shrift and rarely lasted. To be accepted as one worth talking to felt like an honour. Later, Peter was a loyal friend, though often irascible and frustrated by a philistine world. One of twin brothers, Peter had come from a working-class family in Macclesfield, Cheshire, and took an enduring delight in membership of the Oxford and Cambridge Club. His father drove a hearse and his mother looked after the house. Peter left school at 14 and was apprenticed to a pharmacist, while also learning Latin and Greek at evening classes. After national service in India, he went to University College London, where he studied philosophy under AJ Ayer, graduating with a first. After a year as a teaching assistant at UCL, he won a prize fellowship to Trinity College, Cambridge, studying and teaching there for three years before moving to Leeds. In 1979 he translated into English, with Roger White, Frege’s posthumous writings He remained at Leeds until his retirement in the early 1990s. He was socially at his best in a domestic setting: sitting late into the night over a bottle of claret, listening to or talking about music, reciting poetry. His great passions were Mozart, Shakespeare’s sonnets and the poems of WB Yeats. He turned his painstakingly decorated house in Leeds, complete with Steinway piano, into a salon where his friends gathered to hear performances by established musicians, many of whom became Peter’s personal friends. Peter never sought promotion or publicity. But to those who knew him he set a standard that keeps hope in the value of philosophy alive.

Scott Westgarth, a 31-year-old light-heavyweight who came to boxing late and left it too early, has died after winning the 10th fight of his short professional career. He will have no say in the agonised discussions to follow, except as collateral evidence. Rolling bulletins on Monday morning – some of them brief mentions tacked on to the affairs of state and passing concern about the worsening weather – generated the first wave of familiar sadness and predictable controversy. The sport rose as one to laud a warrior, whether the defenders knew Westgarth well or not, because they understand the sacrifices and dangers of their calling better than the abolitionists they realised would soon be added to the noise. Westgarth and Scunthorpe’s Dec Spelman, the unbeaten 26-year-old favourite, each hit the floor in a hard, close contest. But the older man got up in the 10th to prevail against the odds, 95-92. The unclaimed prize was a shot at the English title, a minor belt that can lead to bigger nights. Westgarth finished his ringside interview, later collapsed and was taken to hospital. He did not recover, joining more than 500 pugilists in the long history of the sport who have given up their lives in the ring. Mike Towell was the last British boxer to die from boxing injuries, the day after losing to Dale Evans in Glasgow in September, 2016. Saturday night’s promoter, Stefy Bull, described Westgarth as, “a young man doing a job he loves”. Very few don’t love it, even those who are damaged by it. Michael Watson was sometimes seen ringside at fights in his wheelchair years after he emerged from his 1991 bout with Chris Eubank a shell of the fine fighter he once was; Spencer Oliver, who spent a week in a coma after his last fight, in 1998, is an articulate and passionate commentator still; Nick Blackwell, sadly, was so enchanted by the calling he came back from a coma induced by his dreadful experience against Chris Eubank’s son, Junior, in 2016, to spar again, to the alarm of everyone. Meanwhile doctors and horrified citizens will rush to every proffered microphone to call for an end to what they regard as barbaric and pointless behaviour. They see the blood and bruises and exploitation – all of which are plainly on view. Their concerns should not be ignored. But they do not see beneath the skin of the fighters, who share their trepidation but not their perspective. Bob Westerdale, who writes about boxing for the Sheffield Star, knew Westgarth better than most. “On a personal note,” he said in his paper on Monday, “I cannot get out of my mind the last words Scott spoke to me: Boxing is about taking risks and I will take them.” Westerdale said of the “edginess” he detected in boxers: “It’s in their eyes. They possess an inner darkness needed to take themselves to a bad place – a hidden reserve required to take their opponent somewhere even worse. Out of the ring I never got that impression about Scott Westgarth, at all. Such was his lust for life, his brightness of personality and engaging chatter, he just didn’t seem like your normal boxer.” Westgarth, a Geordie boxing out of Sheffield, had no amateur bouts and went straight to the pros, at 24. Some will say he might have been better off in one of his old jobs: a snowboard instructor who no doubt celebrated the bronze medal another free spirit, Billy Morgan, won at the Winter Olympics last week. Westgarth was also a chef at the Royal Victoria Holiday Inn in Sheffield. His gym mates at Glyn Rhodes’s Sheffield Boxing Centre in Hillsborough loved his sense of humour. He had no enemies in a sport that accommodates much resentment. Curtis Woodhouse, the former footballer whose main event on Saturday night, against John Wayne Hibbert, an eliminator for the Commonwealth light-welterweight title, was cancelled along with the rest of the show, wonders about his future in the sport. “My condolences and thoughts go out to Scott’s family, friends and all those who knew him, it’s so heart-breaking,” Woodhouse told the Hull Daily Mail. “You forget sometimes how dangerous a sport this is. Events like this leave you questioning whether you want to continue in the sport. I’m sure there will be a lot of soul searching for everyone.” Bull, whose own last bout, in 2010 was against Woodhouse, joined the queue on social media to reiterate his condolences. “God bless @scottwestgarth 2 promote a Boxing show and a young man doing a job he loves losing his life I have no words RIP lad thoughts go out 2 yr family and yr team it’s been the hardest few days I’ve had to endure no idea what 2 do moving forward.” But life does move forward. On BT Sport on Monday morning, a three-hour tribute to Muhammad Ali celebrated the greatest heavyweight of them all. There was social media chat about Callum Smith’s win over the Dutchman Nieky Holzken in Nuremberg on Saturday night and how the Liverpudlian might fare against George Groves when they meet in London in the summer. An email reported the Rio Olympian Anthony Fowler would return to the ring on the undercard of Dillian Whyte’s heavyweight fight against Lucas Browne at the end of March. A few of us joined Whyte in London in the afternoon. It was not a joyous occasion. Everyone spared time to reflect on Westgarth’s death – especially the fighters present. But they will all move on. On Saturday another Sheffield boxer, Kell Brook, will make his high-profile comeback after two defeats in world title fights in which he injured both eye sockets. He has had doubts about risking his sight. Now he must put those concerns aside. It is what Westgarth did. It is what they all do. • A GoFundMe page has been set up to support Scott’s family"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/09/lust-in-translation-arrival-of-the-love-hotel-divides-india","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-09T14:18:41Z","webTitle":"Lust in translation: arrival of the 'love hotel' divides India","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/09/lust-in-translation-arrival-of-the-love-hotel-divides-india","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/09/lust-in-translation-arrival-of-the-love-hotel-divides-india","fields":{"headline":"Lust in translation: arrival of the 'love hotel' divides India","bodyText":"Police swept through the Mumbai hotels at about 3pm, going room to room, arresting more than 40 unmarried couples. All were charged. The college students were forced to call their parents and admit what they had done. Their crime was “indecent behaviour in public”, the police said. For couples without marriage certificates in India – especially those of different faiths – spending time in a hotel room together can still be a struggle. But where many Indians see immorality, others in the country’s digital startup industry have seen opportunity. “We have a guaranteed promise,” says hotel entrepreneur Blajoj “Blaze” Arizanov. “No knocks on the door, no weird stares, no questions asked.” For nearly three years Arizanov, a Macedonian, and his Indian co-founder, Sanchit Sethi, have been pursuing an unlikely goal: to bring a version of Japan’s short-stay “love hotels”, designed for urgent amorous encounters, to India. StayUncle, their company, added its 800th hotel partner in February and clocked up $3m in total sales. The startup is helping to drive a more couple-friendly attitude across the Indian hotel industry – even if society is still catching up. “Even today, around half of my team doesn’t tell their family they work for StayUncle,” Arizanov says. StayUncle started in 2015 as a hotel aggregator, selling half-day stays aimed at business people seeking a nap or somewhere to freshen up. But sales were slow. “It wasn’t a problem to die for,” Arizanov says. “As a startup, you want to solve a problem that is of severe importance.” In the meantime, the website was being inundated with couples seeking privacy. “We got to know they were coming to us because they couldn’t book a hotel with local IDs,” he says. “It was a tragic thing – but maybe the opportunity we had been scouting for all this time.” Winning over hotels was the hardest step. Eight out of 10 dismissed the idea outright. “They said no, it’s against law, it’s immoral, blah blah blah,” Arizanov says. Asking them to shed their old-fashioned ideas rarely worked. What did, however, was an appeal to the hip pocket – and the rapid growth of Airbnb. “We told them, you can choose to be conservative, or you can open your eyes to the opportunity,” Arizanov says. “There are thousands of young people with well-earning jobs and lots of free money who want to have fun. And if you reject them Airbnb will take your piece of the pie.” Most hotels were satisfied when the money started flowing, and many now approach StayUncle asking to be listed. But Arizanov says he still “mercilessly” cuts at least 10 each month for being insufficiently discreet. Other hotels have asked to be taken off the website after seeing StayUncle’s provocative marketing. When the company posted a picture on Facebook of two Hindu deities checking into a room, it got death threats. When Arizanov insisted on calling the website’s blog Naughty Sita, after another Hindu god, staff threatened to quit. (It was retitled Naughty Bharat, or Naughty India, last month.) Dressed in a black turtleneck, with shoulder-length hair, Arizanov, 29, looks like a thoroughly modern prophet as he propounds his philosophy of business. “We have to be controversial to survive,” he says. But his Indian colleagues are less breezy. “I was struggling with the idea,” says his co-founder, Sethi. “The struggle is continuing.” The business is still an awkward subject in his family, who are from a small city near the holy city of Varanasi. “Some of them, who have more progressive minds are OK,” he says. “Others are still on their way to accepting it.” StayUncle’s greatest threat may be competition. India’s largest network of budget accommodation, Oyo, recently introduced a “relationship mode”, listing hotels that have agreed not to hassle unmarried couples. Arizanov is convinced the concept will boom in India. After all, he says, Japan, where they were pioneered, is a conservative country too. “They’re going to be an escape route,” he says. “Rather than let that repressed sexual energy pile up and manifest in some other way, we are helping them dissolve in some alternative channel, quietly.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/feb/26/the-guardian-view-on-chinas-leadership-strong-but-not-stable","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-26T18:31:51Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on China’s leadership: strong but not stable? | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/26/the-guardian-view-on-chinas-leadership-strong-but-not-stable","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/26/the-guardian-view-on-chinas-leadership-strong-but-not-stable","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on China’s leadership: strong but not stable?","bodyText":"Anyone shocked to learn that Xi Jinping intends to continue indefinitely as China’s president was not paying attention. Every indication was there. The surprise is that he spelt it out so quickly and bluntly, with Sunday’s announcement that the Communist party plans to scrap the two-term limit that would have seen him depart in 2023. He is an “emperor”, say his critics, “president for life”. Not so, insisted a state-run tabloid – but it simultaneously invoked the need for strong and “consistent” leadership as far ahead as 2035, or even the middle of the century (when Mr Xi will be 96). In fact, he does not need to change the rules; there is no term limit for heading the party and central military commission – his real sources of power. Whether he is acting from strength, or to ward off potential challenges, it is a statement of intent. An increasingly powerful, forceful man is telling the world that he plans to run his increasingly powerful, forceful country for the foreseeable future. This “is the reverse of history … a statement of ‘no’ to the reforms China had achieved in the past 40 years”, warned student leaders from Tiananmen and other prominent pro-democracy exiles, usually harsh critics of the Communist party’s record. The elite survivors of Maoism’s disasters – Mr Xi’s father among them – vowed to prevent another strongman ever emerging. They sought to collectivise and institutionalise politics, through measures such as term limits. It seems unlikely that their successors anticipated how quickly and thoroughly Mr Xi would consolidate power. But no one could do this entirely alone; they opened the door. Many had come to believe that the party-state was mired by inertia and corruption. The weakness of the last leadership, the way vested interests fended off much-needed changes, and increasingly open public discontent made the status quo look unsatisfactory and unsustainable. Instead of dispersing power, the party chose to concentrate it. This repressive turn began before Mr Xi came to power in 2012. He has doubled down on it, and personalised it. His anti-corruption drive has removed potential opposition. It has also, with his pledge of national rejuvenation, struck a chord with many ordinary people. The argument for concentrated leadership is even easier in the age of Trump, Brexit and the rise of populism: a firm hand is needed to guide the country through such choppy waters; democracy leads to chaos and decline. Some still suggest he is amassing power to push through long-promised reforms, and wants to avoid becoming a lame duck as he nears the exit. But those who have amassed great power rarely choose to loosen their grip. There is a reason China prided itself in “solving” (with glitches) the succession problem. Unlike most authoritarian regimes, it has not waited for the death of the top man, nor passed his job on to a son or brother. It promised its citizens that leaders got there on merit, and would change regularly. Meanwhile, officials had the prospect of advancing and the confidence that rivals and enemies were restrained while in power. Mr Xi’s opponents see few checks on him now and cannot expect to simply wait him out. And he has personalised his rule to an extent he may regret if the economy or foreign policy goes badly awry. Though so many have been silenced in recent years, the depth of alarm at this move is evident – and rightly so. In the short term, there is likely to be more repression, with critics inside and outside the party forced into line. In the longer term, China may well find, as previous leaders recognised, that strongmen can mean anything but stability."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/feb/28/italian-left-weekend-elections-working-class-europe","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-28T13:00:14Z","webTitle":"Why the Italian left looks doomed in this weekend’s elections | James Newell","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/28/italian-left-weekend-elections-working-class-europe","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/28/italian-left-weekend-elections-working-class-europe","fields":{"headline":"Why the Italian left looks doomed in this weekend’s elections","bodyText":"The prospects for the left in the upcoming Italian general election do not look good, divided as it is between the mainstream Democratic party (PD) and a variety of radical left groupings, many of which have come under the umbrella of Liberi e Uguali (Free and Equal), headed by senate president Pietro Grasso. The last opinion poll put the PD on 22.7% and Free and Equal on 5.4%. The electoral system, which distributes over a third of the seats according to first-past-the-post, will almost certainly ensure that the left pays dearly for its divisions. From one point of view, the unpopularity of the PD – which has been the mainstay of the governing coalition and which reached a high of 41% in the 2014 European election – is puzzling. The Italian economy is picking up. The government has received praise from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development and in other quarters for a series of structural reforms deemed essential to raising productivity and investment. The prime minister, the PD’s Paolo Gentiloni, is the most popular of the major parties’ spokespersons. There are two answers to this puzzle. The first is that although the PD has been campaigning hard on its record, the man who personifies this – Gentiloni – is unable to translate approval ratings into support for his party because he is not its leader, and voters know that none of the competing parties or electoral coalitions are likely to emerge with an overall majority on Sunday. Italian elections are no longer contests between two prime ministerial candidates competing for majorities as they were when Silvio Berlusconi was at the height of his power. Thanks to the emergence of the Five Star Movement as a significant “third force”, the composition and the head of the incoming government will be decided by negotiations after the election. Consequently, a vote for the PD is not necessarily a vote for a Gentiloni premiership, and the party’s actual leader, Matteo Renzi, is unpopular. Such short-term considerations aside, the left is struggling in Italy for the same reasons that it is struggling in the rest of Europe. Since the collapse of the Berlin wall, unbridled capitalism has been the only game in town; and concomitantly, parties of the left have lost the last vestiges of their former cultural ascendency. In the UK, Labour and the postwar social democratic consensus gave way to New Labour and “the third way”. In Italy, the mighty Communist party and working people’s clubs made way for a succession of non-communist parties and for Berlusconi’s Canale 5. Consequently, the left is not strong enough to provide representation for a working class that no longer identifies itself as such, feels threatened by mass migration, and perceives a growing gap between itself and the elites. Those elites are no longer just politicians, bankers and wealthy industrialists, but the well-educated in salaried employment – those who, by virtue of their education, are protected from the insecurities of globalisation, are comfortable with its associated cultural changes, and who, like the owners of capital, enjoy positions of privilege. The consequence has been division between a “respectable” left and an anti-establishment radical left. While the former has sought, through the formation of the PD in 2007, a governing role in alliance with left-leaning former Christian Democrats, it has struggled to appeal to working-class voters over and against the claims of the anti-immigrant populists. The radical left, while appealing to the better educated in salaried occupations, struggles to make headway against the equally anti-establishment Five Star Movement. For so long a beacon for the left elsewhere in Europe, the Italian left is struggling to present anything resembling a popular response to the social and economic crises of the early 21st century. • James Newell is a professor of politics at Salford University and author of The Politics of Italy: Governance in a Normal Country"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"higher-education-network/2018/feb/28/qs-world-university-rankings-2018-dentistry","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-28T13:30:22Z","webTitle":"QS world university rankings 2018: dentistry","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2018/feb/28/qs-world-university-rankings-2018-dentistry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/higher-education-network/2018/feb/28/qs-world-university-rankings-2018-dentistry","fields":{"headline":"QS world university rankings 2018: dentistry","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/feb/26/jane-walker-black-label-whisky-celebrate-international-womens-day-diageo","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-26T18:22:27Z","webTitle":"Step aside, Johnnie!

Jane Walker whisky to celebrate women","bodyText":"Johnnie Walker is rolling out a female version of its whisky in the US – Jane Walker. A limited edition run of its 12-year-old Black Label blended whisky will feature a striding woman on the label rather than the top-hatted man normally associated with the brand. The brand’s London-based owner, Diageo, the world’s largest spirits company, is hoping the March launch will widen the appeal of the product while celebrating women. The move comes as the UK trade associations representing the beer industry draw up a code of conduct to eliminate sexism in their sector, including offensive imagery on pump clips and labels, to prevent alienating a growing band of female beer drinkers, brewers, sommeliers and writers. Diageo said: “As a brand that has stood for progress for nearly 200 years, Johnnie Walker is proud to take this next step forward by introducing Jane Walker as another symbol of the brand’s commitment to progress.” The first major change to its logo in more than a century comes as Diageo and its rivals seek to attract more female drinkers. For every bottle of Jane Walker sold, Diageo will donate $1 (72p) to organisations supporting women’s causes. The release, on 1 March, comes a week before International Women’s Day. Johnnie Walker – established in Kilmarnock in 1820 by John Walker – is one of Diageo’s oldest whisky brands. The launch comes as the #TimesUp movement continues against sexual harassment.

Although it only hovered in the air for 53 seconds, the fact that its eight rotors were powered entirely by electricity was a landmark for the manufacturer of gas-guzzling planes. The goal is that the technology could be used for airborne travel in congested cities. “Our goal is to democratise personal flight by leveraging the latest technologies such as electric propulsion, energy storage and machine vision,” blogged Zach Lovering, Vahana project executive. Ehang 184 Chinese drone manufacturer Ehang is considerably more advanced than Airbus. In February it flew 40 journalists and local dignitaries on trips of up to 15km in Guangzhou, southern China, reaching top speeds of 80mph. To fly, passengers simply mark their destination on a map and the drone creates and executes a flight plan. Ehang claims the craft is robust enough to withstand thunderstorms and typhoons – in the event of problems it can be piloted remotely from a control centre. Volocopter The German company behind this 18-rotor, two-person air taxi is backed by Daimler and recently struck a partnership deal with Intel. Their latest model, the 2X, is capable of 30 minutes of flight – designers are aiming for a full hour, which they think will be sufficient for typical shuttles across most major cities. Risk of crashing is diminished by nine battery packs – in the event of catastrophic failure a ballistic parachute will save the day. The craft are being tested in Dubai. Uber Elevate Uber is developing several air taxi concepts. Last November the taxi firm signed a deal with Nasa to develop on-demand, 200mph electric aircraft that would begin testing in gridlocked Los Angeles in 2020, with a view to having the service fully operational for the city’s 2028 Olympics. Last month it announced a project with helicopter manufacturer Bell to begin flying air taxis in Fort Worth, Texas by 2023. Back in 2016 it published a 98-page white paper analysing the technical and regulatory hurdles that would have to be overcome before taxis become airborne. Lilium In April 2017 this Munich-based startup demonstrated the first unmanned flight of its two-seater prototype VTOL vertical take-off and landing jet. Powered by 36 electric jet engines, rather than rotors, the craft could reach speeds of 185mph. Lilium claims the 19-mile journey from New York’s JFK airport to Manhattan would take five minutes in its air taxi compared with 55 minutes by car; it also says the fare would be around 50% less. Lilium hope to have the service operational by 2025."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"cities/2018/aug/03/all-weather-friendship-but-is-pakistan-relying-too-heavily-on-china","type":"article","sectionId":"cities","sectionName":"Cities","webPublicationDate":"2018-08-03T06:15:05Z","webTitle":"'All-weather friendship': but is Pakistan relying too heavily on China?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/aug/03/all-weather-friendship-but-is-pakistan-relying-too-heavily-on-china","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/cities/2018/aug/03/all-weather-friendship-but-is-pakistan-relying-too-heavily-on-china","fields":{"headline":"'All-weather friendship': but is Pakistan relying too heavily on China?","bodyText":"Chen Zhu, a 46-year-old director of a Chinese shipping company in Karachi, Pakistan, was sitting in his car after finishing lunch. He had dispensed with his normal security since it was a public holiday, and his next task for the day was to buy some groceries. An unknown assailant crossed the road, approached Chen’s car and shot him nine times. He was declared dead soon after reaching hospital. The motive for what was clearly a pre-planned attack is not just of interest to the police and Zhu’s family. If it was a killing designed to threaten Karachi’s growing Chinese business community, it underlines how Pakistan’s decision to place so much of its economy in the hands of state investors from its much larger neighbour is resented by those who fear the country will become a de facto colony of China. The framework for the economic alliance is a deal known as the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) unveiled when Xi Jinping, the Chinese president, came to Pakistan in 2015. CPEC is a series of mainly Chinese-financed energy and infrastructure projects totalling upwards of $62bn in grants and soft loans – of which around $26bn is earmarked for power plants. The project is branded around the theme of connectivity: power stations, ports, dams, transmission lines, roads and fibre optic cables linking Pakistan to the Chinese internet. Among projects to be completed in 2018 are a mass-transit light railway in Lahore, and a coal-fired power plant in Karachi. Concerns over China’s ambitious Belt and Road Initiative have been expressed from Germany to Australia, but such worries do not find many echoes in Islamabad or Karachi, Pakistan’s largest port and commercial capital. Pakistan has taken a huge strategic bet with China, and few mainstream politicians are challenging this gamble, save to demand their region gets a larger slice of cash. Both military and civilians say this will be the Chinese century – and it is Pakistan’s good fortune to be in with China on the ground floor. The official rhetoric is all about “an all-weather friendship between iron brothers”. Muhammad Zubair, the governor of Sindh province and a close ally of Nawaz Sharif, the ousted prime minister, openly acknowledges the Chinese relationship is about more than economics. “It gives China the security leverage they desperately need,” he says. “Obviously they want to compete with America, and want to make as many friends as possible on the way. They see [that] Pakistan is already facing the might of India – and India is politically very close to America, so China has a clear room for manoeuvre via Pakistan. They have global ambitions, and we have been their friends long before anyone else. “My only question to CPEC’s critics is, if we had not done CPEC, what option were you proposing? Are you saying we should go to complete power blackouts and the country should go into the stone age? When someone says CPEC favours the Chinese far more than Pakistan, of course that is the case, but that will always be the case between a lender and a borrower.” The interior minister, Ahsan Iqbal, argues Pakistan had nowhere else to go. Saudi Arabia – to which the Pakistan military has just agreed to send another 1,000 troops – is the only alternative source of big cash. The benefits to China are readily apparent, says Zubair: “It is sitting on tonnes of cash and needs to invest it. We are the obvious country for political and geographical reasons.” In addition, Pakistan’s growing middle class represents a huge potential market for Chinese exports. Almost two-thirds of Pakistan’s 208 million people are aged under 30 and are driving demand in the fastest-growing retail market in the world. Pakistan’s still underdeveloped agricultural system is ripe for Chinese investment; China also wants to develop its western provinces, and needs a transit route via Pakistan to import energy and raw material from the Middle East, the Horn of Africa and sub-Saharan Africa. But CPEC may yet disappoint Pakistan. Husain Haqqani, the former Pakistan ambassador to the US and one of America’s diminishing band of Pakistani friends, says China has a history of predatory lending in developing countries that may not bode well for Pakistan. In Sri Lanka, for example, China built a port at Hambantota but the revenues have been lower than expected and Sri Lanka has been unable to service the loans. In December, it agreed to hand the port over to two Chinese state-controlled entities. In Pakistan, China also has the upper hand in a relationship already accounting for 46% of Pakistan’s trade deficit. Sirajuddin Aziz, president of the Habib Metropolitan bank, warned that CPEC should not become a vehicle to exclude other international investors. Countries such as Japan already complain that their efforts to build infrastructure in Pakistan now meet with Chinese resistance. But the biggest question is whether Pakistan’s burgeoning defence relationship with China may one day extend to granting Beijing a military base on Pakistan’s soil – one from which China could intensify its strategic rivalry with India. Jiwani, about 50 miles (80km) west of the better-known Gwadar port in Balochistan, has been most frequently mentioned as a possible site. Gwadar’s great expectations Gwadar itself, currently a small dusty fishing town 300 miles from Karachi, is the centrepiece of CPEC. In effect owned by the Chinese for the next 40 years, it will provide China with access to the Indian Ocean and the Arabian Sea. After driving on a battered two-lane highway through scrub and past a scattered town, the road looks much like anywhere else in Balochistan, until the first signs emerge that one of the great economic gambles of Pakistan is drawing close: an increase in Pakistani police, then a convoy of Chinese luxury cars and finally the looming blue cranes of Gwadar port itself. The Chinese cars, with Chinese flags, escorted by gun-carrying guards, turn right up the hill towards a five-star hotel populated by Chinese that sits at the top of the cliff overlooking the port. Below by the water’s edge stand the eight huge newly installed cranes, a business centre, a container area and the so-called Chinatown, a web of huts containing the Chinese workers who are effectively running the biggest deep water port in the area. A short boat ride out from the docks with the port managers towards the Arabian Sea reveals the sheer scale of the enterprise. The director of marine operations, Captain Gul Muhammad, says the aim is to turn Gwadar into a city of one million people with the largest port in south Asia, two enterprise free-zones with 23-year tax holidays, liquified natural gas terminals with pipelines to Karachi (home to the largest international airport in Pakistan), and a multi-lane expressway heading north through Quetta and across 1,860 miles towards the Chinese border. “From here, we can transform Pakistan. It will happen sooner than people think,” Muhammad promises. The speed of the plans to transform a fishing port may appear fantastical until you compare pictures of cities such as Doha today and 30 years ago. Then the pace of development, especially under Chinese direction, seems quite achievable, even if, right now, mundane issues such as sufficient drinking water are occupying the planners. The local community – largely fishermen – fear being shut out of the development, and there seems to be an assumption that infrastructure investment is inherently a benefit.

John Peel’s guest on his late-night radio show is the sound poet Bob Cobbing. Stationed alongside is the Scottish monologist Ivor Cutler. Urged on by his captivated host, Cobbing plays the tape of a recording made with his French collaborator François Dufrêne. What follows is a kind of aural collage from the very edge of language: repetitive pantings, groans, sighs, whispers and primal gibberish. After it judders to a halt, Peel turns to the somewhat nonplussed Cutler to inquire: has he ever tried anything similar? “You mean making a noise?” Cutler sceptically lobs back. As the spectacle of Cobbing in full shamanistic flow on a Radio 1 pop show confirms, the literary 1960s was an era in which, for the first time in nearly 40 years, the avant garde veered dangerously close to the mainstream. It was an age in which (sometimes rather to their surprise) experimental writers found themselves contracted to major commercial publishers, in which novels could cheerfully be issued in random fragments under the cover of a cardboard box (BS Johnson’s The Unfortunates), and ambitious debutants embark on their careers with the assumption that, as Eva Figes once put it: “I and a few other writers with similar ideas could change the face of English fiction.” Who were Britain’s 60s experimentalists, and what did they imagine that this “changing the face” of contemporary literature might involve? Leading lights of the novel included Johnson, Figes, Ann Quin, Alan Burns, Christine Brooke-Rose and such veterans of the prewar avant garde as Stefan Themerson and Rayner Heppenstall. (The blurb of Heppenstall’s Two Moons invited purchasers to read all the right-hand pages continuously, all the left-hand pages continuously or both narratives in parallel.) The poets brought together everyone from Cobbing, Rosemary Tonks and Tom Raworth to the young JH Prynne, whose 1968 collection Kitchen Poems opens with the thorny lines: “The whole thing it is, the difficult / matter: to shrink the confines / down.” If the techniques they espoused ranged from collage and cut-and-paste to nonlinear narratives, fragmentation and words flung randomly about the page (as in Johnson’s novel House Mother Normal), then what united them was a conviction that the modernity they inhabited needed an equally newfangled response. “I’m not sure that there’s really an about for the novel to be about any more,” remarks the avant-garde writer in Malcolm Bradbury’s Eating People Is Wrong (1959), which is not so very far from Figes’s famous line about the English social realist tradition not being able to contain the realities of her lifetime, “horrors which one might have called surreal if they had not actually happened”. In the context of postwar English literature, then dominated by figures such as Kingsley Amis, Iris Murdoch and Anthony Powell, this kind of stance was highly adversarial. If a second factor collectively enthused the titans of 60s avant garde, as they gnashed their teeth over the review pages of Sunday newspapers, it was a detestation of “the enemy”, variously located in “tradition” or “the literary establishment”. Fifties social realists such as Amis, William Cooper or CP Snow; movement poets Larkin, DJ Enright or Donald Davie; Bloomsbury biographers and dignified belletrists: all of them were seen as reactionary obstructions laid across the path of the avant garde’s forward march. As for up-and-coming but insufficiently committed contemporaries, the famously combative Johnson telephoned AS Byatt shortly after the publication of her well-received second novel, The Game (1967), to briskly inform her that she was “no competition”. David Lodge, too, in his recent volume of memoirs remembers the arrival of an anguished cri de coeur from Brooke-Rose, “a catalogue of complaints about being ignored by British academic and journalistic critics, her ideas borrowed without acknowledgment, her novels misunderstood, misrepresented or simply ignored”. It is difficult to travel very far through the jungle of postwar British literature without wondering whether some of these oppositions aren’t violently overstated. The 60s experimentalists might, in certain circumstances, have regarded themselves as a collective unit but they never amounted to a “group” in the manner of some of their continental contemporaries, and one or two of them hated each other like poison. Neither were some of them as genuinely avant garde as they believed. Johnson’s critics, for example, regularly amused themselves by proposing that he was, at heart, a thoroughly conventional writer who wore his experimentalism as a kind of plumage. Meanwhile, from the other side of the fence, to write off 50s social realism as innately staid and conservative is to ignore the well-nigh Joycean wordplay of Amis’s early dialogue or the fact that Alan Sillitoe’s French translators regarded him not as a kitchen-sink merchant but as a homegrown existentialist, Nottingham’s very own Camus. The same lack of any clear cut distinctions applies to the movement’s forebears, who can seem heterodox to the point of randomness. Figes’s starting point was Kafka. Johnson, a fan and friend of Beckett, seriously endangered his relationship with the author of Waiting for Godot by quoting some private compliments on one of his book jackets. Burns looked westward to William S Burroughs and the horrors of American consumerism (see his Dreamerika!, 1972). Quin, often thought to be the most Europeanised of the gang, left a series of notebooks that, as Jennifer Hodgson, the editor of Quin’s recent posthumous collection The Unmapped Country points out, are full of ruminations on the classics of the English canon. To a high modernist brought up on the Joyce of Finnegans Wake, all this could look horribly timid – pallid amateurs in England mucking about while the really serious action went on elsewhere. And if the 60s avant garde lacked coherence as a literary unit, then it also lacked staying power. Johnson and Quin killed themselves within a few months of each other in 1973. A discouraged Burns simply stopped writing. Brooke-Rose, who later complained about “the stifling of fiction by non-fiction on the part of the critical establishment”, retreated into a series of elliptical novels with prepositional titles such as Between and Thru. On one level, this running out of steam was chronological, a matter of 60s avant-garde fiction and poetry being tied up with the tenor of a time in which anything went – even the Beatles could employ sound collage techniques on best-selling recordings such as The White Album. At the same time, at least part of it was down to a critical hostility that brought together not only conservative pundits but the new “establishment” of the decade that followed. In retrospect, it seems significant that Giles Gordon’s anthology Beyond the Words: Eleven Writers in Search of a New Fiction (1975) should have been trashed by Martin Amis, Julian Barnes and Peter Ackroyd. Nearly five decades later, what remains? Jonathan Coe’s biography Like a Fiery Elephant (2004) established Johnson as a major if somewhat lonely figure, and also one of the most irascible self-obsessives ever to pick up a pen. (“You ignorant unliterary Americans make me puke,” begins a letter to a US publisher who had dared to turn him down.) To read House Mother Normal (1971), which explores the mental chaos of an old people’s home, is to be struck not simply by its formal trickery – several of the pages are left blank – but by an odd, fleeting lyricism. “Jesus will come for my end,” muses 85-year-old Gloria. “He will lift me up into his heavenly boudoir and I will sing with the angels all night long. The stars will shine down on me when he comes, his Milky Stout.” Quin’s debut Berg (1964) still seems an extraordinary piece of work. Spiky and constricted, it’s like a detective novel from which someone has removed the plot; or, to extend the analogy, like watching Match of the Day when someone has removed the ball and the studio-bound pundits are wearing blindfolds. “A Double Room”’, one of the pieces collected in The Unmapped Country and apparently written in the mid-60s, has the same seedy hotel setting and the same end-of-tether terseness. (“After all. She took a dress down. No best to put the same one on. They’ll know. They.”) Meanwhile, the sound of Cobbing in excelsis (watch the rendition of “Alphabet of Fishes”, on YouTube) strikes a note rarely heard in British poetry – guttural, improvisatory, full of unexpected detonations and occluded wordplay. As for the question of wider influence, the trail of the 60s mad lads and lasses (“Uncle Bob Cobbing and all,” as Larkin once sniffed) runs through acres of 21st-century literature. One can see it in the techniques of contemporary novelists such as Deborah Levy, Nicola Barker (winner of last year’s Goldsmiths prize for experimental writing) and Coe himself, who enlivened part of The Rotters’ Club with a single 13,955 word Johnsonian sentence. The current issue of the Quietus carries a sheaf of tributes to Quin from acolytes as various as Stewart Home and Lara Pawson. And the avant garde’s shadow hangs all over the kind of Scottish novel that began to take shape in the late 1970s and 80s, with its streams of consciousness, its fractured narratives and spiky demotic. As AL Kennedy observes: “Authors like Alasdair Gray, John Byrne and Jim Kelman were working with an awareness of the experimentation going on in the 60s. It laid the foundations for what became the Scottish Renaissance.” According to Coe: “If the experimental novelists of the 60s were able to see what’s happening at the moment, I think they would feel vindicated.” A traditionalist might think that, like some of Johnson’s special effects, or Brooke-Rose’s ellipses (“ – Two flies on my knee are making love. / – Flies don’t make love. They have sexual intercourse. / – On the contrary.”), this may be slightly overdoing it. On the other hand, in his study of contemporary British fiction, The Novel Now, Richard Bradford identifies a school of writing he christens “domesticated post-novelists”. Bradford’s exemplars are Ali Smith and David Mitchell, writers who, he maintains, combine a hankering for experimental playfulness with – something the 60s avant garde occasionally disdained – a determination to emerge with the reader on their side. Perhaps in the end Johnson, who went to his carefully choreographed death (a card left by the side of the bath read “This is my last word”) almost exulting in his neglect, had the last laugh • The Advance Guard of the Avant Garde will be broadcast on Radio 4 on 10 March."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/mar/05/anna-jones-recipes-for-breadcrumbs-fritters-salads-soups-croutons","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-05T12:00:41Z","webTitle":"Anna Jones’s showstopping recipes with leftover breadcrumbs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/05/anna-jones-recipes-for-breadcrumbs-fritters-salads-soups-croutons","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/05/anna-jones-recipes-for-breadcrumbs-fritters-salads-soups-croutons","fields":{"headline":"Anna Jones’s showstopping recipes with leftover breadcrumbs","bodyText":"Cheap, humble and often wasted, breadcrumbs are something I reach for during the cold months. They are endlessly useful to bind a fritter or a sauce (see last week’s romesco), and bigger, craggy crumbs can be baked until crisp and scattered through a warm winter salad. They make a quick and easy crust, bind a tart filling, or just add anywhere you might need to add texture. All hail the kale salad This is based on the kale salad from Joshua McFadden’s book Six Seasons, which claims to be the salad that started a worldwide trend for using kale as a salad leaf. I actually use cavolo nero, sometimes known as lacinato or Tuscan kale here, but curly kale would work really well too. Leftovers can be warmed in a pan and eaten with a poached egg or tossed through buttered spaghetti. Prep 10 min Serves 4 1 bunch cavolo nero or kale (about 250g-300g), stalks removed ½ small garlic clove, peeled and finely chopped 50g pecorino cheese (I use a vegetarian one) Olive oil 1 lemon, juice and zest 1 pinch chilli flakes Salt and black pepper 100g breadcrumbs, toasted Roll the leaves of the cavolo nero or kale into thick cigars and shred them as thinly as you can – about 2-3mm is perfect – then wash and dry them. Use a pestle and mortar to bash the garlic with a little salt until you have a smooth paste (or chop it very finely on a board, then transfer to a bowl). Combine this with the pecorino, about three tablespoons of oil, the lemon juice and zest, the chilli and a good grind of black pepper. Pour the dressing over the shredded leaves and toss well to coat. Taste, then adjust the flavour, adding more lemon, pepper, salt or chilli as needed. Leave the salad to sit for about 10 minutes, so the leaves can soften. Meanwhile toss the breadcrumbs in a little olive oil, salt and pepper and toast until crisp and golden in a dry pan or in a warm oven at 180C. Top the salad with the toasted breadcrumbs and a final grating of cheese and chilli, if you wish. Leek, tomato and butternut croustade This is my take on a favourite my husband grew up with, passed on to me by his mum, Sian, a brilliant cook. Making a crust from breadcrumbs is a lot more straightforward than pastry: easy, affordable comfort food. For a vegan version, swap the butter for coconut oil, the cheese for two tablespoons of nutritional yeast, and a non-dairy milk for the filling. Prep 15 min Cook 1 hr Serves 6 For the croustade 170g breadcrumbs (I use wholemeal or sourdough) 110g butter, softened 175g strong cheddar, grated 60g pumpkin seeds, roughly chopped 1 small bunch fresh winter herbs, (thyme, rosemary or sage), picked and roughly chopped 1 garlic clove, peeled and finely chopped For the filling 3 medium leeks, trimmed, washed and finely sliced 1 bay leaf 50g butter Salt 285ml milk 2 tsp dijon mustard 1 tbsp flour (I use spelt or wholemeal) 1 small bunch tarragon, leaves picked and chopped 400g tin cherry tomatoes, drained 100g butternut squash, finely sliced Heat the oven to 200C/390F/gas 6. Use your hands to mix together all the croustade ingredients. Press two-thirds of the mixture into the bottom of a 27cm gratin dish, ensuring an even layer, and keep the rest for later. Bake for 10-15 minutes, until golden. Meanwhile, make the filling. Sweat the leeks with the bay leaf in the butter, along with a pinch of salt. Once the leeks are soft, add the milk and mustard, and simmer for five minutes to allow the bay to flavour the mixture. Whisk the flour into the milk, and cook for a further two to three minutes. Keep whisking until it thickens and coats the back of a spoon. Once ready, remove the bay leaf, add the tarragon and spoon the sauce over the croustade base. Dot the tomatoes on top of the leeks, pressing them down slightly so they nestle in. Lay the slices of squash over the top, adding a drizzle of olive oil and a good pinch of salt and pepper. Sprinkle the remaining croustade mixture on top and bake for 15-20 minutes, until the squash is cooked and the crumbs are golden. • Food and prop styling: Anna Jones.

He recalls wandering into the study of the first, Professor John Bayley, “in search of an assignment, or at the very least, human contact”, and he was sent away with the instruction to go and read all of George Eliot, not just the big novels, and to come back when he was done, a task that Bayley clearly hoped would postpone further master-pupil engagement until the end of the year. The second teacher, however, Richard Ellmann, whose biography of James Joyce was itself a “work of art”, was much more suited to the “priestly” vocation that Atlas craved. Ellmann seemed to see in Atlas a fellow traveller in the curious compulsion of detailing the life of literary genius. Towards the end of his year with Ellmann, Atlas attempted to live up to his mentor by unravelling, in an exhaustive 20 pages, “Joyce’s use of the Renaissance philosopher Giambattista Vico’s theory of historical cycles in Ulysses”. At the top of his paper, Ellmann left a single valedictory pencil note: “A good start,” it said. Atlas is of the belief that a true biographer does not choose his or her subjects – the subjects rather move in and refuse to leave until their life has been written. He was first chosen in this way by Delmore Schwartz, the doomed American poet of the mid-20th century, who had gone from golden prodigy – championed by TS Eliot – to raddled derelict in a couple of decades. Schwartz had haunted Atlas’s imagination since the biographer saw a newspaper picture of the poet when he was in his teens. But it was only after he began to pursue the fragments of a life that ended outside the Columbia hotel on Times Square in 1966 – when Schwartz had a heart attack while taking out his garbage – that he started to see the parallels between their lives. This was the reason he had fallen in love at first sight: “Delmore’s attachment to his early childhood, his unrealisable expectations, his piercing loneliness, his book hunger, his dread of failure… these were traits and longings we shared.” Perhaps all writing is autobiography. That, at least, is one of the unavoidable themes of this unfailingly acute memoir of the biographer’s art. Atlas’s biography of Schwartz opened up life for him, he became an editor at the New York Times, he wrote for the New Yorker, he published a novel, he was invited to write other biographies, but none really snagged in his heart. In 1987, though, he wrote to Saul Bellow to share his growing realisation that he was the Nobel laureate’s natural Boswell. The relationship, again, seemed fated in some way. Bellow had also written about Schwartz, in his novel Humboldt’s Gift. Both men were formed in Chicago. “I was the one,” Atlas argued. Bellow was not convinced, and so the stalker’s dance between avid biographer and reluctant subject, which is the substance of this book, and of Atlas’s life, began. It is a triumph of chutzpah, and of desperation. At one friendly lunch, as he peppers his still reluctant subject with intimate questions and details the childhood acquaintances of Bellow’s he had met and interviewed, Atlas remembers how “Bellow took me in with that keen, appraising look of his: Who is this guy? It was beginning to dawn on him: I was going to write his biography”. There are elements in this indefatigable, sometimes toe-curling, pursuit that recall Nicholson Baker’s granular obsession with John Updike, detailed in U&amp;I, and of Geoff Dyer’s comic failure to write his life of DH Lawrence, Out of Sheer Rage. Like any one-sided love affair, Atlas’s entrapment of Bellow is familiar in its trajectory but entertainingly unique in its particulars – and an inspiration for compulsive biographers everywhere. • The Shadow in the Garden by James Atlas is published by Corsair (£30).

Although motor manufacturers said new models coming on to the market were on average about 12% more fuel-efficient than their older versions, campaigners said a higher proportion of gas-guzzling vehicles leaving the forecourt had led to a 0.8% increase in the average amount of C02 generated per new car. Falling consumer confidence has affected the lower end of the car market, with sales of the smallest, cheapest vehicle down by more than 10%. The Society for Motor Manufacturers and Traders said an “anti-diesel agenda” was contributing to the rise in CO2 emissions. Diesel registrations fell by 17% last year after the emissions scandals. Diesel engines have tended to have greater fuel efficiency than petrol engines, but have been responsible for a rapid rise in NOx emissions and severe air pollution in urban areas. The SMMT said the decline in diesel would make it harder for the UK to hit its CO2 reduction targets. Its report acknowledged that cheaper running costs may have encouraged committed diesel drivers to buy bigger models, noting: “Consumers appear to have often used the improved efficiency of the products to enable them to move into larger and higher value vehicles.” Greg Archer, of the cleaner transport campaign group Transport &amp; Environment, said: “The principal reason CO2 emissions are rising is that carmakers are selling more gas-guzzling SUVs. Blaming the slump in diesel sales is a smokescreen that hide their failure to fit fuel efficiency technologies to the new cars they are selling.” The SMMT said sales of electric cars were disappointing and thatlong-term incentives would be needed to achieve cuts in CO2 emissions of almost 6% a year until 2021 under EU requirements. The industry said confusion over government policy was causing buyers to hold back, particularly tax changes that took effect last April and more announced in the autumn budget. Despite long-term hopes for electric and hybrid vehicles, 95% of the UK’s 2.5m new cars sold were still either petrol or diesel. Average emissions for a new car rose to 121.0g of CO2 per kilometre, which was the same as 2015 levels. However, the levels were 33% lower than those in 2000. Estimates of CO2 emissions of the average new car are likely to be 20% higher from September 2018, when tests designed to better reflect normal driving comes into force. Total CO2 emissions from all cars in use on UK roads are down just 7% since 2000, according to the SMMT report. This is despite the gradual replacement of vehicles with more efficient models. Emissions have risen over the last three years owing to increased traffic on UK roads. Mike Hawes, the chief executive of the SMMT, said: “The industry shares government’s vision of a low-carbon future and is investing to get us there – but we can’t do it overnight; nor can we do it alone. The anti-diesel agenda has set back progress on climate change, while electric vehicle demand remains disappointingly low amid consumer concerns around charging infrastructure availability and affordability. “To accelerate fleet renewal, motorists must have the confidence to invest in the cleanest cars for their needs – however they are powered. A consistent approach to incentives and tax, and greater investment in charging infrastructure will be critical.” Sales of new cars declined by 5.7% last year after five years of growth, with plunging diesel sales after the government signalled tax changes on company cars and cities considered punitive measures to tackle air quality after the VW diesel test-rigging scandal."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/feb/26/morning-mail-michael-mccormack-set-to-be-new-deputy-pm","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-25T20:00:07Z","webTitle":"Morning mail: Michael McCormack set to be new deputy PM","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/feb/26/morning-mail-michael-mccormack-set-to-be-new-deputy-pm","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/feb/26/morning-mail-michael-mccormack-set-to-be-new-deputy-pm","fields":{"headline":"Morning mail: Michael McCormack set to be new deputy PM","bodyText":"Good morning, this is Eleanor Ainge Roy bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Monday 26 February. Top stories Australia will have a new deputy prime minister today with Michael McCormack, the veterans affairs minister, expected to be appointed the new Nationals leader to replace Barnaby Joyce when Nationals MPs meet in Canberra at 8am. On Sunday McCormack became the sole declared candidate after David Gillespie withdrew from the race and the agriculture minister David Littleproud said he would not run. The party room meeting comes amid growing anger that the identity of the woman who accused Joyce of sexual harassment was revealed. On Sunday the Nationals deputy party leader, Bridget McKenzie, denied the leak had come from the party. She said she had received assurances from the party president and federal director, and added: “I understand through a range of networks that it wasn’t unknown who the complainant was.” You can catch all the action live from Canberra from 7am with Guardian Australia’s political reporter Amy Remeikis, including Malcolm Turnbull’s return from Washington and question time with a new deputy PM. The author of a newly released Democratic memo on investigations into Russian meddling in the 2016 US election defended his work on Sunday, after being attacked by Donald Trump. Trump tweeted that the memo was “a total political and legal BUST”, and personally abused California congressman Adam Schiff. Referring to an infamous Trump remark about Mexican immigrants, Schiff told CNN’s State of the Union he was “proud to be one of the bad hombres, I guess”. The Democratic memo was published with redactions two weeks after Trump blocked its full release. The document aims to counter a Republican narrative that the FBI and justice department conspired against Trump as they investigated his ties to Russia. The Coalition government’s plans to privatise Australia’s visa application system could include “premium services for high-value applicants”, different access for those able to pay more, as well as “commercial value-added services”. The Department of Home Affairs is seeking a private-sector partner to design, build and operate a commercial “user-pays” visa application and approval system, with limited human involvement. But the Community and Public Sector Union has warned the changes could cost up to 3,000 jobs and jeopardise the security of people’s private information. The Greens senator Nick McKim said the proposal could see a fatal corruption of the integrity of Australia’s visa system with “access to Australia packaged up and sold to the highest bidder”. The former British prime minister Tony Blair and the American author Michael Wolff have accused each other of lying, as the row about Blair’s dealings with Donald Trump’s White House reignited. Blair features only briefly in the blockbuster book, but Wolff claims Blair was angling for a job as a Middle East peace envoy and that Blair told the Trump team that British intelligence may have been spying on them before Trump assumed the presidency. Wolff said on Sunday that Blair was a “complete liar” in the way he dismissed claims in the book. Blair responded by saying Wolff’s stories about him were made up. The Labor party’s national left faction has come out strongly against Malcolm Turnbull’s proposed corporate tax cuts, saying they are not appropriate in “any fiscal environment”. It’s being seen as a warning to the shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, who has suggested the issue may be revisited after the budget returns to surplus. But the left faction convenor, Pat Conroy, told a meeting of the faction in Sydney that there was “no case for the reduction in the corporate tax rate”. He said the issue was “not about timing, instead it is about a rejection of trickle-down economics”. The Turnbull government has dug in behind its plan to reduce the corporate rate, and big business has intensified its lobbying effort in the hope of persuading the Senate to drop its current opposition to tax relief for big corporates.

Thinking time Musician, activist and soothsayer; Moby is a man of many talents. Sophie Heawood visits the famed eccentric in his palatial home to discuss Trump (“He’s a sociopath”), his friends in the intelligence communities and his past life as a drug addict and alcoholic. “The thing about Moby is that he often turns out to be right,” writes Heawood. “Even when he can seem a little ridiculous beforehand. He recently took a complex personality test which labelled him as a ‘futurist’ – someone who sees what is coming next for humanity.” The debate surrounding the use of phonics in Australian classrooms has taken on urgent significance since the release of a government-commissioned report that recommended the introduction of a mandatory “check” on children’s phonics progress. The check tests students’ ability to sound out a mix of 40 real and made-up words. While the education minister, Simon Birmingham, publicly backed the plan it was variously embraced and rejected by divided sections of the education community. Michael McGowan asks why can’t the right and left stop sounding off about phonics and find a bipartisan way forward. The South African-born Australian writer Ceridwen Dovey talks to the Guardian about the nature of privilege, shame and the complexities of art in her new novel, In the Garden of the Fugitives. The book finds rich settings in South African farms, American college dorms and Italian archaeology digs, and explores a complex meditation on the guilt of privilege. “I really struggle to find a position to write from as an author,” Dovey says. “It’s shaded by being a white South African who grew up in apartheid. Can I speak from the class of the perpetrator?” What’s he done now? Donald Trump has said that US teachers are “very gun-adept people” and suggested arming the best 350,000 to 700,000 of them in a bid to stem school shootings. But Vox has fact-checked the president’s claim and found there is no evidence that even a fraction of that number have “significant experience with a gun”. Media roundup The Australian Financial Review splashes with the first part in a series on Macquarie Bank and explores how the “millionaires factory” made it big on the global stage. The Sydney Morning Herald has an interactive feature on the exodus of Sydneysiders for greener pastures, reporting that every day 129 people ditch the city for elsewhere in Australia, while only 85 move the other way. And the ABC has a disturbing report on “hazing” practices at colleges at the University of Sydney, including locking first-years in bathrooms in the dark and then pelting them with dead fish, until students cried and begged for help. Coming up Question time is likely to be heated this afternoon as Labor tries to keep the Coalition on the ropes after two weeks of the Barnaby Joyce saga.

Their position of 13th in the medal table is the lowest achieved by a team of Russian athletes since the dissolution of the Soviet Union. However, the overall OAR medal count of 17 exceeded that earned by Russia in recent years in Vancouver in 2010 and in Salt Lake City in 2002. It is also a larger total than the Soviet Union made on three occasions. But that is in part because of the expansion of the number of medals available in the games. The Soviet Union never finished lower than second in a Winter Olympics medal table. Russian athletes were competing under a neutral banner after a ban was placed on the country for systematic doping violations at previous Games. Many athletes who had competed for the nation in their home Winter Olympics in Sochi in 2014 were unable to compete because of their association with the Russian state doping programme. A chart of medals won by the Soviet Union (1956-1988), Unified team (1992), Russia (1994-2014) and the Olympic Athletes from Russia (2018) shows that Sochi was a high-point compared to other recent performances. The OAR’s two golds in Pyeongchang were won by 15 year old Alina Zagitova in figure skating and the men’s hockey team. At their medal ceremony, the hockey players sang the Russian anthem over the top of the Olympic anthem being played on the loudspeakers - despite the IOC ban on Russia which prohibited the use of the Russian flag or anthem. The IOC later issued a statement saying: “We understand that this was over excitement by the athletes who had just won a gold medal in extraordinary circumstances.” Despite the IOC ban, Russian athletes were well-supported in Pyeongchang, with fans going the extra mile to demonstrate that Russia was at the Games. “We bought the [2014 Sochi] uniform specially so that Russianness is at least visible somehow” Andrei Savinov, a 53-year-old from Moscow, told reporters. Other fans, especially when watching the hockey, wore costumes that harked back to national identity and the USSR era. The Olympic Athletes from Russia would have won one additional medal, but the bronze won in the mixed doubles curling in Pyeongchang was stripped from Alexander Krushelnitsky after he tested positive for the banned heart drug meldonium. Another Russian athlete who failed a test during the Games was bobsleigh pilot Nadezhda Sergeeva. She denies taking a banned substance, and was filmed before the Pyeongchang event wearing an “I don’t do doping” sweatshirt. With the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the talent pool available to the Russian team shrank. In 1992 the Unified Team represented a similar geographic area to Soviet Russia, with the exception of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, who competed as individual nation states in Albertville. By the time the next Winter Olympics came around, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan all had their own Olympic committees and were competing under their own flags. The Russian Empire was represented at four Summer Olympic Games between 1900 and 1912. During that time the empire won one medal in a winter sport – Nikolai Panin securing gold in figure skating at the 1908 London Olympics."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"fashion/2018/feb/25/dolce-gabbana-aw18-milan-fashion-week-religious-iconography","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-25T18:02:34Z","webTitle":"Dolce & Gabbana's new show is declaration of love to fashion industry","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/feb/25/dolce-gabbana-aw18-milan-fashion-week-religious-iconography","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2018/feb/25/dolce-gabbana-aw18-milan-fashion-week-religious-iconography","fields":{"headline":"Dolce & Gabbana's new show is declaration of love to fashion industry","bodyText":"It may have started to snow in Milan on Sunday afternoon, but at Dolce &amp; Gabbana’s show HQ the climate was anything but cold. This season, design duo Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana made a declaration of love to the industry with an autumn/winter 2018 collection entitled Fashion Devotion. While they are well known for their dedication to their craft, one half of the design duo was in a particularly enthusiastic mood at a preview hours before the show. “Fashion is not work, fashion is devotion,” Dolce said. “You live, sleep and eat with fashion, you never stop thinking about it and you love it with all your heart.” On the catwalk, this was expressed using religious iconography – a frequent theme in the house’s collections – with gold embellished tabernacle bags, embroidered haloes, dog-collar shirting and, most distinctively, the sacred heart. This was found on dresses, coats, and came as a sculpted clasp on the brand’s new bags, which were flown in on drones like robotic angels before the models appeared. Divine inspiration also materialised in T-shirts that read Fashion Sinner. The designers are heavily involved with the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s forthcoming Costume Institute exhibition, entitled Fashion and the Catholic Imagination, for which this collection is one to explore. There’s no doubt that the exquisitely executed pieces in this show, featuring over 100 models, will cost a lot of money – prices start from about £150 for a bikini top and stretch to £9,000 for an embellished gown – but backstage, Dolce insisted money was the last thing on his mind. “You kill the love and creativity when you talk about how much something is,” he said. “When the creativity is beautiful, the people pay.” Based on the results, the designer appears to be right. The house turned over €1.3bn (£1.1bn) in the 2016-17 financial year, a 9% increase on the previous year. Earlier in the day, the concept for autumn/winter 2018 was more subtle. At Marni, the Italian house known for its conceptual approach and art influences, Francesco Risso, its creative director, invited guests to watch his third collection sat on televisions, compact newspapers, and rugs piled high. “Basic, raw and immediate,” as the show notes advised, the clothes here had trailing loose threads and visible inverted seams for deliberate slapdash effect. Striped blanket coats, colour-clashing silk and sequinned dresses, and long ribbed polo necks were bunched, wrapped and joined with pins and hardware, “fusing halves together”. Elsewhere, memorable motifs came by way of coats with an all-over camouflage print made up of women’s faces, illustrating “safety in numbers”, as well as a whiskered cat print with eyes designed to “hypnotise and attract all over”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"sport/2018/feb/25/scotland-finn-russell-orchestrates-harsh-lesson-england","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-25T22:00:04Z","webTitle":"Scotland’s Finn Russell orchestrates a harsh lesson for England | Robert Kitson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/feb/25/scotland-finn-russell-orchestrates-harsh-lesson-england","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/feb/25/scotland-finn-russell-orchestrates-harsh-lesson-england","fields":{"headline":"Scotland’s Finn Russell orchestrates a harsh lesson for England","bodyText":"Every now and again comes a reminder of why the Six Nations still exerts a powerful hold on the imagination. Out of a clear blue Edinburgh sky has also come a scoreline which has transformed this season’s championship and given England a lot to contemplate. It is now entirely possible the visitors’ dreams of a third straight title will already have evaporated before Ireland visit Twickenham on the tournament’s closing Saturday. Above all else, though, this was a glorious weekend for Scotland and those who like seeing positivity and calculated risk rewarded at the higher end of professional sport. One defeat does not necessarily make England a bad team overnight but it was the manner of it that felt most significant. Efficiency, hard work and repetition can take a team so far but sometimes inspiration, artistry and passion count for even more. This was no scrappy Calcutta Cup mugging but a meticulously planned and coolly executed assassination of English vanities. Scotland have had some stirring days in defeat to New Zealand and Australia in recent seasons but rarely have they delivered such a complete 80-minute performance. Finn Russell and his back row gave their opposite numbers the kind of run-around no one involved will forget in a hurry. For the Scots it also completed one of the great turnarounds in any team sport in recent times. This time last year they were losing 61-21; a 52-point victorious swing inside 12 months is a Six Nations record. Less than a month ago Gregor Townsend’s players were reeling in the wake of a 34-7 walloping in Wales; if Scotland were to go on and lift the title after that wretched start, it really would rank among the great championship fables. Such an outcome would require successive away wins in Dublin and Rome and favourable results elsewhere but either way Townsend and his proactive team have taught Eddie Jones’s England a valuable lesson. Just last week Jones was dismissing the notion of speculative distribution – “If you want entertainment go and watch Super Rugby” – at this level, only to be confronted by Russell doing a passable impression of Carlos Spencer and Quade Cooper combined. Maybe on another day the long passes that outflanked the narrow English defence and gave Huw Jones such a licence to thrill would have fallen into enemy hands but Russell deserves massive credit for backing himself despite a personally rocky start to this Six Nations. There was absolutely nothing fortuitous, however, about Scotland’s breakdown dominance, with John Barclay and Hamish Watson once again raising doubts over England’s effectiveness in that critical area. With Ryan Wilson more than happy to mix it physically with the visitors’ big ball-carriers and England reduced to second best almost everywhere, the upshot was Scotland’s most comprehensive triumph in this fixture for over 30 years. “It wasn’t just their back row; it was players across the XV,” said Chris Robshaw, who might have been reminded of his side’s 30-3 loss in Cardiff in 2013. “It was frustrating because we’d spoken so much about the breakdown. For whatever reason we didn’t come with that intensity and physicality we had spoken about.” Good as Townsend’s men were tactically and temperamentally, England under Jones have never conceded as many points before half-time. They also seem to have a recurring problem in away fixtures featuring extended pre-match formalities but blaming Princess Anne or the Irish Taoiseach would be facile. In this instance it is reasonable to ask if England’s intense physical preparations, not least in the fallow week after the Wales game, ultimately backfired. Tough extra scrummaging sessions against Georgia become less useful if they drain the team of vitality when it counts. England, who are due to train in Oxford this week, also have to ask themselves whether they have the optimal back-row balance, whether to stick with all their senior “glue” players and whether they might have to widen their horizons beyond grinding down opponents and pulling away in the final quarter. They continue to concede too many penalties and, on this evidence, even France may sense an opportunity to resuscitate their season. “We’ve got to take our medicine and learn,” said Robshaw. “Well done to them but we’re not out of this competition and we’ll keep on fighting.” A failure to return south with so much as a losing bonus point, however, means Ireland could wrap the title up a week early should they score a convincing four-try win over Scotland and England not do likewise at the Stade de France. Scotland’s dismal Six Nations away record – only two away wins since 2000 other than in Rome – will also have to be confounded, though in the English-reared Jones they have found a natural-born try-scorer. “I was thinking: ‘I haven’t really got a step so I’ve got to go straight here,” said the 24-year-old, modestly discussing his direct surge to the line for his second try just before half-time. “I didn’t really fancy it to be honest. When you think of England you think of their defence. That brick wall … it’s almost impenetrable at times.” Not on this occasion. Jones’s coaching namesake warned against looking for non-existent “shadows in the corners” but one or two clouds are starting to gather on England’s horizon. Their grand slam hopes have been abruptly extinguished and, as far as their rivals are concerned, any sense of invincibility has also disappeared."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/feb/25/robert-clark-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-25T17:52:24Z","webTitle":"Robert Clark obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/feb/25/robert-clark-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/feb/25/robert-clark-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Robert Clark obituary","bodyText":"My friend Robert Clark was a man with diverse interests who offered his friendship to many of the people with whom he crossed paths. First among these was his partner of a third of a century, Susan Costello. They shared a home in Kennington, south London, that was neatly packed with books, music and their copious papers. Robert, who has died of myeloma aged 71, was born in Llandudno, north Wales, son of Frank Clark, a tax inspector, and his wife, Joan (nee Davies). He attended Nottingham College of Education and worked briefly as a teacher. Then, in 1970, he joined the civil service, moved to London and met Susan. Latterly Robert managed benefits offices in central London. The capital was the focus of his cultural and intellectual life too. He was an elder of the Friends House Quaker Meeting, a governor of a Lambeth primary school, a Pentonville prison visitor and a keen supporter of the London Sinfonietta. He was a member of the committee of his local Labour party branch and a director of the consumer group Voice of the Listener and Viewer, championing especially the quality and diversity of radio broadcasting. Robert was also part of an informal network of National Trust members that sprang from the Bradenham affair of 1982, when the trust granted a lease of land in the Chilterns for building an air force bunker, and members’ challenges to this decision led to changes in governance procedures. The group has monitored the trust’s governance ever since. Robert was a lifelong Guardian reader. His fondness for place was not limited to Wales and London. Susan and he were regular visitors to Italy and to Orkney, for the St Magnus festival. Robert’s energy, his constructive attitude, his passions, his kindness and his generosity of spirit leave him bright in the memory of many.

The creator was Romelu Lukaku, his neat cross finding the substitute, after the No 9’s first goal for United against top-six opposition had cancelled out Willian’s opener. José Mourinho praised a fine display from his centre-forward. “He played fantastically well. He had in my opinion the same start as the team, the team didn’t start well and it happened to him: he was losing some balls in the first control. He was a little bit lost but then he went together with the team – improving, improving.” The victory means Chelsea slip to fifth and United are six points clear of the London club in the race to secure a Champions League place. After Mourinho (perhaps studiously) failed to namecheck Antonio Conte in his programme notes there was a pre- and post-match handshake between the feuding pair and they were later seen sharing a smile. The United manager made two changes: Anthony Martial replaced Juan Mata and Paul Pogba was reinstated for the injured Ander Herrera after being dropped for the draw at Sevilla. Conte stood down Pedro for Álvaro Morata and Cesc Fàbregas for Danny Drinkwater. It was the latter who prompted Chelsea’s opening foray, with a sweeping ball that won a corner. It came to nothing, yet when the visitors next attacked David de Gea was beaten. Fortunately for United the bar was not, with a fluid move in which Eden Hazard found Marcos Alonso on the left ending when Morata volleyed the ball off the woodwork from his team-mate’s first-time delivery. From here United gained a foothold. Anthony Martial, Lukaku, Alexis Sánchez and Nemanja Matic all began to see the ball. When Sánchez floated in a diagonal free-kick, though, it went straight into Thibaut Courtois’s hands. Pogba’s opening contribution was to find Antonio Valencia along the right and after he crossed Sánchez might have done better with Lukaku’s chest-down. The early exchanges were open. Chelsea utilised wide areas to create space, with Victor Moses probing near United’s goal on the right. United emerged from the ensuing lull on top. Lukaku twice received the ball in a threatening position but his first touch, then a lack of space, blunted his potency. Sánchez was guilty of a bad miss when arriving late for a Martial pass. The Chilean had only to stab home either side of Courtois; instead he dribbled the ball straight to the goalkeeper. Pogba’s best moment of the half drew a yellow card for N’Golo Kanté. Yet after his barracking run caused the midfielder to foul him, disaster for Pogba and delight for Chelsea followed. Valencia dinked in a cross and Willian headed clear. Yet after Pogba failed to challenge, the ball went again to the Brazilian and he found Hazard. After galloping alongside his team-mate in the inside-right channel, possession came back to him via a delightful return pass from the Belgian. Now, Willian took a touch and smashed the ball home past De Gea, who should have done better, the ball passing near enough to his body for it to be repelled. A fine equaliser was soon to follow, though. This was intricate, impressive stuff. Matic found Sánchez, whose precise ball hit Martial’s feet and when his equally exact pass went to Lukaku, the Belgian scored his 22nd United goal. That meant United began the second half in classic Mourinho stick-or-twist territory. Despite being the home side and proud progenitors of attack-first football, this is just not the Portuguese’s default mode. His team, though, did go for the win. Pogba threaded a ball forward, Sánchez collected on the area’s edge and the home crowd responded noisily. Next zipped passes between Matic, Pogba and Sánchez moved United forward at a rare speed. The attack eventually led to a corner from which Sánchez committed the cardinal sin of hitting the first defender. De Gea atoned for his earlier error by saving a Drinkwater shot that came dipping in the mid-afternoon sun, in what was a warning to the home side. For the last 25 minutes Mourinho introduced Lingard for Martial. His first contribution was to dispossess Willian and launch a United attack. They were finishing the stronger. Scott McTominay outmuscled Hazard and Chelsea were spun out of position. When the ball eventually came to Sánchez his pivot-cross was hammered instantly at Courtois by Lukaku. Four minutes from time Morata scored a goal that was adjudged offside. Conte said: “Yeah, but for sure it was onside – this type of situation can change the final result and for this reason I am very positive they should use VAR.” He did confirm that Hazard’s earlier substitution was not for an injury. “It was a tactical decision,” Conte said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2018/feb/25/donald-trump-nra-rifle-buying-age-minimum-raise-split","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-25T18:44:19Z","webTitle":"NRA and Donald Trump appear to part ways over raising age to buy rifle","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/25/donald-trump-nra-rifle-buying-age-minimum-raise-split","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/feb/25/donald-trump-nra-rifle-buying-age-minimum-raise-split","fields":{"headline":"NRA and Donald Trump appear to part ways over raising age to buy rifle","bodyText":"Donald Trump and the National Rifle Association (NRA) are each suggesting the other party will switch positions on whether the legal age to buy a rifle should be raised. Amid fierce debate over gun law reform after 17 people died in a shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school in Florida, Trump has repeatedly suggested that he might endorse a law to raise the legal age to buy a rifle to 21. The NRA opposes that policy, fuelling suggestions that a split may be opening between the president – who told NRA members last year “I will never, ever let you down” – and the powerful group which spent $30m backing his run for the White House. “It should all be at 21,” Trump told state leaders at a meeting on Thursday. “And the NRA will back it.” The association’s spokeswoman, Dana Loesch, responded on Sunday by saying that Trump’s proposal was still just that and he had not broken with the gun rights group yet. “I know that people are trying to find daylight between President Trump and 5 million law abiding gun owners all across the United States,” Loesch told ABC’s This Week. “These are just things that he’s discussing right now.” With Trump and the NRA at odds, Republicans are also expressing differing views on changing the age to legally purchase a rifle. Florida’s governor, Rick Scott, a longtime gun rights advocate with an A+ rating from the NRA, has also said he would endorse raising the age to purchase a rifle, along with a handful of other gun control compromises. Scott told Fox News Sunday’s Chris Wallace: “You know, I’m an NRA member. I believe in the second amendment. I believe in the first amendment, all the amendments. I think most members in the NRA agree with me, this is logical. I’m sure there’s going to be some that disagree. But I’m a dad. I’m a grandad and I’m a governor. I want my state to be safe.” Scott also said he did not agree with Trump’s proposal to arm school teachers, saying: “I believe you’ve got to focus on the people that are well-trained in law enforcement, that are trained to do this.” The Pennsylvania senator Pat Toomey, one of the architects of an attempt at bipartisan gun control legislation after 20 young children and six adults were killed in the 2012 Sandy Hook shooting, said he was “very skeptical” of the effort to raise the age to purchase rifles, since it would overwhelmingly affect law-abiding teenagers and young adults. “There’s a lot of hunting rifles that are as powerful as an AR-15,” he told NBC’s Meet the Press. The differences between AR-15 rifles and popular hunting rifles are “just cosmetic”. As students and teachers who survived the shooting in Florida organize protests and a March on Washington to demand gun control laws, the NRA is focusing on blaming the shooting on the failures of local and federal law enforcement. The Broward County sheriff’s department, whose liberal sheriff has spoken in favor of gun control laws and against the NRA, is under particular pressure. “This all stems from their dereliction of duty,” Loesch said, pointing to the multiple interactions the gunman had with law enforcement before he carried out his attack. Holding law enforcement officials responsible for their failures, she said, was more appropriate “than trying to blame 5 million innocent, law-abiding gun owners all across the country”. The Broward County sheriff, Scott Israel, told Jake Tapper on CNN’s State of the Union he was “disgusted” and “demoralized” by an armed school resource officer’s failure to enter the high school to confront the shooter during the Florida attack. He said he was investigating the behavior of three other deputies, who CNN reported had been at the campus but had not entered the school. “Of course I won’t resign,” he added. While many survivors are pushing for gun control laws, not all the family members and survivors of the Parkland shooting agree on what should be done to prevent the next such incident. “We don’t care about gun control right now,” Andrew Pollack, the father of Meadow Pollack, who was killed in the shooting, told Fox News Sunday. “That’s a big issue in the country and you’re not going to get everyone together on it. “But, we’re going to get everyone together on fixing our schools. The American people, we can get together on school safety.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/feb/26/ireland-joe-schmidt-six-nations-roll-up-sleeves","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-26T00:01:36Z","webTitle":"Joe Schmidt: Ireland will still have to ‘roll up sleeves’ to win Six Nations","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/feb/26/ireland-joe-schmidt-six-nations-roll-up-sleeves","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/feb/26/ireland-joe-schmidt-six-nations-roll-up-sleeves","fields":{"headline":"Joe Schmidt: Ireland will still have to ‘roll up sleeves’ to win Six Nations","bodyText":"Suddenly this Six Nations is Ireland’s to lose. Take maximum points at home to Scotland – as, for example, Wales did, the team they took maximum points against here – and England would need to do the same against them at Twickenham in the final round just to stand a chance. Joe Schmidt is doing a manful job of trying to dampen the escalating expectations of his public. “Other people make assessments but I wouldn’t,” he dutifully said. “It’s a lot easier for us than it is externally, because we do live in a bit of a bubble during the championships. In the early part of the week the guys won’t get too excited. They may well see they have to roll up sleeves.” Johnny Sexton and Conor Murray, Ireland’s prize assets at half-back, are unlikely to be exposed to the promised intensity of Tuesday’s training. Both men left the field in some discomfort, albeit Murray at the end of the match, but neither’s injury is thought to be serious. Sexton “copped a knee in the backside”, while Murray caught his foot awkwardly but was walking on it afterwards. Ireland have suffered their fair share of injuries to key personnel this championship, not least for this match against Wales, and have ridden the absences well, but the loss of their half-backs would be calamitous. Sexton himself was an injury scare in the build-up, but, notwithstanding the early misses of a conversion and two penalties, he ran the show superbly, alongside the incomparable Murray. Around them, meanwhile, Ireland are starting to thrive again, after the passing of their fabled “Golden Generation”. Garry Ringrose is available and Sean O’Brien is set to play for Leinster this weekend. Even better news than that, though, is the form of those whose places they will hope to win back. Chris Farrell was awarded man of the match for his muscular display at outside-centre; Dan Leavy should have been awarded it for his on the flank; Andrew Porter’s performance meant the loss of Tadhg Furlong barely registered; and James Ryan’s industry is food for thought for Iain Henderson, another poised to return. All is looking rosy in the Ireland camp. If their opener in Paris was notable for the nerve they showed in adversity, the win against Italy was a chance to develop the range of their attack. Here, they put both together to dispatch a Wales team who just would not be shaken off. There is no doubt that Ireland’s fixture list has been kind this championship, allowing them to build to their likely showdown at Twickenham with this run of three home games in the middle. No such luck for Wales, whose championship has slammed into the brick walls of Twickenham and Dublin. They now finish with two home games against the “easier” of the Six Nations teams but the damage to their hopes has been done. “We need to make some changes against Italy because we want to see where some of the squad is at this level,” said Warren Gatland. “Can they handle international rugby? The focus changes a little bit. It is important we finish in that top three, but also start thinking long-term, in terms of the World Cup.” Ireland will be doing the same, but their ambitions are somewhat higher than top three."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/feb/25/jeremy-corbyn-soft-brexit-customs-union-commons-rebellion","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-25T16:06:26Z","webTitle":"Embracing soft Brexit would be risky for Corbyn.

But it’s still the smart move","bodyText":"“Crunch time is coming for the prime minister,” Keir Starmer, Labour’s Brexit spokesman, tells the BBC’s Andrew Marr. But, then again, when isn’t it? Theresa May is more familiar with crunch time than an overworked gravel salesman. What gives force to Starmer’s claim is that the ordeal now facing the prime minister is of a different order and character to the daily miseries that have afflicted her since the general election last June. Ostensibly a principled challenge by Jeremy Corbyn to her position on Brexit, it is really a ruthless political challenge to her position, full stop. You can be sure that the Labour leader’s speech on Monday will disappoint those in his party who hoped he would embrace full, continued, unambiguous membership of the EU customs union. Corbyn’s longstanding ideological recoil from the EU will see to that, as will the unrelenting pressure from Eurosceptic Labour MPs and some of his closest advisers, who believe that a sellout on Brexit will be fiercely punished by working-class voters. So don’t expect a tearful declaration that he does, after all, love Big Brussels. There has been no epiphany, no sudden volte-face. Yes, his mind has been focused by the risk of a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland and the consequent mortal threat to the Good Friday agreement. But the shift he is about to announce is primarily political rather than doctrinal in inspiration. The potential to cause havoc in the Commons was demonstrated by the success in December of Dominic Grieve’s amendment to the European Union withdrawal bill giving MPs a legally guaranteed vote on the Brexit deal. But there are only so many procedural issues upon which Labour can join forces with remainer Tories if the bombardment is to be sustained. This is what Corbyn is doing. By shifting the needle even slightly on the question of a future customs arrangement with the EU, he will – at a stroke – create the germ of a cross-party rebel alliance bound not only by an insistence on the supremacy of the Commons but also by shared policy values. This is a hugely significant moment. I sympathise with the 80 senior Labour figures who signed a statement issued to the Observer urging him to go further and to back membership of the single market. They are right that Britain’s economic interests would be profoundly damaged by our departure from that hard-won commercial arrangement. But they misinterpret what Corbyn is doing, and why. His conversion is not to soft Brexit, but to a hard knock on the door of No 10. With ever greater clarity, it is dawning upon Labour strategists that there may indeed be a “Corbyn moment” – which is to say, a limited period of maximum electoral opportunity. For an opposition, there is always a case for playing it long, campaigning in more locations, fleshing out the difference you will make to sceptical voters. But time can be a foe as well as a friend – never more so than in the capricious age of novelty politics and fickle social media. Last summer belonged to Corbyn, in mood, tone and electoral trajectory. But volatility, by definition, destroys that which it creates. Etched into the waves of euphoria is the certainty of the opposite emotion. The only variable is the time span separating infatuation from rejection. It could be years – but not necessarily so. Remember Cleggmania? Remember May’s apparently unbreakable command of the political stage in late 2016? In modern politics, the only mantra worth repeating is: this too shall pass. So what are Corbyn’s options? He can hold tight and wait for this jerry-rigged government to collapse under the weight of its own contradictions. Or he can strike. The first option is proving risky, as May’s lonely talent appears to be a capacity to turn her party’s confusion and indecision to her advantage. The cabinet’s commitment last week to pursue a Brexit deal based upon “ambitious managed divergence” is yet another tribute to her dreary genius. The wording is completely meaningless in all respects – except that it has extended the Tory truce a little longer. And this is what May does; all she does, in fact. She leads by procrastination. She insists upon inaction. She is the woman ordering endless Ubers to take her to the place where she already stands. The alternative option for the Labour leader is to force the pace, and to do so in parliament. In 1992-93, John Smith paved the way for Tony Blair’s victory by tactical alignment over the Maastricht treaty with the Tory Eurosceptic “bastards” – a Commons rebellion that did terrible damage to John Major’s authority. A quarter of a century later, Corbyn has a comparable opportunity to make common cause with the Tory remainers: not always, but often enough to tip the Conservative tribe from paralysis to panic. His new position on the customs union is meant to light the fuse that leads – however circuitously – to a confidence vote in the PM and another general election. It is not a strategy without peril. It could fail, and embarrassingly so. But it is still, as Michael Corleone would say, the smart move. • Matthew d’Ancona is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/2018/feb/25/minister-seeks-to-scotch-claims-of-brexit-power-grab","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-25T22:30:33Z","webTitle":"Minister seeks to scotch claims of Brexit power grab","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/feb/25/minister-seeks-to-scotch-claims-of-brexit-power-grab","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/feb/25/minister-seeks-to-scotch-claims-of-brexit-power-grab","fields":{"headline":"Minister seeks to scotch claims of Brexit power grab","bodyText":"The Cabinet Office minister David Lidington will on Monday promise “a very big change” to a key Brexit bill in the hope of resolving the deadlock between London and the devolved administrations over what happens to powers being repatriated from Brussels. In a speech in north Wales, Lidington will say “the vast majority of powers returning from Brussels will start off in Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast – and not in Whitehall”. He will propose government amendments to that effect in the EU withdrawal bill, saying these will put “beyond doubt our commitment to a smooth and orderly departure from the EU, in a way that doesn’t just respect the devolution settlements, but strengthens and enhances them”. But he will insist on the UK government retaining legislative control over certain aspects of lawmaking that are normally devolved because of the need to maintain “common UK frameworks” in areas such as agriculture. The bill, which has cleared the Commons and is now in the Lords, will transfer existing EU law into UK law to ensure legal continuity, pending any decision by a UK government to start rewriting EU rules that it wants to change in the future. The SNP-led Scottish government and the Labour-led Welsh government have both accused London of a power grab because the bill would ensure that, where the EU exercises powers over matters that are otherwise devolved, those powers would initially be transferred to London, and not to the devolved administrations. Northern Ireland is also affected but, with power sharing suspended, the main complaints have been coming from Edinburgh and Cardiff. Ministers have been trying to negotiate a compromise, but the Scottish and Welsh governments remain unsatisfied and have been threatening not to give the bill legislative consent – a move that would not necessarily block the legislation, but would undermine faith in the devolution settlement. Lidington, who is effectively Theresa May’s deputy, will say that he made a “considerable” offer to the devolved administrations in talks last week. Describing his plans for amendments saying there should be a presumption in favour of relevant EU powers being devolved, he will say: “Let’s be in no doubt: this would mean a very big change to the EU withdrawal bill that is before parliament and a significant step forward in these negotiations.” But he will explain why the UK government wants to reserve some control over these policy areas. “Some powers are clearly related to the UK as a whole and will need to continue to apply in the same way across all four nations in order to protect consumers and businesses who buy and sell across the UK, in all parts of what we might call the United Kingdom’s common market,” he will say. “That market is one of the fundamental expressions of the constitutional integrity that underpins our existence as a union.” The government has not yet tabled its proposed amendments to the bill, but it will need to do so soon because the EU withdrawal bill is already being debated in committee in the Lords. Lidington is hoping to reach an agreement first and is expected to convene another meeting of the joint ministerial committee - the body comprising ministers from the UK government and the devolved administrations - this week or next week. In his speech, Lidington will say that that preserving its “common market” makes the UK stronger. “Maintaining the common market of the United Kingdom will give us the heft to lead the charge for common regulatory standards at a global level. Having the right framework in place at home means we can be at the forefront of developing the new regulatory environment we need for the exciting technologies of tomorrow,” he will say. “We want innovators and producers across Scotland, Wales, England and Northern Ireland to be able take get ahead of the curve and edge ahead of their global competitors.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/feb/26/scottish-devolution-settlement-threatened-brexit","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-26T13:07:08Z","webTitle":"Scotland’s devolution settlement is threatened by Brexit.

It needn’t be","bodyText":"Established with fanfare from a muted trumpet in October 2016, the Joint Ministerial Committee (European Negotiations) was intended “to ensure that the interests of all parts of the United Kingdom are protected and advanced, and to develop a UK approach and objectives for the forthcoming negotiations”. Ministers committed themselves to meet monthly. In 16 months, it met only seven times. In the month before the prime minister sent the article 50 letter and in the following six months, it didn’t meet at all. No meetings of JMC (EN) officials took place between February and September 2017. Little wonder that ministers in the devolved administrations complained, bitterly, about lack of engagement. Such a neglectful approach has produced an EU (withdrawal) bill that betrays a lack of sensitivity and even basic understanding as to how the devolution settlement works. The Scotland Act 1998 proceeds on the basis that everything is devolved unless expressly reserved to Westminster. The bill turned that basic principle of devolution on its head. Post-Brexit, UK ministers would hoard the repatriated powers in devolved areas and confer them on the devolved institutions, as and when they saw fit. Mistrust between Whitehall and the devolved governments has, unsurprisingly, heightened, leading to unprecedented cooperation between the Scottish and Welsh governments, including jointly promoted amendments to the bill. In Holyrood, the relevant committee (including three Conservative members) unanimously declined to recommend legislative consent to the bill, as drafted. Belatedly, the Scottish secretary of state, David Mundell, admitted that the relevant provisions needed surgical amendment. This cack-handed approach of the UK government has allowed the Scottish government an opportunity to crank up its already well-oiled grievance machine, making sensible agreement and compromise more difficult. With a healthy dose of common sense, a feasible solution must be possible. It should be easy to identify where most of the 111 powers returning from Brussels, with a Scottish devolution dimension (“intersects” in the new jargon), should go. Something as matter of fact as where responsibility for the future of the “energy performance in buildings directive” should lie is surely not going to trigger a constitutional crisis. The UK government accepts that a good number of “intersects” can be repatriated directly to the devolved institutions. The Scottish government has acknowledged its willingness to negotiate UK frameworks – for example, to support the functioning of UK markets. And last October’s JMC set out agreed principles for establishing common frameworks. Some progress, apparently, was made at last Thursday’s JMC. Reports suggest the UK government is willing to flip the bill’s approach, with all powers going direct to the devolved institutions. But, with a stroke of tactless genius, it also proposes that UK ministers should have a veto over their use. It’s not unreasonable for the British government to be concerned that if powers are devolved, policies within the UK could diverge, pending agreed frameworks being established. But surely it doesn’t compromise anyone’s principles if, during that time, there is an agreed and time-limited moratorium on the use of these powers, with provision for ministers to act jointly, should the need for remedial legislation arise. And it’s not unreasonable for devolved administrations to have anxieties over what UK ministers might agree to in overseas trade negotiations, which could have an impact on devolved policy areas. The Canadian government allowed representatives from the provinces and territories to be in the room when negotiating their trade agreement with the EU. The UK government should accord the devolved administrations similar respect. What is needed now is much greater transparency. If we could identify the sticking points, we could make our own judgments as to whether they are serious, or whether some people are playing to the gallery. Agreement on frameworks is only a start. UK ministers simply cannot impose top-down policies on the other administrations. The Welsh government has published imaginative proposals for a UK council of ministers, with the possibility of some form of qualified majority voting. Such an approach is probably too bold and too radical for our present government. But let’s consider it. Surveying the otherwise bleak scene of post-Brexit Britain, I would find it sweetly ironic if, in rejecting an allegedly federal Europe, Brexit takes us step further down the road to a more federal UK. • Jim Wallace, Baron Wallace of Tankerness, is a former leader of the Liberal Democrats in the House of Lords.

However, his future is under serious consideration and another defeat on Saturday, when his side visit Watford, will almost certainly bring the sack. The damaging 2-1 defeat at home to Huddersfield Town on Saturday leaves Albion anchored to the bottom of the Premier League, seven points adrift of safety, with only 10 matches remaining. The club’s hierarchy are deeply concerned by their league position but also the fact that Pardew has had no positive impact on the team’s fortunes since his appointment in November. Albion have won only one of Pardew’s 14 league matches and a section of the fans turned on the manager in the closing stages of the game against Huddersfield. Yet Albion are not minded to make a change at the moment and risk further upheaval in a season that has been full of turmoil. Talks took place between Guochuan Lai, Albion’s owner, and members of the board in the wake of Saturday’s defeat but there was a collective agreement at the end of those discussions that Pardew should remain in charge for now. There is a feeling within the club that, with more than a quarter of the season remaining, the points are still available for Albion to haul themselves clear and Pardew will be supported – in the short-term at least – on that basis. At the same time there is no escaping the sense of disappointment about Pardew’s reign so far. As well as presiding over a miserable run of results Pardew pushed for the mid-season team-bonding trip in Barcelona that proved a disaster and ended with four players breaking a midnight curfew and allegedly stealing a taxi. Part of the problem for Albion when weighing up what to do with Pardew is the lack of credible and serious managerial alternatives. It is a situation that echoes the sort of issues Stoke City faced when deliberating over whether to dismiss Mark Hughes last month. Albion recognise, however, that the current run of form cannot be allowed to continue without taking any action. With that in mind, there is an acceptance at the Hawthorns that another setback at Watford would trigger a further review of Pardew’s position and probably end with him being cut loose only three months after replacing Tony Pulis. Another key consideration for Albion in all this is what will happen in the summer and beyond, given the club may well be playing Championship football and looking for a manager to win promotion. For the moment, however, Albion are not giving up all hope that they can survive with Pardew at the helm."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/feb/25/the-guardian-view-on-neanderthals-we-were-not-alone","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-25T18:15:18Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on Neanderthals: we were not alone | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/25/the-guardian-view-on-neanderthals-we-were-not-alone","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/25/the-guardian-view-on-neanderthals-we-were-not-alone","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on Neanderthals: we were not alone","bodyText":"The three human subspecies known to have hybridised to produce the present human population of the planet, Neanderthals, Homo sapiens and Denisovans, last had a common ancestor more than half a million years ago. Until now it has been assumed that the only branch of her descendants to think symbolically was us, Homo sapiens. In fact, until the development of sequencing techniques sensitive enough to work on ancient DNA, it was thought that the other two species had died out entirely, rather than leaving portions of their genome in European and Melanesian populations respectively. But the discovery, reported last week, of palaeolithic art at four sites in Spain that dates from the time when the peninsula was occupied only by Neanderthals, shows that they worked with symbols of stone and paint. We have no idea what these markings mean. That is in the nature of symbolism, and indeed of language: the meaning of a sound, or a marking on the wall, is given by the community that uses it; it can’t be read by outsiders. We already know that Neanderthals were anatomically equipped for speech; their use of painted symbols suggests that they could make audible symbols and not just visible ones. One of the effects of the discovery reported last week has been to push one of the standard tropes of science fiction 40,000 years into our past. That was when Homo sapiens met Homo neanderthalensis, another symbolically intelligent species, and our ancestors realised that they were not alone in the universe. We can deduce that these encounters must have been reasonably peaceable, because Europeans and all other populations outside Africa carry some Neanderthal DNA. Pushing the emergence of language so far back is exciting enough. But the implications are dizzying. If Neanderthals and Homo sapiens developed the capacity for symbolic thought and language independently, the ground for it must have been very well prepared more than half a million years ago, when the ancestors of the Neanderthals first left Africa. If they did not develop it independently, then those ancestors, Homo erectus, must have had a capacity for symbolic thought far earlier than most scientists would think likely. Animal studies have shown that almost all of the capacities that we once considered uniquely human are shared with animals. Some birds are capable of choosing and using wooden tools, chimpanzees use stone ones, and even sheep recognise one another as individuals. Many creatures communicate with sounds, as well as with smells and expressions. But only humans have symbolic language, so far as we know. Only humans form concepts and combine them as if they were physical tools before using them to shape the world. Now it seems that to be human in this sense is an older and stranger thing than anyone had earlier dared to dream."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/feb/25/stormzy-flag-up-poverty-neglect-ethnic-minority-children","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-25T17:34:08Z","webTitle":"We shouldn’t have to rely on Stormzy to flag up deprivation and neglect | Kimberly McIntosh","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/25/stormzy-flag-up-poverty-neglect-ethnic-minority-children","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/25/stormzy-flag-up-poverty-neglect-ethnic-minority-children","fields":{"headline":"We shouldn’t have to rely on Stormzy to flag up deprivation and neglect","bodyText":"When Stormzy spoke out at the Brits against Theresa May’s response to Grenfell, it wasn’t just about the disgraceful response to the fire. It was also a reflection of the reality facing people growing up on neglected estates. He has spoken before about his experience of poverty in his childhood, and his struggle to stay on the right track. Stormzy’s black Britishness is a factor here for, as he vented his frustration, he again highlighted the enduring fact that issues impacting ethnic minorities are rarely prioritised. He gave urgency to the question so many continue to ask: had the Grenfell tragedy occurred in Gloucestershire, were child poverty endemic in Cambridge instead of Tower Hamlets, would we not see a stronger response from the government? Last year May said we must hold a mirror up to our society. With the race disparity audit, she did just that – releasing a wealth of data that showed entrenched racial inequality was endemic. But there was a specific ill there in plain sight that either she didn’t see or we have chosen not to talk about. The End Child Poverty Coalition reports increases in child poverty in Britain’s most deprived areas and the fact that the top 10 most deprived areas are also the places with the most black and ethnic-minority children. But it’s worse than that. Analysis of census and other data by the Runnymede Trusts suggests that nearly half of ethnic-minority children in Britain today live in poverty conditions. This is a painful realisation for me. My mother has been a foster carer for more than a decade, and I also saw firsthand the devastating impact of poverty. But I also saw that their trajectories were not irreversible. I had the privilege of seeing a number of children who had arrived hungry and neglected go on to flourish and thrive. I saw how, with support early on, a child’s life can be turned around. That should be the hope for all children, but what does it say about a nation when it becomes clear that the strongest predictor of a child going to school hungry is the colour of their skin? Child poverty is not just a moral concern, it’s also an issue of racial justice. We should all care about the colour of child poverty, because there can be no integration while race divides the haves and have-nots. We cannot have a cohesive society without an end to poverty, without making social mobility a reality. We were promised much, but as Brexit befuddles the government, May’s commitment to tackling “burning injustices” seems to have been shunted to the sidelines. And that spells bad news for the hugely disproportionate numbers of black and Asian children going hungry and cold. Bad news and ruined futures. New research by the University of Geneva suggests that child poverty increases the risk of heart disease and cancer in later life – even if you work your way out of poverty. Ignoring this crisis now will have consequences that last a lifetime. Never mind tackling injustices in this parliament or even the next, the child poverty figures show we’ll be living with the consequences of racial inequality into the 22nd century. There are many problems interlinked. We were promised an integration white paper after the Casey review, but the Brexit talks have produced a policy road-block, leaving us still waiting for the green paper. We desperately need a comprehensive strategy that outlines clearly how the poverty and inequality faced by ethnic minorities will be tackled. And we need to see both Labour and the Conservatives commit to a “triple lock” on benefits for children – such as child tax credit and child benefit – so they actually rise with the cost of living. Top-ups from tax credits are a lifeline for families all over the country. Families need a real living wage that covers the costs of food, heat, housing, transport and school uniforms. Naming it the “national living wage” is not enough. Our work at the Runnymede Trust with the Women’s Budget Group showed that the benefit freeze and benefit cap have been a disaster for ethnic-minority women and single mothers. The government’s own impact assessment noted that 37% of those affected were from ethnic minorities. Nearly 200,000 children from the lowest-income families saw their household incomes fall further when the cap was lowered. Housing costs are a contributor to poverty. Regardless of income level, type of house or age group, ethnic minorities are more likely to live in overcrowded housing. A third of homeless households are from ethnic-minority backgrounds. The distraction of help to buy needs to end. Those on low incomes can wait no longer for genuinely affordable, decent social housing, and once again we see how a policy, or policy vacuum, afflicts the disadvantaged in general and specific groups and communities in particular. We were told that, with a new analysis and a new focus from government, the inequalities that blight minorities would be addressed, but that has yet to happen, and now we know that the notable victims of that neglect are children. The prime minister should have been their champion. They – and we – shouldn’t have to rely on Stormzy. • Kimberly McIntosh is policy officer at the Runnymede Trust"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/2018/feb/25/letter-ian-aitken-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-25T16:04:12Z","webTitle":"Letter: Ian Aitken obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/feb/25/letter-ian-aitken-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/feb/25/letter-ian-aitken-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Letter: Ian Aitken obituary","bodyText":"The first time I met Ian Aitken, in 1995, it was obvious how much affection and admiration he had for Michael Foot, the former leader of the Labour party.

The species, which provided the model for the much-loved character Ratty in The Wind of the Willows, has suffered catastrophic declines over several decades and is the UK’s fastest declining mammal. Habitat loss, water pollution and the introduction of American mink – originally farmed for their fur, but which escaped into the wild and proved a voracious predator – have all contributed to the slump in the number of voles. Analysis led by the Wildlife Trusts found a decline of 30% in the areas where they live between 2006 and 2015. A slight increase in their distribution was recorded in the last few years, thanks to conservation efforts by wildlife groups – the biggest reintroduction of water voles in the UK began last year – but the situation remains bleak. Ellie Brodie, the senior policy officer for the Wildlife Trusts, said: “Water voles are an essential part of our wild and watery places and it’s terribly sad that we’re continuing to witness huge declines of this much-loved mammal. “The Wildlife Trusts and others are working hard to help bring them back again and care for the places they need to survive – but much more is needed if we’re going to stop this charismatic creature disappearing altogether.” Water voles have disappeared from 94% of places where they were once found, previous research found. They are important because their burrowing and feeding behaviour along the edges of watercourses creates the conditions for other animals and plants to thrive. The Wildlife Trusts want the government’s planned nature recovery network to be underpinned by a new Environment Act and expanded funding for water vole conservation efforts. They also want landowners to manage river banks sympathetically to help water voles and for people to volunteer to help survey water voles or manage riverside habitat. A Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs spokeswoman said the government was concerned about the decline of water voles. “Through our 25-year environment plan we will provide opportunities for species recovery as we develop our nature recovery network, creating or restoring 500,000 hectares of wildlife-rich habitat to provide benefits for species such as the water vole.” Last year, Northumberland Wildlife Trust alone released 570 water voles across Kielder Water and Forest Park, in the first step of the major reintroduction programme."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/feb/25/syrias-return-to-bombing-as-usual-is-down-to-russia","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-25T16:07:56Z","webTitle":"Syria's return to bombing-as-usual is down to Russia | Simon Tisdall","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/25/syrias-return-to-bombing-as-usual-is-down-to-russia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/feb/25/syrias-return-to-bombing-as-usual-is-down-to-russia","fields":{"headline":"Syria's return to bombing-as-usual is down to Russia","bodyText":"The first signs from eastern Ghouta are not encouraging. A day after the UN security council finally agreed a ceasefire, it was back to bombing-as-usual for Syria’s regime. It is as though the vote for a truce in the besieged enclave, so long in coming and so contentious, never happened at all. Bashar al-Assad, Syria’s president, is primarily culpable. He probably no longer cares what the world thinks. He has no reputation to lose. Perhaps he calculates one final push by his ground forces will finish the rebels, before a ceasefire takes hold. But the larger burden of responsibility lies with Russia. It was Vladimir Putin who rescued Assad in 2015 when he was losing the war. Russia’s president has protected his Syrian poodle from war crimes charges and blocked inquiries into his use of banned chemical weapons. Putin has bathed in the kudos of seeming to supplant the US as the Middle East’s big mover and shaker. When Israel and Iran got into a scrap in Syrian airspace recently, it was Putin, not Donald Trump, who phoned Jerusalem and told Benjamin Netanyahu to knock it off. And it was Putin who delayed the UN ceasefire last week, even as Ghouta’s children were dying, watering down its provisions. He ensured, in effect, that anybody Assad deems a “terrorist” is still fair game for his barrel bombers. That is why the fighting continues unchecked. The Syrian conflict began as a popular, internal uprising against a dictator. But since Russia jumped in militarily it has become Putin’s war. It is Moscow’s biggest foreign military adventure since the 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Remember how that ended. Putin owns the Syria conflict, in the same way Lyndon Johnson owned Vietnam. Russian forces are not committed on the ground to a similar degree. But Russia’s global prestige, geo-strategic interests and political and military credibility are now inextricably linked to Assad. Increasingly that looks like a bad bet that Putin cannot afford to lose. Syria is a shocking, baffling mess. For ordinary Russians, it is a waste of men and money. For a watching world, appalled by scenes of relentless brutality and cruelty in Ghouta, Aleppo, and a thousand other towns and cities, it is Putin’s mess. It’s up to him to fix it.

It made Ledecka the first woman to win two separate events – and a bona fide star. Sean Ingle North Korean cheerleaders The appearance of 229 women in identical red snowsuits would have turned heads anywhere, but the presence of North Koreans singing in unison and performing choreographed routines often captured more attention than whatever event they were attending. Reactions were mixed and the cheerleaders were largely seen as a novelty, another thing to take a selfie with, but were definitely unique to the Pyeongchang Olympics. Benjamin Haas South Korea’s Garlic Girls The South Korean women’s curling team known as the Garlic Girls, a nod to the famed export of their Uiseong hometown where they met and formed a team as high schoolers, became an overnight sensation during their inspired run to Sunday’s gold medal match, winning hearts around the world with their steely focus and quirky personalities en route to an improbable silver medal. Bryan Armen Graham Gus Kenworthy’s kiss Kenworthy kissing his boyfriend just before his freestyle ski event was the kiss seen around the world. He has been a champion for gay athletes at the Olympics and slammed Mike Pence leading the US delegation. This year’s Games included the most openly LGBTQ athletes with a total of 15, including Ireen Wüst, who became the most successful Olympic speed skater ever with 11 medals. BH Return of the shirtless Tongan The return of the shirtless and oiled Tongan at the opening ceremony, but this time in subzero temperatures, delighted many viewers and raised Pita Taufatofua’s profile. He had not seen snow until two years ago but qualified for a cross-country ski race in an effort to inspire others to dream big. Nigeria’s women’s bobsled team, a first for Africa, also carried a motivational message. BH Chloe Kim launches out of a halfpipe into the hearts of the world There are many Olympic gold medallists but stars are harder to come by. Chloe Kim, the 17-year-old Korean-American snowboarder who entered these Olympics with the weight of two countries on her shoulders, placed herself squarely in the latter camp when she delivered on her long-held promise with a transcendent run for Olympic halfpipe gold. Light-years beyond her rivals, she has a future of limitless promise: 2022, 2026, 2030 … and beyond? BAG Billy Morgan takes bronze in big air It seemed impossible that Morgan would surpass partying with a toilet seat around his head in Sochi. But in Pyeongchang he claimed a brilliant bronze, before celebrating by being driven around the Olympic Village on a trolley. The 28-year-old former builder clearly has cojones the size of breezeblocks – and is funny and a bit mad with it. SI Lizzy Yarnold wins gold for Britain A week before the Winter Olympics Yarnold was a 28-1 outsider to retain her skeleton title due to various niggles and mixed performances. Worse still, she was also suffering from a brutal chest infection and at one point thought she feared she would have to pull out. Yet, once again when the pressure was highest, Yarnold delivered – with gold. SI Diggins and Randall make history No American woman had ever won a medal in cross-country – much less a gold – until Jessie Diggins and Kikkan Randall overtook Sweden and Norway on the final lap to win the team sprint freestyle.

The England striker had endured the type of afternoon that would send most forwards apologetically back into their shells, a pair of misses from point-blank range surely playing on his mind as Tottenham ran aground on a blanket defence. Yet Roy Hodgson, frantically reorganising his back-line as the contest drifted towards its denouement, must have known how this tends to play out. The Crystal Palace manager, when in charge of the national team, had once looked to Kane to salvage situations and here was the striker peeling away from the clutter in the six-yard box at Christian Eriksen’s late corner to eke out space at the far post. Damien Delaney, a 36-year-old thrown into a rare appearance off the bench after the excellent James Tomkins had cramped up making a clearance, seemed to lose his bearings as he stared into the glare of the early afternoon sun. He should still have been stronger but he twisted too late in trying to stifle his opponent. Kane had squeezed out enough room in which to work. His header was cushioned delightfully to arc back beyond Wayne Hennessey, via a touch of the goalkeeper’s glove, and over Christian Benteke and James McArthur on the line to ripple the far corner of the net. Kane’s 11th goal in 10 games, 24th in the league this season and 150th of his club career, was ultimately a thing of delicate beauty, even if Hodgson spent what little time remained thumping his head back against his seat in the dug-out spitting livid frustration. “Harry’s character made him keep pushing to achieve what we needed,” said Mauricio Pochettino. “All talented players miss chances but what makes a top player different is that, when he makes a mistake, he forgets about it almost immediately and takes the next.” Spurs, now on their best unbeaten run since 1999 at 15 matches, were thankful for his stubborn refusal to wilt. They had monopolised the ball in a contest that had long since degenerated into an exercise of attack versus defence but were starting to run out of ideas when their reward was plucked from the game’s last knockings. Dele Alli had been reduced to seeking out contact in the penalty area – the midfielder might have had an argument for an award but for his increasingly familiar tendency to over-elaborate the collapse to the turf, which may be dissuading officials from making decisions in his favour – with Hennessey and Palace’s rejigged rearguard was thwarting everything flung at them. Those two Kane misses felt more significant with every block or save mustered by the hosts, Tottenham’s anxiety rather summed up by Serge Aurier further blighting an erratic display with a trio of foul throws. Palace had handed Kane his first chance when Patrick van Aanholt sliced an attempted clearance from Alli’s diagonal to the forward’s feet, only for Hennessey to dart out and deflect the shot over the bar. Early in the second half a period of Spurs possession had culminated in Eriksen’s delivery, lofted into the six-yard box with the outside of his left boot, only for Kane, his body shape uncharacteristically awkward, to plant his volley wide. It was to his credit that he summoned the composure to score at the end and give the visitors the win they merited. Even Hodgson would not deny Tottenham had “the best of the play and created all the chances”, though the finale still felt cruel. Palace, outside the bottom three only on goal difference with Manchester United and Chelsea to face next, had been denied 12 senior players through injury even before Tomkins hobbled away with “severe cramp”. Aaron Wan-Bissaka had been asked to quell Eriksen’s considerable threat on senior debut, the first Palace academy graduate to make a full league debut for the club in 2,148 days – a rather stark statistic – and performed capably, but all the hard work and endeavour of the collective went only so far. They had harried and hassled admirably, threatening occasionally through Andros Townsend’s pace or Alexander Sørloth’s muscular running, but mental and physical fatigue kicked in before the end. All the chopping and changing eventually took its toll. Hodgson may have Martin Kelly back from a hamstring injury against United next Monday, when Timothy Fosu-Mensah is ineligible, and Jeffrey Schlupp is due to resume training. The manager is still none the wiser as to when Mamadou Sakho, whose wife gave birth to the couple’s third child in France last week, will feel ready to test his calf in competitive action again. These are increasingly desperate times and, given the fixtures ahead, the situation is likely to worsen before it can improve. “After seven games we were eight points adrift and at least now we’re level,” said Hodgson. “If we get the players back who are unfit at the moment, who knows? In our best moments, with our best team, we can be quite effective.” Their run-in is going to be excruciatingly tense."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"music/2018/feb/25/eddie-amoo-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-25T15:29:32Z","webTitle":"Eddie Amoo obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/feb/25/eddie-amoo-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/feb/25/eddie-amoo-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Eddie Amoo obituary","bodyText":"In 1976, somewhat against the odds, the Real Thing topped the UK charts with You to Me Are Everything, a song that became a disco classic. Although black soul music was appreciated by British record-buyers, they had shown little interest in homegrown examples. This was the breakthrough single, the one that said it was OK to buy British soul music. The Real Thing continued to have hits, but by far their most thought-provoking release was their album, 4 from 8, from the following year, in which Eddie (later Eddy) Amoo, who has died aged 73, and his younger brother, Chris (later Cris), wrote about the turmoil around them in the Toxteth area of Liverpool 8. A three-track medley of nearly 12 minutes included Children of the Ghetto, which was not a hit for the Real Thing but taken up very successfully by Philip Bailey (best known as a singer with Earth, Wind and Fire), Courtney Pine and Mary J Blige. Possibly the Real Thing’s original fans found the social realism hard to take and it was clearly inspired by Eddie’s hero, Curtis Mayfield. “I met him in 1975,” Eddie told me, “and I played him one of my songs, A Man Without a Face. He said, ‘It’s too heavy, man.’ I wasn’t expecting that reaction. The most political songwriter of our age was telling me to cool it!” The Liverpool 8 Medley is Eddie Amoo’s testimony to the streets he loved. It was a delight to walk around with him as everybody would recognise him and have a friendly word. In 1964 he married Sylvia Joel, and they lived close to Sefton Park, with their daughters, Dionne, Sara, Michaela and Marlene. Born in the city, Eddie was the son of another Liverpudlian, Moya, and her husband, Robert, a seaman from Ghana. Eddie recalled his mother taking him to see Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers at the Liverpool Empire in 1957. “It was my first concert and there were very few black people in the audience. Someone pointed at me and said, ‘There’s one of them.’ I’d found a role model in Frankie Lymon and I wanted to be a singer.” Still, there were troubles ahead. Eddie was caught with a knife and sent to borstal. In the early 1960s, he befriended Joey and Edmund Ankrah, the sons of a minister, and together with Alan Harding and Nat Smeeda they formed a doo-wop group, the Chants. They sang Gene Chandler’s Duke of Earl and Kathy Young’s A Thousand Stars a cappella. They saw the Beatles, who occasionally backed them. “About six times,” said Eddie. “It would have been more but their manager Brian Epstein didn’t think they should be backing anyone.” As a result, the Chants established their own backing unit, the Harlems. The Chants were signed to Pye Records and produced by Tony Hatch, and although they nearly scored with an infectious I Could Write a Book, they should have done better. They were championed by the Liverpool MP Bessie Braddock. In 1975 Chris Amoo formed his own band, the Real Thing, which won ITV’s Opportunity Knocks, and he suggested that Eddie, now playing guitar and keyboards, should join them. Eddie coached the band, which included Dave Smith and Ray Lake, and they toured with David Essex, who used them on the hit album All the Fun of the Fair (1975) and later on the hit single Me and My Girl (Night-Clubbing) (1982). The Real Thing’s first hits, You to Me Are Everything and Can’t Get By Without You, the latter of which reached No 2, were written and produced by Ken Gold, but their subsequent successes, You’ll Never Know What You’re Missing, Love’s Such a Wonderful Thing and Can You Feel the Force?, inspired by Star Wars, were written by the Amoo brothers. In the 80s the group had success with “decade remixes” but they wanted to avoid becoming a tired club act. “We had to find ways to tweak the songs,” said Eddie, “We wanted to re-energise and revitalise them without changing what made them popular.” This included rapping, and the group kept fit so that they looked good on stage. In 2013 the Real Thing recorded a live album and DVD at the Philharmonic Hall in Liverpool, and a documentary film about their career, directed by Simon Sheridan, is in its final stages. “I have a theory,” said Eddie, “that so much racism isn’t racism at all but teenage boredom. I was so lucky to have an outlet for my frustration and life’s been good to me. When I started, I had nothing but the ability to sing.” Eddie is survived by Sylvia and his daughters, and Chris plans to continue with the band. • Eddie Amoo (Edward Robert Amoo), singer and songwriter, born 4 May 1944; died 23 February 2018 This article was amended on 26 February 2018.

No one wants to help me’, G2, 22 February). Might the supreme court judgment in favour of John Worboys’ victims offer some hope? If anything could be classed as inhuman or degrading treatment under article 3 of the European convention on human rights, surely it is these cases. No wonder our prime minister – and former home secretary – wants the country out of the convention. Roger Downie Glasgow • Your article about the “brutal immigration climate” reminded me of what happened to my father. He was born in what was Calcutta in 1927 to a British couple, the youngest of four. He and his siblings were all brought to the UK as toddlers and left to be brought up in South Wales by their maternal grandparents. In 1970 he applied for a British passport, having never travelled abroad since his arrival, at which point all hell broke loose as the Home Office had no record of his entry into the UK. He had to provide no end of documentation to prove his right to a British passport. My father was furious for, as he pointed out, no one seemed too worried about his status when he had to do his national service. His eldest brother, by now a judge, was equally put out, having spent the whole of the war fighting in Europe (soldiers didn’t require passports). However, both were eventually granted British passports. A cynic might say that it helped that they were white, university-educated professionals. Su Coates Lower Rudge, Somerset • I’m embarrassed to admit being naive even though I’m nearing 70. There’s me thinking how barbaric it is for the US to forcefully repatriate illegal immigrants, despite the fact they had forged productive lives and raised children (legal American citizens) over several decades – all this chiefly due to Trump’s policies. Now I am astonished to read our Home Office is executing similar antisocial acts against “retirement age” Caribbean citizens, who have also spent most of their adult life in the UK. I think it’s time to re-release the film It’s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World – but as a documentary this time around; it will be a blockbuster. Paul Garrod Portsmouth • The appalling treatment of Commonwealth citizens who arrived here as children, and have contributed to the UK all of their lives, suggests that the UK should no longer hold the post of “head of the Commonwealth”. Perhaps it is time to expel the UK from the Commonwealth in the light of its inexcusable, inhumane treatment of the children of parents who were encouraged to come to the UK as convenient labour – and whose children are now treated as though they are past their usefulness.

The band – founder members Kelly Jones and bassist Richard Jones, plus guitarist Adam Zindani and drummer Jamie Morrison – marked the occasion with one ramshackle gig at an 800-capacity student union in London, breaking up the vintage album tracks with a medley of AC/DC, Black Sabbath and Springsteen covers. By all accounts, it sounded as if the veteran ironmongers of flinty romanticism were finally having fun. Perhaps emancipation has that power. For the past seven years, Stereophonics have been perhaps the biggest indie band in the world, free of record contract tyranny yet still capable of comfortably filling massive arenas and booking headline festival slots. A brace of new records on their own label charted impressively; their 10th album, Scream Above the Sounds, was released via Parlophone late last year and only missed No 1 because Michael Ball and Alfie Boe made an early play for the Christmas market. Removing the major-label yoke of relentlessly producing albums and touring may not have pushed Jones’s songwriting into new realms of cosmic experimentation, but it does seem as if he has been listening to a lot of ZZ Top. The hard boogie of new song Chances Are is booming enough to fill this Aberdeen hangar and then some. It is accompanied by grindhouse footage of dirtbikes, hot rods and other symbols of revved-up Americana– an appropriate kickoff for a monster-truck-sized gig. Jones’s voice – that impressive Rod Stewart rasp, albeit with the twinkle turned down – adds horsepower and heft to newer material, but there is a distinct uptick in energy whenever the band reprise their earliest hits. A rampant run through More Life in a Tramp’s Vest is greeted particularly warmly, complete with vintage pics and video of the band in younger, longer-haired days. Things occasionally veer into arena-rock routine – with encroaching dry ice on All in One Night and a jiving baritone sax player on the grinding Geronimo – but there is little sense of self-indulgence. The overall vibe is of seriousness, although one perhaps unintentional moment of humour comes from an acoustic interlude on a cosy stage set where band members and their instruments are brought so close together you half expect them to knock each other over. They resurrect their Handbags and Gladrags cover from The Office, inspiring a happy punter to twirl a security guard beside the sound desk. After that sweet acoustic detour, a run of middling, muddy songs threatens to derail the show, draining momentum. Even the return of the sax player, this time throwing a tenor around, cannot amp up new track Cryin’ in Your Beer. But after that longueur, there is a five-song run of classics – relatable, hardscrabble snapshots of life far away from bright lights and big cities – that serve as an impressive reminder of why Stereophonics became so successful so fast. While playing Traffic, Kelly dramatically pauses mid-strum in a moment designed to create tension. Instead, the gap is filled to overflowing with emphatic cheers, to the extent that he even cracks a smile. • At Motorpoint Arena, Nottingham, 26 February. Box office: 0843 373 3000.

After Hamilton’s opening night was delayed, making it ineligible for this year’s WhatsOnStage awards, the field was wide open and three wildly contrasting shows shared the limelight. Everybody’s Talking About Jamie, inspired by the true story of a teenage boy who wanted to dress in girls’ clothes, was crowned best new musical at Sunday’s ceremony at the Prince of Wales theatre in the West End of London. The hit show, first staged in Sheffield before transferring to the West End, also won best actor in a musical (John McCrea) and best supporting actress in a musical (Lucie Shorthouse). Jez Butterworth’s The Ferryman, which became the fastest-selling production in the 60-year history of the Royal Court theatre before its West End transfer, took home the award for best new play. The production, set in Northern Ireland in the early 1980s, also won Sam Mendes best direction, and Fra Fee best supporting actor in a play. The biggest winner with four prizes was Broadway fairytale 42nd Street, which won best musical revival, best choreography, best set design and best costume design. Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, one of the biggest stage events of recent years, took two awards – best West End show and best show poster – to add to the eight it received last year. The Almeida theatre’s production of Hamlet, starring Andrew Scott, also won two prizes. The show was voted best play revival and Juliet Stevenson received best supporting actress in a play for her performance as Gertrude. The main acting awards for plays went to the Broadchurch co-stars Olivia Colman (best actress) and David Tennant (best actor) for their respective roles in Mosquitoes at the National Theatre, and Don Juan in Soho at the Wyndham’s. For Tennant, it was the third time he had taken the award, having previously won for Hamlet and Richard II. He said: “It was a real privilege getting to do a play about Soho in Soho and, especially over a summer when London sadly suffered terrible attacks, the play itself began to feel like a real celebration of London.” The West End producer Sonia Friedman, whose credits include Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, The Ferryman, Don Juan in Soho and Hamlet, won the Equity award for services to theatre."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"media/2018/feb/25/bbcs-steph-mcgovern-says-she-would-earn-more-if-she-was-posher","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-25T12:20:54Z","webTitle":"BBC's Steph McGovern says she would earn more if she was posher","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/feb/25/bbcs-steph-mcgovern-says-she-would-earn-more-if-she-was-posher","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2018/feb/25/bbcs-steph-mcgovern-says-she-would-earn-more-if-she-was-posher","fields":{"headline":"BBC's Steph McGovern says she would earn more if she was posher","bodyText":"A top BBC presenter has said she would earn more money if she had a posh accent instead of her pronounced north-east twang. Middlesbrough-born BBC Breakfast presenter Steph McGovern said she had only “just now” made it to a six-figure salary while “posher” colleagues do similar roles for “a hell of a lot more”. The 35-year-old also said the BBC should do more to encourage working-class people into broadcasting. “We concentrate too much on ethnic diversity and not enough on class. It’s dead important to represent loads of different cultures. But what the BBC doesn’t do enough of is thinking about getting people from more working-class backgrounds,” she told the Sunday Times. Speaking to the Guardian on Sunday, she clarified her remarks, saying the BBC should not do less work recruiting more people from ethnic minority backgrounds, but should give more consideration to class: “If you focus on class too, then that will bring with it diversity in every sense, not just ethnicity. There shouldn’t just be a focus on ethnicity.” McGovern added: “A lot of people who talk to me in the street [and] say they like me on telly are people from ethnic minorities, because we’re often from a similar socio-economic background.” McGovern, the daughter of a teacher and radiographer, told the Sunday Times that she has had to argue consistently to get paid fairly. “It’s not as simple as a gender issue; it’s partly down to class. There are a lot of women who do a similar job to me who are paid a hell of a lot more ... who are a lot posher than me.” She did not make it on to the BBC’s best-paid list last year, which only features presenters and stars earning more than £150,000. The list included the news and Antiques Roadshow presenter Fiona Bruce, who earns between £350,000 and £399,999, and Newsnight’s Kirsty Wark, who takes home £150,000-£199,999. McGovern believes too many BBC managers are out of touch with ordinary people: “A lot of people in management are from the same background. We’re talking about ‘how do we represent more working-class people?’, when they themselves are not working-class. So how do they know?” she told the Sunday Times. Earlier this month McGovern tweeted farewell to Louisa Compton, editor of BBC Two’s Victoria Derbyshire programme, who had been poached by Channel 4: “Huge loss for the BBC – a Bafta-winning journalist – one of few who investigates stories real people care about and doesn’t live in a political/media bubble.” A few years ago, a BBC Breakfast viewer wrote in to give McGovern £20 towards curing her “affliction”, meaning her accent. She told the Sunday Express magazine: “I even got one letter that politely said, ‘Dear Ms McGovern, I watched you on BBC Breakfast. I’m sorry about your terrible affliction. Here’s £20 towards correction therapy.’” A BBC spokeswoman said: “More than 80% of the BBC’s workforce was educated in state schools and the BBC is more diverse than it has ever been. The BBC has a clear commitment to finding and developing new talent. “We offer hundreds of apprenticeships to ensure the BBC is open to people from all backgrounds and a range of programmes to help people develop their career once they’ve joined, but there’s always more to do and we have an ambitious diversity strategy which sets out our commitment to fully reflecting and representing the whole of the UK.” Almost half of BBC employees (48%) come from a family in which neither parent had a degree but 61% come from families in which the main earner had a higher managerial and professional job."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/mar/14/women-who-work-how-shonda-rhimes-tv-shows-excel-in-the-workplace","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-14T10:00:08Z","webTitle":"Women who work: how Shonda Rhimes' TV shows excel in the workplace","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/mar/14/women-who-work-how-shonda-rhimes-tv-shows-excel-in-the-workplace","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/mar/14/women-who-work-how-shonda-rhimes-tv-shows-excel-in-the-workplace","fields":{"headline":"Women who work: how Shonda Rhimes' TV shows excel in the workplace","bodyText":"At the end of the pilot episode for Grey’s Anatomy spin-off Station 19, Andy (played by Jaina Lee Ortiz) expresses the deep love she has for her work as a firefighter. “I don’t need a prize,” she tells her colleagues, “Every day here is a prize. Every life saved. Every fire put out. We’re Seattle firefighters. Station 19 is where we choose to be.” Station 19 is, of course, not just a show about working at a fire station. It focuses on family conflicts, parent-child relationships, and romantic and sexual intrigue, all of which are mainstays in Shondaland productions. Yet the heart of the show, and the heart of many of Shonda Rhimes’ most impressively watched and beloved programs, is the focus on women who don’t just work, but who truly, genuinely believe in and love the work they do. Both Station 19 and For the People, Shondaland’s other new show, which focuses on the lives of a group of young attorneys working at the Mother Court in New York, continue this tradition by providing intimate looks at women who are primarily motivated by the work that they do, and who are often willing to overstep the men they love in order to get the accolades they want and deserve. Focusing on the lives of women who work isn’t necessarily a new step for television. Shows like Mary Tyler Moore, Murphy Brown, Living Single, Supergirl, Mad Men and The West Wing, among others, have all looked at women’s experiences in the workplace. Yet, Shondaland’s consistent centering on the love of work itself, rather than the enduring sexism of the workplace or the difficulties that come with having a high-pressure job, offers a view of working women that is both powerful and nuanced, and that cuts across preconceived notions of class, race and gender, allowing us to see that female characters can be just as motivated by personal excellence and success as their male peers. One way that Shondaland achieves this is by presenting work itself as just as thrilling and essential as a romantic escapade. In the pilot of Grey’s Anatomy, Meredith Grey gushes about the wonders of performing surgery for the first time. “That was amazing. You practice on cadavers. You observe. And you think you know what you are going to feel like standing over that table, but that was such a high. I don’t know why anybody does drugs!” In Scandal, Olivia Pope’s team are introduced to us as “gladiators … in suits.” In How to Get Away with Murder, professor Annalise Keating may feel like her personal romantic life is out of control, but conveys power, precision and determination when taking the stand. “I’ll handle it,” she tells a colleague when her winning verdict is threatened. “I want to be her,” her student proclaims with awe when she sees Annalise speak to the press after winning that same case. Rhimes allows working women to be the heroes in their own stories in a way that prizes and protects each working woman’s humanity, allowing work to nourish her characters, but not letting the work being a stand in for other complexities. Perhaps this is because Rhimes herself identifies so much with the tremendous joy of being in that “zone” when doing the work that you love, an experience that Rhimes calls “the hum”. “When I am hard at work, when I am deep in it, there is no other feeling,” Rhimes explains in a 2016 TED Talk. “I love working. It is creative and mechanical and exhausting and exhilarating and hilarious and disturbing and clinical and maternal and cruel and judicious, and what makes it all so good is the hum. There is some kind of shift inside me when the work gets good. A hum begins in my brain and it grows and it grows and that hum sounds like the open road, and I could drive it forever.” It’s rare to hear a woman giving a talk on work-life balance speak so freely of how much she loves the work itself, how it feeds and nourishes her, and how central and important it is to her selfhood and identity, even if, as she describes in her TED Talk, that work hum is not all of her identity. It’s in balancing that hum, rather than rejecting it, that Rhimes is able to be more fully connected to her family, and herself. In a world that consistently tells women they have to choose between prioritizing work and home, this message is an important one that permeates Shondaland onscreen, as well as the recently launched Shondaland.com, which focuses on centering female stories, often relating to how women, and especially women of color, navigate a world that underestimates them. In a recent tweet, Rhimes was clear in expressing her worth, which many thought to be in reference to her company’s recent move to Netflix. “Correction: a black woman built an empire of humanity-themed TV shows. Do your homework. Get woke. Black is not a theme. I am not a token. But I am a night of television.” In this way, Shondaland’s tradition of presenting women who work with dignity, nuance and valor isn’t just about great storytelling; it’s about the insistence that women should get credit for the very real work they do, and acknowledging that women shouldn’t be viewed as “tokens” when they are the best and the brightest. This message rings loud and clear in For the People, when the pilot episode ends with Sandra (Britt Robertson) and best friend and fellow lawyer Allison (Jasmin Savoy Brown) looking out at the Mother Court, where they now work, and have encountered any number of fraught cases already. “Are we worthy?” Allison asks. The two go back and forth joking about the answer, but the scene ends with a moment of determination, rather than confusion. As Sandra looks proudly into the distance, she leans against her best friend and declares, “We are worthy.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/mar/12/spy-scandal-uk-russia-relations-tumbling-what-next-skripal-salisbury-poisoning","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-13T10:01:40Z","webTitle":"Sergei Skripal scandal has sent UK-Russia relations tumbling.

What next?","bodyText":"Theresa May’s assertion that it is highly likely the Russian state has committed an act of aggression by poisoning the double agent Sergei Skripal plunges Anglo-Russian relations into their worst state since the cruise missile crisis in the 1980s. The prime minister knows that she will have to go further than her response as home secretary to the 2006 murder of Alexander Litvinenko – some assets frozen, an end to intelligence cooperation and the expulsion of a number of Russian diplomats. Although the UK is giving Russia 24 hours to prove the murder came about due to rogue operators gaining control of military grade nerve agent, no one expects the Russian ambassador, Alexander Yakovenko, will even try to convince the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, that the Russian state simply lost control of the poison. Trust between the UK and Russia has been in short supply for years, and it is more likely Yakovenko will say Russia is the victim of media-induced spy fever. It will leave May with no option but to confirm that the Russian state committed an unlawful use of force against the UK. That would place the onus on the Foreign Office not just to compile an effective unilateral response, but also to gather European and American support for a multilateral measures. The context of Brexit, and Donald Trump’s ambivalence towards Putin, sets a diplomatic challenge for the Foreign Office. The UK has long been the anti-Russian outrider in Europe, and Johnson’s meeting with Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, in Moscow in December achieved little. European Union countries come to the Russian issue with their own agendas and commercial interests. The EU foreign affairs chief, Federica Mogherini, has insisted the bloc was not suffering from sanctions fatigue over Ukraine, pointing to the imminent fourth anniversary of the annexation of Crimea. The EU competitiveness council on Monday renewed the existing sanctions regime. But Angela Merkel, the reinstalled German chancellor, said she hoped the expected re-election of Vladimir Putin this weekend might provide a moment to restart the Minsk peace process. She favours further engagement. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, on Monday fended off rare criticism of his Syrian policy from his predecessor François Hollande by defending his policy of engagement with Russia, arguing he did not think the years of complete absence of dialogue had led to any progress for France. Equally the new Italian government, once it is formed, is likely to be influenced by the pro-Russian populist right. Many experts say EU sanctions have probably reduced growth in Russia by just 1% last year. In a recent report, the Estonian intelligence agency claimed Putin “uses western sanctions to shield himself from criticism of a failed economic policy, and [this] helps to some degree to paper over the fundamental weaknesses in the economy”. So the poisoning of a Russian double agent in a British cathedral city makes fascinating reading for European nations, but many Western politicians will be guided by bigger strategic choices including relations over Syria, Iran, Ukraine and commerce. Trump has also been reluctant to sanction Putin over alleged interference in the 2016 US election, with most of the running being made by Congress. The likely UK unilateral package will start with the expulsion of some diplomats. Throwing out the ambassador would be a major step, and leave the UK bereft of a smart high-level conduit to Moscow. Retaliation, including the expulsion of the UK’s ambassador in Moscow, might follow. The culture secretary, Matt Hancock, could in theory direct the broadcasting regulator Ofcom to investigate whether Russian media outlets such as RT are fit to hold a broadcasting licence. But state directed withdrawal of media licences might put the UK in the same frame as repressive regimes such as Turkey. Alternatively, public figures including shadow cabinet members, or even football managers such as Jose Mourinho, could be formally advised to pull out of the lucrative contracts they have signed to appear on RT. It is also highly likely that sports officials, as opposed to players, will be directed not to attend the World Cup this summer. More seriously, amendments to the sanctions and anti-money laundering bill will be introduced by ministers to allow stronger sanctions against human rights abusers, such as the persecutors of Sergei Magnitsky, the Russian tax accountant who died in jail in Russia after revealing details of massive state-sponsored fraud. The Foreign Office says in practice it already has the full confiscatory powers it needs, but under pressure from Tory backbenchers, such as Richard Benyon and the Europe minister, Sir Alan Duncan, have said ministers will be minded to support a Magnitsky clause once the bill reaches report stage. A more pertinent option would be to impose asset freezes on Russian oligarchs linked to the Kremlin especially if they are unable to explain the sources of London property wealth. But British law prides itself on due process, and arbitrary asset grabs in the manner of a Gulf crown prince might not look good. Militarily, the British army already has a rotational presence in Estonia, but Russia would not welcome Nato placing more troops closer to Belarus. Nato can also step up the strategic pressure on Moscow by speeding up Ukraine’s provisional admission into the alliance through agreeing a membership action plan. Similar encouragement to anti-Russian political forces can be offered in the Balkans, a key area of conflict with Russia. The UK is chairing a summit on the west Balkans this summer, and could use this as a vehicle to encourage parties fighting Moscow’s influence. There are two other measures on the extremities of the spectrum of options available to Downing Street. The UK could designate Russia as a state sponsor of terror. In the US, designation results in a variety of unilateral sanctions, including a ban on arms-related exports and sales, prohibitions on economic assistance and visa bans. The UK could also recommend Russian banks are cut off from Swift, the system behind international financial transactions. Some Russian banks linked to Iran have already been cut off from system, for instance. This might weaken Russia’s ability to trade internationally, but Russian banks have switched to a Russian payment system called SPFS, set up with larger non-G7 countries. None of the options are simple, and in the end they will only confirm Putin in his apparent determination to define Russia by its opposition to the west, and especially Britain."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/mar/27/two-sisters-asne-seierstad-review-slow-burn-tragedy-isis-norway-syria","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-27T06:30:06Z","webTitle":"Two Sisters by Asne Seierstad review – slow-burn Isis tragedy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/mar/27/two-sisters-asne-seierstad-review-slow-burn-tragedy-isis-norway-syria","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/mar/27/two-sisters-asne-seierstad-review-slow-burn-tragedy-isis-norway-syria","fields":{"headline":"Two Sisters by Åsne Seierstad review – slow-burn Isis tragedy","bodyText":"For a couple of years they flitted across our screens and newspapers like ghosts. One here, two or three there, once a group large enough to fill a minibus, mostly young, all seduced by a vision of purity, an urge to violence, or both. The Islamic State recruits who travelled from Europe had been neighbours, classmates, colleagues, members of close-knit families and intimate communities before they set off to a war zone, where they planned to build paradise on Earth. But in their departures, announced on the news every few weeks, they seemed to become insubstantial, unreal, as hard to understand as they were to reach once they had crossed the border into Syria. In Two Sisters, Norwegian journalist and writer Åsne Seierstad, the author of bestseller The Bookseller of Kabul, tries to reverse that process – to turn the fanatical ghosts back into complex humans – by telling in intricate, compelling detail the story of one family dragged into Isis’s web of horror. The Norwegian-Somali Juma sisters left their Oslo home one October morning in 2013, as if it was any other day. Leila, then aged 16, was ostensibly off to school, while Ayan, three years older and the brains behind their plan, said she was heading across town to see a friend. That evening they emailed their father to say they would never be coming home, that they were going to live in Syria for the sake of their souls and the souls of their parents and three brothers. Two Sisters, then, is also the story of the family shattered by the sisters’ departure. In her exploration of how and why Ayan and Leila abandoned their home for a distant war, Seierstad weaves a complex picture of their lives as young Norwegians. Ayan’s brilliance at one of the most elite high schools in Oslo, the focus and ambition that she would later apply to religion, shines through in her former teachers’ accounts of her. Tussles with her mother about clothes that were too revealing – before she embraced covering everything but her eyes – the teenage crushes, intense friendships, bands, football and summer camps are the stuff of any adolescence. But Seierstad also teases out the sense of alienation that a distinct and different heritage can produce in a homogeneous society – Ayan’s exploration of her roots and religion, Leila’s isolation at school. Ayan, particularly, was drawn into a radical milieu just as she reached an age where she was trusted to go out on her own. She was inspired by the charismatic but radical Qur’an teacher who taught many Somali heritage children at weekends, then drawn into the world of IslamNet, a society of young, Salafist Muslims in Oslo. Increasingly, she abandoned homework and spent her weekends trying to win converts at street stands downtown or organising conferences of radical preachers from around Europe. At home the sisters’ parents, Sadiq and Sara, didn’t monitor the teacher who was secretly radicalising their children, because they trusted his credentials and welcomed their daughters’ new enthusiasm for religion without questioning its intensity. Security forces failed the sisters. They had only got as far as Sweden when the family first called police for help. Leila was still a minor and it should have been possible to intercept them there, or on their slow passage through Turkey, but their father’s desperate pleas went unanswered for hours. And teachers, as the sisters voiced increasingly extreme views, broke up classes to pray or skipped school entirely, misunderstood the source of their radicalisation. They worried that Sadiq was planning to marry them off, pressuring them into covering up. In fact, he is a liberal poet who wanted his daughters to have an education and future in Norway. This collective failing is the reason Sadiq chose to speak out, in the hope that his family’s tragedy might help others to recognise the danger signs. “We were blind,” he says. “We thought it would pass.” Sadiq set off in search of Ayan and Leila three days after their flight, the start of an ongoing attempt to find them and bring them home. It ruined him financially and nearly cost him his life. At one point he discovered both daughters in the maelstrom of northern Syria, only to be jailed and tortured on the order of Ayan’s husband, Sadiq’s new Isis son-in-law. For a factual account, some of Seierstad’s descriptions can seem almost too detailed – for example, Sadiq mulling the metallic taste of tea and the play of sunlight on clouds as he flew to Turkey. But Seierstad and Sadiq spent many hours in conversation and the sense of place and time the author conjures makes Two Sisters more than a factual exploration of radicalisation. It is, instead, an unfolding human drama whose characters are compelling – from the strong-willed young women and desperate parents at the story’s heart to the shifting cast that surrounds them – womanising fundamentalists, well-meaning but clueless Norwegian teachers, the loyal Syrian smuggler with close ties to al-Qaida. Seierstad traces the Jumas’ slow shift to accommodate the once unthinkable, including marriage negotiations with a jihadi hoping to become Leila’s husband. She captures, too, the peculiar language of the young extremists, peppered with Arabic terms and references to God. “Things have been hectic here with Asiyah’s aqeeqah,” Leila writes in a message to Sadiq after her daughter is born, referring to a feast of celebration. “You should know that we are happy and well, we are safe and Allah has provided us with plenty of rizq [gifts].” Sadiq assumes his son-in-law has written it, but his wife knows better. “That’s how she talks now,” she says, shaking her head. Seierstad’s wide-ranging book also confronts the tragedy of Syria, revealing how much damage Isis did to the country that was its main base. She explains the complexities of a war that fractured early into factional fighting, and the rise of Isis from the ruins of Saddam Hussein’s Iraqi bureaucracy and the US occupation that followed. But Leila and Ayan – who start off so human, as Seierstad details their teenage friendships, their lives around Oslo, their progress and battles at school – end up as little more than ciphers. Their characters are as hidden by Isis ideology as their bodies are by the group’s all-enveloping black tents. They did not respond to Seierstad’s interview requests; to family and friends, they are unremittingly upbeat about their lives in Syria. Their mother – the only relative to whom the girls are still speaking, though there has been no direct contact for a year – never asks them difficult questions. She assumes Isis are listening in and doesn’t want them trapped by their own words. The horrors of living as a woman under Isis are revealed in Seierstad’s account of Ayan and Leila’s Norwegian friend Aisha, also in Syria, who married a man so violent that he shot her when she tried to leave the house to go shopping, then battered her two-year-old son to death. Still, in her apparently sincere online dispatches, Aisha insisted everything was good in paradise on Earth, and in a chat with a friend, Ayan makes jarring excuses for Isis’s practice of sexual slavery. Since the book was finished, the Islamic State has collapsed and its fighters and their families have scattered. There is no update on the whereabouts of Leila or Ayan, giving the reader some sense of the void their parents and siblings stare into every day, wondering what happened to them, the two bright girls from Oslo. • Two Sisters by Åsne Seierstad is published by Virago (£18.99).

He was a ropemaker, a builder of shelters such as yurts, a maker of pack saddles, feltmaker, tree planter, woodland coppicer and charcoal burner. He was born in St Ives, Cornwall. His father, William Lloyd, was a musician who also wrote about poetry and opera, while his mother, Constance (nee Rawson) was a musician who founded the Wayside Folk Museum in Zennor. His secondary schooling included a spell at the English School in Château-d’Oex, Switzerland, where the family had relatives. His agriculture studies at Cambridge University were interrupted by wartime service in the Royal Navy. Last year Walter received a medal from Vladimir Putin in recognition of his service on the Arctic convoys. He also served off the Normandy beaches on D-day and on minesweepers in Burma and Malaya. After graduation, and having married his cousin, Vivienne Nugent, in 1948, Walter began livestock farming in Lancashire and began the Hades Hill herd of fell ponies. During the 1960s, Walter trained Civil Defence Corps instructors. Then as civil defence officer for Rochdale council and emergency planning officer for Greater Manchester council he planned for disasters and nuclear strikes. In 1968, Walter founded Civil Aid. This took him to Belfast at the height of the Troubles and to Trinidad to study hurricane disaster relief. He also used music festivals as training opportunities: when several thousand people were without food, water or shelter at Windsor Free festival in 1974, he bought an old fire engine, packed it with food and tarpaulins and served long lines of hungry hippies with drinking water, chapatis and vegetable curry. He and Vivienne divorced in 1969, and he married Gillian Baron, who he had met in 1977 on the road to Appleby horse fair. In early retirement in the 80s, Walter pursued his interests in self-sufficiency. He set up charcoal-burning operations in South Lakeland, a significant impetus behind the revival of Lakeland crafts. He built bow-top living wagons and was proud to be associated with Gypsy people. He was a member of the Lakeland Fiddlers and was carried to his 90th birthday party, in a woodland setting, by one of his own Hades Hill ponies. Walter is survived by four children from his first marriage, Bill, Simon, Caroline and Tom; two stepchildren, Mike and Tom, from his marriage to Gill, from whom he was divorced; and by two “bonus” children, Joanne and Rob, from his partnership with Sue Walker, who worked at the Haybridge nature reserve in Cumbria. He is also survived by three grandchildren and three great-grandchildren."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/12/government-austerity-damage","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-12T19:08:23Z","webTitle":"There’s no light at the end of this tunnel.

Just more pain","bodyText":"Bravo! Well done, Britain! It’s “a remarkable national effort,” gloats chief architect George Osborne, “we got there in the end”. Making his spring statement, chancellor Philip Hammond may allow himself a funereal glimmer of an almost smile. The current account deficit has been starved down to its 2% target. So easy! Any dieter determined to lose weight can just lop off their legs and, hey presto, the scales will say they made it. Swallowing tape-worms or emetic poisons will do it too. Easy if you ignore collateral damage, human suffering, irrecoverable losses and economic paralysis. Easy if your aim is ideological state-shrinkage. Wherever you look, you see the harm. Some can be fixed: leaking school buildings, closed libraries, neglected parks and playgrounds. But too much is beyond repair. You can’t summon up the skills and deep experience of all the teachers, nurses, doctors, administrators and technicians who have not been trained and hired to fill the gaps. Hard to replace those who have burned out under unbearable pressure. What of the million public servants gone, as Whitehall frantically tries to hire lost expertise to cope with Brexit? Unseen is damage done to lost childhoods, skills never acquired, chances gone, physical and psychological scars, with soaring numbers of children in care, poverty itself a proven life-damager. Unseen, too, are old people ending their days without any social care, home alone, day centres shut, ending up in overflowing A&amp;E departments. This falls under local government, now on the brink of insolvency, says the National Audit Office. Nor will it end. Hammond sees a “light at the end of the tunnel” but hastens to add, “we are still in the tunnel”, warding off any of his own anxious MPs who want to spend. Paul Johnson, head of the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) warns: “We are nowhere near out of austerity. There are still big spending cuts and big social security cuts to come.” He predicts child poverty will rise quickly, as benefit freezes, cuts and rising prices far outweigh minimum wage increases. Johnson says, as he has for years, that you can’t have Scandinavian public services on US tax rates. “You have to make a choice.” This is the slowest recovery from a recession on record, after Osborne’s first austerity budget killed the green shoots of growth stone dead. That cold blast chilled the bones of the whole economy, but the least resilient regions and lowest-paid people were frozen hardest. The blame goes deeper: by calling a referendum amid their austerity, he and David Cameron gave a weapon to those places to hit back, even though they will suffer most from Brexit. The politics of austerity has been cleverly crafted, with Cameron, Osborne and Theresa May all adept at distraction on a grand scale. With empty empathy they have megaphoned social problems, their concern masking opposite actions. “All in it together,” was Osborne’s best line, as he impoverished the bottom half with benefit cuts, raised regressive VAT, cut top tax, shifted personal allowance rises towards the better-off, and ensured the burden fell on those with least. These Tories have caused record household debt, high employment with low pay as most wages stagnated or fell, while FTSE 100 CEO pay quadrupled – and have taken funds from young to give to better-off old. All three have made rousing speeches, wringing their hands over housing and the plight of the young, only to make things worse for renters while enriching developers with help-to-buy. On excessive sugar or plastics, fine words ring out, but no action. On social care and the clear need to use the untaxed property wealth of older people to pay for their own care, nothing. How May agonised in public over the “just about managing” and then tightened the screw. Whenever the Resolution Foundation and the IFS produce irrefutable figures proving all this, the Treasury puts out meaningless numbers to bamboozle. Last week, responding to the IFS on the worsening social security cuts, it just said, “We are spending £90bn on working age welfare.” True, but no use without context of the cuts being inflicted on 11 million families. The government’s media minions whoop up any shade of improvement in the figures, shorn of context: the Daily Mail’s Saturday editorial slams “doom-mongers” and crows “how much brighter the outlook appears today”. Yes, growth has inched up a smidgen, but the Tory press makes no mention of the global surge that has left us behind: we were top of the G7 before the referendum, but are bottom now. Note how every pro-Brexit commentator, both left and right, talks up our torpid economy: they ignore the Brexit penalty of a 12% fall in the pound against the euro causing our already serious trade deficit to rise. They forget to say that a welcome manufacturing rise is mainly due to North Sea oil being turned on again. And sales are mainly to the EU, now threatened. Is this recovery? The chancellor is pleased his receipts will improve by £7bn-£11bn, higher than expected. Good for him. But until most people feel any extra coins in their pockets, it may count for little. Might he give away a little something for a headline? At the upper levels of the NHS they tell anyone who asks that they are hoping for a 70th birthday present in June: they suggest a legally guaranteed 3-4% annual rise, for ever. The odds look as near zero as the corporation tax Caffè Nero has paid in the last decade. In the autumn budget, where will the windfall be spent? The chancellor promises “consultations” on various tax changes. But dismally, he told the BBC’s Andrew Marr that any bonus would be split three ways: between paying off debt, spending, and, yes, tax cuts. But for now, it’s do-nothing day – a “policy-neutral” statement, says the Treasury. But doing nothing is a policy, pursuing more of the dreadful same. Hammond’s reasons to hoard might be fear of an inevitable recession sometime, interest rate rises, a trade war, robotics job losses – and the certain Brexit fallout. But every chancellor saves for a pre-election splurge. Will that work? Austerity has cut too deep for any quick fix. It’s already late and, by 2022, far too late. No last-minute lashings of cash can train up doctors, nurses, teachers and social workers, re-open defunct children’s centres, youth clubs or old people’s day centres. All a chancellor can do quickly is cut tax – a vote-catcher that would again carpet-bomb what’s left of the public realm. And by now, that might not even buy votes in an austerity-weary populace. Hammond’s light at the end of the tunnel is a distant pin-prick receding into the economic “long term” – and in the long term, as Keynes said, “we are all dead”. • Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"music/2018/mar/14/inside-the-demise-of-nme-ex-staffers","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-14T10:41:02Z","webTitle":"'Its soul was lost somewhere': inside the demise of NME","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/mar/14/inside-the-demise-of-nme-ex-staffers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/mar/14/inside-the-demise-of-nme-ex-staffers","fields":{"headline":"'Its soul was lost somewhere': inside the demise of NME","bodyText":"When the Manic Street Preachers formed in Blackwood, south Wales, in 1986, the band had three goals: “Top of the Pops, Radio 1 and the cover of NME,” says bassist Nicky Wire. Within six months of releasing their debut album, they had landed all three. “It felt so fucking easy!” says Wire. The band’s history (and that of countless others) is intertwined with the magazine. Wire cites reading NME as a formative teenage education, and says he preferred the company of its journalists to his 1990s musical peers; in an infamous 1991 interview, guitarist Richey Edwards carved “4 REAL” into his arm. The Manics made their 25th and 26th appearances on the cover in summer 2014 – their last. It still felt significant then, says Wire. But he wasn’t surprised to hear that last week’s issue would be its final one, two and a half years after the magazine moved to a free publishing model. “For me, it died when it went free,” says Wire. “There was barely anything to read in it, and I like paying for things that have a certain quality. I don’t wanna go into Topshop as a 50-year-old man and feel like I’m nicking something off a pile.” NME published its final print edition on 9 March, featuring rapper Stefflon Don on the cover. The contents contained no sense of ceremony – the magazine went to print on Tuesday, the day before staff found out the magazine was closing; the brand will live on online. Outside a central London station early on Friday morning, one vendor was almost out of copies – an unusual occurrence, he said – finding customers eager to obtain a copy of the final issue. “Last year I did one station, with 10 bundles – I sold out only two of them, and returned eight,” he said, offering a straightforward assessment of its demise: “Some stations go quite well, but the majority of the stations, it’s not moving, so that’s why it’s gonna stop.” As a paid-for title, NME had spent years battling declining sales, with ABC figures from the second half of 2014 showing an average weekly circulation of around 14,000. So in September 2015, publishing company Time Inc revamped NME as a free magazine, bringing circulation up to a reported 300,000 copies per week. Now a mass-market product, the magazine shifted from its focus from alternative music to pop culture, with branches of Topman and HMV acting as key distribution points. It wasn’t to last. According to Paul Cheal, Time Inc’s UK group managing director for music, NME’s print edition was closing after 66 years owing to “increasing production costs and a very tough print advertising market”. (Ten days earlier, Time Inc UK was bought by private equity firm Epiris; editor Mike Williams left a week before the closure of the print edition was announced. Time Inc did not make anyone available for comment.) How did the storied magazine’s second coming fail? The disappearance of NME speaks to the complexity of the free publishing model – trickier than just ripping off the price tag – and forging a new identity from a brand steeped in six decades of music history. Dominic Ponsford, editor of Press Gazette, says its disappearance mirrors current publishing trends, citing the closure of free weekly titles Coach and Sport. “There was a time when those free magazines were the only way to access a young, hard-to-reach audience, but because Google and Facebook are so good at selling targeted ad campaigns, it’s really hard for publishers to compete.” Phil Hilton, editorial director of leading men’s freesheet Shortlist, sympathises with NME, but tells a different story. Shortlist doesn’t struggle for advertising, which comes down to a fundamental difference between the two titles: “Shortlist was conceived as free from the start. We knew the audience, we designed it for the kind of advertisers that would find that audience relevant. It’s much harder to take [NME] and put it through a different distribution model and a different audience. Your dynamics with your readers are so different.” Douglas McCabe, CEO of media research company Enders Analysis, agrees that free isn’t a means to an end, particularly when translating a niche product for the mass market. “In the end, its very soul seemed to have been lost somewhere. Think about how Stylist has become the kind of magazine that people take home. You flick through NME for 10 minutes on the tube, which isn’t a deep enough relationship to really work.” Who was NME for? The magazine had been narrowing its remit since the 1990s, when Britpop – a scene it helped define – proved to be a commercial winner for editor Steve Sutherland. Britpop didn’t last, but NME’s glorification of guitar music above all did. That sound, and the magazine with it, found a second wind in the parallel early 2000s New York and London indie booms presided over by editor Conor McNicholas, who ran the magazine from 2002 to 2009. One leading British magazine editor pinpoints McNicholas’s tenure as the start of the end: aggressively positioning the magazine at teenagers when young people were abandoning print, and sloughing off older music fans. “You could argue that the internet would have killed NME anyway, but I do think sales numbers were never big enough to justify trying to shake off a sizeable chunk of their audience – a decision driven, of course, by the ads team wanting a younger demographic profile that would be more appealing to clients.” NME’s subsequent editors, Krissi Murison (2009 to 2012) and Mike Williams (2012 onwards) hugely diversified the magazine’s contents, expanding its coverage of hip-hop, dance and music made by women. They simultaneously drew on the magazine’s history in archive features and cover stories in an attempt to attract the previously neglected older readership, with their fondness for the brand and enthusiastic spending power. But the magazine’s consumer base, diminished by McNicholas’s guitar-heavy focus, balked at covers featuring people of colour and women, leading to a preponderance of guitar-wielding white boys and their vintage peers on the front page. This strategy caused tensions among staff. Lucy Jones was deputy editor of NME.com from 2012 to 2015. “By the end of my time there, it felt indefensible, embarrassing and myopic,” she says of the cover strategy. “Eventually, all the brilliant female staffers left. I wonder if the editorial direction in the final years had been stronger, bolder, more willing to take risks, to tussle harder with what the publishers were saying, and represent the best of popular music no matter what the gender, skin colour or instrument, things might have been different.” When the free magazine launched in September 2015, having Rihanna on the cover looked like an encouraging embrace of the possibilities afforded by scrapping the price tag, and with it the financial dependence on a close-minded readership. But alarm bells started ringing two weeks later when radio DJ Chris Moyles – a man whose boorish attitude had never previously had a home in NME’s pages – appeared on the front cover. Radar, the previously vibrant new-music section, had shrunk to a spread. “The clock has been ticking ever since it became a freesheet and stopped doing what it did best, opting for something light and fluffy,” says publicist Barbara Charone, who works with artists including Madonna, Foo Fighters and Depeche Mode. NME was now reliant on advertising and commercial partnerships, which often appeared so ill-judged that they attracted online notoriety. In October 2015, a Foals cover was concealed with an advertising wraparound for the Netflix animation BoJack Horseman, which featured the Oxford five-piece redrawn as cartoon horses. In March 2016, the magazine changed its logo to NMD in association with Adidas’s Generation Nomad campaign. Earlier this year, Time Inc halved the paper’s dimensions to advertise the film Downsizing. Still, the editor claimed in interviews that he had never done anything for a brand that he wouldn’t have done as editorial. These clumsy advertorials tarnished the brand. The magazine now relied on a distribution network that included a number of independent record shops, many of whom found it hard to shift. London’s Rough Trade East stopped taking NME shortly after it went free, as did Manchester’s Piccadilly Records. Brighton’s Resident record store asked distributor Marketforce to reduce its order from 50 copies a week to 10, but were told 50 was the minimum order. “Whilst the copies of DIY and Loud &amp; Quiet get picked up eagerly, the NME pile would remain untouched in the main,” says Resident’s Natasha Youngs. “We kept it to the end, but only because we couldn’t reduce our allocation without refusing to stock it altogether, and that felt morally wrong.” Despite antipathy towards the brand, appearing on its cover retained its cachet. Adrian Read is co-director of Inside/Out, an independent publicity agency that works with Lady Gaga, Lily Allen and Alt-J among others, and had nine NME covers during its free incarnation. “Like so much print media, its value in 2018 wasn’t solely based on the number of people that read it and its direct consumer impact. A lot of its influence was about positioning artists to media and the industry, and it still had a knock-on effect to an artist’s fortunes in other areas. An NME cover was still a badge of honour and few artists would tell you otherwise.” Barbara Charone agrees: “When Foo Fighters headlined Glastonbury [in 2017], I really wanted that cover, and when we got it, it really meant something.” Read sees the magazine’s demise as bad news for the music press. “Whatever your thoughts about NME, it helped put value and interest in music – which is something that has gradually eroded in the past decade. While there have been a number of brilliant online music media outlets founded in recent years, there’s not yet enough in breadth and depth – especially in the UK – to replace what good print music media delivers for reader and artist.” Charone disagrees: “The end of music journalism? Hell no! Q has been completely revitalised in the last year, while Loud &amp; Quiet – run by ex-NME staffers – has relaunched this month.” Popjustice editor Peter Robinson is cautiously optimistic. “NME closing isn’t the end of music journalism, and I’d say the music writing I’m seeing these days from the UK and abroad is sharper, broader and brighter than anything I can remember. But I don’t think many people realise just how precarious even prestige titles are financially. When you see the Fader or Buzzfeed laying off staff, when they’re supposed to have this whole modern publishing thing figured out, it’s pretty scary.” So where does the blame fall? “Every staffer from any era as far back as the 1970s can pick several moments from their tenures when it all went irreversibly wrong, until the next golden age rolls in with a fresh generation of young geniuses to clean up and save the mag,” says Q editor Ted Kessler, who got his start at NME in the 1990s. “The margins for error just got slimmer and slimmer until the margins ran out.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"cities/2018/apr/11/the-gold-coast-sun-drenched-sin-city-that-wants-to-shine","type":"article","sectionId":"cities","sectionName":"Cities","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-11T07:00:03Z","webTitle":"The Gold Coast: the sun-drenched sin city that wants to shine","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/apr/11/the-gold-coast-sun-drenched-sin-city-that-wants-to-shine","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/cities/2018/apr/11/the-gold-coast-sun-drenched-sin-city-that-wants-to-shine","fields":{"headline":"The Gold Coast: the sun-drenched sin city that wants to shine","bodyText":"Pristine beaches stretching for 70km, enviable weather, world heritage-listed Gondwana rainforests, and enough big city infrastructure to keep punters interested – Australia’s Gold Coast is a pleasure centre. But for many it has a pervasive dark side: a city once branded as a sunny place for shady people. One of Australia’s most revered writers once told me he comes here to have his breakdowns. On a visit in 1997, Prince Charles was reported to have said its gaudy skyscrapers contributed to the “uglification” of one of the world’s top holiday spots. In 1984, the prominent Sydney architect Neville Gruzman suggested the city should be bulldozed into the surf. Today, the Gold Coast seems to be attempting that reinvention itself. It is Australia’s fastest growing city and larger than three of its capital cities (Canberra, Hobart and Darwin), with the 2018 Commonwealth Games doubtless accelerating a maturation already under way. Every month or so there’s a new hip place to be seen, an old high rise disappears and a shiny new one soars. Every week some new claim is made for the ultimate in gastronomic happiness. Do these ventures live up to the hype? Sometimes. But it hardly matters. The Gold Coast is a city built on hype, on rise and fall. As a longtime resident, I’ve experienced several waves of self-proclaimed urban renaissance and learned that, while the spin exists largely to generate the sale of sky homes, each growth phase possesses a grain of truth. The Gold Coast wants to grow up. But is that possible when the rest of the country’s estimations of it are so rigid? Unlike many major Australian cities, the Gold Coast does not retain much evidence of a colonial urban sensibility, in part because of rampant redevelopment and erasure, but largely because it never really got started. The urban vision was always more closely linked to a 20th-century American aesthetic. The influence of the strip cities of Miami, Los Angeles and particularly Las Vegas are in evidence as well as, more recently, nods to the 21st-century architectural ambition of Dubai and Shanghai. While each of these cities have marked differences they all share a postwar history of urban expansion and proliferation. All have grown at phenomenal rates, new frontier cities that owe less to major port affiliations or centrifugal notions of planning than they do to strip formations, late capitalism and experimental development. The big-ticket architecture says so. The $1bn luxury Jewel project currently under development epitomises this push for opulent new millennium design. An example of continuing high-end investment in architectural innovation, the development is a six-star three-tower structure modelled on shards of smoky quartz crystals found on a mountain in the region. The interpretation is refreshingly abstract compared with the ubiquitous “palm tree, primary colour” resort styling the Gold Coast has leaned so much on in the past. Across many sectors, the city is shrugging off the declarative localism it has played to in exchange for a more sophisticated spin on where it sits in the world. It will be interesting to note how the international spotlight will burn. In 2016, international tourism figures peaked at one million. Tourists from Asia make up the majority of those, as they have for decades. People from Singapore get the Gold Coast, as do people people from Hong Kong and Dubai – they are all cities that share a new frontier urban aesthetic. The real opposition to the Gold Coast’s ambition is national. Australians often experience the city in hyperactive mode, arriving to soak up the sun and get away with what they’re less likely to at home; raging down streets like no one lives here, hiring mopeds and tuk tuks blasting Justin Bieber or AC/DC, high on party drugs or table-sized martinis. They may have visited in a pack of mates at the annual Schoolies festival – a Spring Break equivalent that erupted in the 1970s and still attracts tens of thousands of school leavers. Or they may have vibrant memories of flying through the hyperreal universes of the Dreamworld, Movieworld and Seaworld theme parks as kids. It’s these off-kilter experiences – the combination of bright lights, sunburnt skin and cringey recollections – twinned with the consistent media overplay that continue to define national opinions of a city locals affectionately refer to as “the Goldie”. It is not unusual for major cities to have underworlds: corrupt power centres and schlocky, sometimes violent nightclub strips. It’s just that the depiction of such things erupting on Australia’s Gold Coast makes great trash TV. Stock footage proliferates of schoolies vomiting in bins, bikies brawling in restaurants, meter maids in gold bikinis and bare-knuckle violence – but these things exist as a fraction of a much larger whole. The burgeoning arts scene is emblematic of the city’s evolution. Twenty years ago, arts visibility, policy and recognition barely existed, and certainly not at levels that could match commercial imperatives. Today, the Gold Coast can hold its own. Under the directives of the Culture Strategy 2023, the city council has invested $7m in the development of an arts and cultural programme for Festival 2018, linked to the Commonwealth Games, while a $365m cultural precinct funded by all levels of government will be launched in stages. Yet the attitude of the rest of Australia towards the city, even though it is now one of the top five tourist destinations nationally, seems to be: “We want you to stay in your box.” Evidence of the Gold Coast’s continuing appeal as a preferred place to holiday and live goes largely unacknowledged. In part, this paradox is related to class. Australia prides itself on being an egalitarian society, but it can be highly parochial and territorial. The rivalry between Sydney and Melbourne is legendary; neither would ever consider the Gold Coast as worthy of debate. The city’s location in Queensland doesn’t help. From 1968 to 1987, the state was under the corrupt rule of the disgraced premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen, known as the “hillbilly dictator”, who fostered the creation of a police state and opposed homosexuality, abortion, demonstrations against anti-apartheid and even the 40-hour work week. Perceptions of Queenslanders have been affected ever since. This state of play is changing, but a whiff of snobbery still exists. Southerners expect us to smash them in football games and pull together in natural disasters, displaying the kind of spirit that helped us survive “Joh” in the first place. But the notion that the locals are unintelligent – “They all talk slower up there because of the heat” – endures. When the 1% holiday in Australia, they tend to go elsewhere. This is no different from the idea that Parisians are all rude or New Yorkers unfriendly. The Gold Coast is more dynamic than its enduring mythologies suggest. It does not so much resemble an overgrown Porpoise Spit, the mythical town made famous by the film Muriel’s Wedding: an acrylic land of hoop earrings, dumb surfers and undone housewives burning down backyards. Cities have moods and boroughs, and things only locals know. They are at their best when they surprise; when you sink in to the city and relate to it on its own terms. The Gold Coast has been allowed to be trashy, glitzy and even obscene, as long as it doesn’t gatecrash the VIP party – one smoky quartz slipper already dangerously close to the rope. In any case, this won’t be the city’s last renaissance. In collaboration with Guardian Australia, Guardian Cities is devoting a week to Australian cities.

Top stories Theresa May has said it is “highly likely” Russia is the culprit behind the Salisbury attack on a former Russian spy and his daughter, and the UK will not tolerate a “brazen attempt to murder innocent civilians on our soil”. In a statement to the House of Commons the prime minister said the evidence had shown the Skripals had been targeted by a “military-grade nerve agent of a type developed by Russia”. TThere were only two plausible explanations for what happened in Salisbury, she said: “Either this was a direct act by the Russian state against our country. Or the Russian government lost control of this potentially catastrophically damaging nerve agent and allowed it to get into the hands of others.” Labor says it can collect a cool $11.4bn in short-term savings by cutting a cash refund to wealthy investors. Peter Costello introduced the cash payment portion of the dividend imputation, which is a tax offset given to shareholders who get paid dividends from companies that have already paid tax on their earnings. Labor’s plan to scrap it is expected to mainly hit wealthy retirees whose income comes in the form of tax-free superannuation payments. An Iranian refugee who has been waiting 18 months on Nauru for critical heart surgery has been flown to Taiwan for the life-saving operation after the Australian Border Force relented and allowed the woman’s teenage son to travel with her. Fatemeh, 55, has been facing “high and imminent risk of … heart attack or sudden death”, according to doctors. Border Force had approved her medical transfer overseas, but Fatemeh refused to leave her son alone on the island. He has suffered from acute mental health issues on Nauru. “Death and separation from my son is the same for me,” Fatemeh says. Labor’s new position on the Adani coalmine has underwhelmed voters, according to the latest Guardian Essential poll. Bill Shorten said last week Labor would oppose the Carmichael project but not revoke its licence if it won office. In this week’s poll, voters were asked whether they supported the Turnbull government’s pro-Adani position, Labor’s stance, or the Greens policy, which is to oppose the project. The highest level of support was recorded for the Greens’ anti-Adani position (30%), followed by the government’s position of supporting Adani (26%) with only 19% backing Shorten. The former foreign minister Bob Carr has called for Australia to cut its immigration rate in half, declaring that the nation’s experiment of running the fastest rate of immigration in the world was was failing. Monday’s ABC Q&amp;A program concentrated on just one issue: immigration levels and the pressures on our cities. But while Sydney was one of the great melting pots of the world, Carr said, even immigrants were asking whether Australia could achieve the same benefits from migration at a less dramatic pace. “Do we really want to be adding a million to our population every three and a half years?” Sport Australia started the fourth day on 180 for five, a lead of just 41 runs, and could only add 59 more runs amid a tail-end collapse, totalling 243 &amp; 239, with South Africa 382 &amp; 102/4. Kagiso Rabada ripped through the remainder of Australia’s order, to leave South Africa’s victory a formality. The issues with last week’s hiring of Graham Arnold as Socceroos coach go beyond his appointment and to the footballing environment in which he became the leading local candidate. In comparison to other Australian coaches with club experience on a national level, the 54-year-old was not the best person for the job, but arguably the least unsuitable. Thinking time For those who have not been glued to the political contest that reaches its denouement in South Australia on Saturday, Max Opray has prepared this handy explainer. He lays out the key players, the big issues and the seats to watch on Saturday night when Nick Xenophon faces his first test as a genuine option for state premier. What were you like at 21? In a dispatch from the Adelaide festival, Guardian Australia’s culture editor, Steph Harmon, writes about the Swiss artist Mats Staubs’ audiovisual project 21: Memories of Growing Up. The artist travelled the world recording 10 to 20 minutes of audio from people of all ages, races, backgrounds as they described their 21st year. Three months later, the project revisited these people – but this time a camera was turned on them. The audio of each person telling their story was played back to them, and their reaction filmed, as they listened to one past version of themselves describe another. “Watching these strangers grapple with their memories, and how to construct their own narratives, you think of the story you would tell,” Harmon writes. “What kind of person were you? And which words would you use to describe that?” It’s been 10 years since the global financial crisis and just as many Australians in their prime earning years are employed as in 2008. But the workplace has been radically altered, writes Greg Jericho. “One of the problems with economics is trying to judge how things are going. The unemployment rate used to be a good measure but one clear sign of how poor it can be occurs when you compare our current unemployment rate of 5.5% with the US’s 4.1%. It would seem we’re doing much worse, whereas I’d take our economy any day of the week.” What’s he done now? The Trump administration has backed away from a proposal to raise the legal age to buy certain guns because of an NRA lawsuit, the president wrote on Monday. “On 18 to 21 Age Limits, watching court cases and rulings before acting,” Donald Trump tweeted, after weeks of voicing support for raising the age limit. He also said there was “not much political support (to put it mildly)” for the policy. Time magazine has compiled the president’s stance on five gun control ideas here. Media roundup The Daily Telegraph reports that the federal children’s minister, David Gillespie, has said adoption rules should be relaxed so white Australians can adopt Indigenous children to rescue them from rape, assault and neglect. The ABC has an interactive experiment giving readers the chance to decide on how Australia’s population should grow.

He knows he never has to work another day in his life, but he can’t stop himself. “I don’t like it when people say I’ve got an addictive personality,” he says. “It’s people who never take drugs who say that. But I have an obsessive-compulsive thing going on.” Writing is an itch he’s got to scratch – particularly when it comes to Trainspotting. The author is about to release Dead Men’s Trousers, the fifth novel in his Trainspotting series. Welsh says it will be the final instalment (though by the end of the afternoon he’s not quite so sure). Trainspotting, published in 1993, is a violent black comedy about working-class heroin addicts in Edinburgh. In a Waterstones poll of 25,000 people, it was voted the 10th greatest book of the 20th century. It has sold more than 1m copies in the UK alone and is said to be the most shoplifted novel in British publishing history. The film of the book had even more impact: in 2012, it topped a poll of the best British films of the past 60 years. Trainspotting follows the exploits of five (later four) pals, and a pretty unwholesome group they are: liars, thieves, scammers and, of course, that unforgettable psychopath Francis Begbie. Their lives are desperate (a baby girl dies because her parents are too mashed to save her), yet Trainspotting somehow became a symbol of 90s cool. The novel is fast-paced, shocking, amoral, written in a sweary, phonetic, catarrhal slang. Welsh captured brilliantly what it felt like to be cocooned in a heroin haze, no matter how scabby the reality. It could even be said that he created a new genre: kitchen-sink surrealism (notably the scene where Renton fishes in his excrement for his precious opioid suppositories before disappearing down the toilet). In Dead Men’s Trousers, the gang are a quarter-century older; Renton is a successful DJ, Sick Boy a pimp of sorts, Spud the loser he always was and Begbie an internationally feted artist who claims to have renounced violence. In some ways they are transformed, in others not. When Spud and Sick Boy enter the world of organ harvesting, you know things are not going to end well. I meet Welsh at the tube in Farringdon, east London. He’s tall, so easy to spot. In a woolly hat, jeans, Dr Martens and a parka, he looks like a recently retired football hooligan. We head for a pub. This is one of the areas Welsh used to go clubbing when he lived here in the 80s. Since the success of Trainspotting, he’s lived all over: Amsterdam, Barcelona, Chicago, San Francisco and now Miami. Like Edinburgh, London has changed a good deal over the decades, and this pub is as gastro as it gets. To be fair, Welsh has also changed. He orders mashed avocado on toast and green tea, and bemoans the disappearance of the London that was. You sense nothing terrifies Welsh so much as the thought of growing up. He once said he would rather “sell my arse” in King’s Cross than settle down to a life of “home-garden-kids” dreary domesticity. Not surprisingly, he has no children. Now he’s 59, a few months short of a pensioner’s bus pass, and he’s getting rose-tinted about the good old bad old days. “The bookies on Pentonville Road is my biggest disappointment. You could get anything in there: speed, coke, smack. Not particularly great, but it was always there if there was an emergency.” Today, he largely restricts himself to a good bottle of red, though he also has a penchant for a hallucinogenic drug called DMT – he has found it revelatory and life-changing. There has always been an autobiographical element to Trainspotting. The original novel is set in Leith, the port district of Edinburgh, where Welsh was born to a waitress mother and dock worker father. He became addicted to heroin in his early 20s. To some extent, the lives of the characters still mirror his own. In middle age, Welsh became a DJ (post-Trainspotting, he found he could make a fortune playing in clubs across the world, and he loved the social side); in Dead Men’s Trousers, Renton manages DJs. And while Begbie is a renowned artist seeking sun and sanctuary in Los Angeles, Welsh is a renowned artist seeking sun and sanctuary in Miami. He moved there a few years ago with his second wife, American Beth Quinn, 23 years his junior. I have always been fascinated by his relationship with the Trainspotting characters. Which is most like him? Welsh says he has most in common with the main narrator, Renton (played by Ewan McGregor in both films). “Renton is in some ways a more authentic self. I write more self-consciously when I write as him.” He talks about how Renton has changed over the years. “He has become a little bit more successful. He’s got to that point where he feels he’s got something out of life; it’s something he wanted, but he doesn’t really feel fulfilled by it. It’s a common malaise people feel. They search for something, they get it, then they think, what the fuck was all that about? Was it worth spending all the time and energy on this quest?” That’s another of Welsh’s obsessions: always wanting something new, better, different, and destroying what we have in the process. How would he describe Renton to somebody who has never met him? “He has ideas above his station and is a bit full of himself. He oscillates between being really cool and in control of everything, and socially inept. Which is probably me!” Welsh seems to have been far from inept in his relationships with women. “A certain kind of woman always liked me,” he concedes, and gets the giggles. “It was always cool, interesting, quirky women who liked me.” He was not the type of man a woman would look to if she wanted to settle down. Despite having tied the knot twice, he never considered himself the marrying type. “Women who just wanted to find a guy, settle down, have a couple of kids, hang out with the mothers and sisters all the time when the guys went to the pub, didn’t like me. They saw me as a bit of a threat. They saw me trying to seduce their quirkier, more interesting mates.” And were you trying to seduce them? “Well, of course. We’re all seducers, for God’s sake. But also they saw me trying to lead their boyfriends into places where, like, ‘Ach, you don’t want to get fucking settled down. You’re better than all that.’ I was a threat to the potential nuclear family, to that kind of social order.” Welsh was never going to be a model citizen. At the age of eight, he received his first conviction, for playing football in the street. Did he get in a lot of trouble? He smiles. His smile has a touch of the Hannibal Lecters about it. No, he says, he tended to get others into trouble. “I was one of these kind of fucking horrible kids that made the snowballs for other people to throw. I was quite good at manipulating thicker kids and causing trouble. It’s a horrible thing now to say.” He refers himself back to the characters in Trainspotting. “Maybe that’s more Sick Boy than Renton. Hahaha!” Sick Boy is the most cynical of the Trainspotting characters, an amoral con artist always sniffing out a chance to screw the next sucker. Welsh is good company. You sense he enjoys his own company, too, that he would happily spend all day listening to himself telling stories. In the past, interviewers have suggested that his stories tend towards the tall; that they can’t tell when he’s telling the truth and when he’s making things up. You can find any number of dates of birth for him, for example, with his age ranging from 56 to late 60s; the most reliable appears to be 59. I mention this and he bursts out laughing. “Yeah, I never know myself.” We’ve been chatting for a good hour already. “I’ve not told any real whoppers today.” Welsh left school at 16 in the mid-70s, did a City &amp; Guilds course in electrical engineering and became an apprentice TV mechanic, before a powerful electric shock prompted him to move on to other work: “A lot of menial jobs – dishwashing, portering, clerical, paving roads.” And then there was that heroin habit. Unlike many addicts, he says, he was not self-medicating to escape the horrors of life; for him, heroin was purely hedonistic. But it soon became a problem. “The first year, I thought I was fine, but the second year, I couldn’t pretend to myself. I was moving in different circles. I was more unkempt.” I ask what was so great about heroin. He talks at length, and rather beautifully, about it. “To feel a tremendous sense of wellbeing to the point where you really don’t give a fuck about anything. To have that feeling of invincibility. The good thing about heroin, and the worst thing, is not having to deal with other people. Of course, it’s a complete delusion. You can be sitting in your own fucking piss in a shithole flat, but it gives you that illusion of strength and power and wellbeing. And you can see why people who don’t have any sense of empowerment would embrace that. In the end, you’re just chasing: you’re taking heroin to avoid being sick, rather than to have that euphoric feeling.” Welsh was addicted to heroin for about 18 months. He went cold turkey, and says it was awful. But he beat his addiction. He spent most of his 20s moving between Edinburgh and London, trying – and failing – to make it as a punk rocker in bands. By the mid-80s, he was living in London, flipping houses in the crazy property boom. His big break was an accident – literally. He was on a bus going to a Hibernian football match when the bus was involved in a collision and toppled over. He received £2,000 compensation for an injury. He used the money to secure a mortgage on an £8,000 flat in Hackney, which he sold 18 months later for £15,000. He then bought a house in south-east London for £17,000 and sold it for £52,000 18 months later. I don’t get it, I say. How could he possibly go from a life of reckless abandonment to one of such disciplined self-interest? “It’s that obsessive-compulsive thing. I’m obsessed with anything I’ve done. It was a way of making quick money, a wanker’s job. Why would you want to do that? What’s the fucking point? You want to do something with your life, not fucking ponce around doing up fucking flats and selling them.” In the late 80s he returned to Edinburgh and another new career, this time in local government. And again he made a success of it. He received a series of rapid promotions to end up as head of training at the economic development department. “I was quite hated by my staff. I was really straight.” He was sufficiently senior to recommend himself for a part-time master’s in business studies, which he completed. At the same time, he started writing seriously. Much of Trainspotting, he claims, was written at work. After publishing it in 1993, he gave up his middle-management job and wrote full time. Whereas property had been a temporary obsession, writing became a permanent one: “That’s the one I’ve stuck with, because when you’ve got a blank page, you can create a whole world, and if you get bored with that, you’re fucked, basically.” Has he ever been bored by writing? “Never. Never. I’ve been bored with some projects, but not the idea of writing.” He chews on a piece of halloumi approvingly. “That squidgy noise it makes on your teeth is great. It reminds me of the sound when you’re washing up a plate.” It’s a nasty, brutish world he creates. In Filth, his protagonist is the filthiest of police officers; Marabou Stork Nightmares is about a man in a coma who was sexually abused by his uncle; A Decent Ride features an oversexed cabbie; Bedroom Secrets Of The Masterchefs is about a hard-drinking football hooligan; and on it goes. Welsh returns again and again to the same themes of corrupt, destructive masculinity: drinking, scoring, snorting, raving, shagging, bragging, betraying and destroying. Trainspotting remains by far his biggest success. Does it bother him that critics often say he has never matched it? “I don’t get the chance to be bothered, because I go from one project to another. I’ve usually got a book or film or TV project on the go. And the one you’re doing, you’re totally immersed in. I don’t think Trainspotting is my best book by a long chalk.” He hates the process of revision. By that point he’s already thinking of a new book. This is perhaps why they are so raw – at best fizzing with energy, at worst reading like first drafts. “I’m quite impatient. Once I’ve got the story done, I want to get it out. I don’t always take time to think about the stylisation and literary value, I just think, on to the next story.” There is one act of violence in the new book that made me feel sick, I say, yet he seems to describe it with gusto. “Hahaha!” And it really is loud, full-throttle laughter. I’m not sure if it’s glee, embarrassment or both. “Well, you’ve got to get into the guy’s mind,” he says. “In Marabou Stork Nightmares there’s this rape scene that goes on and on, and I thought, this is just a bit of writing. I had that element of detachment from it. Then a play of it opened, and the rape scene was taking place inside this tent, so you didn’t see it, but you heard all the screams, and it went on for eight minutes, and I wanted to die. I wanted the ground to open up and swallow me, because I could feel the excruciating pain and torment of everybody in the audience. And I was thinking, is that the reaction people are going to have when they read what I’ve written?” But it didn’t make him reassess how he wrote certain scenes. “You can’t self-censor,” he says. Is there a bit of Begbie in you, I ask – do you have a temper? “I’m pretty even-tempered, but when I do lose it, I go a bit nuts, so I don’t like to do it. I haven’t done it for a long time. Anything that comes to hand is used. I hit somebody in the head with a bar stool once. It was quite a heavy stool. He was pretty fucked. I would probably rather have somebody do that to me than me do that to them, because the guilt afterwards is crippling. It’s much worse than the shock if it happens to you. You can get over that. But if you do it to somebody else…” Even Begbie seems to reach an accommodation with decency of sorts in Dead Men’s Trousers; a kind of ethical nihilism – if you are going to destroy people, he philosophises, make sure it is people you don’t know, rather than those you love. Welsh smiles. “Yes, that’s Begbie. He is the poster boy now for white existential male rage. It’s his realisation that rather than hurt people close to you, just hurt total strangers if you need that fix of violence.” Who would win in a fight between him and Begbie? “Begbie,” he says instantly. “The other three I would take easily.” In Dead Men’s Trousers, Renton talks about the worst thing he has ever done (having sex with his pregnant sister-in-law at his brother’s funeral). What is the worst thing Welsh has done? For the first time all day, he refuses to answer. “I’d never talk about the worst thing I’ve ever done. There are things you’ve done you feel uncomfortable talking about, and there are things you’ve done that are hurtful and beyond the pale. When your behaviour has occasioned distress in people who have put trust in you, that’s the worst thing you can do.” There is no glee in his voice now, just a deadly seriousness. “I’ve always had some kind of moral conscience, but it gets stronger when you get older. It’s harder to be a bastard.” But there’s pain that comes with this, too, he says. “With everything you do, you’re striving to be a better version of yourself. But you lacerate yourself more when you do improve and get into a slightly higher moral plane. You look back more critically. So I think you’ve got to be a bit kind to yourself as well.” It’s mid-afternoon and Welsh is due at a recording studio to meet up with the legendary American record producer Arthur Baker. They are recording a single to coincide with the new novel. Welsh has written a verse, loosely based on Dead Men’s Trousers, that he will rap over a dance track. He polishes off the pot of green tea and we head out. In the street, he talks politics as we look for a cab. He says he is a product of the Thatcher era (like the Trainspotting crew, he is a natural wheeler-dealer), but defines himself as a punk rock anarchist. He hates everything the EU stands for in terms of centralised power and big business, but he would still rather be in than out. As for Scotland, “I’m less about Scottish independence than I am about the dismantling of the UK. I’m not so much a separatist as a breaker-upper. Taxxxxxiiii!” He hails the cab with magnificent authority. We head off for the studio in Hackney, and he is thinking about the notion of control. Often, he says, he’s felt the urge not to be in control, which may well explain his love-hate relationship with drugs. “You need to knock yourself out of your comfort zone, that has been a feature of my life.” But you seem to have enjoyed a sustained period of stability, I say – he has been married to Beth for 13 years. “Well, actually, we’re in the process of divorcing,” he says. “It’s not been easy for either of us.” Was there another woman? He seems simultaneously to laugh and choke. “No. Let’s just say it’s been a turbulent year, relationship-wise. I did get into a relationship afterwards very quickly. That was silly, because it was too quick.” Welsh is ready to shake up his life again. “I’ve been in three long-term relationships with blocks of single shags in between. I’ve got the co-dependency thing and the commitment-phobic thing running at the same time. A lot of guys have that. It’s like, find the beautiful princess, build a castle, then fuck off on a quest. And I was always fucking off on a quest, whether working on a film set or researching books or going to literary festivals. I was off all the time. It’s been a problem in every relationship I’ve been in. I like to have somebody I love and am loved by, but at the same time I’m always running away from them, too. That is something I have to resolve.” Separation is both traumatising and liberating, he says. Now he has started DJing again, hanging around nightclubs, living a young man’s life. We arrive at the studio. He introduces me to the production team, puts on a set of headphones and they start recording him, rapping against a heavy dance beat. His words are full of rage, but Welsh is thoroughly enjoying himself. Before I go, I ask if this is really the final Trainspotting book. He looks astonished at the suggestion. Then he remembers his own words. “Did I say that? I probably did say that, didn’t I? I might change my mind already. Yeah. There will be another one.” And with that he returns to his rap. He is entertaining us, entertaining himself, loudest boy in the class, centre of attention, eternal rebel, just as he likes it. For all his new-found introspection, Welsh need not worry too much. There is no danger of him growing up just yet. • Dead Men’s Trousers is published on 29 March by Jonathan Cape at £16.99. To order a copy for £14.44, go to guardianbookshop.com or call 0330 333 6846.

The Saracens and Lions’ full-back was shown a yellow card for a tackle in which his shoulder hit the neck and face of his opposite number, Matteo Minozzi, at the end of the first half. It wasted a prime attacking position for the home side, who at that stage were leading 17-7 having spent most of the game defending. Warren Gatland, the Wales head coach, said immediately after the match that he had been disappointed by the challenge, which he felt did not need to be so high, and revealed he did not send him back on to the field because he feared an “emotional” player was in danger of receiving another yellow card which would have led to his permanent exclusion. After reflecting on the incident, Gatland said: “It is not a major issue. It is about getting a balance and Liam controlling that emotion. Things were not going as well as he would have liked, he made a couple of errors and you could see him getting frustrated. “He gave away a penalty at the breakdown that he did not need to and while I understood what he was trying to do in the tackle and hit Minozzi as hard as he could, there was a bit of frustration and he caught him high. It could have been a red card. “I have sat him down before and it is just how we manage him and the players. I don’t want him to lose that emotion. That is what makes him so good: he is physical, has a great work-rate and great energy. You don’t want to take those away from him, but when things aren’t going his way he needs to keep calm.” The coach made 10 changes for the visit of Italy and will overhaul his side again as Wales look to finish as runners-up to Ireland. Alun Wyn Jones is set to return as captain as part of a raft of changes at forward to accommodate more physical opponents than Italy. “I hope France have been partying after beating England,” Gatland said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/13/yale-saifullah-khan-criminal-justice","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-13T13:35:43Z","webTitle":"Campus rape victims often find more justice in college than in court | Jill Filipovic","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/13/yale-saifullah-khan-criminal-justice","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/13/yale-saifullah-khan-criminal-justice","fields":{"headline":"Campus rape victims often find more justice in college than in court","bodyText":"Here is what Saifullah Khan and the woman he stood accused of raping agree on: the two Yale students were at a Halloween party in 2015, and it was a typical college party, with lots of booze. The two went back to the woman’s dorm room. She was so drunk she vomited multiple times. She woke up with bruises on her legs. Whether the two had consensual sex or whether Mr Khan raped the woman, whose identity is being shielded, was the question in front of a New Haven, Connecticut, jury, when the district attorney decided to pursue sexual assault charges against Mr Khan – an unusual move in a case of alleged acquaintance rape on a college campus. After hearing protracted testimony about the woman’s supposedly immodest Halloween costume, her alcohol consumption and her alleged flirtatious behavior, the jury found Mr Khan not guilty. The case was being closely watched, as a growing backlash against college campuses adjudicating sexual assault complaints has many, including in the highest reaches of government, wondering why campuses don’t just refuse to get involved and instead turn these cases over to the criminal justice system. This case makes clear that if the goal is to protect women’s equal rights to education – our right to attend college without the threat of sexual violence, and to go to a school that protects all of its students from bad actors – the criminal justice system is wholly insufficient. In a criminal proceeding, the stakes are high: lose, and you may wind up in jail (and in some states, if the charges are sufficiently serious, you may lose your life). The bar for guilt, then, is set high as well: guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. That is, a prosecutor has to show something much more than that you probably committed the crime; she has to amass so much evidence that jurors are wholly convinced of your guilt, and that any doubts they may have are far-fetched and unreasonable in the face of the evidence. Built into this system is the understanding that sometimes – even much of the time – there simply isn’t enough evidence for a conviction, even of someone who probably did it. The classic Blackstone-ism of: “It is better that ten guilty persons escape than that one innocent suffer” is the basis of the American criminal justice system, and what makes it a model for the world. In this case, one could argue that the criminal system worked. If the evidence wasn’t overwhelming enough that jurors still harbored wholly reasonable doubts about Mr Khan’s guilt, then he should have walked, odious as he seems. But the criminal justice system is also one made by men, with sexism built in. And so rape cases have always been harder to prove than other crimes, because the burden shifts so rapidly to the woman who says she was raped. She’s not supposed to be the one on trial, and yet too often, she is. Defense lawyers ask what she was wearing, as if a miniskirt signals a willingness to have sex with any man on the planet; they ask if she flirted, as if having a conversation with a man signals willingness to have sex with him; they ask if she was drinking, as if intoxication means a woman will have sex with anyone; they ask about past sexual behavior, as if having sex previously means you are wholly willing to indiscriminately have sex with anyone at any point thereafter. Rape shield laws, which prevent sexual history from being used against victims in court, were supposed to curb these evidentiary abuses, but as the Khan case shows, they haven’t: the woman was interrogated about her drinking, her texts to Mr Khan, and her Halloween costume. After the trial, defense attorney Norm Pattis said, “She chose that costume knowing she would see Mr Khan that night at the party. As I pointed out during the trial, she could have gone as Cinderella in a long gown. Why did she choose that alluring cat costume?” It’s shocking, because Mr Pattis is surely smarter than that, and knows that not every woman who has ever worn a sexy Halloween costume was doing so to demonstrate that she would sleep with any man who crossed her path. But the misogyny built into that tactic – the suggestion that the woman was slutty, and therefore must have consented to sex, or perhaps had no right to say no in the first place – still works with juries. That, obviously, needs fixing. But colleges also need mechanisms to keep badly behaved and violent students off campus, or at least penalize them accordingly, even if those students are accused of something that doesn’t meet the high threshold for criminal sanctions. Take hazing, for example. Some cases are sufficiently severe (usually cases where someone dies or is seriously injured) that a few students are brought to trial, and sometimes convicted. But that takes months or even years, and zeroes in on a small number of individuals, rather than holding larger groups accountable for enabling abuse of their fellow students. Universities, by contrast, can suspend fraternities and take immediate action to protect students. When it comes to sexual assault on college campuses, universities are tasked with taking the same approach – or at least they were, under the Obama administration. The Obama Department of Education encouraged colleges to create transparent and fair procedures for adjudicating sexual misconduct, allowing each student to present evidence to bolster their claims, and recommending a “preponderance of the evidence” standard to determine responsibility. Under that standard, students who are on two sides of a complaint are treated equally, and a decision-making panel’s job is to look at which way the evidence is most convincing to determine responsibility, and then consequences, which might range from an apology to suspension to expulsion, depending on the offense. It’s this standard that many critics find unfair – in their telling, expelling a student for rape without the high bar a criminal trial provides is unfair. But the bar isn’t as high because the stakes are not as high. Yes, suspension or expulsion are serious matters, and might compromise a student’s future. But students potentially face those same penalties for all manner of bad acts on campus, from plagiarism to stealing from a roommate to hazing. Why should sexual assault be treated differently – especially in a way that tips the scales in favor of the accused? Under Title IX of the Civil Rights Act, women have a right to education equal to that of men. Refusing to deal with sexual violence on campus functionally means that women do not fully enjoy our right to education. Too often, assault victims are the ones who end up dropping out of school if their assailant remains on campus. What else is a rape victim going to do if she has to see the man who assaulted her sitting a few rows down in philosophy class, laughing with his friends in the dining hall, and playing Frisbee on the quad? Telling her to take the case to the police isn’t enough – as the Khan case shows. It’s true that campus adjudication processes are often flawed. On too many campuses, students aren’t given sufficient ability to present evidence in their defense, or direct questions at an accuser. Too often, the evidentiary rules are opaque, and students are not given sufficient information about what awaits them in disciplinary hearings. But the criminal justice system is not a panacea. Our systems are created by human beings, and built into them are our flaws and biases. Nor is it reasonable to expect a single system to adjudicate all manner of antisocial human behavior. We understand that in our workplaces, an employee may behave in a way that may not quite merit criminal punishment, but would certainly merit termination. Losing a job is a serious consequence, but we accept that it’s a fair outcome, even if the employee’s responsibility for the bad behavior wasn’t proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Colleges offer far more protection that most workplaces. And their adjudication systems do not have to be identical to the criminal system in order to be appropriate for their environment. The Yale case shows us just how uphill the battle remains for the minority of women who are willing to walk into a court of law and say they were sexually assaulted. It points to necessary changes in evidentiary rules so that a woman’s outfit isn’t what’s on trial. But it also shows why functional, transparent, parallel systems are necessary on college campuses to make sure justice is done and all students have the right to be there.

Employers and union leaders have agreed a revised proposal to reform pensions, which – if endorsed by all parties – will be introduced as part of a three-year transitional arrangement. The proposal has been sent to members of the University and College Union (UCU) and will be considered on Tuesday at a meeting of the its higher education committee and at a separate meeting of branch representatives. Some UCU members quickly expressed their disapproval of the deal on social media and predicted that it would be rejected. Universities UK (UUK), which represents university employers, is in the process of consulting with Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS) employers on the new proposal. It is expecting union leaders to suspend industrial action from Wednesday. More than 60 universities have been hit by the strikes, which were launched after changes were proposed to pensions that the UCU claimed would cost staff £10,000 a year after retirement. The breakthrough came on Monday after six days of talks at the conciliation service Acas, amid mounting concern about the damaging effects of the strike on students’ studies and long-term relations between university staff and employers. Crucially, the new proposal retains a “meaningful level” of defined benefits for lecturers and other university workers. Under the original scheme, they were due to be scrapped in favour of a defined contributions scheme. The interim arrangement, which if agreed will come into effect from April next year, will require employers and members to pay higher contributions. Total employer contributions will go up to 19.3% of salary, with members’ contributions rising to 8.7%. These increased contributions are only in place for the duration of the three-year transitional arrangement. The two sides have also agreed to convene an independent expert panel to look again at the USS scheme, the valuation of which has been fiercely disputed. The dispute entered its fourth week on Monday, with lectures and tutorials cancelled and picket lines holding fast. Beyond the three-year deal, the two sides agreed to open fresh talks to explore risk-sharing alternatives for the future from 2020, in particular collective-defined contributions (CDC). The UCU and UUK both refused to comment further until the proposal had been discussed and agreed by members. But on Twitter, using the hashtag #NoCapitulation, UCU members and branches swiftly signalled their dissatisfaction with the deal, with one describing it as “derisory”. “UUK have woefully underestimated our collective anger &amp; commitment to protect our pensions,” said one, adding: “Totally out of touch. Blinkered &amp; arrogant.” “Go to bed, get back to the pickets tomorrow bright and early. We are going nowhere,” said another. Warwick UCU was one of the branches that quickly came out to reject the deal, tweeting: “Following our branch meeting this afternoon, the Warwick UCU position is to maintain the pensions status quo. In line with that near unanimous vote, Warwick UCU does not accept the agreement between @ucu and @UniversitiesUK reached at ACAS today.” Others included University College London, Soas and Liverpool University. The UCU’s industrial action is the most sweeping seen in UK universities - 14 days spread over a month with the threat of further disruption of final-year exams and graduation ceremonies if a deal is not reached. Strike action scheduled for Tuesday will continue as planned. A statement from UCU said: “The agreement on benefits noted above is transitional for the period of this valuation [from 1 April 2019 to 31 March 2022]. Recognising this, both UCU and UUK agree to work together to explore alternative options for the future of the scheme. The consideration of any alternative would include the potential impact on recruitment and retention, with a view to reviewing the different provision within the sector. “UCU and UUK jointly agree to form an independent expert group on valuation with an independent chair, involving academics and pension professionals, and liaising with USS. The objective will be to inform the next USS valuation and therefore will be completed by the end of 2019. “The group will consider issues of methodology, assumptions and monitoring, aiming to promote greater transparency and understanding, and will take account of the real strengths, sustainability and viability of the scheme.“ Both sides acknowledged the damaging impact of the strike and said trust needed to be rebuilt. The UCU agreed to encourage its members to prioritise the rescheduling of teaching in order to minimise the disruption to students. UUK posted a statement on Twitter that read: “An agreement has been reached between Universities UK (UUK) and the University and College Union (UCU) under the auspices of Acas following six days of talks. UUK is now consulting with Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS) employers about a revised mandate for a forthcoming joint negotiating committee on Wednesday 14 March.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/13/dip-housing-market-red-brexit-uk-eu","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-13T11:50:49Z","webTitle":"Red Brexiters wise up – a housing crash won’t bring us socialism  | Zoe Williams","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/13/dip-housing-market-red-brexit-uk-eu","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/13/dip-housing-market-red-brexit-uk-eu","fields":{"headline":"Red Brexiters wise up – a housing crash won’t bring socialism","bodyText":"“Alexa, what is red Brexit?” tweeted Aaron Bastani, the founder of the exhilarating Novara Media: the answer was a dramatic fall in London house prices, averages down by over £100,000 in some parts. North-west England, by contrast, is holding up well, with double-digit increases in Blackburn and Warrington, and steady growth in Manchester and Merseyside. This is the great rebalancing we’ve all been waiting for, the beginning of the end of unaffordability in the capital, the redistribution of asset inflation to the places it has traditionally never reached. It’s what the left wanted, and it’s a consequence of Brexit: ergo, red Brexit, or Lexit if you prefer. This is what you might call the tiger-riding approach to our national crisis in housing: climb atop a powerful shock and hope it continues to go in your direction. But house-price crashes never do proceed steadily towards equality. There have been four in the UK since the 1970s. They always hit the most buoyant areas first, and those places are always the first to recover. They always have a contagious effect on the economy around them. The housing market has been perverted over time by specific and discernible forces: an element of land-banking by developers; a chronic failure of the state to build for the future; and the evolution of housing as an investment, with prices determined not by any notion of value relative to the wages of people who need to live in them, but by how much a lender is prepared to lend. It has become a political platitude to promise to build more, though no one ever does. The necessary, radical missing question is how money should be created, if not like this. When 85% of all bank lending is on existing residential housing stock, house prices will always over-inflate. Any serious, structural solution will, without question, have red in it. But red Brexit is not a serious, structural solution. To rejoice in a leave-induced housing crash in the name of socialism is like watching a millionaire’s house burn down and thinking that it’s good for equality. Perhaps, if it didn’t set fire to any other houses; at a pinch, if he couldn’t immediately rebuild his house; but as a general rule, “set fire to it” is the thing you try last. The meaning of Brexit ought to be growing clearer, the closer we get to its realisation. What started as a battle of vast concepts – control versus cooperation, sovereignty versus internationalism – should have solidified into something more detailed. Instead, it has remained an abstraction, while the ideas attaching to it become ever wilder. Where once it would deliver £350m a week for the NHS, now it will realise the housing equality dreams of the reds who wanted it all along. The right elides it with the restoration of a hazily defined empire; the left collapses it with the concept of democracy itself. Vince Cable, leader of the Liberal Democrats, who said this weekend that the vote was “driven by nostalgia” for a Britain where “faces were white”, sees the entire caper as racist. His opponents embrace the decision to leave the EU as a victory for the upstanding citizen against everything: liberals, political correctness, experts, bureaucrats, Vince Cables, residents’ parking bays, hummus. Every day this project swells to encompass more ambition, more dread, more significance, more destiny, more conceptual certainties, most of which are preposterously contradictory. Once concrete decisions are made, and a roadmap established that a rational person could navigate, the fanciful will slip away. The return of the empire will turn out to mean a trade deal with India a lot like President Macron’s. The collapse of house prices and the rentier economy could turn out to be just another painful recession. Taking back control will gradually become more control over some things, less over others. This is at the root of politicians’ failure to articulate what they want. It’s not the internal divisions strangling them; it’s that any practical move, in any direction, will spell the end of their dreams. London School of Economics academic Stefan Collignon has drawn some interesting parallels between Brexit and the English civil war, finding cavaliers and leavers in the same places on the map. This has been noted before, roundhead areas becoming, in the fullness of centuries, Labour strongholds; royalists preceding Tory voters. It’s only funny now because the leavers are so cavalier. Yet there is, in the crisis that followed the regicide, some other, elementally recognisable quality of disappointment. It turned out that too much had been loaded upon a king, whether keeping or killing him; that bugbears like popery and radicalism were self-inflating, their danger grew roughly in proportion with how much time you spent worrying about them. The more abstract your politics, the less space it has for the practicalities and compromises wherein solutions are found. Ultimately, debate has to return to the particular and the demonstrable.

May is urgently trying to resolve a heated dispute about Westminster’s plans to temporarily restrict law-making by the Scottish and Welsh governments over at least 24 EU powers which will be repatriated after Brexit. These areas – which are controlled by the EU but overseen by the devolved governments – include GM crops, pesticides regulation, organic farming, fishing quotas and food safety. The prime minister will host separate bilateral meetings with Nicola Sturgeon and Carwyn Jones after all three leaders hold a joint ministerial committee at Downing Street, underlining the pressure May is under to resolve the dispute before meeting other European leaders on Brexit next week. UK ministers want changes in these areas to be agreed under UK-wide common framework agreements to protect the UK’s internal market and overseas trade. They published an amendment to the EU withdrawal bill on Monday in the Lords which said those restrictions would be temporary. The amendment binds UK ministers to consult with the devolved governments on the frameworks and report to the Commons on progress to implement them, but the devolved governments insist that is an unconstitutional restriction on their powers. Mike Russell, the Scottish Brexit minister, warned that Sturgeon would reject these amendments on Wednesday. In a letter to all MSPs, he said these powers had no time limit in the draft legislation. UK ministers had also refused to say whether the Sewel convention – a convention where devolved legislatures are consulted on primary legislation which affects them – would apply. “That is unacceptable,” he said. “Clearly we cannot agree to such proposals. The devolution settlement cannot be changed, even temporarily, without the consent of the Scottish parliament.” UK and Scottish government officials are playing down the prospects of a breakthrough at these meetings. Tensions escalated sharply after the Scottish and Welsh governments published their own rival legislation which would replace the EU withdrawal bill if the talks end in failure. The Scottish National party government in Edinburgh and the Welsh government in Cardiff both have majority support for their bills. Jones is widely believed to be closer than Sturgeon to accepting the latest changes to the withdrawal bill, which will be debated by the Lords on 22 March. UK officials say they have several weeks to finalise a deal, in time for a Lords vote next month. A Welsh government spokesman said last week’s ministerial meeting between the three governments suggested that UK ministers were “starting to move in the right direction and were willing to consider further changes”, adding: “We will continue to work to secure the amendments necessary to properly protect the devolution settlement, notably on Wednesday when the first minister meets with the prime minister.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/mar/12/stormy-daniels-trump-affair-allegations-money-return-tell-story","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-12T18:35:12Z","webTitle":"Stormy Daniels offers to return money to 'tell her story' of alleged Trump affair","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/12/stormy-daniels-trump-affair-allegations-money-return-tell-story","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/mar/12/stormy-daniels-trump-affair-allegations-money-return-tell-story","fields":{"headline":"Stormy Daniels offers to return money to 'tell her story' of alleged Trump affair","bodyText":"Stormy Daniels has offered to return a $130,000 fee paid to her by Donald Trump’s personal lawyer so she can break her silence about her alleged affair with the future US president. A letter from the actor’s lawyer Michael Avenatti to Trump’s personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, on Monday offered to return the $130,000 (£93,000) into an account of the president’s choosing by Friday. The letter asks that no action be taken to prevent the airing of an interview that the actor – real name Stephanie Clifford – recently recorded with the CNN journalist Anderson Cooper for the CBS news program 60 Minutes, for which Cooper is a regular contributor. It gives Trump until noon ET on Tuesday 13 March to accept the offer. Trump has denied Clifford’s allegations of a lengthy affair with him in 2006, the year after he married Melania Trump. “Ms Clifford wants to be able to tell her story directly to the American people and say what happened with the president, as well as his efforts to silence her,” Avenatti told the Guardian on Monday. “She wants the people to decide who is shooting straight with them and who is being less than forthcoming. One of the fundamental premises that America was founded on was the right to free speech and that’s very important to her.” Cohen, a longtime Trump lawyer, has admitted paying Clifford $130,000 in 2016. In February, the celebrity magazine InTouch published a 5,000-word interview detailing Clifford’s story. In a series of twists and turns last week, the White House press secretary, Sarah Sanders, was the first to acknowledge from the administration’s side that there had been any contact between Trump and Clifford, claiming that he had won a case “in arbitration” against the actor. Then on Wednesday night, the New York Times obtained a copy of a temporary restraining order issued by a private arbitrator in Los Angeles on 27 February precluding one Peggy Peterson from disclosing “confidential information” as defined in an earlier secret agreement. Peggy Peterson is a pseudonym for Stephanie Clifford, according to a separate lawsuit brought by Clifford days later, while Trump, for the purposes of his legal dealings with Clifford, “was referred to by the alias ‘David Dennison’ or ‘DD’”. Cohen had used a shell company, Essential Consultants LLC, to wire the $130,000 to Clifford. The New York Times broke the story on Monday of Clifford’s offer to pay back the 2016 fee of $130,000 paid to her by Cohen. As well as a TV interview with Cooper, the letter also says that if Clifford’s offer to return the fee is accepted, she would then be permitted to: “(A) speak openly and freely about her prior relationship with the president and the attempts to silence her and (b) use and publish any text messages, photos and/or videos relating to the president that she may have in her possession, all without fear of retribution and/or legal liability for damages.” Cohen admitted last Friday that he had used a line of credit based on the value of his own home to gather the $130,000 to pay Daniels, and had used his email account associated with the Trump Organization – the president’s business empire – to communicate about the payment. He says he paid Clifford in a personal capacity. There is no proof that Trump knew about or approved the payment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2018/mar/20/six-of-best-spring-hearltland-walks-in-britain-england-wales","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-20T06:30:33Z","webTitle":"Six of Britain's best ‘spring heartland’ walks","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/mar/20/six-of-best-spring-hearltland-walks-in-britain-england-wales","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2018/mar/20/six-of-best-spring-hearltland-walks-in-britain-england-wales","fields":{"headline":"Six of Britain's best ‘spring heartland’ walks","bodyText":"Spring is primarily about transformation and the promise of summer. It fights a titanic struggle, for winter is loath to let go. Eventually spring wins through, and greens the drab-brown land until its flowers cover winter’s grave. Above all, spring is a mighty metamorphosis that would turn any caterpillar green with envy. Wave upon wave of rejuvenation occurs, over entire landscapes, over whole countries. At its zenith, massive changes occur daily: swallows arrive one day, orange-tip butterflies appear the next, then nightingales, and so on. It offers us new epiphanies each day, each sunny hour. So, spring can transform us, too, if we allow it to enter into us, and we into it. Fortunately, there are many ultra-special places – spring’s heartlands – which can help us be enriched by the season. Silverdale, north Lancashire Spring makes the Arnside and Silverdale Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty a place of essential pilgrimage. The AONB is spread over undulating countryside of rocky limestone hillocks, peaty valleys and coppice woods, linked by a labyrinthine network of lanes and footpaths, perfect for pottering and second honeymoons. Magical places abound, such as the Fairy Steps, the Trough (a shallow gorge), the nature reserves of Gait Barrows and Leighton Moss and, a short way to the north, the towering massif of Arnside Knott. Best of all, there is limestone pavement aplenty, banks of primroses and choirs of willow warblers. • Just off Junction 35 of the M6, arnsidesilverdaleaonb.org.uk, OS Explorer map for SE Lakes (OL7) Cwm Soden, Ceredigion coast This undiscovered sea combe running into Cardigan Bay, in the secret land of Ceredigion, is Wales at its very best – full of legend, myth and mystery. The rushing, gushing stream recites poetry, in Welsh. Spring sparkles here. You will leave part of your soul behind. There are two options on this National Trust route: for the longer “butterfly walk”, park at Cwm Tydu bay and follow the coastal path north over Caerllan Cliffs, looking out for carpets of sky blue spring squill and listening out for displaying choughs. It’s best to turn inland towards Pen-y-graig and then descend the valley (following numbers 1, 2, 6, 5, 4 and 3 on the NT route). For a shorter circular walk, miss out the first stretch of coastal path, by parking near Pen-y-graig church. • Route details at nationaltrust.org.uk Heddon Valley, Exmoor Warning: leaving this piece of paradise-on-earth hurts. This valley in the north-west corner of Exmoor national park has it all: intimacy, hanging oak woods, bracken, gorse and scree slopes, a stream with dippers, firm footpaths leading to a rocky cove with memorable views along the Exmoor coast, easy-access routes, loos, a National Trust shop with ice-cream and a picturesque half-timbered Victorian pub, and afternoon tea. Yet it remains unspoiled (though midweek visits are the quietest). Strangely, this valley stands apart: it is like no other on Exmoor, and it has its own sunny, sheltered climate. Buzzards circle overhead. You can plan a route in advance, or just arrive and be guided by the spirit of the place. • There are several walking routes on offer, some gentle, some challenging (especially on the upper slopes), nationaltrust.org.uk Kingcombe Meadows, mid-Dorset A relic Thomas Hardy landscape, this secluded valley escaped (or resisted) the ravages of late 20th-century agriculture. It is a mosaic of small, old-fashioned flowery meadows, separated by tall and outgrown hedges offering blackthorn snow in spring, and a meandering alder-lined stream. Kingcombe Meadows are so far off the beaten track that the track petered out some while back, but it is vaguely near the village of Maiden Newton. The infernal combustion engine cannot intrude here. If you want peace and songbirds, you’ll find them, once you have found your way in. Kingcombe is run as a farmland nature reserve by the Dorset Wildlife Trust: it’s grazed by a few cattle and sheep, with some meadows cut for hay. • dorsetwildlifetrust.org.uk Ashford Hangers, Petersfield, east Hampshire There are dreamscape vistas over the Low Weald of West Sussex and along the western South Downs from this east-facing wooded chalk escarpment. It is the heartland of the poet Edward Thomas, who dwelt, mused and wrote here. Birdsong reverberates, brimstone butterflies wander ceaselessly, carpets of bluebells and ransoms thicken, and spring reigns supreme. Parking is limited, off a miasma of sunken lanes, and the numerous footpaths are steep and/or muddy, but this is one of the most wondrous places in the UK, especially in early spring when the chiffchaffs are arriving. Read Thomas’s poems March and Home (Often I had gone), before visiting. There are some excellent pubs around the village of Steep. • hants.gov.uk Avebury, Wiltshire History is everywhere, and in almost everything, at this open-access stone circle within a world heritage site landscape, and partly within Avebury village itself. Yet nature is omnipresent, especially in the vast, changeling skyscapes. Park in the National Trust car park and wander into the cul-de-sac village. Celandines abound. Swallows nest in the Victorian lychgate to St James’s church (kept open). Lichens grow in hieroglyphs on the ancient standing stones. But look up, for Avebury is run by its jackdaws and rooks. There are several rookeries, one by the church. Jackdaws peer down from chimney pots and parkland trees. If you want to lose yourself, wander the paths on to the nearby downs, such as Windmill Hill, and dream awhile. • nationaltrust.org.uk Matthew Oates is the author of Beyond Spring (Fair Acre Press, £10.99), available from guardianbookshop.com"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/mar/12/russia-highly-likely-to-be-behind-poisoning-of-spy-says-theresa-may","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-13T10:03:36Z","webTitle":"Russian spy poisoning: Theresa May issues ultimatum to Moscow","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/12/russia-highly-likely-to-be-behind-poisoning-of-spy-says-theresa-may","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/mar/12/russia-highly-likely-to-be-behind-poisoning-of-spy-says-theresa-may","fields":{"headline":"Russian spy poisoning: Theresa May issues ultimatum to Moscow","bodyText":"Theresa May has given Vladimir Putin’s administration until midnight on Tuesday to explain how a former spy was poisoned in Salisbury, otherwise she will conclude it was an “unlawful use of force” by the Russian state against the UK. After chairing a meeting of the national security council, the prime minister told MPs that it was “highly likely” that Russia was responsible for the attack on Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia. She warned that Britain would not tolerate such a “brazen attempt to murder innocent civilians on our soil”. In a statement to the House of Commons that triggered an angry response from Moscow, the prime minister said the evidence had shown that Skripal had been targeted by a “military-grade nerve agent of a type developed by Russia”. Describing the incident as an “indiscriminate and reckless act”, she said that the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, had summoned the Russian ambassador to Whitehall and demanded an explanation by the end of Tuesday. Russian officials immediately hit back, with Maria Zakharova, the spokeswoman for the Russian foreign minister, calling the remarks “a provocation” and describing the event as a “circus show in the British parliament”. Andrei Lugovoi, a Russian member of parliament who stands accused of the 2006 murder of the former Russian agent, Alexander Litvinenko, said May’s decision to point the finger at Moscow so quickly was “at a minimum irresponsible”. Ministers on the national security council were told that the nerve agent used was from a family of substances known as Novichok. “Based on the positive identification of this chemical agent by world-leading experts at Porton Down, our knowledge that Russia has previously produced this agent and would still be capable of doing so, Russia’s record of conducting state-sponsored assassinations, and our assessment that Russia views some defectors as legitimate targets for assassinations, the government has concluded that it is highly likely that Russia was responsible for the act against Sergei and Yulia Skripal,” she said. The prime minister said that left just two plausible explanations “Either this was a direct act by the Russian state against our country, or the Russian government lost control of this potentially catastrophically damaging nerve agent and allowed it to get into the hands of others.” May made clear that she believed there was already “a backdrop of a well-established pattern of Russian state aggression” – listing the illegal annexation of Crimea, violating European airspace and a “sustained campaign of cyber-espionage and disruption”, including “meddling in elections, and hacking the Danish ministry of defence and the Bundestag, among many others”. She also spoke of the extrajudicial killing of terrorists and dissidents outside Russia and the murder of Litvinenko. The home secretary, Amber Rudd, will chair a meeting of the government’s Cobra emergency committee in Whitehall at 11.30am on Tuesday to discuss the latest developments in the investigation. May said the government would consider Russia’s response on Wednesday. “Should there be no credible response, we will conclude that this action amounts to an unlawful use of force by the Russian state against the United Kingdom,” she said, promising to return to the house with a full range of retaliatory measures. “This attempted murder, using a weapons-grade nerve agent in a British town, was not just a crime against the Skripals. It was an indiscriminate and reckless act against the United Kingdom, putting the lives of innocent civilians at risk. And we will not tolerate such a brazen attempt to murder innocent civilians on our soil.” The tough statement means that a major diplomatic row is looming between Moscow and London, with expulsions on both sides highly likely. Russia’s hardline ambassador to the UK, Alexander Yakovenko, may well be sent home. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, responded by saying the whole house condemned the “deeply alarming attack” and that a full account was needed from Russian authorities. However, he warned against a full breakdown of communications with Moscow. “We need to continue seeking a robust dialogue with Russia on all the issues currently dividing our countries, rather than simply cutting off contact and letting the tensions and divisions get worse and potentially even more dangerous,” he said. Corbyn then began a political attack on the Conservatives, after reports that the party had accepted donations of more than £820,000 from Russian oligarchs since May took over the leadership. He asked why the government had not accepted a Labour-led amendment to the sanctions and anti-money laundering bill that would pave the way for so-called Magnitsky powers to punish human rights abuses with asset freezes and visa bans. May responded that her government’s simple approach to Moscow was: “Engage but beware.” Referring to her previous comments on on Russian interference in elections, she said: “There can be no question of business as usual with Russia.” On the Magnitsky powers, she insisted that the UK was already able to take tough action against individuals, but did promise to try to reach agreement over the amendment. In 2007, Gordon Brown kicked out four Russian diplomats in protest at Vladimir Putin’s refusal to extradite Lugovoi and Dmitry Kovtun, the two assassins who put polonium into Alexander Litvinenko’s tea. The Russian foreign ministry expelled four British diplomats in response. On this occasion, Putin is likely to react badly to May’s ultimatum. The UK’s ambassador to Moscow, Laurie Bristow – the deputy ambassador at the time of Litvinenko’s murder – is vulnerable. Additionally, the Kremlin may take action against the BBC. When relations plummeted over Litvinenko, Moscow closed the St Petersburg office of the British Council and accused its director, Stephen Kinnock – now a Labour MP – of drink-driving. The use of Novichok – a deadly nerve agent developed in the 1970s and 1980s by the Soviet Union – will be seen as a brutal calling card. It was inevitable that the poison would be discovered, with a trail leading straight back to Moscow. The attack came two weeks before Russia’s presidential election on Sunday. The calculation may be that the Skripal case galvanises Putin’s conservative base and boosts votes. The reaction of backbench MPs to May’s statement was largely supportive on all sides of the house. The Tory chair of the foreign affairs select committee, Tom Tugendhat, said the Salisbury attack was “if not an act of war … certainly a warlike act by the Russian federation”. Labour’s Yvette Cooper, who chairs the home affairs committee, said it was hard to see any alternative to the prime minister’s “very grave conclusion”, but asked if any action had been taken to review 14 other cases that she had raised. A number of backbench MPs criticised Corbyn for failing to speak out more strongly in the face of what they described as a national security threat. Iain Duncan Smith, the former Tory leader, said the prime minister had risen to the occasion, but that colleagues would be disappointed by the Labour leader’s partisan attack. His Conservative colleague, Johnny Mercer, described the opposition response as a “shameful moment”. Others argued that the time for dialogue with Moscow had run out. In a barbed attack on Corbyn, the Labour MP John Woodcock – a longtime critic of his party leader – welcomed the resilience of May and said the UK would face a national security threat if led by “anyone who did not understand the gravity of the threat which Russia poses”. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) is planning to accelerate and expand its cyber-offensive capability over the next five years in response to the present crisis with Russia, according to Whitehall sources. The aim is to increase the UK’s ability to strike back against selected targets in Russia and other states regarded as hostile, such as China, North Korea and Iran. The MoD is also, in the wake of Salisbury, planning to spend more on chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) defence. The move is an acknowledgement that it has paid inadequate attention to the increased danger. May won strong support for her position from international allies. The US secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, said whoever had ordered the attack must face serious consequences. He said: “We have full confidence in the UK’s investigation and its assessment that Russia was likely responsible for the nerve agent attack that took place in Salisbury last week. There is never a justification for this type of attack – the attempted murder of a private citizen on the soil of a sovereign nation – and we are outraged that Russia appears to have again engaged in such behaviour. “We agree that those responsible – both those who committed the crime and those who ordered it – must face appropriately serious consequences.” Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said: “The United Kingdom has concluded that Sergei Skripal and his daughter were poisoned with a military-grade nerve agent of a type developed by Russia. And prime minister Theresa May stated today that it is highly likely that Russia was responsible for the act. The use of any nerve agent is horrendous and completely unacceptable. The UK is a highly valued ally, and this incident is of great concern to Nato. Nato is in touch with the UK authorities on this issue.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"voluntary-sector-network/2018/mar/29/small-charity-tight-budgets-neglect-staff","type":"article","sectionId":"voluntary-sector-network","sectionName":"Voluntary Sector Network","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-29T06:53:07Z","webTitle":"The small charity I worked for used tight budgets as an excuse to neglect staff","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/voluntary-sector-network/2018/mar/29/small-charity-tight-budgets-neglect-staff","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/voluntary-sector-network/2018/mar/29/small-charity-tight-budgets-neglect-staff","fields":{"headline":"The small charity I worked for used tight budgets as an excuse to neglect staff","bodyText":"Small charities are some of the most rewarding organisations to work for. There are so many positives: the commitment and passion of colleagues, the success stories that are a direct consequence of your hard work, the chance to get involved with projects outside of your expertise and the sense of unity that comes from overcoming challenges together every day. But there is a darker side. Leaders of small charities can also promote the attitude that working to a tight budget makes it OK to be unprofessional. The result is high staff turnover, which has a huge impact on programme work, funding streams and beneficiaries. During the 18 months I worked at a charity such as this I felt belittled and worthless. Senior members of staff had their favourites, which led to double standards among peers, and a culture of bullying and micromanagement. Some employees were not allowed to use their mobile phones during work hours, while others answered personal calls during meetings with no consequences. Some employees were able to work from home whenever they liked, while others were denied this luxury altogether. And some were publicly criticised and shamed for their work, while others got away with catastrophic mistakes – even ones that cost the charity large sums of money. I experienced micro-management firsthand that was detrimental to the fundraising projects I was working on, as well as to my confidence. My manager insisted on being involved at every stage, which added weeks to each project. I had no ownership of my work and essentially acted as a go-between for my manager and the contractors we employed. The final straw was when a colleague made homophobic comments at a social event after work. I reported this to my manager but no action was taken – it wasn’t seen as a work issue because it had happened after hours. It was frustrating that, in a sector that fights for equality and justice, my complaint was not taken seriously. If anything, I was made to feel I’d done something wrong by bringing my colleague’s behaviour to light. As a small charity, there was no human resources department, which meant there was nowhere safe and confidential to escalate these matters. It also led to a lack of training at management level, leaving many in leadership positions unaware of how to speak to a wider team, give feedback effectively or keep morale up. It doesn’t have to be this way. I now work for a wonderful international development charity. Although it is also small, it couldn’t feel more different. We are treated like adults and trusted by senior management. Our ideas are listened to and our efforts are appreciated. I feel valued and respected, and the charity has a low staff turnover. Looking back, I question why the organisation I used to work for did not think it necessary to look out for staff or question why most left after only a year. It seems bizarre that the trustees and leadership team did not ask why staff were so unhappy. A tight budget is no excuse for neglecting your team. Small charities deserve better leaders with better people management skills. With happier staff comes stability and consistency, making the workplace a more productive place to be. That all benefits our beneficiaries. So why do so few small charities want to invest in it? Want to share your own experience working in the charity or non-profit sector?

The University of Bath’s remuneration committee meets on Wednesday, 14 March, at a time when its staff are on strike over the downgrading of their pensions, with the students demanding compensation for lost teaching time. So far the university has been upbraided by HEFCE, the university’s court, a large number of professors, its academic assembly and the students, but nothing has yet changed. The university’s chair of council, Tom Sheppard, and other senior lay office-holders cling to their positions despite calls for them to resign. Still the VC remains in office until August, and will then receive her salary for a further six months’ sabbatical leave. The background to this loss of credibility entails privileging a small group of senior management over several years with exaggerated pay and perks (ie rent-seeking on student debt), while the salaries and conditions of all other staff are restricted to below-inflation awards; public money spent on a personal loan write-off; permitting the VC to take on significant additional paid employment outside the university (including, ironically, membership of the university pensions board); a lack of transparency in these decisions despite repeated requests for published criteria; and undermining the collegiate culture so essential to a well-functioning university. This same leadership team is currently asserting its right to control the appointment of a new vice-chancellor. This is indefensible. Failure to resign now will cast a shadow over any incoming VC. We call upon them, again, to do the honourable thing, having lost all legitimacy. Geof Wood, George Lunt, Ian Gough, Stuart Reynolds, Mike Owen and David Collard Prof emeriti and life members of the court of the University of Bath • The scandal of excess pay for vice-chancellors stems in part from universities’ anomalous status and weak governance. The ONS classes universities as private, not public sector, even though most of their income is from public bodies (especially since much student loan debt will be written off by the government), and most were built with public money. Yet there is none of the external accountability to shareholders that is a check on excess pay in private companies. Though having charitable status, they are exempt from supervision by the Charity Commission. The only check is internally appointed non-executives, whose complaisance on VC pay has been shameful. Universities are the least accountable entities in our economy – public or private. It is moot who actually owns them. Given the scandal of VC pay (and the coming scandals – universities’ financial instability, dilution of student’s learning experience, financial exploitation of students and staff), it is surely time that the issue of university governance was looked at afresh. Julian Le Vay Oxford • It seems appropriate that the vice-chancellor pay league table should be headed by the London Business School, since business schools are there specifically to teach their customers how to maximise their earnings. Business used to be about producing some necessary or desirable thing and selling it at a workable profit. It involved deep knowledge of the field and the workforce. Business schools, by contrast, teach all-purpose management skills designed to be parachuted in anywhere. As the financial pages demonstrate, what these businesses make or sell is subsidiary to the profits that can be made by merging or “rationalising” them. As for the workforce, that’s the least of their considerations. Business schools do not increase knowledge, are not a public good, and have nothing to with universities’ real purpose. By contrast, they have everything to do with the mindset that has led to the current universities strike.

But I don’t say yes. Not yet. The no part of my brain is still in the fight, a boxer taking punches. The no inside my brain is resilient. Will you really enjoy the party, it’s asking me. Think of the book. You’ll never write the book if you spend your time going to parties! Yes or no – the central dilemma. For most of my lifetime, yes has been winning the race. But recently no has made a strong comeback. The forces of no tell you not to give in to your impulsive side, but to look elsewhere in your brain for guidance. There are good reasons for this, mostly having to do with the fact that the world has recently changed very fast. We used to live in a world in which we didn’t need an inner no, because no was all around us. Now we live in a world designed to give us what we think we want. Now yes is all around us. An outer yes requires an inner no. Recently, an article in the Financial Times declared that no was the new yes, and cited books with titles such as The Power of No, and How to Say No Without Feeling Guilty. These are trendy self-help books. But I’ve been reading books on the no side of the equation for a few years now. The importance of saying no to your impulses is more than fashionable – it’s a necessity. In 2002, the behavioural psychologist Daniel Kahneman won a Nobel prize for his work on saying no to your impulses; in 2017, Richard Thaler won another. Dozens of researchers and writers have picked up on the work done by Kahneman and his late colleague Amos Tversky. I have a whole shelf of their books. Of course, there’s Kahneman’s Thinking, Fast and Slow, and Thaler’s Misbehaving. But also The Marshmallow Test by Walter Mischel, The Impulse Society by Paul Roberts, Irresistible by Adam Alter, Your Money and Your Brain by Jason Zweig, Wait by Frank Partnoy. And there’s The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying by Marie Kondo, for those who have said yes too many times, and need to clear their clutter. You have gut feelings, these authors tell us. You have impulses. Don’t say yes to these impulses. Think again. Say no. Mick says: “So – is that a yes?” I’m thinking that I’d love to go to Mick’s party – and also that the word yes is actually affecting the way I think. Over the last few years I’ve been to several sales seminars hosted by Jordan Belfort. The Wolf of Wall Street says that, if you want to generate a yes, it helps to use exactly the right tone of voice. Then ask the person a few innocuous questions and get them to agree with you – these utterances are called “micro-agreements”. Saying yes makes it harder to say no. Yes! I want to say the word. I want to be marinated in a mutual moment of yes. But I don’t say the word. Not just yet. The psychologist Steve Peters gives one of the clearest metaphors for the impulsive part of the brain. He calls it the chimp. Everybody has an inner chimp, he says. Actually, he’s talking about the limbic system, the centre of emotions. We all have an inner human, too. Your inner human is located in the prefrontal cortex. The chimp makes snap judgments. It’s obsessed with food, sex and immediate danger. It’s there for a reason. Back when we were chimps, it was right most of the time. It made you fight when you needed to fight. It made you kill when you needed to kill. It was grabby, jealous, greedy. It still is. The prefrontal cortex, on the other hand, is what makes you human. Some people, Peters points out, might say it’s where your soul is. It seeks the truth. It looks for evidence. It argues rationally and sees the world in what Peters calls “shades of grey”. One of the most important things Peters says is this: the inner chimp is much more powerful than the inner human. When information reaches the brain, it gets to the chimp first. The chimp has first dibs. Which means that everything you see or hear is framed by your impulses. When you see something you want, yes comes first. Yes is louder. No is a distant second. One thing you might notice at this point is that we seem to be living in a world designed for the inner chimp in all of us. Politics is for chimps; Twitter is for chimps; clickbait is for chimps. In a broader sense, the internet is for chimps. Not all of it, of course. But watch the blogger Tim Urban’s brilliant Ted talk on procrastination. You start out with the best intentions. But it’s easy to fall down a rabbit hole. I once had a conversation with the tech guru Jaron Lanier, who has strong feelings about this. These rabbit holes are not just based on our whims. They are engineered for us by expert robots. We are like rats in an experiment designed to get us to say yes. The experiment is relentless; it has almost unlimited resources and all the time in the world. In The Impulse Society, Paul Roberts writes about a man called Brett Walker, who became addicted to the online game World of Warcraft. “For four years,” writes Roberts, “even as his real life collapsed, Walker enjoyed a near-perfect online existence, with virtually unlimited power and status akin to that of a Mafia boss crossed with a rock star.” In real life, Walker was “physically weak, financially destitute, and so socially isolated he could barely hold a face-to-face conversation”. The inventors of World of Warcraft had designed an astonishingly effective product. “On the surface,” writes Roberts, “the tale of someone like Brett Walker may not seem relevant to those who don’t spend our days waging virtual war.” But that’s just on the surface. Roberts makes a powerful point: the rest of the world is more like an addictive game than you might think. Not just Netflix and Amazon, which are guided by rabbit-hole algorithms. It’s more than that, he says. It’s the whole consumer society. It’s the way we “fine-tune our lives”. It’s a world geared to the chimp – or, in psychologist Walter Mischel’s terms, the “hot system” of impulse, rather than the “cool system” of taking stock, looking for evidence, thinking about what’s best in the long term. Daniel Kahneman refers to “system one” and “system two” – gut reaction versus taking a moment or two to think things through. Jason Zweig refers to “thinking” and “feeling”. I think that Paul Roberts has put his finger on the reason lots of people are interested in this distinction. It’s the world. It’s changing. It’s designed for the chimp in all of us. I interviewed Mike Morhaime and Frank Pearce, the inventors of World of Warcraft. “As I got older,” Morhaime told me, “I became fascinated with how computers worked. How everything evolved. And so I decided to go into electrical engineering. I was just so fascinated,” he said. He looked down at the table, and then up again. “I’ve just always been interested in the capabilities of different devices,” he said. “And getting them to talk to other devices. All the inputs and outputs on them, you know.” Morhaime and Pearce didn’t have an office. They had a campus in Irvine, California. Lovely modern buildings and neat lawns. Frank Pearce’s office was full of plastic figurines of characters from the game – orcs and elves. And, of course, humans. “Mike is better at relationships and interacting with people than I am,” he told me. I was trying to find out why the game was so popular; why millions of people spent 20 or 30 hours a week playing it. Morhaime and Pearce had manipulated algorithms and got them to talk to each other. They had fine-tuned the algorithms for years. Eventually they had found a sweet spot in the human brain. In the lobby was a map of the world that lit up. It was a data field of where people were saying yes to the game, in real time. They were saying yes in Los Angeles, Boston, Caracas, and Buenos Aires. They were saying yes in Madrid and Beijing. Morhaime and Pearce are only the beginning. That’s what I imagine Jaron Lanier would say. That’s what Paul Roberts would say. Mick says: “I’d love you to come.” And I would love to come. I can always write my book another time. My brain runs calculations. It’s doing what behavioural psychologists call “future-discounting”. I want to say yes now. If I say yes now, I’ll be happy. Then I’ll be able to look forward to the party. Then I’ll go to the party. That’s a lot of happiness. The chimp in my head is totting everything up. But there’s a problem. He’s using chimp maths. Chimp maths is not real maths. It’s what you use when you’re wondering whether to have the salad or the fries. Look at those fries! They are 10 times better – order them! That’s chimp maths. Chimp maths says yes to the party. But my prefrontal cortex knows that if I say no now, I’ll be happier – but not until later. The question is: how much is deferred happiness worth? And how do you persuade yourself to say no to happiness now? I interviewed Frank Partnoy, the author of Wait, a book about the benefits of not capitulating to your inner chimp. Before I met him, he sent me an email: “Given the crush of technology, email, social media, and 24-hour news, most of us react and decide too quickly. We are hard-wired to snap respond to fast, salient stimulus, even when it is to our disadvantage.” In other words, the world has got too fast for us. Things have evolved to grab the chimp’s attention. Food is fast. It’s engineered to get glucose into our blood as soon as possible. Social media is fast. It stirs us up. It engages the chimp. To thrive, we must slow down. Everybody else is led by their inner chimp. So slow down. If you wait, you’ll win. In The Marshmallow Test, Walter Mischel tells us about his famous experiment involving children and marshmallows. Partnoy describes it, too. It’s one of the most influential experiments in recent behavioural psychology. In the experiment, conducted at Stanford University in 1960s, four-year-old children were given a choice. A marshmallow was put in front of them, and they were told that they could eat the marshmallow now, or wait 15 minutes, after which they would be given two marshmallows. The kids were left alone in the room with the marshmallows. Some said yes. Some said no, for the whole 15 minutes. The kids were monitored over the years. Those who had said no got better grades. Also, they “were less prone to impulsive behaviour”, and, according to tests, were “more likely” to be well-adjusted. Party or book? “The hotter and more salient the desired reward,” writes Mischel, “the more difficult it is to cool the impulsive reaction to it.” On the other hand: “The power is not in the stimulus… but in how it is appraised.” And, of course: “The power resides in the prefrontal cortex, which, if activated, allows almost endless ways of cooling hot, tempting stimuli by changing how they are appraised.” As Frank Partnoy would say: wait. As Steve Peters would say: allow time for the information to move beyond the chimp. You don’t have to be “hijacked by your chimp”. You can let yourself feel your chimp’s emotions, and wait for them to pass. Be rational. Say no to the marshmallow right now, and you might find yourself with two marshmallows in the future. I’m desperate to go to the party. I really am. It would be such fun. Why not just go for a couple of days? Why not? But that’s chimp maths. I can see what would happen. I’d have to make arrangements, pack, drive to the place. I’d be anticipating it for a couple of days beforehand. I’d be excited and anxious. My focus would go. Then it would take me a couple of days to wind down. I’d lose a week. “The thing is,” I say to Mick, “I can’t.”"},"isHosted":false},{"id":"football/2018/mar/12/jose-mourinho-frank-de-boer-worst-manager-marcus-rashford-manchester-united","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-12T16:49:51Z","webTitle":"José Mourinho attacks ‘worst manager’ Frank de Boer for Rashford comments","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/12/jose-mourinho-frank-de-boer-worst-manager-marcus-rashford-manchester-united","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/mar/12/jose-mourinho-frank-de-boer-worst-manager-marcus-rashford-manchester-united","fields":{"headline":"José Mourinho attacks ‘worst manager’ Frank de Boer for Rashford comments","bodyText":"José Mourinho has branded Frank de Boer the “worst manager in the history of the Premier League” after the Dutchman questioned the Manchester United manager’s handling of Marcus Rashford. De Boer lasted only five matches at Crystal Palace before being sacked in September. He lost each of his four league games without managing a goal and won a League Cup match. After Saturday’s 2-1 victory over Liverpool in which Rashford scored United’s goals, De Boer said it was a “pity” Mourinho was the 20-year-old’s manager. In response, Mourinho said: “I read something, some quote from the worst manager in the history of the Premier League – Frank de Boer. What he was saying was not good for Marcus Rashford to have a coach like me, because the most important thing for me is to win. “If he was coached by Frank he would lose because he lost every game. I try to give the best to the kid. I have to be honest and give the credit to the people of the academy that was responsible for his formation, to Louis van Gaal [Mourinho’s predecessor] who was responsible for his first season. But if you go to his numbers and how many matches he played with me last season and this, I would say probably he’s in the top five players with most matches in the two seasons.” De Boer, working as a BT pundit, had said when discussing Rashford, who was making a first league start in 2018 against Liverpool: “It’s a pity the manager is Mourinho because normally he’s an English player you want to give him time and he can then make mistakes. But Mourinho is not like that, he wants to get results. If he has one or two not good games, he puts him out. He’s very young, he needs games, he’s so talented. You want to see this player every week.” United play Sevilla in Tuesday night’s Champions League last-16 second leg with the tie poised at 0-0, which means the visitors will go through on away goals in the event of a score draw. Mourinho believes United have a chance of winning the competition if they progress. “I think we’re not one of the best teams in the competition but when a team arrives in the last eight, anything can happen,” he said. “When you’re in the last 16 it looks really far but in the last eight you start smelling the semi-finals.” Paul Pogba remains a doubt with a leg injury picked up in training last week. Mourinho said he did not know whether the midfielder would be available but Pogba had trained after the open part of Monday’s session closed. Michael Carrick has confirmed he will retire at the end of the season. “There comes a time, whether you like it or you don’t like it, that your body tells you it is time to stop playing football,” he said. “That’s pretty much where I’m at. It’s something that you have got to accept.” Carrick is expected to join United’s coaching staff in the summer. “It’s kind of been sorted out but we’re still talking about it so there is nothing to totally confirm yet,” he said. “It’s looking likely.” The 36-year-old expanded on the heart condition he had in September. “I had a problem during the Burton [EFL Cup] game in the second half,” Carrick said. “I had a few tests after that and the same problem came back on the Sunday of that week in training. “I had the procedure the following week. It took a little while to get over. There were some times there, two or three days, when I wondered whether I would carry on playing or not; is it worth it or not? But that quickly passed and I got back fit. I wanted to finish on my own terms so I was determined to get back fit. I’ve been training hard and we’ll see what happens.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"travel/2018/mar/18/norway-land-of-midnight-sun-northern-exposure-north-coast","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-18T07:00:01Z","webTitle":"Up all night in Norway: land of the midnight sun","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/mar/18/norway-land-of-midnight-sun-northern-exposure-north-coast","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2018/mar/18/norway-land-of-midnight-sun-northern-exposure-north-coast","fields":{"headline":"Up all night in Norway: land of the midnight sun","bodyText":"Midnight. Morning. A shard of sun cuts through the cloud. Due north, not east, from my lighthouse. Gulls scream below us as they circle Flatøy fyr, our uninhabited island near Nordskot, northern Norway. We are on our own here for a few days, just me and the photographer Howard Sooley. We are 300km inside the Arctic Circle. Standing on top of the world. I have been getting up around dawn for a year or more, absorbing the daybreak and recording it. I am writing a book, a manifesto for morning, about why it means so much to me, the change from night to light, making time to be (by) yourself. So I’ve come north for the summer solstice to see if there can be dawn without dark, if morning needs the night-time at all. The last time I was in Nordskot it was Arctic winter. Dimmed daylight only from 11am until 2pm. In this small coastal community nestled into mountains, winter sun never reaches the horizon. The only way to see it is out at sea. People wait on the quay, anxiously ask after it like looking for a lost child. But now it is midsummer in the land of midnight sun. For months, the sun will never set. So we are here for the empty islands and the lighthouse and endless days without night. Except, of course, it is raining, cold and cloudy. There is still snow and almost no sunlight at midnight and I am very tired and wet. We’ve just arrived in a small open boat, freezing water soaking us. We walk up through a bog cotton meadow, the seed heads lit like Einstein’s hair. We drink whisky on a cliff facing the near north pole. It has been a long journey, we have had to carry a week of water up the lighthouse tower. Bed calls from our wooden cabins. But there are no sheets to add to no running water, my duvet’s torn and smells of fish. It is our fault, we forgot to ask. Sleep is elusive. My lace curtains are useless. North-country Norwegians are tough, to be seen out fixing their houses in the middle of the night, manically making the most of the short summer. It is bright at 3am and I wake at 4am wondering whether here was such a good idea. Then I look out and see a sea eagle, standing 20ft away, profiled like a carving. It stretches huge wings and takes a long, lazy loop around the island. My concerns fly away. Over the next days, we unwind. The landscape is almost too perfect, the colours of the clovers too pink, the silvers of the birch almost blue. It is an ozone thing I think. Everywhere is undisturbed, the growing miniaturised like a Japanese garden. It is almost prehistoric, an insight into a world before or after man. We catch fish from the quay. It is almost too easy. We hook a stunning golden cod, shiny like a coin. We release it but keep some silvered pollock. We eat them in the lantern room, our 360-degree high window on the world. We walk, we watch, we absorb astonishing light. We become saturated with 24-hour sun. But we are feeling the need for baths, bigger beds and better blinds so transfer to Villa Haugen, 20 minutes back by open boat to the neighbouring island of Grøtøya. We wallow in good food, good showers and sheets. Haugen is a luxury boutique hotel near to Nordskot, now owned by an oil executive. It was once home to the richest woman in northern Norway, her fortune built on skrei, migratory cod on their 1,000-mile journey to the Lofoten islands near here. Hundreds of ships would wait for them in the harbour. We cook dinners on the beach from fish caught from the hotel boat. These are pristine waters still teaming with cod, home to fields of queen scallops swimming like monarch butterflies. Just don’t expect Roddie Sloan, the lone diver in the area, to tell you where. He supplies Noma and like all good fishermen guards his secrets deep. But there are brown trout in the lakes, sea trout in the rivers. There are wild orchids in the woods. It is the definition of unspoilt. Every night (if there is such a thing, I am beginning to wonder), we sit late by the barbecue, watching savage Arctic skuas and an array of eagles. The sun never drops. Perhaps it stops for a moment, levels, then starts (you think) to rise. At around 2am, the small birds sing, a dawn chorus with a less obvious dawn. It may be more obviously morning than moments before. It is almost bipolar the effect of polar light; you sleep but in short shifts, feel almost manic in the morning, lit by an urgency of time. I am unsure that I could do well for too long in the endless days and nights. The last time I was here I saw northern lights staining the white mountains, greening the clear fjords, the sky dancing to a symphony I couldn’t quite hear. This time I came in search of dawn: could it exist without night? Could dawn be an idea, almost a philosophical thought? How would the birds know when to sing, flowers when to bloom, people when to wake? I came away with answers I am unsure I yet understand. Science will tell you the sun is up all day, that it rises at the same time it sets. But you feel a shift as the new day inhales and the old day fails. Breathe deep in this empty world of endless days, almost untouched seas and beaches, an almost abandoned lighthouse. It is a place to wander in wonder, to find your peace in quiet.

This popular sporting event in the capital has been going strong since 1993. You can run 5k, 10k or a half-marathon. This year it’s being held on the summer solstice, 21 June, when daylight lasts almost a full 24 hours; the sun sets after midnight and rises before 3am. The race starts late in the evening, near Laugardalslaug, one of Reykjavík’s geothermal pools. After your run, you can enjoy a dip in one of the hot tubs and steam baths in the early hours – all in broad daylight of course. marathon.is/midnight-run Svalbard, Norway One of the world’s northernmost inhabited areas, Svalbard is an archipelago between the north pole and mainland Norway. From late April until August the sun doesn’t set at all and hangs instead just above the horizon which makes it an ideal time to see the polar bears. The all-night visibility increases your chances of spotting them, and the archipelago begins to melt, making it easier to navigate by boat. naturalworldsafaris.com St Petersburg, Russia From late May until July, St Petersburg is bathed in an all-night luminous light known as the White Nights. Understandably the switch from dark and freezing winter nights into extended daylight is something to celebrate – which is why St Petersburg’s White Nights festival came into being. It’s a month of cultural events ending with the Scarlet Sails: the biggest annual public gathering in Russia, including a mock pirate battle in the harbour and an extravagant firework display. wnfestival.com"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"football/blog/2018/mar/21/the-joy-of-six-football-loan-deals","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-21T12:23:08Z","webTitle":"The Joy of Six: football loan deals","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/mar/21/the-joy-of-six-football-loan-deals","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2018/mar/21/the-joy-of-six-football-loan-deals","fields":{"headline":"The Joy of Six: football loan deals","bodyText":"1) George Haworth (Accrington to Blackburn Rovers, 1885) In December 1884 Blackburn announced a deal had been struck for them to field Haworth, Accrington’s captain, in that season’s FA Cup. He would continue to play league fixtures for his parent club, or anyone else who wanted to borrow a decent defender (he also played a bit for Preston that season). But before their quarter-final against West Brom, something happened. The finer details are hard to ascertain but it seems the club hadn’t joined the British Football Association, which was trying to force them to do so by blocking the Haworth deal. Rovers set off with a weakened team, won 2-0 and – still without Haworth – then thumped Old Carthusians in the semi-final. But, with Scottish side Queen’s Park awaiting in the final, they were desperate for Haworth’s help at Kennington Oval. So desperate, in fact, that according to the Manchester Weekly News they “sacrificed any pride by begging permission to enlist the services of that grand player.” Athletic News said they “made themselves ridiculous before the football community”, before eventually striking a deal. According to the Sportsman, Haworth “proved himself to be one of the grandest half-backs that we remember seeing”. As the match progressed, thousands of people congregated outside the Blackburn offices of the Preston Herald, where the latest scores would be posted in the window as soon as word from London arrived – as close as the 19th century came to a liveblog. The final score was 2-0. Haworth won the Cup with Blackburn and was named Accrington’s player of the season. SB 2) Manny Omoyinmi (West Ham to Gillingham, 1999) Omoyinmi arrived at Gillingham, with a view to a £400,000 permanent move, and had an immediate impact. He scored the winner at home to Oldham on his debut, repeated the feat at Oxford in his next game, and got the first in a 2-1 win at Brentford, who had gone unbeaten in their previous 26 games. But then, after seven league starts and a couple more in an emphatic two-legged League Cup defeat by Bolton, he was called back to West Ham and flung on to the bench. Finally, in mid-December, the lifelong Hammers fan got the opportunity he had dreamed of, replacing Paulo Wanchope for the final eight minutes of extra-time as his side knocked Aston Villa out of the League Cup on penalties. But he’d already played in the competition for the Gills, which led to the match being replayed (West Ham lost, inevitably) and Omoyinmi being immediately and permanently cold-shouldered by Harry Redknapp. “The manager hasn’t spoken to me since it happened and it has been made out to be all my fault,” he said, when the club announced he would be released. “All I ever wanted to do was play for this club, and it has all gone wrong.” SB 3) DJ Campbell (Leicester City to Blackpool, 2010) The Football League show on the BBC was great. No adverts, slick presenting by Manish Bhasin and you didn’t even have to change the channel after Match of the Day. Sadly it ended in 2015, but not before inspiring Campbell to rejoin Blackpool on loan in 2010. “It’s odd but I was watching the Beeb’s show last Saturday night” Campbell said. “For some reason my mate said ‘just go back to Blackpool’, and I said I wanted to. Then at the exact moment, the lady on the TV said they had just had an email from a guy in Blackpool saying: ‘Sign DJ Campbell.’ The way that happened was crazy really, fate I guess.” Campbell swiftly went about fuelling Blackpool’s promotion push: eight goals in their final 12 matches helped pip Swansea to sixth. A daunting play-off against Nottingham Forest awaited, but a wonderful assist by a young Séamus Coleman and Charlie Adam’s penalty – won by Campbell – gave Blackpool a slender first-leg lead. Forest hadn’t conceded at home for more than 12 hours going into the second leg, but Campbell’s hat-trick sent the Seasiders to Wembley, where they would beat Cardiff. Campbell made his loan permanent and finished their Premier League season as top scorer, but will always be remembered for that night in Nottingham. MB 4) Uwe Fuchs (Kaiserslautern to Middlesbrough, 1995) Bryan Robson signed the 6ft 2in Fuchs on the advice of former England team-mate Tony Woodock, saying “in Germany they call him a typical English centre-forward.” As Middlesbrough fan Harry Pearson wrote in the Guardian, those were ”words which are to football what the phrase ‘contains mechanically reclaimed meat’ is to fine dining,” yet for a few magical months Boro’s fans took Fuchs hungrily to their hearts. It wasn’t just his goals that endeared him to fans – there were rumours of a romance with Jet from Gladiators and tales of his quirky foreign habits became the subject of fevered debate. He liked, for example, to warm down after a match with six laps of the pitch – “I used to warm down with several pints of lager,” sniffed former Boro midfielder Gary Gill. But then, suddenly, it was over: he was sent off against Sheffield United – “There have been some excellent foreign imports to this country, but Fuchs is a disgrace,” raged Dave Bassett – and suspended for the season’s final game. Bryan Robson declined to trigger a £500,000 pre-agreed permanent fee and he ended up moving to, and being rubbish for, Millwall. SB 5) Osvaldo Ardiles (Tottenham to Paris St-Germain, 1982) On 2 April 1982 Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands. The following day Tottenham beat Leicester 2-0 in the FA Cup but every time Ardiles, their Argentinian midfielder, touched the ball the crowd booed. “It’s incredibly sad how these countries I love could be at war against each other,” he told Spurs’ kit man, Roy Reyland. On 4 April he flew home, and did not return for eight months. As the conflict rumbled on and the player – whose cousin José, a fighter pilot, was shot down over the Falklands and killed – announced he “could never play soccer again in England unless relations between our two countries improve dramatically” it became clear his immediate future lay outside London. “And that’s when Paris St-Germain came in for me. I thought: ‘Paris is nice.’ And off I went,” wrote Ardiles in his autobiography. Sadly, however, “my football there was lamentable. There’s no other word for it.” By the end of 1982 the conflict was over, and Ardiles returned to England. His friend, team-mate and compatriot Ricky Villa had remained throughout and Ardiles received a warm welcome. “The English are used to these sorts of conflicts,” Villa said. “Throughout their history they’ve taken control of lands that aren’t theirs, so they’re more experienced than us with this kind of issue.” SB 6) Fernando Morientes (Real Madrid to Monaco, 2003) Morientes was in his prime, and Real Madrid didn’t want him. Three times a Champions League winner, Morientes was not deemed Galáctico enough by Florentino Pérez and after a loan deal with Schalke collapsed and Monaco’s star striker Shabani Nonda suffered a season-ending injury, Morientes joined the Ligue 1 side and was prolific. Real had been so keen for Morientes to join Monaco that they’d waived various clauses to get the deal done. Naturally, in the Champions League quarter-finals, Monaco were drawn against Madrid, and Morientes played against his parent club. With Monaco trailing 4-1 at the Bernabéu, Morientes rose above five defenders to plant a header past Iker Casillas. Two weeks later, Monaco won the second leg 3-1 – Morientes again scoring a sensational header from Patrice Evra’s cross – to win the tie on away goals. Morientes scored home and away against Chelsea in the semi-finals and after defeat by Porto in the final he returned to Madrid as the competition’s top scorer. But following Michael Owen’s arrival, Morientes never scored again for Madrid and left for Liverpool in January 2005.

This could have been one of the great nights for this club and, very nearly, it was. Instead, it became a harrowing reminder they have much to learn at this level and, having thrown it away, they might just have to accept the allegations of naivety that come their way. Any analysis should take into account that, over two legs, Mauricio Pochettino’s side played some exhilarating attacking football against nine‑times finalists, scored three times against a side that had not conceded a Serie A goal since December and were still ploughing forward in those heart-stopping moments when Harry Kane’s 90th-minute header came off the turf, thudded against the post and was hacked off the goal-line. Ultimately, though, the night swung on a spell in the second half when Gonzalo Higuaín and Paulo Dybala both scored within three minutes of one another to turn the game upside-down and maroon Spurs 4-3 behind on aggregate. And if there is one thing we know about the Italian champions, with all that rich experience in their backline, it is that they know how to defend a one‑goal lead. As much as Spurs will be accused of blowing it, Massimiliano Allegri and his players deserve enormous credit given there are statistics to show that only 17% of sides qualify in Champions League knockout ties when they have drawn 2-2 in the home leg. Juve had to do it the hard way, with Son Heung-min scoring first on 39 minutes, and in the process they needed to demonstrate all the knowhow that has helped them reach two of the previous three finals. Yet this was not just a victory for their powers of endurance. They had shown from the start that they were willing to attack in numbers and it was a marvellous piece of forward play from Higuaín to put in Dybala for the winning goal. The left-footed finish was not too bad, either. Spurs could argue that Andrea Barzagli, the defender who made that late goal-line clearance, ought to have been sent off in the first half for bringing down his studs on Son’s thigh and then, just for good measure, doing the same again while expertly feigning an apology. Barzagli, two months shy of his 37th birthday, had worked out early on that Son had the beating of him and carried out the assault with the air of a man who was not willing to tolerate younger, quicker opponents showing him up. Uefa may decide to take disciplinary action. Yet the Spurs inquest should start with themselves because the reality is that, even before the second-half collapse, there were tell-tale signs that the home team had the capability to make life difficult for themselves. That impression was hardened, for example, when the game was still goalless and Douglas Costa accelerated past Jan Vertonghen into the penalty area before the Spurs player made the mistake of diving in against an opponent he could not catch. It was a clear penalty and bewildering, to say the least, that the various match officials all gave Vertonghen the benefit of the doubt, particularly when the Champions League employs an additional assistant referee behind the perimeter line of the penalty area. These assistants do not appear to do a great amount and, in different circumstances, Juve could conceivably have left Wembley complaining that the relevant one here had a perfect view of the infringement. At 0-0, it felt like a huge let-off and when Son opened the scoring it seemed even more that Vertonghen’s luck was in. Kane, Christian Eriksen and Dele Alli were all involved in the goal. Alli had the first chance but Barzagli’s sliding tackle diverted the ball outside the penalty area. Kieran Trippier turned it back in and Son had the good fortune of striking the shot against his standing foot before the ball looped in, almost in slow motion. Ahead 3-2 on aggregate, Spurs were through unless they conceded twice and surely ought to have changed the tempo of the match to prevent it being so open. That did not mean they had to adopt ultra-defensive tactics, or halt their ambitions for another goal, but there could have been a better mix between attack and defence and it was easy in the final half an hour to see which team were veterans of this competition and which had been in the quarter-finals only once before. Juve’s recovery began in the 64th minute when the substitute Stephan Lichtsteiner crossed from the right, Sami Khedira headed the ball on and Higuaín reacted at the far post to add the decisive touch with an angled volley beyond Hugo Lloris. Three minutes later, Dybala was racing behind an uneven backline to drive the ball past Lloris and the speed at which the game had swung in Juve’s favour was frightening. It took a while for Spurs to shake their heads clear but they did rouse themselves for a late onslaught. Kane’s header was their best chance but he will also reflect on a first-half effort that went into the side netting, having taken the ball wide of Buffon. And though Son played with tremendous energy, his list of misses was even more extensive. Spurs were out and the manner of their exit will hurt immeasurably."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"society/2018/may/12/rise-in-drug-arrests-among-teenagers-prompts-county-lines-concerns","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-12T07:16:28Z","webTitle":"Rise in drug arrests among teenagers prompts 'county lines' concerns","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/may/12/rise-in-drug-arrests-among-teenagers-prompts-county-lines-concerns","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/may/12/rise-in-drug-arrests-among-teenagers-prompts-county-lines-concerns","fields":{"headline":"Rise in drug arrests among teenagers prompts 'county lines' concerns","bodyText":"There has been a sharp rise in the number of arrests of teenagers for drug dealing, prompting concern about young people being groomed to work as drug mules in so-called county lines operations. Data obtained by the Guardian through freedom of information requests shows that the number of arrests of under-18s for possession with intent to supply and supplying drugs rose by 28% between 2013 and 2017, from 1,639 to 2,097. The figures are drawn from data supplied by 24 police forces. Five forces provided figures for under-16s, which showed that arrests in this age group almost doubled, from 157 to 312, over the same period. Arrests for drug dealing have fallen overall, from 24,022 to 23,022 across all age groups. County lines drug trading, also known as “going country” or OT (out there), involves urban gangs moving class A drugs and cash between inner-city hubs and provincial areas. Young people are recruited by dealers who groom them and offer them money to sell drugs in out-of-town locations. The figures show children as young as 12 are being arrested for possession with intent to supply heroin and crack cocaine. Areas that saw the biggest rise in the number of arrests included Norfolk, Devon, and Dorset. In Norfolk the number rose from 29 in 2013 to 121 last year. Paul Sanford, a Norfolk assistant chief constable, said: “Norfolk Constabulary has been focused on disrupting and preventing county lines drug dealing in our local towns and villages since December 2016 when we launched Operation Gravity. Since then a total of 578 people have been arrested.” Simon Harding, a senior lecturer in criminology at the University of West London, said the data showed the challenges posed by county lines drug trading. “Young people are recruited by dealers who … will give them a bag of £500 cash and £500 worth of drugs and a zombie knife and send them to a seaside or provincial town to set up and start dealing,” he said. Another expert, Paul Andell, a senior lecturer in criminology at the University of Suffolk, said the figures could point to a crackdown by the police on county lines trading. “That is good news. It’s what we do after the arrests [that is important] – how do we work with these young people?” Junior Smart, the founder of the SOS gangs project in London, said arresting young people was not the answer. “Any action that criminalises a child should concern everybody. Where in the hierarchy are these young people? These kids on the street corners [dealing] are not the ones bringing in drugs in the first instance. The people creating the drugs market are still where they are,” he said. DS Ken Lamont, of Devon police, said county lines trading was a contributing factor in the rise in arrests of young people for drug dealing but improvements in collecting data also played a role. “At the moment I wouldn’t say [county lines trading] is endemic but it’s certainly a problem and we have done significant disruptions,” he said. Forces could not tackle it alone and needed partners in health, education, and housing to work together, he added. Lamont noted that dealers often adapted to avoid detection. “Because of our success around cuckooing [where an address is taken over for dealing] … people are booking hotel rooms [to deal from].” In November last year the National Crime Agency (NCA) said the county lines drug trade was out of control and its officers had identified more than 700 operations. Rhiannon Sawyer, the The Children’s Society area manager for children and young people’s services in Greater London, said her staff had noticed that more 12-year-olds were being targeted to deal drugs. “They are more vulnerable as they are younger and the rise is significant enough to get us worried about it,” she said. “The level of violence [around county lines drug trading] is getting worse, so all over the country there have been lots of stabbings, rape, and children being held down and drugs are being forced inside their vagina or anus so they can carry it.” In London, arrests among under-18s rose from 754 to 904 between 2013 and 2017. The Met police said: “Drugs are now, more than ever, easier for young people to access due to the increased use of mobile phone applications and social media platforms.” Jude Jubey, a co-founder of Youth Ink, a London-based organisation that helps young people on the margins of society, said: “The number of young people arrested is going up and I believe the reason for this is there is more demand for class A drugs. “The best approach would be to make young people aware of the outcomes of when you get involved in the drug trade as some think it is an easy way to make money and end up in debt and bad things happen.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/shortcuts/2018/mar/07/gucci-shoot-harry-styles-st-albans-hiring-house-business","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-07T17:49:53Z","webTitle":"Right plaice, right time: the fish bar that netted £20K for a Gucci shoot with Harry Styles","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/shortcuts/2018/mar/07/gucci-shoot-harry-styles-st-albans-hiring-house-business","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/shortcuts/2018/mar/07/gucci-shoot-harry-styles-st-albans-hiring-house-business","fields":{"headline":"Right plaice, right time: the fish bar that netted £20K for a Gucci shoot with Harry Styles","bodyText":"Gucci reportedly paid £20,000 for Harry Styles to have a bag of chips at a chip shop in St Albans. The pop star, in pinstripe suit and pink socks, was seen filming an ad for the fashion brand there, and the owner let slip his supersize fee. It highlights how even ordinary spaces can be attractive to a location scout for a film or ad. Rates vary, but filming, say, a furniture ad in a semi could bring in upwards of £1,500, according to Michelle Shashoua, co-founder of agency Fresh Locations. “Some homes could be double or three times that. “It’s got to be worthwhile to the owner,” she says. “It is a lot of disruption, not only to the owners but also to their neighbours.” A film shoot “is not to be underestimated. It’s a minimum of 30 people and 12 hours for an ad, and they will need the run of your house.” For a feature film, it could be more. A business would have to shut down for the day. “If people have to work from home that day, it’s whatever’s worthwhile [to the business]. Usually, it will be upwards of £3,000 a day for an office.” A local cafe could cost about £2,000, but it depends on the shoot. “A high-end beauty or fashion brand, involving a high-profile model or celebrity, could stretch to around £15,000 for a well-known restaurant, and if you are dealing with a hotel, it could be between £15,000 and £30,000 a day.” Some organisations have their own prices, depending on who is paying. Network Rail, for instance, charges a £7,000 day rate (plus staff costs, such as electricians and security staff) for shooting a commercial on its property, and upwards of £11,000 for a feature film. The Royal Parks also has its own rates, with large shoots costing about £6,000 a day. A smaller park or garden, run by a council or charity, “might be quite happy to do it for a lot less,” says Shashoua. She once used a community allotment for a fashion brand for £700. Despite the disruption, Shashoua points out, having your shop/cafe/chippy made famous in a film shoot “can drive business”. The owner of the St Albans chip shop could look forward to years of Styles’ fans’ pilgrimages for a saveloy and chips."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/mar/10/five-star-hotel-joey-essex","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-10T11:00:11Z","webTitle":"Five Star Hotel: shiny teeth, handsy pillocks and hostile hospitality","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/mar/10/five-star-hotel-joey-essex","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/mar/10/five-star-hotel-joey-essex","fields":{"headline":"Five Star Hotel: shiny teeth, handsy pillocks and hostile hospitality","bodyText":"To the Greek island of Ios for Five Star Hotel (Monday, 10pm, E4) in which five “celebrities” are charged with the task of running a luxury hotel complete with living, breathing guests. Never let it be said that reality TV doesn’t bring with it the crucial element of jeopardy. The hotel is owned by “international hotelier hotshot” Mario Armani, whose name may or may not be made up. “What I don’t know about running a hotel isn’t worth knowing,” he crows, while handing over his business to a bunch of nitwits whose life’s ambition is for their teeth to shine more brightly than the North Star. Alarm bells start ringing when it becomes clear that both the hotel and the programme share the same name. This makes the former a dead loss for a Google search and the latter a clear case of wishful thinking, “star” being a relative term in the realms of lowest-common-denominator TV. Our newly anointed hoteliers include Spencer Matthews (dim-bulb brother-in-law of Pippa Middleton), Geordie Shore’s Holly Hagan (surgically enhanced party girl), Towie’s Lydia Bright (nominative determinism fail) and ex-footballer Ashley Cain (creep). Bringing up the rear is Joey Essex, the eternally bemused realitybot who, famed for being unable to tell the time, has carved a career out of similarly epic displays of idiocy. At various stages of their holiday, guests will rate the performance of their amateur hosts. Those with the lowest star rating – see what they did there? – will be catapulted back to their agent’s office where they will immediately draw up plans for their next televisual outing. Here, Joey is given the job of bellboy but the responsibility proves too much. Witnessing him trying to steer guests’ luggage is like watching a blobfish trying to master a Rubik’s cube. Undeterred, he joins the new front-of-house manager Spencer, now stuffily attired in a Butlins-style blazer, to welcome arriving guests. They do this in the manner of Crufts judges checking the haunches of a pedigree bichon frise. Uber-tanned 20-year-old identical twins Georgie and Charlie render the two hosts slack-jawed with lust. Back on luggage duty, it takes Joey 40 minutes to locate their room, which is less than a minute away. Once there, he realises he hasn’t brought a key. “I forgot to get it from reception,” he groans. “That’s not my job. I’m a ball boy. What am I? Ball boy? Bellboy? … I think we should go and lay by the pool.” While Lydia is put in charge of the bar, Ashley sets about hitting on every woman within a two-mile radius under the guise of organising a beach party. “I want you to be my VIPs,” he oozes, working his way along the sun loungers. In normal circumstances, Ashley would be hauled back to the manager’s office and dispatched to scrub some toilets as punishment. But, this being reality TV, handsy pillocks get extra screen time for their efforts. Five Star Hotel is cerebrum-melting stuff, the telly equivalent of locking children in a school to see how long it takes for them to burn the place down. In this case, the sooner it goes up in flames the better. Truly, we get the entertainment we deserve."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/2018/mar/07/lizzie-deignan-equal-pay-womens-tour-cycling","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-07T16:30:02Z","webTitle":"Lizzie Deignan welcomes equal pay for riders competing in Women’s Tour","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/07/lizzie-deignan-equal-pay-womens-tour-cycling","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/mar/07/lizzie-deignan-equal-pay-womens-tour-cycling","fields":{"headline":"Lizzie Deignan welcomes equal pay for riders competing in Women’s Tour","bodyText":"Riders competing in the Women’s Tour in June will for the first time receive the same prize money as their male counterparts in the Tour of Britain. The sponsor of both races, OVO Energy, has increased the women’s prize fund from €35,000 to €90,000 in order to establish financial parity. The general classification winner of both races will receive €14,600, with both male and female stage winners also taking home the same amount. Britain’s Lizzie Deignan, who won the Women’s Tour in 2016, said: “I’m so excited about the Women’s Tour; the race is the pinnacle of women’s professional road cycling in the UK and it’s an important step to offer equal prize money to the comparative men’s race. “To be honest I wish gender parity wasn’t an issue in cycling. I think I speak on behalf of most women in the peloton when I say I just want to get on and compete and be recognised fairly for what we do. So this support means we can now focus on playing our part in an amazing race.” In the five years since the Women’s Tour began in 2014 it has gradually moved towards equality. The belief has always been women should be entitled to the same prize money and logistical backup – such as hotel accommodation – as their male counterparts. Emma Pooley, the Olympic time trial silver medallist in 2008, said: “There’s been a long campaign for parity in cycling, and I strongly believe women’s racing should be moving towards equal racing opportunities and equal media coverage. The Women’s Tour is already leading the way and a major step to addressing the imbalance in cycling’s economy is equal prize funds for high‑quality races. “Women’s cycling has a huge amount to offer fans and sponsors alike and I believe it will further inspire more women to ride bikes.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/mar/07/mps-from-all-sides-call-for-abortion-law-in-n-ireland-to-be-relaxed","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-07T17:55:54Z","webTitle":"MPs from all sides call for abortion law in N Ireland to be relaxed","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/07/mps-from-all-sides-call-for-abortion-law-in-n-ireland-to-be-relaxed","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/mar/07/mps-from-all-sides-call-for-abortion-law-in-n-ireland-to-be-relaxed","fields":{"headline":"MPs from all sides call for abortion law in N Ireland to be relaxed","bodyText":"More than 100 MPs and peers from all parties have written to the home secretary, Amber Rudd, calling for women in Northern Ireland to be allowed access to abortion services locally rather than having to come to England. The letter, signed by 131 parliamentarians including eight Conservatives such as the former education secretary Justine Greening and the former chancellor Ken Clarke, the former Liberal leader David Steel and the shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, follows a UN declaration that forcing women to travel for an abortion is an infringement of their human rights. With the government advertising its support for women’s rights ahead of International Women’s Day on Thursday, the timing of the letter is likely to be embarrassing. The Conservatives govern in alliance with the DUP, which opposes abortion. Abortion is allowed in Northern Ireland only if a woman’s life is at risk or there is a serious or permanent risk to her mental health. Rape, incest and fatal foetal abnormalities are not seen as valid reasons for termination. Last month the UN committee on the elimination of discrimination against women (Cedaw) said thousands of women and girls in Northern Ireland faced “systematic violations of rights through being compelled to either travel outside Northern Ireland to procure a legal abortion or to carry their pregnancy to term”. Stella Creasy, the Labour MP for Walthamstow, said the scale and cross-party nature of support for the change should force the government’s hand. “We have heard talk of the importance of regulatory alignment between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK but that concern does not seem to extend to the basic human right of not to be forced to continue an unwanted pregnancy,” she told the Guardian. “The UN ruling is clear that forcing women to travel to seek an abortion is not acceptable. It’s time for all who say they support gender equality to put their votes and their voices where their marching is and back this call for progress.” The letter, sent late on Wednesday, urges Rudd and the government to bring in legislation to allow equal access to abortion. Campaigners believe the law could be changed in the forthcoming domestic violence bill. Women and girls in Northern Ireland can face sentences of up to life in prison for accessing a service that is provided on the NHS in England and Wales for free. The letter cites the experience of one woman given a three-month prison sentence, suspended for two years, for self-inducing an abortion in 2016 because she could not afford the cost of travel to England and the expense of a private procedure. A woman being prosecuted for purchasing abortion pills for her 15-year-old daughter is currently awaiting trial. Last year the Home Office introduced funding for women and girls from Northern Ireland to access abortion in England free of charge and to avail of a means-tested travel bursary. It is understood that between July and February, 474 people did so. In its statement in February, Cedaw said that due to the “heavy financial, emotional and logistical burden”, travel was not always viable. Its report made 13 recommendations, including the repeal of the criminal sanction on abortion contained in the 1861 Offences Against the Person Act. One of the recommendations was that terminations should be allowed in cases of sexual crime and fatal foetal abnormality and where there is a threat to a woman’s health, without “permanency” being a condition. In a previous response to Creasy on the issue, Rudd, who added responsibility for women and equalities to her brief this year, has argued that the UN’s Istanbul convention does not distinguish between abortions close to home and further away."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}
