The ideas and methods of that school of thought, and those currents of research which accept its intellectual hegemony within the economics discipline (behavioural economics, game theory, etc) should undoubtedly be part of any curriculum taught to economics students today. What is objectionable in the standpoint of such adherents of this dominant school of thought, however, is the doctrine that there are “no schools of thought in economics”, by which they mean, of course, that there is no other school of thought apart from their own. This idea – absurd as it appears to anyone who follows discussions on economic issues in the media and public life – has unfortunately become reality in the economics department of UCL and all too many other universities today, due to the ruthless exploitation by the dominant orthodoxy of its freedom to appoint and promote academic staff. A particularly objectionable outcome of this is that UCL's economics department now prides itself on providing a curriculum to undergraduates that avoids “confusing” them by exposing them to the very idea that there are other schools apart from that of the orthodoxy. This is indoctrination, not education, and it is particularly mortifying that such a situation should have been allowed to occur at UCL, an institution established with radical intent by its founders, and even today proclaiming its dedication to the encouragement of critical thought. Dr Hugh Goodacre Former member of the academic board, and teaching fellow in the department of economics, University College London • Professor Orazio Attanasio and others defend use of unrealistic assumptions in economics: “The London tube map is not realistic and makes absurd assumptions. If it did not it would be illegible and useless. The map is useful precisely because it abstracts from unnecessary details to show you the way.” Yes, indeed, the tube map is great so long as you travel by tube. But if there is a tube strike and you have to make your way on foot, its unrealistic assumptions will lead you astray. The same problem arises with economic models based on unrealistic assumptions. They may forecast very well in a limited context (economists call this “restricted domain”). But outside that limited context (ie “unrestricted domain”), a model based on unrealistic assumptions will, sooner or later, go wrong. This is why unorthodox economists get so agitated about the use of unrealistic assumptions in mainstream economics. Peter Swann Beeston, Nottinghamshire • In their letter attacking Larry Elliott’s critique of neoclassical economics (A modern-day Martin Luther really nails it: economics needs a Reformation of its own, 18 December), my esteemed colleagues completely miss the point of his argument. He does not critique economic expertise per se, but only that of those who adhere to the neoclassical (“orthodox”) paradigm and thus typically assume that it, and it alone, has a monopoly on truth. Elliott’s argument is that it is precisely the truth claims of neoclassical economists and their systematic exclusion of all other economic expertise (through faculty hiring practices and degree curricula that fail to acknowledge the importance of alternative – heterodox – conceptions) that is dangerous. Indeed, history has shown it to be so on numerous occasions over many years when neoclassically legitimated policies have devastated the livelihoods (and sometimes the lives) of millions of people across the globe. But what do I know? I am merely an economic sociologist who studies actually existing capitalist economies (rather than idealised versions of them), in their historical provenance and with their complex social, cultural and political asymmetries: the “unnecessary details”, as your correspondents would have it. But let me leave the last word to a bona fide (though heterodox) economist, Neil Kay. In his book, The Emergent Firm, he comments: “the individual intent on pursuing a career as an economist has to be bright enough to understand the abstract ramifications of neoclassical theory, and dumb enough to have faith in them.” Jeffrey Henderson Professor of international development, University of Bristol • The august bunch of professors who objected to Larry Elliott’s view of them seem to have missed a rather obvious point. The mathematical models and “vast amounts of data” were of no use to them, or us, in 2007. Indeed one of the very few people who sounded warning bells about the overheating economy was Gillian Tett of the Financial Times, someone who is obliged by her job to exist in the real world rather than the dusty portals of academe. Do you really need complicated models to work out that if the 100% mortgages that helped cause the economy to crash in 1990 then became 125% under New Labour you would probably see a very damaging correction at some point? Or that if Nigel Lawson’s financial sector remained unreformed you would likely see more banking and financial scandals like the Barings, BCCI and pension mis-selling scandals that occurred before 1990? No wonder economics students up and down the country are protesting about these precious models having little connection with life outside the lecture room window. David Redshaw Gravesend, Kent • The attack by Professor Orazio Attanasio et al on Larry Elliott’s profound article misses the point and reaches again for the armoury of jargon which obfuscates the issues, even for other thinking people. Elliott’s “taking account of the complexity of markets, the constraints imposed by nature and rising inequality” challenges their academic and economic hegemony. Maybe Larry Elliott is thinking too deeply for them and gets to the heart the matter. The Austrian sociologist and economist Egon Matzner wrote that only idiots and economists believe that limitless growth is possible in a finite world. The late David Jenkins, former bishop of Durham, once told a meeting of the Edinburgh Fabian Society that believing in the markets was like believing in the Virgin Mary. So maybe August Strindberg hit the nail on the head when he wrote: “What is economics? A science invented by the upper class in order to acquire the fruits of the labour of the underclass.” How about a spot of social and ecological justice for 2018?

He begins by identifying the issue at the heart of all sexual harassment stories. “Power would still have won” had it not been for a technicality, Kettle says. Rather than examining why women’s experiences of harassment are being ignored and why Green would have been able to dismiss Kate Maltby’s “plausible” allegations – for which the Tory MP has now apologised – Kettle goes on to make the whole story about sex, not power. This conflation is also seen in the Cabinet Office investigation, Theresa May and Damian Green’s exchange of letters, and much of the coverage since – and it serves to trivialise the abuses that women in all workplaces suffer at the hands of more powerful men. Specifically, according to Kettle, Green was brought down by the fact that those looking for porn at work can often find porn to watch at work. Green is named as a “victim” of this access, pushing the idea that the Tory MP has been treated unfairly – that Green, hapless and manipulated, fell at the hands of the greater power (in this account porn; in others a young female journalist). In reality it was Green who held the position of dominance at every stage of this process – and he was fired from his job precisely for manipulating the truth. Too many in Westminster and the media – including those on the left – want to avoid talking about the power imbalance that underpins harassment. The Women’s Equality party will not duck that debate. Sophie Walker Leader of the Women’s Equality party • For the police to reveal confidential information about lawful activities of a politician infringes the latter’s right to privacy and probably cannot be justified. However, exposing that a cabinet minister is being untruthful is an exercise of freedom of speech in the public interest. Bringing legal proceedings for the second disclosure would not be in the public interest because it might deter others who wish to blow the whistle on impropriety.

When officers were sent to recover the dogs, the dead fox was found in the immediate area. An investigation is under way to identify the owners of the dogs and the circumstances in which the fox died. Elsewhere, officers in Cheshire said they were made aware of footage and reports of an illegal Boxing Day hunt in Allostock, near Knutsford. Cheshire police appealed for witnesses. A force spokesman said: “We are aware of footage and reports that an illegal hunt has taken place in Allostock and consequently detectives and rural and wildlife trained officers are investigating the allegations. In Suffolk, where it was claimed a fox was killed, officers issued a renewed appeal for witnesses after a disturbance broke out between members of the Great Thurlow hunt and observers.

Prices will continue to rise more than your pay for most of 2018 The cost of living is increasing at a near six-year high of 3.1%, having more than doubled during 2017, largely as a result of the fall in the value of the pound following the EU referendum in June 2016. Meanwhile, average wage growth is running at 2.3% (or 2.5% if you include bonuses) which means that real earnings are falling. Household energy costs, petrol and car insurance have been among the worst culprits for price rises. Most of the big energy companies hiked tariffs during the year, with British Gas adding 12% to electricity bills in August. This time last year the average price of petrol on Britain’s supermarket forecourts was 111.9p a litre, but now it’s 116.5p. There’s not much we can do about that, unfortunately, although most experts are expecting a flat or mildly falling oil market in 2018 as US shale production continues to rise, offsetting attempts by the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) to increase prices. Car insurance has rocketed by an average of £200 over the past five years, according to Comparethemarket.com. Between September and November 2012, the average motor insurance premium stood at £559, but today premiums for the same three months have reached an average of £758 – a rise of £199. After years of increases in insurance premium tax, 2018 is unlikely to see further hikes so the inflation rate in car insurance may finally begin to slow. Most economists expect the general price squeeze to continue through 2018, although there is some light at the end of the tunnel; the Bank of England is forecasting inflation to slip back to 2.4% by the end of 2018. Meanwhile, wage growth is expected to at least maintain its current rate, or moderately accelerate to above 2.5%, so Christmas 2018 could see the first recovery in real earnings for years. 2. Train fares will jump on Tuesday The bad news is that the first big price rise of 2018 is just days away: on Tuesday UK rail fares will rise by 3.4% – the largest increase for five years. The rise covers “regulated” fares such as season tickets and long-distance journeys. But other fares can be raised or dropped at the train operators’ discretion. The price of an off-peak trip from Preston to Manchester goes up 6.6% to £16 from £15, while a London to Slough off-peak ticket is increasing by 9% from £9.60 to £10.50. 3. Letting agency fees will (eventually) be abolished Tenants in England typically pay £404 every time they move, according to campaign group Generation Rent – and more than £800 in some parts of London. There can also be additional charges for tenants on low incomes and needing rent guarantors (at an average cost of £152), or simply needing to move in on a Saturday (an extra £62). But at some point in 2018 (the government has not given a precise date yet) England will follow Scotland and ban letting fees to tenants. Landlords threaten to retaliate with rent increases, but with a weak economy and lower pressure from migration, few experts reckon rents will rise by anything more than 0-1% in 2018. 4. Pensions will be the big money story of 2018 Many people could be in for a shock when they check their pay packet in April 2018. That’s because of a big change that will affect millions of people, who will see a bigger slice of their pay automatically diverted to a savings pot for their pension. Automatic enrolment went live in 2012 and but the total minimum amount paid in is currently just 2% of qualifying earnings – made up of 0.8% from the worker, 1% from the employer and 0.2% in tax relief. However, on 6 April this will rise to 5% – typically 2.4% from the worker, 2% from their employer and 0.6% in tax relief. In April 2019 the total increases again, to 8%. So, if you are an affected employee, how much might you – and your employer – have to pay into your pension? For someone on £20,000 a year, it means they will lose an extra £33 a month when they see their pay packet at the end of April 2018. Currently, they are contributing the minimum 1% of salary, which works out at £16.67 a month, including tax relief worth £3.33. From April, this will rise to £50 a month (with £10 of tax relief), then in April 2019 it will rise to £83.33 a month. Employers will also have to put in lots more. Expect the opt-out rate to rise in 2018 – and for employers to use their increased pension payments as an excuse not to give wage rises. 5. The state pension will rise, tax allowances improve, but council tax will go up From 6 April, pensioners entitled to the full new state pension (with a full 35-year record of NI contributions) will see their payments increase by £4.80 from £159.55 per week to £164.35 a week, which means there will be nearly £250 a year better off. The old basic state pension will rise from £123.30 a week to £125.95. On the same day the new personal tax rates will come into force, with the chief change an increase in the personal allowance – that part of your pay not liable for income tax. It will go up to £11,850, a £350 increase from the current level. In practice, it turns into a £70 saving for a basic rate taxpayer, as it means that £350 more of their income is not liable to 20% income tax. But much if not all of this will be taken up by potentially large increases in council tax. In a move slipped out just before Christmas, the government allowed local authorities to raise council tax by up to 5.99% next year. All councils will be able to raise council tax by up to 2.99% next year to fund local services, which is 1% more than this year. On top of this, 152 councils, which includes all London boroughs, unitary and metropolitan authorities and county councils, will be able to increase it by an additional “precept” 3% to fund social care services. 6. House price rises will slow to a dribble Most people, particularly first-time buyers, will welcome a pause in house price growth, with most of the experts predicting just 0-2% rises in property prices in 2018 – and falls in the capital. For the first time since the financial crisis, earnings are likely to rise faster than property prices. 7. Interest rates will rise, and the stock market will wobble Another 0.25% increase is expected in late spring, taking the Bank of England base rate to 0.75%. But unless the economy displays some unexpected perkiness, that should be the last rate rise of the year, so mortgage rates will stay low. In 2017 the FTSE 100 enjoyed a rise of nearly 500 points, or more than 6%. In Frankfurt, the Dax index surged 13%, while on Wall Street the gains were even higher, with the S&amp;P 500 advancing 18%. But after such a strong run – and with more interest rate hikes expected in the US – few believe 2018 will be anywhere near as good as 2017, with some predicting a major wobble in the market some time during the year. 8. The taxman will soon come knocking Maybe you were one of the 2,590 people who used Christmas Day to fill in their tax return. But for the others who didn’t, the 31 January deadline looms. If you are filing your 2016-17 return online for the first time, you will need to create a government gateway account if you haven’t already done so. Go to gov.uk/topic/personal-tax/self-assessment.

Still, he may prove successful: many doubted him when he arrived at Wednesday in 2015, and he started well there, reaching the play-offs in his first two seasons. But if he is to change things at the Liberty Stadium, he needs to do it immediately. After Saturday’s game at Watford, three of Swansea’s next four league games are against Tottenham Hotspur, Arsenal and Liverpool. If they do not beat the Hornets, they could soon be staring down the barrel of being shy of safety by double figures and of relegation looking even more inevitable than it does now. That new manager bounce needs to be pretty high. NM • Carvalhal says he is a ‘football romantic’ as he aims to keep Swansea up 2) Mourinho’s defensive inconsistencies In most of José Mourinho’s title-winning sides, you could have a pretty good stab at naming their starting defence. In his last full season at Chelsea, for example, two defenders played every game and another only missed five: the consistency in selection was a key part of their defensive solidity, which in turn was a key part of their success. That may be part of the problem with Manchester United: in 20 Premier League games this season Mourinho has fielded 12 different defensive combinations, and no back four (or five) has started more than three games together. Their overall defensive record is pretty good (16 conceded in 20) but this constant chopping and changing (partly forced upon him, partly his choice) was almost certainly a contributing factor to the concession of that late equaliser against Leicester, and of two early goals against Burnley. Mourinho’s best teams are built on the solid bricks of a reliable defence but, as United prepare to host Southampton in Saturday’s late kick-off, the foundation is more like a wobbling Jenga tower. NM • Paul Wilson: Mourinho has a point when he says United are not a big team • Mourinho says ‘£300m not enough’ for his side to compete 3) City would not be the same without Fernandinho How much you agree with Jamie Redknapp this week really depends on how long your list is. While Fernandinho might sneak into the top 50 signings made by Premier League clubs, he is not yet ready to be mentioned in the same breath as Frank Lampard, Cristiano Ronaldo or David Silva. However, that doesn’t mean the 32-year-old is not one of Pep Guardiola’s most important players – it is his tactical awareness and work ethic that gives his manager the confidence to field no other defensive-minded players in midfield. And if when Vincent Kompany gets injured, as at Newcastle? No problem, Fernandinho can slot in at centre-back, just as he did in the Manchester derby earlier this month. Selfless and versatile, he must be a dream to coach. While City will be expected to dominate Crystal Palace on Sunday, the London side’s threat on the counterattack is their greatest weapon with the pace of Zaha and Townsend, and Fernandinho’s presence will again be key. Redknapp’s comment is well wide of the mark but the Brazilian is certainly one of Manchester City’s best signings in the last 15-20 years. MB • Jacob Steinberg: City’s attacking intent too much for Newcastle 4) Can Stoke stop Azpilicueta and Morata? The most enjoyable attacking combinations to watch are often the ones that remain impossible to stop despite their predictability. It is no secret, for instance, that César Azpilicueta’s accurate deliveries from the inside-right channel have become a highly efficient weapon for Chelsea, but Brighton were still unable to stop the defender from creating Álvaro Morata’s goal with another accurate cross at Stamford Bridge on Boxing Day. The two Spaniards have developed a brilliant understanding on the pitch, with Azpilicueta providing the assist for six of Morata’s goals this season, and Stoke City will have to find a way to repel them – something Mark Hughes’s side were incapable of doing when Chelsea visited the Bet365 Stadium in September. JS • Sobhi earns Stoke vital point at Huddersfield 5) Fortune could favour Burnley if they are brave Given that Burnley were minutes away from securing a famous win at Old Trafford on Boxing Day, it does feel slightly unfair to ask whether they could make any tweaks to improve their away form. They have hardly been weak on their travels after all, picking up 16 points from 10 away games. Sean Dyche’s side have produced eye-catching performances at Stamford Bridge, Goodison Park, Anfield and Wembley, and only the top five boast better records than them this season. Yet Burnley are not the most prolific of teams and it is worth pointing out that they have scored only 11 goals on the road. Dyche tends to start with one striker but perhaps he can afford to be a bit more adventurous when Burnley visit Huddersfield. JS • Burnley denied victory at Old Trafford by Lingard 6) The sooner Wilshere gets a new Arsenal contract, the better Arsenal’s win at Crystal Palace was Jack Wilshere’s fourth successive league start for Arsenal – his best run in the side for four years. Alexis Sánchez scored twice but it was the Englishman who ran the game at Selhurst Park, dictating the play and calming things down when Palace equalised before an inch-perfect pass found the Chilean for Arsenal’s third. It is a pass he would never have tried a month ago, and evidence of the confidence that Wilshere is playing with. He feels important again, and he is, particularly when you look at the other central midfield options Wenger has at his disposal: Xhaka was again poor at Palace, Elneny and Coquelin don’t have the required skill set and Ramsey and Cazorla remain injured. All this means that Wilshere will again need to deliver at West Brom on Sunday. Wenger must keep Wilshere’s confidence high, the sooner Arsenal hand him a contract, the better. When he is on this type of form, Arsenal (or England) don’t have a better deep-lying playmaker.

The issue is whether is will be Dominic Calvert-Lewin in 2018, as Cenk Tosun’s impending £25m arrival on Merseyside will probably bump him to the Everton bench in the new year. The 20-year-old has had a fantastic breakthrough year for both club and country – even if goals have come harder to come by of late – but the onus is now on Calvert-Lewin to get on the scoresheet and remain at the forefront of Sam Allardyce’s mind. Saturday’s opponents, Bournemouth, are leaking goals at present – seven in the past two home games – and if Allardyce’s tactics are not too miserly, it is an ideal opportunity to cement his place as Everton’s No1 striker, at least until Tosun arrives. MB • Bolasie defends Allardyce over blunt Everton attack 8) Schmeichel’s chance of redemption There is no doubt that Kasper Schmeichel deserves to be regarded as one of the finest goalkeepers in the Premier League. The Dane was inspired when Leicester won the title and he was probably his team’s most impressive player in the Champions League last season. However he has experienced a slight dip in form in the past fortnight, leaving a big space for Christian Benteke to plant a central header past him in the 3-0 defeat by Palace, failing to reach Juan Mata’s stoppable free-kick in the 2-2 draw with Manchester United and scoring a sloppy own-goal against Watford on Boxing Day. It is far from a crisis but Leicester will need the 31-year-old to return to his reliable best at Anfield. JS • Paul Wilson: Van Dijk could start an era of reliable Liverpool rearguards • Liverpool agree world-record £75m fee for Southampton defender 9) Benítez putting his eggs in one Brighton basket After Newcastle’s fantastic win at West Ham, in which Rafa Benítez was rewarded for fielding an attacking side, it must have been desperately disappointing for fans to see the Spaniard revert to a conservative approach against Manchester City – the home side had onlu 23% possession (Nicolás Otamendi alone completed more passes than the 13 Newcastle players). By leaving Christian Atsu and Matt Ritchie – his two most creative wide players, who were decisive at the London Stadium – on the bench against the league leaders, Benítez appeared to write off the City game on Wednesday to make sure they are at their strongest against Brighton on Saturday, a much more winnable home game. Three points against Chris Hughton’s side and that logic will be justified, but anything else and Benítez’s tactics and selection should be questioned. Home form is crucial in any relegation battle but United have now lost five consecutive home matches – the first time since 1953 – and they can ill-afford another St James’ defeat. MB • Newcastle sunk by Sterling’s strike for City 10) A fine fixture mess While not all of them are likely to publish articles on their websites about it, some clubs have been left with some curious gaps between fixtures over the Christmas period. Tottenham and West Ham, for example, will both be off this weekend but then play on Tuesday, Thursday and next Sunday in the FA Cup, meaning both will have had six clear days before playing three times in the following six. This was because their fixture against each other was due to be played on Sunday but was moved because of safety and public transport concerns, which could have been avoided if someone had been blessed with the foresight to realise that shifting 70,000-plus people from Wembley on New Year’s Eve might have been tricky. As it is, both teams now face at best a highly unusual schedule which is unlikely to provide a sterling spectacle for anyone. Quite a mess all round.

Oxford and St Andrews are among 13 elite institutions to have signed up to a scholars programme run by the Europaeum, an association of leading European universities that asks postgraduate researchers to come up with practical solutions to social and political issues such as human trafficking, youth unemployment and regional separatism. Andrew Graham, a former master of Balliol College, Oxford, said he had the idea for a type of Rhodes scholarship for Europe in the wake of the EU referendum result. Graham said he found himself “pushing at an open door” when he first proposed the scheme to universities in 2017 and again in his entrepreneurial fundraising efforts to meet the roughly €10,000 cost for each scholar. “Brexit was absolutely part of it but universities in Helsinki and Madrid and Prague and elsewhere face issues that are just as intractable. There’s the rise of the far right in Germany, the disputes in Catalonia, the tension around migration, and high rates of youth unemployment in places like Greece and Portugal,” Graham said. “These are European problems, not just EU or eurozone problems alone. But it was Brexit that made me think it was time for something fresh.” Graham, who worked in Downing Street as an adviser to Harold Wilson, wants the programme to show that universities can act to overcome the issues that provoked Brexit. “The Brexit result clearly had a lot to do with a fundamental absence of leadership. But it was also about opposition to evidence, and an information barrier among large parts of the public,” he said. “As academics we have to think: what happened to the values of the Enlightenment and the insights from the scientific revolution? What the hell did we do wrong?” The 30 hand-picked scholars will take part in the first classes in Oxford in the first week of January, and there will be a further seven modules in 2018 and 2019 in venues such as Leiden, Geneva and Prague. The group includes four graduates from Oxford and three from St Andrews. The scholars will be expected to divide into working groups and take specific problems to solve over two years. For the pilot programme to be a success, Graham says, its outcomes will have to be meaningful policy initiatives. “The results of their efforts have got to have value. I don’t necessarily mean monetary value, but value for society. They can be idealistic, but they also have to be pinned into reality – ideally something that could be implemented in one form or another,” Graham said. “What we want are outcomes that will excite people and be useful, whether to an MP or the European parliament or an NGO or business. It could be all sorts of things, but it has to interest someone and give them a solution that they can bring about.” The scholars were selected as people who “think for themselves but not just of themselves,” according to the Europaeum’s description. Member universities submitted a shortlist of names of graduates, generally in the first or second year of a doctorate, studying humanities or social sciences. The shortlist was whittled down to 30, with an outstanding academic record the first requirement, followed by personal values and “people who are committed to Europe and who desire to make it a better place”. “Could someone who voted for Brexit join the programme? Absolutely. But not someone who was xenophobic or only a Little Englander,” Graham said. The Europaeum scheme is the first of a series of efforts by British universities to continue collaboration with their European partners after Brexit. The University of Warwick is in talks with peers in EU member states to offer joint undergraduate degrees, while the Russell Group of leading research institutions is looking at a creating new student exchanges with Europe if the UK is unable to remain in the Erasmus programme after 2020. Oxford is also embarking on an innovative partnership with four universities in Berlin, including Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, allowing Oxford researchers to collaborate with German colleagues."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/dec/28/2018-business-names-to-watch-michael-oleary-james-murdoch-winklevoss-jeff-bezos-iain-conn-steve-rowe-martin-sorrell-tim-martin","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-28T13:05:33Z","webTitle":"Which big names in business are 2018’s ones to watch?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/dec/28/2018-business-names-to-watch-michael-oleary-james-murdoch-winklevoss-jeff-bezos-iain-conn-steve-rowe-martin-sorrell-tim-martin","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/dec/28/2018-business-names-to-watch-michael-oleary-james-murdoch-winklevoss-jeff-bezos-iain-conn-steve-rowe-martin-sorrell-tim-martin","fields":{"headline":"Which big names in business are 2018’s ones to watch?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"From the head of Europe’s biggest short-haul airline to an heir to the Murdoch empire, here are 10 well-known business figures expected to hit the headlines next year, for good or ill. Michael O’Leary In 2011, the chief executive of Ryanair, Michael O’Leary, outlined his pitch for one of the most sought-after honours in the world: “There hasn’t been a war in Europe for 50 years, because they’re all too busy flying on Ryanair. I should get the Nobel peace prize – screw Bono.” Shamefully, the Nobel committee continues to overlook O’Leary as a potential laureate, although he is increasingly being recognised in other areas. Having admitted that his company may not always have treated its passengers quite as they hoped, O’Leary is now contending with critics who accuse the airline of mistreating its staff. Ryanair will be investigated by two parliamentary committees after allegations about employee working conditions, including that it has been “trying to wriggle out” of paying its staff the national minimum wage, while setting tough in-flight sales targets. The airline has said the claims about cabin crew pay and working conditions “are false”. However, O’Leary announced this month that he will begin talks to recognise pilot and cabin crew trade unions. The success of these discussions will make him a subject of even greater focus than usual next year. Emma Walmsley GlaxoSmithKline backed away from its oncology drugs two years ago under Walmsley’s predecessor, Sir Andrew Witty, but 2018 will represent efforts by the company to re-enter the field. She has reinstated cancer treatments as one of the planks of her strategy to restore the company’s fortunes since taking the role last spring, after GSK lagged rivals in in producing multibillion-dollar blockbusters. It is now up to Walmsley to restore faith in the group’s research and development skills. James Murdoch What next for James Murdoch, the chief executive of 21st Century Fox and younger son of Rupert Murdoch? Well, he is expected to leave his father’s corporate orbit next year once Disney completes its $66bn (£49bn) acquisition of Fox’s entertainment assets. Disney has floated the possibility that Murdoch Jr might join the group in an executive role, and if he does the 45-year-old will be seen as a potential successor to Bob Iger, the Disney boss who looks unlikely to be wrestled out of the door until 2021. Otherwise, Murdoch is expected to strike out on his own, given that his job with Fox will no longer be there if regulators clear the deal. The Winklevoss twins Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss saw a new trend coming with the advent of social media. Unfortunately for them, their foresight did not extend to keeping a hold on the idea, so they ended up suing Mark Zuckerberg, who they claimed stole their idea for a social network and called it “the Facebook”. Next year might give them a shot at further redemption after they became bitcoin billionaires in 2017. Having bought about 100,000 units of the cryptocurrency in 2013, when each coin was worth roughly $120, the value of each one rose to nearly $12,000 in early December and kept on soaring. Much of the financial world is waiting for what they view as a bubble to burst. Nicky Morgan Being one of the infamous Daily Telegraph front page “Brexit mutineers” did not faze the Conservative MP for Loughborough (she pinned a copy to her office wall), so it is hard to envisage her backing away from the limelight during 2018. She is not backing a second referendum, but believes leaving with no deal is suicidal. “No deal I think is a critical thing. And my role is to stop that happening,” she said in December. Morgan has a platform for her campaign too, as chair of the influential Treasury select committee, which is likely to add to her profile and possibly her impact. Jeff Bezos The 53-year-old creator of Amazon is the world’s richest man: his fortune increased by about $34bn in 2017 to take his net worth to $99.6bn. Having founded Amazon in his Seattle garage in 1994, Bezos now owns 16% of the retailer, which is hardly loved but appears practically unstoppable. He also owns all of space exploration company Blue Origin and the Washington Post newspaper, which he bought for $250m in 2013. The question for 2018 is: can he get any richer? Steve Rowe Steve Rowe, the boss of Marks &amp; Spencer, is a veteran employee of the high street retailer, having taken a Saturday job in the Croydon store at the age of 15. Still, it is unlikely that even Rowe will have witnessed many years as crucial to M&amp;S as 2018 is shaping up to be. Alongside new chairman Archie Norman, the chief executive is attempting to revitalise this British institution. The scale of how far M&amp;S has fallen behind, however, is betrayed by the stock market: in 2017 its market value was eclipsed by takeaway group JustEat and by fashion firm Asos. Neither of the online companies was even close to being conceived when Rowe started his M&amp;S career. Sir Martin Sorrell The chief executive of the advertising firm WPP is surely someone to watch in 2018 – just ask him, he’ll tell you so. Always interesting, sometimes entertaining and occasionally controversial, Sorrell tends to make himself relevant to the news cycle if there’s ever a chance he might get overlooked. That is doubly true in World Cup years, when ad spend tends to get a bit of a lift, plus periods where there is any turbulence in geopolitics. It is unlikely he’ll stay voluntarily quiet in 2018. Tim Martin Forget Al Murray, the boss of JD Wetherspoon is the real pub landlord. The Brexiter is one of the most articulate – and compelling – of the high-profile leave supporters, so is almost always worth listening to, no matter which way you voted. He has argued that Brexit should mean lower food prices (key remainers say it will mean the opposite), but if that seems far-fetched it’s worth recalling how Martin was once derided for his views on the euro, which now look sage-like. Still, if the economy suffers any Brexit wobbles, and his pubs get hit, it will be worth watching him trying to explain why Brexit is a smart move."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/27/ukraine-and-separatists-begin-largest-prisoner-exchange-of-conflict","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-27T15:59:55Z","webTitle":"Ukraine and separatists begin largest prisoner exchange of conflict","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/27/ukraine-and-separatists-begin-largest-prisoner-exchange-of-conflict","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/27/ukraine-and-separatists-begin-largest-prisoner-exchange-of-conflict","fields":{"headline":"Ukraine and separatists begin largest prisoner exchange of conflict","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Ukraine and Russia-backed separatists have begun to exchange more than 300 prisoners in the war-torn east of the country, in the largest such swap since the insurgency broke out in 2014. The exchange of prisoners was being carried out at a checkpoint near Horlivka, a city in the eastern Donetsk region. Ukraine handed over 246 prisoners in exchange for 74 people who had been taken captive by separatist forces. Journalists, activists and bloggers who had been accused of spying or treason were among those released. Twenty people who had been held in Ukrainian government custody refused to return to pro-Russia breakaway regions, Kiev said. Family and friends of the freed Ukrainian prisoners gathered at Kiev’s Borispol airport where the former captives were expected to arrive on Wednesday evening. “Nothing is more important than to bring our people home,” said Ukraine’s president, Petro Poroshenko. The prisoner swap was confirmed on Monday when Patriarch Kirill, the head of the Russian Orthodox church, met with pro-Russia separatist leaders at Moscow’s Danilov monastery. In a phone call in November, Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, had urged the separatist leaders to exchange prisoners with the Ukrainian government. Although the Kremlin insists the Russian army is not in eastern Ukraine, international observers say Russian soldiers and military hardware are involved in fighting in the region. The conversation was Putin’s first official contact with the heads of the breakaway republics, and came about at the urging of Viktor Medvedchuk, a Ukrainian business tycoon and politician who is close to the Kremlin. Putin is godfather to Medvedchuk’s daughter. Alexander Zakharchenko, the head of the Kremlin-backed Donetsk People’s Republic, said on Wednesday that more prisoners would be exchanged in the coming months. But a recent escalation in hostilities has quashed hopes of an imminent end to the conflict, which is now the longest in Europe since the second world war. More than 10,000 people have been killed and 1.5 million displaced in eastern Ukraine since fighting erupted there almost four years ago. A ceasefire that was supposed to go into effect on 23 December was shattered within hours when a Ukrainian solider was killed. Monitors from the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) have since reported hundreds of ceasefire violations, and at least seven Ukrainian soldiers have been killed in the past week. Both sides accuse each other of breaking the terms of the truce, which had been agreed during talks between representatives of Russia, Ukraine, separatist forces, and the OSCE in Minsk, Belarus, on 20 December. A number of similar ceasefires have failed to take hold since the start of the conflict. The United States said last week that it was sending lethal weapons to Kiev to help it fight pro-Russia separatist forces. Although the US state department did not specify what weaponry it was sending, reports said Kiev would receive American-made Javelin anti-tank missiles. Donald Trump’s decision to arm Ukraine was criticised by Russian officials, who said it would derail peace efforts and lead to further loss of life. The Obama administration had consistently refused to approve Kiev’s requests for US lethal weaponry because it said the move risked provoking a dangerous escalation in the conflict. Poroshenko insists Ukraine will use the weapons in a purely defensive manner to “rebuff the aggressor”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/27/archive-files-britain-colonial-past-government","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-27T15:02:09Z","webTitle":"Why do archive files on Britain’s colonial past keep going missing? | Siobhan Fenton","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/27/archive-files-britain-colonial-past-government","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/27/archive-files-britain-colonial-past-government","fields":{"headline":"Why do archive files on Britain’s colonial past keep going missing?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The National Archives are home to more than 11m documents, many of them covering the most disturbing periods of Britain’s colonial past. The uncomfortable truths revealed in previously classified government files have proved invaluable to those seeking to understand this country’s history or to expose past injustices. It is deeply concerning, therefore, to discover that about 1,000 files have gone missing after being removed by civil servants. Officially, the archives describe them as “misplaced while on loan to a government department”. The files, each containing dozens of pages, cover subjects such as the Troubles in Northern Ireland, the British colonial administration in Palestine, tests on polio vaccines and territorial disputes between the UK and Argentina. It is unclear whether duplicates exist. The loss of so many documents of such significance has understandably caused concern among historians, politicians and human rights groups. Amnesty International has called on Theresa May to order an urgent government-wide search for the documents, while Labour MP Jon Trickett has warned that the loss “will only fuel accusations of a cover-up”. Such suggestions may seem far-fetched, but recent history has given many people reason to be suspicious. Documents in the National Archives have previously been key in revealing human rights abuses by the British state. In 2014, for instance, investigators from the Irish broadcaster RTÉ uncovered a 1977 letter from the then home secretary, Merlyn Rees, to the prime minister of the day, James Callaghan, in which Rees claimed that ministers had given permission for torture to be used in Northern Ireland during the Troubles. The information had reportedly been withheld from the European court of human rights. Also in 2014, the government was accused of a cover-up after it said it could not release information about the CIA’s “extraordinary rendition” programme because the files had suffered “water damage” . In 2013, meanwhile, the Guardian revealed that more than 1m documents that should have been declassified were instead being unlawfully kept at a high-security compound in Buckinghamshire. Their existence only came to light when a group of elderly Kenyans took the government to the high court, claiming they had been tortured during the 1950s Mau Mau rebellion. The Foreign Office was forced to admit it had withheld thousands of colonial-era papers. Even if the files that have now been reported missing vanished as a result of sloppiness or incompetence rather than malice, that is in a way no less damning. Britain has long failed to acknowledge the horrors that its colonialism and imperialism have wrought on the world. Many Britons have grown up believing their homeland saved and civilised the world, while atrocities, genocide and human rights abuses often go unmentioned. Successive governments have failed to narrow this knowledge gap, whether by setting up truth commissions, establishing a museum of colonialism or teaching schoolchildren about colonialism as part of the standard curriculum. In 2014, a YouGov poll found that 59% of those surveyed thought the British empire was more something to be proud of than ashamed of. The loss of these documents provides an apt metaphor for what colonialism means to many in Britain. Embarrassing facts are neatly filed away, labelled as “the past”, and on the rare occasions that the archives are inspected, damning evidence is nowhere to be seen. • Siobhan Fenton is a freelance journalist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"higher-education-network/2018/jan/09/university-awards-2018-the-categories","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-09T10:29:50Z","webTitle":"University Awards 2018: the categories","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2018/jan/09/university-awards-2018-the-categories","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/higher-education-network/2018/jan/09/university-awards-2018-the-categories","fields":{"headline":"University Awards 2018: the categories","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Here are the 15 categories for the 2018 awards – lots of choice for every university to find an area in which it excels.

On 14 June, we in Grenfell Tower suffered an inferno. I escaped from the 11th floor with my partner and my six-year-old daughter. Over the next few days, as the emergency services continued to dampen the fire and recover our loved ones, we waited for help to come and for the authorities to tell us what to do. But the state didn’t come. Instead, it was volunteers who arrived with food and clothes, and it was they who helped us to find places to stay and search hospitals for our family members. Six months on, little has changed. Four out of five families affected are still waiting for homes. Almost 100 families spent Christmas in hotel rooms, sleeping side by side in shared rooms, what’s left of their belongings stacked in boxes by their beds. Seventy-one of our loved ones died in that fire. They died because we were ignored when we had raised questions about the refurbishment of the tower long beforehand. We are still being neglected today. At a council meeting this month, as survivors and the bereaved, still shaking with fear, told our stories, a council officer played on his phone and then fell asleep. Never in my life had I felt like a second-class citizen; I do now. We need homes and support for the trauma we are suffering. We need to know the truth of what happened, and we need justice. Most of all, we need to be treated as humans, not numbers. We don’t want excuses or platitudes. The language of politics and bureaucracy is not how we speak. We had that before the fire, and it killed 71 people. The council tells us it is busy buying 300 homes, but it’s not meeting the survivors still living in hotels to hear what they need. I know families with disabled parents who have been shown houses with stairs to the front door that they cannot use. I know people who have had their support workers change 11 times. Council press officers offer the media tours of new flats, while survivors in hotel rooms wait for the phone to ring and weeks pass with no news. For many of us a new trauma is starting. This has been our first Christmas without loved ones. I am back at work, trying to get back to normal, but nothing feels normal any more. There were children who escaped the tower that night with nothing more than their pyjamas, and many more stood and watched the tower burn. While there have been some offers of mental health support, we need more: every family should have an assigned mental health worker. The impacts are also felt by the community that watched the inferno take hold. I have friends living in the four towers that overlook Grenfell – they see the burnt building every morning, and every night they go to bed knowing their tower also lacks sprinklers. Justice can only happen once we have the truth. The public inquiry has just begun, but its scope is too much for one person. We asked the prime minister to appoint an expert panel to sit alongside Martin Moore-Bick, the retired judge chairing the inquiry. Just before Christmas she turned us down. Our views have been ignored again, and whatever little confidence we had in the inquiry is slowly diminishing. But we press on with our fight for truth and justice. All those deaths must not be in vain. There must be changes to fire safety and building regulations, and we need a conversation about treating people who live in social housing with respect. My former neighbours in Grenfell Tower came from all walks of life – they included accountants, scientists, security workers, retail managers, artists and architects. We should have been treated like citizens and listened to, not left to burn. We have little faith in the authorities who did not come for us. But there is still time for the establishment to prove us wrong. Come and speak to us, hear us, help us get justice, and work with us to rebuild our lives. • Natasha Elcock lived on the 11th floor of Grenfell Tower.

Here’s a tip for living courtesy of goodyorkshirelass: The remarkable Diana Athill, on reaching 100, asked by by Jim Naughtie what keeps her cheerful, replied firmly, “books”. On the subject of swagger, VelmaNebraska has been reading The Autobiography Of Alice B. Toklas by Gertrude Stein: At first I was mainly bemused or amused by her chutzpah - especially the way she always refers to herself in the third person as either ‘Gertrude Stein’ or ‘Miss Stein’ and pronounces on her fabulousness (an example: “The young often when they have learnt all they can learn accuse her of an inordinate pride. She says yes of course. She realises that in english literature in her time she is the only one. She has always known it and now she says it.”) But slowly I made my way beyond the gossip and rather marvellous self promotion, into the rhythm of her sentences and paragraphs (as Miss Stein learned from listening to her poodle lapping water, “paragraphs are emotional and sentences are not”), and found great joy in the way she is able to create meaning with vagueness (example: “This worked very well at first but finally did not work well”). Since it’s still just about Christmas, let’s take a Dickens recommendation from paulburns, who has been reading the mighty Nicholas Nickleby: One of my favourite Dickens despite its sixth chapter where he runs out of story for the second number and pads it out with two of his worst short stories. It has some of his most dastardly villains - the usurer, Ralph Nickleby; the Squeers family; the odious and ancient Arthur Gride; and the appalling Sir Mulberry Hawk. Then of course there is the hero Nicholas himself, who really is a bit of a prig, and amply demonstrates the oppressiveness of Victorian era patriarchy. Kate Nickleby, another of Dickens’s feisty heroines, despite her temporarily obeying Nicholas’s forbidding her to marry above her station. (The evils of the patriarchy will have you sighing all the way through this novel.) The annoying Mrs. Nickleby, probably the first of the foolish middle-aged mothers who reach their apogee in Mrs. Chuzzlewit. And of course the wonderful, heart-wrenching Smike. On a rather different note, Swelter recommends a novel approaching its 50th anniversary in 2018, and still sounding unlike anything else: Ratman’s Notebooks by Stephen Gilbert is told as a series of undated notebook entries by an unnamed downwardly mobile young clerk who befriends and trains a family of rats that eventually grows into a small rodent army that he uses as an instrument of crime and personal revenge. Once you accept the premise, the diary-like format makes for a headlong read with some suspenseful set pieces. There are echoes of Hamlet and revenge drama, as well as enough occasional allusions to class conflict and economic injustice to allow the reader so inclined to see the rats and their leader as a revolution of the downtrodden. Goodbye, Vitamin by Rachel Khong has pleased LLCoolJ: Thirty-year-old Ruth, recently ‘unengaged’ and taking stock of how she got to where she’s at so far, returns home to help care for her father as he slips further and further into the bogs of dementia. It was just the right combination of ‘froth and fribble’ with a sting – often laugh-out-loud hilarious, often heartbreakingly poignant. I haven’t spotted any mention of whether Khong has personal experience with dementia sufferers, but she must. She captures the ludic nature of the day-to-day business of caregiving brilliantly. I loved it. Finally, Jai R. Emmett reports on Conquest Of The Useless, director Werner Herzog’s reflections on creating his classic film Fitzcarraldo: The man can really take you places whether in film, writing or simply speaking about his passions and his sublime pessimism. Sublime pessimism might just be the perfect place to wrap up on 2017. But here’s to the New Year. Let’s hope it’s a good one. Interesting links about books and reading Francis Ford Coppola tells the New York Times what he’s been reading. Charles Dickens didn’t invent Christmas after all. The Ayn Rand institute has given away four million books. This is not a good thing. “It’s for Shakespeare to penetrate the heart of a prince, and for me to study his cuff buttons.” Hilary Mantel on royalty from the LRB archive.

SINGLE. HUMAN. BEING.” The power of female fertility is simultaneously so mundane as to be overlooked and so significant that it remains the principle battleground in culture and gender wars, a tool or a weapon to be appropriated by those who seek to control the masses. Feminists and writers of speculative fiction have long known this. “The control of women and babies has been a feature of every repressive regime on the planet,” wrote Margaret Atwood earlier this year, on why her 1985 novel The Handmaid’s Tale is resonating so forcefully in the age of Trump. Now Louise Erdrich tackles the subject in her 16th novel. Set in an imminent future where twentysomethings just about remember snow from childhood, Future Home of the Living God owes an obvious debt to Atwood, as well as to PD James’s The Children of Men, though Erdrich also weaves in themes of Native American history, politics and the nuances of family relationships familiar from her most recent novels, The Round House and LaRose. Here, the narrative takes the form of a secret diary, written by Cedar Hawk Songmaker and addressed to her unborn child. Cedar is Ojibwe, though her lyrical name was bestowed by her liberal white adoptive parents (“happily married vegans”). Four months into her unplanned pregnancy, Cedar sets out in search of her birth family to learn more of her genetic history. The resilience and potential treachery of our genes is one of the novel’s most insistent themes. While Cedar goes in search of her biological heritage, society is suffering a genetic catastrophe: evolution has stopped progressing and appears to be reversing; the television news is filled with DNA experts asking: “Hasn’t anyone noticed that dogs, cats, horses, pigs etcetera have stopped breeding true?” This crisis of breeding quickly spreads to humans and the ensuing panic is exploited by an authoritarian government with theocratic overtones. The situation escalates fast; martial law is declared, the internet becomes a means of surveillance, television stations are commandeered and a policy of “gravid female detention” is introduced, requiring all pregnant women to turn themselves in for monitoring. Cedar goes into hiding with the help of her baby’s father, Phil, while rumours filter back about what is done to the women and babies in the hospitals where they are imprisoned. The second part of the book sees Cedar detained in one of these clinics, betrayed by someone she trusted, and planning her escape, her account fraught with the tension between her protective maternal instincts and the growing fear that the child she carries is in some way less than human. Erdrich has said that she began the book in 2002, then set it aside until the end of 2016, reworking it and cutting around 200 pages. This might account for the current version’s disjointed feel, with many plot strands underdeveloped. Atwood says of dystopian fiction: “The form was strewn with pitfalls, among them a tendency to sermonise, a veering into allegory and a lack of plausibility.” Future Home of the Living God suffers from all of these at various times. The rapid, almost overnight decline of society feels too sketchy; at one point, Cedar looks out of her window and sees a giant lizard-bird in a tree, which may or may not be an archaeopteryx, but this Jurassic Park element is not explored in any depth, nor is the theocratic government fully realised. Though the narrative often sparkles with dry humour and Erdrich writes beautifully of the ferocity of maternal feeling and the terrors of pregnancy, it reads as if she has tried to cram in too many ideas in and with too little room to breathe. She is undoubtedly a writer of great skill and imagination, but this novel feels as if it hasn’t quite fully evolved. • Future Home of the Living God by Louise Erdrich is published by Corsair (£18.99).

The two high-points so far have been the way we’ve put our deluded neighbours back in their “also ran” box, and the release of the film 89 - a reminder of how much more beautiful the game was back when players didn’t have to put on a pretence to reassure us it really mattered. Otherwise there’s not much to say. Given that our gameplan has often been to bore opponents into submission, its remarkable we’re still in touching distance of the top four. 6/10 Stars and flops: Our two new arrivals have both proved a big hit. Lacazette has shown he could develop into a prolific goal machine, if his team-mates start picking out his runs and Wenger ever affords him a full 90 minutes. And Kolasinac secured his place as a firm favourite the moment he barrelled into the box to score on his Community Shield debut. As for let-downs: I doubt there’d have been quite so much anxiety about Alexis Sánchez leaving if we’d known he’d spend the first half of the season relentlessly conceding possession; Mesut Özil, who almost single-handedly besieged Manchester United, remains a beguiling enigma; and if Petr Cech is past his sell-by date, then Per Mertesacker must be positively mouldy. The complacent Héctor Bellerín requires a swift kick up the backside, too. Happy with the manager? What is there left to say about a man who’s left looking like Methuselah in an age of revolving door managers? 6/10 Moment of 2017: Looking back, it’s hard to top the smug sense of satisfaction that came from beating Manchester City in the FA Cup semi-final, then ruining Chelsea’s Double aspirations when Aaron Ramsey stooped to conquer in the final. – Bernard Azulay @GoonerN5 goonersdiary.co.uk Bournemouth I can’t pretend everything has gone smoothly. There have been positives but we’re only just doing enough. The defence was starting to look more solid until they came up against Liverpool, while we’ve disappointed going forward. We have to find some more fluency, quickly. 5/10 Stars and flops: Nathan Aké has been a key component of the defence and has generally been very assured and comfortable on the ball – while, despite some of the results, Asmir Begovic in goal has been excellent after a difficult start. He keeps improving. On the negative side, Simon Francis is getting slower and is mistiming tackles, Jordon Ibe has been a costly mistake in the transfer market and is nowhere near as good as Matt Ritchie was for us. I can’t believe that West Ham are interested in Harry Arter either, as he has an appalling season so far. Happy with the manager? There were some dissenting voices when we were in the bottom three but most fans have no interest in the club becoming as hasty as some rivals when it comes to replacing managers. Eddie is still learning and trying to get the best from his players. 6/10 Moment of 2017: Has to be our 1-0 away win at Newcastle in November. Just when we were feeling content to settle for a point, Marc Pugh cut inside in the 90th minute and fired a shot which beat Rob Elliot - but not a defender or the post. Everyone was still reeling from the near miss when Steve Cook rose to meet the resulting corner and scored our winner. There’s no ecstasy in football like an added-time winner. We also enjoyed asking Ritchie what the score was. – Peter Bell afcbchimes.blogspot.co.uk, @CherryChimes Brighton We started out with all the intelligence and brawn that got us promoted. In our first game – at home to Manchester City – we were a bit like rabbits in the headlights but even then lost only 2-0, and quickly got into our stride. Our magnificent home win against West Brom and the 3-0 away thumping of West Ham were the highlights. We’ve been on a bit of a rough run recently but have to take heart from performances such as the one at Old Trafford when we were confident, lively and, almost, rock solid. We need to improve at home but we definitely rediscovered our mojo in the 0-0 draw with Burnley. 9/10 Stars and flops: Our German midfielder Pascal Gross, surely the buy of the season, has been outstanding with three goals and five assists before the Watford game. Maty Ryan has saved us a good few points in goal, Lewis Dunk and Shane Duffy have been monsters in defence, as we knew they would be, while Davy Propper quickly formed a good understanding with Dale Stephens in midfield and Solly March always creates excitement. Flops? You have to be joking. Happy with the manager? Chris Hughton is a legend. He was a genius in the Championship, took us up and should be given as much support as possible. He really is the nicest man in football and has done an excellent job despite our failure to land another striker in the summer transfer window. 9.5/10 Moment of 2017: Invading the pitch when we got promoted and seeing Tony Bloom leaping about and twirling his scarf like a kid with all the players in the West Stand. Also the day the Premier League fixtures were published – marvellous! – Steph Fincham Burnley Am I pleased? I don’t think “pleased” really covers it. To find Burnley challenging the top five at the halfway point is incredible – way beyond what any Burnley supporter could have dreamed of a few months back. Who knows what the second half of the season has in store – but, right now, like every Claret, I’m ecstatic. 10/10 Stars and flops: We haven’t had any flops: the only players who haven’t impressed have been those unable to do so because of injuries holding them back. As for the stars – it’s always about the team at Burnley but I have to say the midfield pairing of Steven Defour and Jack Cork has helped take us to another level. Special mentions, too, for goalkeeper Nick Pope and defender James Tarkowski. Both of them lack Premier League experience but they’ve been superb. Happy with the manager? My belief is we have the best manager in English football. Sean Dyche has been with us for over five years now, he’s got things just as he wants them and has taken us from a bottom-half Championship club to a top-six Premier League club. We fear the worst every time a perceived bigger job becomes vacant but so far we’ve managed to keep him. The longer he stays the better. 10/10 Moment of 2017: For me it was just after 3:45pm on Saturday 12 August - the opening day of this season, sitting in the away end at Stamford Bridge. I remember looking up at the screen at the far end as the players walked off for at half-time and staring at the words “CHELSEA 0 BURNLEY 3”. What a start. – Tony Scholes uptheclarets.com, @utcdotcom Chelsea I’m generally happy - but the spectre of inconsistency does seem to be making a nuisance of himself at the most inopportune moments. Given that Manchester City are now apparently the Greatest Team in the History of the World, we can’t really complain about being third – but those losses to Palace and West Ham especially are as annoying as they are inexplicable. 7/10 Stars and flops: Hazard and Kanté continue to be our best and most important players respectively. We suffer terribly when either is unavailable and they would be ridiculously difficult to replace - a situation we fear every season with Eden, as Real Madrid knock louder year on year. Meanwhile, Álvaro Morata is scoring goals which is what we bought him for. As for flops, perhaps not a popular view but Victor Moses just isn’t good enough: negative, wasteful and definitely the weak link. Happy with the manager? Conte isn’t the man of last season, which is a real shame. I’d imagine that the usual behind-the-scenes shenanigans have blunted that enthusiasm that was a joy to witness in the last campaign. It’s impossible to know what has gone on exactly, but one could guess the Diego Costa episode, the fall-out with David Luiz and the club’s failure to match the manager’s ambitions in the transfer market have all taken their toll. The majority of the fans are happy with him, though, and just hope that the issues can be addressed so that we can have a period of stability in that department. First time for everything, eh? 8/10 Moment of 2017: Watching Spurs’ title challenge. – Trizia Fiorellino chelseasupportersgroup.net Crystal Palace After seven games with no points and no goals, it looked terminal. But just three months later, we’ve seen Palace’s longest unbeaten top-flight run since 1990. It’s virtually impossible to reconcile how poor we were at the start with how well we’ve played at times since – so I don’t think anyone has an idea of how this will pan out. The rollercoaster ride is nothing if not entertaining, though. 6/10 Stars and flops: The team just wasn’t suited to Frank de Boer’s style, as was obvious by the way everyone floundered in August and September. But Christian Benteke is at last beginning to find some form, while Wilfried Zaha has been absolutely magnificent all season, with his decision-making and shooting improving massively. Ruben Loftus-Cheek has shown his international class, and James Tomkins has been impressive when fit. As for flops, Jason Puncheon continues to be a shadow of his former self and Wayne Hennessey’s errors saw him lose his place in goal to fans’ favourite Julián Speroni. Happy with the manager? Huge credit should go to Roy Hodgson and Ray Lewington for the job they’ve done. To turn round an utterly desperate situation in such a short space of time is remarkable. In addition Roy’s genuine love for Palace and his gentlemanly conduct means he is hugely popular at Selhurst Park. 8/10 Moment of 2017: Bradley Lowery and Juan Mata’s Common Goal initiative showed football has a soul. From a Palace perspective, the 3-0 destruction of Arsenal will live long in the memory, as will James McArthur’s injury-time winner against Watford, which felt like a pivotal moment in our season. – Chris Waters palacetrust.org.uk, @Clapham_Grand Everton A few months ago it felt like the chances of a great season were sky high, with lots of new signings and Koeman in charge. It hasn’t exactly gone to plan. That said, while we’re not where I thought we’d be, to be sitting midtable at this stage is pretty good considering he was sacked when we were flirting with relegation. 6/10 Stars and flops: Pickford in goal has been outstanding. By far the best signing. Elsewhere, Rooney – although he tends to play just 75 minutes before being subbed – has scored some important goals; Gueye, Kenny, Calvert-Lewin and Vlasic have done well, and, after a really slow start, Sigurdsson has begun to show his class. On the negative side, big money signings Michael Keane, Davy Klaassen and Sandro Ramírez haven’t really delivered – while Kevin Mirallas has spat his dummy out too many times for me. Happy with the manager? Koeman only gets 2/10. His team ended up a shambles. As for Allardyce – I didn’t want him here but so far he can’t really be faulted and has picked up important points to restore some respectability. It’ll be interesting to see what he does in the window. We desperately need a striker. 7/10 Moment of 2017: I’ve got two. One was Rooney’s wonder goal against West Ham at Goodison. The other was listening to Jürgen Klopp papering over his own team’s inadequacies in the derby by having a go at us. After their next game against West Brom he was still going on about it, saying: “West Brom did well. It was completely different to Everton. They had their moments. They deserved a close result and in the end it’s 0-0.” Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas! – Steve Jones @bluekippercom Huddersfield It’s hard to have too many complaints, given our Premier League status in itself is a minor miracle. We’ve had some setbacks along the way, which you’d expect with a promoted side, but on the whole have continued to confound the pundits. Midtable at the halfway stage of the season? We’ll take that. 8/10 Stars and flops: Belgian forward Laurent Depoitre was our find of the summer – £3.5m from Porto, which was, for a little while at least, our record signing. Aaron Mooy and Christopher Schindler continue to impress, too, and look right at home in the top flight. Given how everything is going and our expectations, it’s hard to label anyone as flops, but Tom Ince’s struggles in front of goal are frustrating – both for him and for us. He clearly has quality and he’s not shy about shooting – it just hasn’t been happening for him. Happy with the manager? How can you be unhappy with the man who made all this possible? There have been games when Wagner’s tactical decisions have been questionable but, like last year, he seems to learn from each mistake. His stock continues to rise. 8/10 Moment of 2017: No contest. 29 May 2017. Beating Reading on penalties at Wembley, promoted to the top division for the first time in 45 years – quite an experience. That said, beating Manchester United at home in October comes close. – Alex Taylor @AlexJT27 Leicester I think we can be pretty pleased with the season so far. After a concerning start, we find ourselves where we should have been last season, and had a cup quarter-final to boot. If it wasn’t for Claudio Bravo and his ability to save penalties, we could have had more from that game, too. As it was, not a bad performance against the season’s outstanding side. 7/10 Stars and flops: Shinji Okazaki is quietly having a storming season and continues to be vastly underrated by those inside and outside the Leicester camp. Danny Simpson is another who is consistent if not eye-catching at right-back. Elsewhere, the rest of the squad’s performances have been characterised by peaks and troughs. When they all click at once, we’ve still got it. Happy with the manager? Just like when Ranieri was appointed, Claude Puel’s arrival hardly got us salivating but it appears to have been an astute call. He’s championing youth, energy and a very vibrant attacking brand that’s somewhat reminiscent of our recent glory days. Hopefully he’ll spend wisely next month: we need some defensive options – we’re still having issues with defending set pieces – and another option on the wings. 8/10 Moment of 2017: We’ve managed to build up some enmity with Spurs over the last few years, so watching their faces drop when Vardy volleyed us ahead moments after they aimed puerile chants at him about his wife’s appearance on I’m a Celebrity was an enjoyable moment. Who came third in a two-horse race? – Chris Whiting thechriswhitingshow.wordpress.com, @ChrisRWhiting Liverpool There have been some great matches but some shockers, too – and not just the two heavy defeats to City and Spurs. Losing the lead away to Sevilla for one, and the draws. The inconsistency is hard to stomach but the good times and great games far outweigh the rest and we’ve really been brilliant in bursts. We’re up there in the mix, and I can’t ask much more than that. 7/10 Stars and flops: Mo Salah has been our man of the season. He got off to a great start, scoring on day one, and has been getting better all the time. It’s good to have a player again who you feel is going to score every time he plays. Of our front four, Roberto Firmino probably gets fewer headlines than the others but he’s a class act and a real team player, who runs the entire 90 minutes and never hides. As for the downside – I’m like a broken record about our defence and goalkeeper and their mistakes. It does feel like it won’t change anytime soon. Happy with the manager? Mostly yes. Obviously it’s frustrating when you see the same errors happening in games and wonder why he’s not changing but it’s still early days with him. It is madness to talk of replacing him – I just hope he is given the time. 7/10 Moment of 2017: Spirit of Shankly, the Liverpool supporters union, working with other clubs’ trusts to make TV companies and the Premier League come to their senses and sack the idea of Christmas Eve games. Oh, and Salah’s goal against Everton at Anfield. – Steph Jones • Part 2: Manchester City to West Ham"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"housing-network/2018/jan/03/home-own-dream-social-renters-happy-renting-homelessness-affordability","type":"article","sectionId":"housing-network","sectionName":"Housing Network","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-03T07:13:09Z","webTitle":"Let's give up the home-owning dream.

Social renters are just as happy","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"We live in a country obsessed with home ownership. While the government may just have promised an extra £2bn of investment in social housing, our national housing strategy is still driven by the assumption that home ownership is the natural choice for all who can afford it. This assumption is backed by policies like Help to Buy, which cost far more than the government puts towards social housing. For those who can’t afford to buy, the assumption is they want to, and are in a private rental limbo, saving and biding their time. For the rest, social housing is the tenure of last resort. Recently, Philip Hammond affirmed this view, stating in the November budget that he had set out to make ownership “a reality, not a dream”. But what is the dream that owner-occupation is meant to provide that other types of housing cannot? Our research at the University of Birmingham gives a simple answer: not a lot. When we take a close look at the experiences of owners compared to social renters we find that they are in fact in the same (ie broadly happy) boat. We surveyed more than 2,000 social renters and home owners in Surrey and Hampshire and found that social renters were significantly less likely to be anxious than home owners, after accounting for a range of factors. Poor health, the stress of raising children, and the stress of living on a low income all play a significant role in the lives of the social tenants we surveyed. But a social home plays a positive role in helping people deal with these strains and stresses, providing emotional as well financial security. This is not the whole story of course. We also found that social renters were generally less satisfied with their lives than home owners. Similarly, social tenants were less likely to feel that others would like their house. So a stigma around social housing still exists. But our social renting respondents did not feel they were missing out on the great dream of ownership. Indeed owners still reported experiencing the stress of financial struggle – even those on higher incomes. This fits with evidence that a similar number of home-owners and social renters are living below the poverty line, around 4.5 million people. These results hint at a simple conclusion: build more social homes and offer them to a wider range of people across the income scale, bringing in more who might prefer not to own. Making more homes available for social rent is a huge financial and political challenge. But it may be a better ideal than Hammond’s dream of ownership for many.

They are all active do-gooders; I may have good intentions but lack the energy and organisational skills to make much of a difference. Now retired, my dad spends his time volunteering in the community and with various charities, and several mornings a week he goes to a nearby primary school to hear children read. My mum would have you believe she’s a hard-nosed pragmatist, immune to sentimentality, but she’s a big softie and spends hours engaged in helpful activities, from managing the church hall to being a school governor. Growing up, my older sister would have frenzies of charitable giving, donating boxes of toys, books and videos to good causes long before I was ready to part with them. My family’s feelings of goodwill swell during the festive season, which was frustrating for a child who felt strongly that Christmas should be exclusively about presents, chocolate and TV, not singing carols at the hospital. You can imagine the dismay felt by my six-year-old self, then, when I discovered that we would be having Christmas dinner at my dad’s place of work – a bail hostel. My dad used to be a probation officer in London, working with men at various stages of the criminal justice process. In 1994, he was enlisted to set up and manage a new bail hostel in York, so my family moved north. The hostel was a place for men to stay while awaiting trial: it was supposed to keep them off the streets and out of trouble. However, its establishment was strongly resisted by the local community, fearful that its residents would pose a threat, and my dad spent the early months of his job trying to win around opponents and convince them that facilities such as bail hostels in fact made the whole area safer. My memories of that Christmas are limited to a sense of deep boredom and frustration at being away from my newly unwrapped toys. My dad, however, remembers it differently. As with most jobs, he tells me, the probation service had targets, quotas and other statistical measures of success. However, there was just one target that he set for himself. He would weigh the residents when they arrived and when they left. If their weight had increased during their stay, he counted that a success. Once the hostel had become more established, it employed a chef who cooked three square meals a day, and who often used ingredients grown in the hostel’s garden. Initially, however, the residents cooked their own meals, which generally meant a tin of beans or a jam butty, eaten at irregular hours and alone. My dad didn’t want this to be the residents’ Christmas experience so asked my mum if she wouldn’t mind cooking a meal for everyone: residents and staff and our family – a total of nearly 20 people. You may well think that your mum or dad or gran cooks the best Christmas dinner, but you are, of course, mistaken. It is in fact my mum who cooks the best Christmas dinner. There’s always a bird, a vegetarian roulade and all the trimmings. We finish with a Christmas pudding made to a recipe passed down by generations of Lancashire women, using a method that makes it notably light. My mum was unfazed by the prospect of cooking for so many, and set to work in the kitchen while my dad, sister and I chatted to this group of men, awaiting trial for all manner of offences. Needless to say, my dad had not asked permission from his senior probation officers to bring us to the hostel or allow us to mingle with these men, nor had he run a risk assessment. I suppose he just thought that if he and my mum were there everything would be all right. And it was. I was reading a lot of Enid Blyton novels at the time, in which groups of plucky, ruddy-faced children armed with pocket compasses and corned-beef sandwiches thwart criminal masterminds. Because of this, I took to describing the residents of the hostel as crooks. “Why are we spending Christmas with the crooks?” I would ask. “Will Santa bring presents for the crooks?” My exasperated parents told me repeatedly not to use that word but to refer to them collectively as “residents” and individually by, well, their names. We ate dinner, which was every bit as delicious as anyone who’s tasted my mum’s cooking would expect. With the Christmas pudding, the grown-ups each had a glass of sherry. My dad remembers one resident proclaiming loudly: “I’ve been an alcoholic for 25 years, and that’s the worst glass of sherry I’ve ever drunk!” After that we went home, and I was returned to my presents, TV and chocolate. For many years afterwards I greedily guarded the more indulgent aspects of Christmas, realising that if I gave an inch the rest of my family would go the full Bob Cratchit and spend the day giving alms to the poor. Now, of course, I look back and realise what a kind thing it was for my parents to do, and feel proud of them. • Fiona Mozley is author of the Man Booker prize-shortlisted Elmet"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"law/2017/dec/22/liam-allan-and-isaac-itiary-trial-collapses-should-lead-to-much-needed-reform","type":"article","sectionId":"law","sectionName":"Law","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-22T17:47:03Z","webTitle":"Liam Allan and Isaac Itiary trial collapses should lead to much-needed reform | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2017/dec/22/liam-allan-and-isaac-itiary-trial-collapses-should-lead-to-much-needed-reform","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/law/2017/dec/22/liam-allan-and-isaac-itiary-trial-collapses-should-lead-to-much-needed-reform","fields":{"headline":"Liam Allan and Isaac Itiary trial collapses should lead to much-needed reform","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"I absolutely support Hannah Quirk over the disturbing non-disclosure in the Liam Allan case (Letters, 20 December). Every point she makes is a telling one. Mr Allan was so very nearly the victim of disclosure laws which are far from fit for purpose. There is more: as chair of the Law Society’s criminal law committee when disclosure-dampening legislation was first mooted, I led for the profession in voicing our profound anxieties. We always questioned the rationale of evidence disclosure being entrusted to a designated police officer. Leaving aside wilful and malign concealment, what of the well-documented, blinkered approach leading to the discounting of any evidence calling the police case theory into question? Our objections then applied to all categories of cases – and continue to do so. From then until now, glaring examples of the defence having been denied game-changing and justice-enabling evidence ought to have led to a radical rethinking of our disclosure provisions long ago. Nothing has changed for the better since our earliest protestations; indeed, here we have news concerning the most recent crop of miscarriage of justice “near misses”. Very likely they constitute the mere tip of the iceberg, the very few that have come to light. Would that the Crown Prosecution Service might always emerge unblemished either, come to that. A no-holds-barred review is essential in order to rescue the very integrity of our system. Malcolm Fowler (Solicitor and higher court advocate), Birmingham • Lack of disclosure by the police and the prosecution is not a new problem. It was one of the key causes of the wrongful convictions of the Birmingham Six, and their successful appeal led the then Conservative government to establish the Royal Commission on Criminal Justice in 1991. In the early 1990s, the courts edged towards imposing greater disclosure obligations on the police and prosecution, but concern about sensitive material and a concerted campaign by the police and others resulted in enactment of the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996 which, while imposing disclosure obligations on the defence, largely left decisions about disclosure of material gathered in criminal investigations to the police themselves. This has never worked satisfactorily, and the problems have been exacerbated by cuts to police budgets, and to criminal legal aid. The police have powers and resources to conduct investigations that the accused does not have. It is unfair (to the accused, but also to the police) and unrealistic to expect the police to make objective decisions about what material should be disclosed to the accused. Subject to suitable safeguards (in particular, with regards to sensitive material), the police should be placed under a clear obligation to disclose everything that they uncover in an investigation. If disclosure decisions are left to the police, more miscarriages of justice will be the result. Ed Cape Emeritus professor, University of the West of England • Being fair to the accused and the accuser goes to the heart of our judicial system. The current disclosure requirements are a key safeguard introduced following a string of shocking miscarriages of justice that came to light in the 90s. It is crucial that police and prosecutors meet their disclosure obligations. Their failure to do so was the reason I raised the issue in our 2015-16 annual report and wrote to the attorney and solicitor general, the DPP and National Police Chiefs’ Council urging action. It’s encouraging to see the media spotlight land on the issue; few people involved in this area of criminal justice doubt there is a serious problem. At the CCRC – the body responsible for independently investigating alleged miscarriages of justice – we have often cited non-disclosure as the single most frequent cause of referral among the 636 cases we have so far referred for appeal. The case we referred this week on grounds of non-disclosure is a fairly typical example. The current media attention may turn out to be the catalyst for much-needed reform. When it comes to deciding what to actually do, a sound evidence base already exists in the shape of the Making it Fair report published jointly by HM Inspectorate of Constabulary and Inspectorate of Crown Prosecution Service and in which we were directly involved. It is a sobering read. The findings have already helped focus our attention on some specific areas; it may also point the way forward more generally. Richard Foster Chair, Criminal Cases Review Commission • I don’t disagree with Julie Bindel about the fact that the criminal justice system repeatedly fails women (The real problem with rape trials? Too many men go free, 21 December). There is, though, another point to be made. Julie states that “Police failure to disclose relevant evidence across all types of cases … is well documented”. To the contrary, critical scrutiny of the criminal justice system and possible miscarriages of justice rarely occurs, either in the press or otherwise. The obvious question arising after the collapse of the Itiary and Allan trials (Report, 16 December) ought to be: why stop at reviewing rape cases? This was always likely to be the outcome of the various steps taken to undermine defendants’ rights within the criminal trial process. These run from the courts’ power to draw an adverse inference from a defendant’s silence (sections 34 to 37, Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994), to the introduction of a prosecution right to make a bad character application under the Criminal Justice Act 2003. Even the objectivity of the sentencing process is now subverted through the introduction of victim impact statements. Defence disclosure is no longer seen as a right – it is in effect at the discretion of the officer in the case and the CPS. Ostensibly this is to prevent “fishing expeditions”. What it actually does it make miscarriages of justice even more likely, both through negligence and design. Nick Moss London • The problem of continous failures in police disclosure of evidence to the defence (Why does police mishandling of evidence only make headlines in rape cases?, theguardian.com, 21 December) requires taking the responsibility for disclosure out of the hands of the police. The police are focused on securing a conviction: that is their job. Deciding which of the evidence they have gathered in a particular case might benefit the defence is inevitably a lower priority. The solution, surely, is to place the responsibility for disclosure in the hands of an independent examining magistrate or judge who retains overall supervision of evidence gathered for a particular case. The judge, rather than the police, would then decide what should be disclosed to the defence. In France, just such a role is performed by the juge d’instruction, who maintains the “dossier” of all case evidence. In Scotland, which for historical reasons is a little closer to France in these matters, disclosure is the responsibility of the Crown Office rather than the police directly. John Lea London • Julie Bindel should remember that justice must be even-handed and as fair to men as to women. In the Allan case, the police apparently did not give information to the defence of communications from the accuser to the accused saying that she enjoyed sex with him. The prosecution lawyer was annoyed because this clearly established doubt about the accusation of rape and the case should not have been brought. Allan’s name will be forever in the public domain whereas the false accuser will remain anonymous. Where is the justice in that? It is very easy for women to accuse men of rape or abuse as they remain anonymous. Is that fair? I am a supporter of rights for women but that does not mean I have to assume that they are always truthful or that all men are predatory.

Ian was born in Manchester and spent his early childhood in Sale with his maternal grandmother, Florrie Gregory, after the death of his mother, Freda (nee Gregory), from polio when he was two. His father, Arthur White, who was in the RAF, remarried and moved to Bradford, to where Ian eventually moved, too, joining Arthur and his wife Paddy and their children Sarah, Jane and Paul. Ian did not thrive at St Bede’s grammar school in Bradford, and left with three O levels. He joined the former West Riding county council in 1964 as a management trainee and subsequently worked in management for Manchester council (1969-71) and East Sussex council (1971-82). At East Sussex, however, he ended up in social services, a route he then followed with a move to the London borough of Hillingdon, initially as assistant director of social services and then as director. By now widely known for his clarity of thought, professional integrity and persuasiveness, as well as his often irreverent sense of humour, he became director of social services at Oxfordshire county council from 1988-95, and during that period served as president of the Association of Directors of Social Services from 1991-92, when councils were preparing for the challenge of running England’s new community care system. He was made CBE in 1995 and in the same year was asked by the London borough of Islington to lead an independent inquiry into its handling of allegations of organised abuse in its children’s homes. The inquiry report said it was possible that many of the allegations were true, identified 32 staff alleged to have been involved, and described the running of the council as “disastrous”. Ian spent the final part of his career as director of social services at Hertfordshire county council from 1995 to 2000, at which point he retired. He then served as chair of NHS commissioning bodies in the county and worked for the Home Office on drug strategies. He also had time to study for degrees in medieval history and in photography. He loved his home village of Stanstead Abbotts in east Hertfordshire and helped to set up a thriving local history society there. He was also an enthusiastic member of Great Hadham golf club near Bishop’s Stortford. To the end he retained his lifelong traits of optimism, courage and humour. Ian married Mary Ward in 1969 and they had a daughter, Justine; the marriage ended in divorce in 1998. He and I met through our shared interest in social housing (I have worked in social services and in housing) and we married in 2000, when Ian became a devoted stepfather to my children, Anna, Sarah and Luke. He is survived by me, his children and seven grandchildren."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/dec/22/frantic-friday-sees-millions-hit-uk-roads-at-height-of-christmas-getaway","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-22T18:24:01Z","webTitle":"'Frantic Friday' sees millions of Christmas travellers delayed across UK","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/dec/22/frantic-friday-sees-millions-hit-uk-roads-at-height-of-christmas-getaway","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/dec/22/frantic-friday-sees-millions-hit-uk-roads-at-height-of-christmas-getaway","fields":{"headline":"'Frantic Friday' sees millions of Christmas travellers delayed across UK","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Travellers on “Frantic Friday” have suffered long delays and cancellations across the UK as millions head away for the Christmas break. Bristol airport runway was closed after a plane came off the runway on Friday morning, leading to as many as 50 flight cancellations and leaving thousands of passengers stranded. Motorists were stuck in long tailbacks on the M40 near Bicester after an Eddie Stobart lorry carrying beer caught fire about 11.30am. No one was hurt, but Highways England said traffic stretched back more than 11 miles after the incident. Guard shortages on South Western Railway led to more than 30 train cancellations, causing disruption to rush hour services between Waterloo and the south-west of England. The Met Office urged drivers to take care on the roads amid murky conditions in the north of England and Scotland during rush hour. More drivers take to the road on Friday than any other day over the Christmas season, according to an AA poll. The combination of the last rush hour before Christmas, last-minute shoppers and online shopping deliveries, as well as millions of people driving for festive visits to family and friends, was expected to clog roads and slow journeys on Friday evening. Traffic volume increased around Manchester, Birmingham, Oxford, Colchester, Maidstone and Rochester on early Friday afternoon, according to the RAC. Simon Williams, traffic spokesman at the drivers’ organisation, said he expected about 15% more breakdowns than usual. Inrix has predicted delays on the roads throughout the Christmas holiday, warning of significant delays on Wednesday 27 December as shoppers turn out for the post-Christmas sales and people return from visiting family. Some stretches of motorway could see delays of up to three hours, with particularly high volumes expected around the M25, according to its forecasts. Vince Crane, the AA’s patrol of the year, said: “With Christmas falling on a Monday, many drivers may hope that journeys would be spread across the weekend – but it means more days of traffic as the getaway from work on Friday is followed by the last major shopping opportunity on Saturday and visits to friends and family on Sunday.“Check the traffic reports before you leave and try to travel when it’s quieter or, if you have no choice, consider an alternative route to beat the jams. “Anything can happen, so don’t forget to do the basic checks on your car before heading off to avoid a breakdown interrupting your Christmas plans. This includes topping up the windscreen wash and antifreeze, checking your lights and adjusting tyre pressures for a full load if necessary.” Airports, ports and international train stations are exceptionally busy, with more than 4.5 million people heading abroad over Christmas and the new year. At Bristol airport, 25 people were on board the Embraer 145 jet when it came off the runway at 11.36am while it was taxiing after landing from Frankfurt, Germany. An airport spokeswoman said there were no injuries and the plane was towed to an aircraft stand. An airport spokesman said: “While it is too early to speculate about the cause of the incident, we are confident that it was not related to the low visibility conditions experienced. “Additional staff are on hand in the terminal to assist passengers. We’re sorry for the disruption and flight cancellations experienced and fully appreciate it is frustrating.” More than 190,000 people are due to travel through Bristol airport between Friday and 1 January, up 5% on the same two-week period 12 months ago. Heathrow, the UK’s busiest airport, will see almost 130,000 departing passengers on Friday. On the rail network, many mainline routes will be partially shut as Network Rail carries out its biggest Christmas engineering programme. Great Western Railway is urging passengers to complete journeys by Saturday “at the latest” as London Paddington will be closed between Christmas Eve and 27 December. The west coast main line will be halted between Preston and Lancaster from Christmas Eve to 27 December, with buses replacing trains. Passengers travelling between London and Glasgow are advised to go via Edinburgh, adding about an hour to journeys. The coach operator National Express is running its largest Christmas schedule to meet increased demand from key locations such as Bournemouth, Cardiff, Leeds, Edinburgh, Portsmouth, Bristol, Glasgow and Manchester."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2017/dec/22/the-gift-social-world-xmas-marcel-mauss","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-22T12:44:51Z","webTitle":"Gifts are a traditional part of Christmas – but why do we give presents at all?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/dec/22/the-gift-social-world-xmas-marcel-mauss","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2017/dec/22/the-gift-social-world-xmas-marcel-mauss","fields":{"headline":"Gifts are a traditional part of Christmas – but why do we give presents at all?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Exchanging stuff – as gifts or economic transactions – and reciprocating those exchanges in a socially acceptable way - is a practice found in all human cultures. The rules and scope of the exchanges may be very different, but the fact of them is universal. French anthropologist Marcel Mauss doesn’t attempt to explain the politics and practice of the office Secret Santa (alas) – instead, he describes “archaic societies” in Melanesia, Polynesia and the north-west coast Native American peoples who practiced ‘potlatch’, a ceremonial gift-giving and feasting ritual characterised by competitive shows of conspicuous giving and consumption. These, Mauss says, are systems of gift-giving that aren’t just about gifts, but carry legal, economic, spiritual and moral significance that saturates the whole social fabric (he calls them “total prestations”). In these societies, items given as gifts take on the spiritual significance of the giver. The value of the relationship is embodied in the thing given. If we can understand the rules and role of gift exchange and reciprocity, he tells us, we can understand the whole culture. Fundamentally, Mauss says, giving gifts is neither voluntary nor altruistic. There’s an obligation to give, an obligation to receive and an obligation to repay. There are rules that determine how this is done correctly – with whom, when and how are all prescribed. One of those rules is to make it look voluntary and spontaneous, so the gift is “generously offered”. But actually it’s a “formal pretence and social deception”. We’re all complicit, and pretending is part of the rules. If you don’t give – and receive – correctly, you risk losing honour, moral authority and wealth. Mauss thinks things are a little more complicated in complex, developed societies with liberal, utilitarian market economies that follow very different sets of rules, Certainly we live in a society with multiple, overlapping and conflicting systems of value and exchange, as do the people in the “archaic societies” Mauss (sometimes inaccurately) describes. There’s plenty to critique. But I think in many ways, the basics still stand. Mauss’ ideas explain why gifting faux-pas can be some of the most stressful moments in the holiday season, and fundamentally, why we haven’t all just given up and decided to do without the bother. Firstly – gift-giving is moral and there are social consequences if you get it wrong. It’s not just the thought that counts, it’s the social action. So by all means be creative, but if he gives a diamond bracelet, and you give a box of After Eights, they bring a cake and you give it back to them when they leave as a means of ‘reciprocating’, you announce that you decided not to ‘do’ presents this year, just after everyone has handed you yours, you’ll pay for it. Not just today, but forever. Secondly, gift-giving – especially at Christmas – is “formal pretence and social deception”. A warm thank you for the sweater you’ll never wear is not just polite, it’s a mandatory step in the dance of this social exchange. Gift exchanges aren’t just about individuals, they’re about the groups we belong to – and our actions are understood in that context. Your kids ignore the gift Grandma gave them? It’ll reflect on you, the parents. Visitors from overseas witness the exchange? It’ll reflect on the nation. Thirdly – for them to really count, shop-bought, mass-produced items must be transformed from impersonal commodity to gift imbued with the spiritual significance of the giver. That’s why cheques and vouchers can fall flat. And that’s why wrapping paper matters – it actively changes the value of the gift. Ultimately gift-giving is a means of affirming and strengthening the moral bonds between us. It’s strategic, competitive, and non-voluntary, but still it binds us close and reminds us that we’re not in this game alone. But if they’re neither voluntary nor disinterested, are they really gifts at all? I reckon if you believe in ‘pure’ gifts at all, then you’re good at self-deception as well as social deception.

The results from Thursday’s vote are disastrous for Rajoy and his conservative government, but are also a headache for those who now have to form a Catalan regional government. Just as in 2015, most Catalans voted against the independence parties, but these still won a majority in parliament – with the balance of power now in the hands of the most radical separatists. Rather than heal wounds, this split will inflame them. Neither side looks likely to back down, and both Catalonia and Spain will suffer as a result. Carles Puigdemont, the outgoing prime minister who fled to Belgium after leading the regional parliament to a declaration of independence in October, may now be reappointed. He would run the strangest regional government Spain has ever seen. It is not clear, for example, whether he will return to Catalonia, where an investigating magistrate is waiting to arrest him on charges of sedition and misuse of public funds. He may choose, instead, to become a symbolic leader in exile. Both the number two in Puigdemont’s new Together for Catalonia coalition (JxC), Jordi Sànchez, and the leader of their allied Catalan Republican Left party, Oriol Junqueras, are currently in jail and under investigation on the same charges. Puigdemont’s first demand on Thursday was for them to be released, but that is up to the courts, not the government. The sight of deputies such as Junqueras being ferried backwards and forwards in police vans to the Catalan parliament in Barcelona cannot be ruled out. Competition between the parties of Puigdemont and Junqueras for leadership of the independence movement, meanwhile, will force them to ramp up the rhetoric of confrontation. Although a coalition government led by the two men is the most likely outcome, this cannot be formed without the anti-capitalist, pro-civil disobedience Popular Unity Candidacy, whose four deputies hold the balance of power. They want a full showdown with Madrid. A return by the separatists to the so-called “route map” by which they unilaterally declared an insubstantial form of independence in October would lead to them crashing straight back into the concrete wall of Spain’s constitution and its cast-iron defender, Rajoy. The latter showed on 1 October, when police beat their way into voting stations to snatch away urns during an illegal referendum organised by Puigdemont’s government, that he was willing to use the violence of the state. Friday’s decision by the supreme court to widen its investigation into attempted sedition, naming other parliamentarians elected on Thursday as suspects, shows there will be no let-up from the courts either. With support from the EU glaringly absent and nobody recognising a Catalan right to self-determination, Puigdemont and Junqueras will struggle to find ways to advance their independence project. Before they can do that, however, separatists have other battles to fight. The October independence declaration led to the imposition of direct rule by Madrid. Rajoy will not change that until a new Catalan government is formed, and will reimpose it if that government steps outside the constitution. The separatists will fight to have Junqueras, Sànchez and others released on bail and to prevent them from being sent back to jail after trial. There are already calls for an amnesty. Rajoy’s standing in Catalonia, meanwhile, could not be lower. Only 4% of Catalans voted for his People’s party (PP), which will have just three deputies in the 135-seat regional parliament. That contrasts with the quarter of the vote won by Citizens, a liberal rival that was born in Catalonia and is as firm in its opposition to separatism as the PP. Citizens is a threat to Rajoy elsewhere in Spain, and the competition to prove who is tougher on separatism may lead to the rhetoric of unionism becoming more heated. That leaves the two sides even more at loggerheads than they were three months ago, before the current crisis exploded. More worrying for Catalans, however, is the deep rift opening up in their own society as extreme positions win out over moderation. Healing that wound may prove the biggest challenge of all. In the meantime, Catalans need a government to run their schools, hospitals and police force. Neither Rajoy’s rock-like obstinacy, nor Puigdemont’s efforts to bring about independence despite the majority who oppose it, will help improve their lives in the short-term."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/dec/26/philip-hammond-urged-publish-treasury-brexit-impact-studies","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-26T19:00:01Z","webTitle":"Philip Hammond urged to publish Treasury's Brexit impact studies","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/dec/26/philip-hammond-urged-publish-treasury-brexit-impact-studies","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/dec/26/philip-hammond-urged-publish-treasury-brexit-impact-studies","fields":{"headline":"Philip Hammond urged to publish Treasury's Brexit impact studies","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Philip Hammond has come under pressure to publish another set of hidden documents relating to how a series of possible Brexit outcomes, including no deal, will impact on the economy. Twenty-five Labour MPs have written to the chancellor demanding that he release the studies, which have so far been kept confidential, after he told a select committee that the work had been done. “The public have a right to know what the impact of Brexit will be for them and for their families,” the politicians, who all support the Open Britain campaign, claimed. The move comes after a similar suggestion by David Davis that his Brexit department had carried out 58 sectoral analyses resulted in immense pressure to publish the findings. The Brexit secretary was heavily criticised after putting out documents that he admitted had been stripped of commercially sensitive material and anything considered detrimental to the UK’s negotiating position. Davis avoided being charged with contempt of parliament over the controversy by persuading MPs that 58 separate impact assessments had never existed in that particular form. Now a fresh push for more transparency on the government’s Brexit preparations has emerged because Hammond told the Treasury select committee this month that the government had “modelled and analysed a wide range of potential alternative structures between the European Union and the United Kingdom”. He said the work “informs our negotiating position”. In a new letter, Labour MPs including Chris Leslie, Catherine West and Maria Eagle asked the chancellor to publish this analysis so their constituents could know what the impact of Brexit would be on themselves and their families. “Without access to the latest taxpayer-funded analysis and research, parliament will be hamstrung in its ability to scrutinise the government’s approach and to present the facts to our constituents,” they said. “It is vital that light is shed on the modelling and analysis that the Treasury has carried out. The best way to achieve that would be for the analysis to be published in its entirety.” They claimed that leaving the EU would result in “profound and wide-ranging economic consequences”, so it was right for the public to understand what could happen. Their letter was sent after questions surrounding what “end state” the government was aiming for rose in prominence as Theresa May and her cabinet embarked on their first formal talks about the issue. Two meetings of May’s Brexit inner cabinet and then of the full ministerial team began with a presentation by the senior civil servant, Oliver Robbins. His work is likely to have to drawn on internal research assessing how each possible Brexit outcome is likely to hit the economy. The discussions are critical as British and EU negotiators prepare to enter the second phase of Brexit talks, on an implementation period and then the future trading arrangement. The controversy surrounding Davis concerned how British sectors would be affected by Brexit, while the information referenced by Hammond refers to the overall impact of different trading outcomes. The Labour politicians, also including Alison McGovern, Stephen Doughty and Stella Creasy, said parliament needed that information now as Brexit legislation made its way through parliament. In their letter they asked: Has this work been carried out independently by the Treasury? Does the analysis differ significantly from the Treasury’s pre-referendum analysis? Has the Treasury shared the analysis with DExEU and No 10? If not, how can it be said to be informing our negotiating position? Has the prime minister read the conclusions of the analysis of each modelled outcome? In response, the Treasury pointed to Hammond’s comments at the time of the select committee hearing earlier this month. Asked by a committee member, Catherine McKinnell, if the information ought to be placed in the public domain given that it would help inform the public and parliament about the final outcome, Hammond suggested that it ought to be published but at a later date. “When we get to the point where we have a deal negotiated and agreed, and it is being put before parliament, at that stage the maximum amount of analysis being placed in the public domain would be helpful,” he said. “At this stage, when we have not even begun the negotiation yet, I am afraid that to put our analysis in the public domain would be deeply unhelpful to the negotiation. There is no decision for parliament to make at this point. Parliament’s decision point will be when the government have negotiated a deal and are presenting it to parliament for endorsement.” But a Labour MP, Leslie, argued that that would be too late as MPs would by then be faced with a single option. He said: “MPs are weighing up vital issues right now – on the withdrawal bill, the customs bill, the trade bill and so on. Only revealing the need to shut the gate after the horse has bolted would be the height of irresponsibility.” The MPs also pointed out that Davis had been disparaging about Treasury work during the referendum itself. “The Treasury carried out analysis during the referendum of different possible outcomes, including continued single market membership, completing a Canada-style free trade agreement, and falling back on to WTO [World Trade Organisation] terms. However, in March, the Brexit secretary dismissed this analysis, saying the Treasury’s forecasts had been shown to not be ‘robust’,” they wrote. Davis’s comment, in front of a select committee, was in reference to modelling by government officials that was used by David Cameron and the remain campaign team in 2016. The Brexit secretary added that May’s government had not by then (March 2017) forecast the likely impact of a no-deal scenario but would try to quantify the impacts of different outcomes. By December he said the government would “at some stage … do the best we can to quantify the effect of different negotiating outcomes as we come up with them”. The next day Hammond suggested that much of that work had already been done."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/dec/22/family-pay-tribute-to-woman-killed-in-aldi-stabbing","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-23T12:38:43Z","webTitle":"Man appears in court after woman killed in Aldi stabbing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/dec/22/family-pay-tribute-to-woman-killed-in-aldi-stabbing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/dec/22/family-pay-tribute-to-woman-killed-in-aldi-stabbing","fields":{"headline":"Man appears in court after woman killed in Aldi stabbing","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A man has appeared in court charged with murder after a supermarket employee was stabbed to death in an aisle at work. Neville Hord, 44, appeared at York magistrates court on Saturday, where he was remanded in custody after a hearing lasting three minutes. He will appear again at Leeds crown court on 28 December. Hord, from Bradford, stood in the dock flanked by two security officers. He spoke only to give his name and confirm his date of birth and address. There were no family members in court. Jodie Willsher, 30, was attacked at the Aldi branch in Skipton, North Yorkshire, on Thursday. Her husband, Malcolm, has since described the 30-year-old as “lovely and warm”, and always having a smile on her face. “She was amazing, beautiful and a lovely person. She was a doting mother and a loving wife,” he said. The couple have a young daughter. Willsher was working at the store when she was attacked. She died at the scene despite efforts by medics to save her. Her cousin Chris Swales posted on social media: “We lost a beautiful, fun-loving and caring person. How can life be so cruel? “A [selfish] act by one person has left a husband without a wife and a little girl without her mother. You weren’t just my cousin Jodie, you were like the sister I never had and now I’m broken you’ve gone.

In Haringey, north London, the council’s plan to partner with with developer LendLease and to put potentially billions’ worth of council assets and thousands of council homes into a joint venture has been just as contentious. Under the scheme, council-owned land and private sector cash and expertise would together be invested in improving the borough, with proceeds split equally between the two partners and council profits ploughed back into local services and further improvements. Proponents of the scheme, known as the Haringey development vehicle (HDV) say it will create thousands of jobs, transform the council’s commercial portfolio, replace worn-out estates, and build thousands of extra homes, while also making big money (half the development profits, increased council tax and New Homes Bonus) for a cash-strapped council. Opponents see a risky privatisation that fails to protect the stock of social housing, while building thousands of new homes that will be unaffordable to Haringey residents. In other words, gentrification. Behind the politics, more attention needs to be paid to one of the council’s core claims : that this will tackle homelessness and the housing waiting list. But the many documents lack both modelling and projections to detail how these commitments will be met. The council website estimates the scheme will result in 6,400 new homes, but gives no detail on which estates will be included in the regeneration, how many people will need to be rehoused nor how many will be likely to want to return. What we do know is that thousands of council homes – many in a poor condition - could be knocked down and many more thousands of new homes could be built. The council aims for 40% of the new homes to be ‘affordable’ but only a modest proportion of these will be homes at social rents. Most of the new social rent homes will be let to existing tenants who want to return to their original area. It is highly unlikely that there will be many left over to let to the homeless. The process of regeneration, however carefully done, involves rehousing the original tenants, some temporarily and some permanently. Every home used for a “decant” is a home that cannot be used for another homeless household in Haringey, of which there are more than 3,000. It will be many years – if ever - before the regeneration process makes a net contribution to the lettings pool . A London Assembly report in 2015 looked at the outcome in 50 previous regeneration schemes. There was a clear pattern. Many more homes were provided in total but there was a serious loss – estimated at more than a quarter – in the number of homes for social rent. These are the homes that meet the needs of the homeless and people on waiting lists because other options are usually unaffordable to them. Haringey is not a borough of affluent people just waiting for someone to provide a £600,000 flat for them to buy. It is one of the most deprived areas in the UK. The council has not committed to replacing all the social rented homes its HDV will knock down, let alone achieving an increase. Last week London mayor Sadiq Khan turned down a major estate redevelopment scheme on Grahame Park in Barnet on the grounds of a major loss of social renting. His policy, that there should be like for like replacement of existing social rented homes, is vital as a minimum if these huge projects are going to meet housing need as well as building new quarters and helping councils with their finances. It is fair to expect the council to know not only who will win from the plan, but also who will lose. If recent history – the loss of social renting – is repeated in Haringey and in the 100 or so schemes now being proposed, it may well be the homeless who pay the real price of regeneration.

The club’s hierarchy continue to assess the manager’s future and a home defeat coupled with another underwhelming performance against West Bromwich Albion on Saturday would likely lead to Hughes being unemployed at Christmas. Stoke, 16th in the Premier League and one point above the relegation zone, have won one of their past eight matches. David Moyes, who replaced Slaven Bilic at West Ham United last month, led his team to a 3-0 win over Stoke last Saturday but Hughes has dismissed the boost a new manager would have on his struggling side. “Initially, you get a manager bounce but usually when you look at the stats it doesn’t make a great difference,” he said. “Do you bring someone from the outside who doesn’t know the group, the frailties, the limitations, the strengths? Or do you continue with the guy that has worked with them solidly for a good period and knows what they are able to achieve? I know what my view on that is.” Hughes insists he is the man to turn things around at the club, and Stoke’s board retain the belief that the Welshman, appointed four years ago, is capable of guiding the team up the Premier League, while acknowledging that a run of poor results cannot be allowed to continue. “We are not where we expected to be, we all acknowledge that,” the 54-year-old added. “I would be more concerned if I felt the side didn’t have the capability to put points on the board. I know this group better than anybody else and I know we have got the capability of picking up points. Before the West Ham game, like-for-like results we were ahead. “We are a good Premier League team and a great Premier League club, and have been for a long time. That’s how we expect it to remain.” There is a sense of underachievement but senior figures at the club also have some sympathy for Hughes because of the poor decisions that have gone against Stoke in recent weeks, including the penalty Manuel Lanzini controversially won for West Ham. Lanzini was subsequently given a two-match ban for diving. “We’ve been hurt by refereeing decisions of late,” Hughes said. “Key moments in key games have been affected by decisions the referee has made. The lad has got sanctioned for diving, rightly, but the only group that haven’t had the benefit of that are ourselves. “That needs to change, the referees need to step up and get decisions right. It doesn’t seem that it’s correct. It may change with video referees coming in. Maybe that’s something to be applauded that they realise there’s a problem and are trying to do something about it. Maybe because the offence was against us he shouldn’t be allowed to play against us in the return game.” Second-bottom West Brom, who could welcome back wingers Matt Phillips and Nacer Chadli, badly need a result too, having failed to win in their past 17 matches in all competitions."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/22/last-christmas-lost-george-michael-beacon-hope","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-22T12:23:29Z","webTitle":"Last Christmas we lost George Michael.

Now he’s an unlikely beacon of hope","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"There was always a poignancy to the song Last Christmas, but George Michael could have never imagined just how poignant it was to become. On Christmas Day, it will be a year since Michael died; 25 December 2016 was not only his last Christmas – it was his last day on Earth. There is no song that sums up the contradictions of Michael so beautifully as Last Christmas. It is cheap, schmaltzy and reeks of artifice (think of the dodgy electronic drum and plonky synth). Yet it is also a melancholy masterpiece (that anguished voice soaring in the final “I gave you my heart”). It may be based on a lie (Michael is distraught because he has been dumped by the woman he loves – Last Christmas was released in 1984, 14 years before he came out as gay) but it could not be more emotionally honest. The video shows a group of young friends holidaying at Christmas in an Alpine ski resort. It is classic 80s (big hair, big cars, loadsamoney) with a simple, old-fashioned narrative (love, heartbreak, humiliation, yearning). We see how last Christmas Michael’s character not only gave his girlfriend his heart, he also gave her a gorgeous brooch. And now she has dumped him for a man played by Wham! partner Andrew Ridgeley. To add insult to injury, Ridgeley is now wearing the brooch. Michael may be beautiful, with a fringe and 4x4 to die for, but he still feels like a loser in the game of love. There is even a hint at the secret he’s keeping (“A man under cover but you tore me apart”). Last year was Year Zero for music. Bowie, Prince, Leonard Cohen … so many music legends passed away. But it was the death of Michael, right at the end of 2016, that hit many of us hardest. It was not only the timing (the embers of Christmas Day) or the shock (he hadn’t been ill), it was the sadness of so much promise unfulfilled. Despite his phenomenal success, for the best part of two decades he had struggled with writer’s block, addiction and depression. All the time, he promised us he was on the brink of a creative comeback. Astonishingly, despite the failure to produce new songs, his reputation did not diminish. In a way he became his art – the reclusiveness, the recklessness, the compulsion to truth when he did emerge from the shadows. In the end, he was remembered almost as much for his lifestyle as for his music. It may have taken him till his mid-30s to come out, but when he did … boy, did he do it in style, with the single Outside, a fabulous hymn to his conviction for cottaging in a public toilet. After that there was no holding back. He would talk at length about the joy of casual sex with strangers on Hampstead Heath, the 25 spliffs a day he got through, his arrest for possession of crack – you name it. When he died, we waited for the inevitable sordid exposés. But they never materialised. Perhaps there was nothing salacious left to reveal about Michael. In fact, a very different secret life of George Michael emerged, one that seemed all of a piece with the earnest sincerity of Last Christmas. This was Michael the discreet do-gooder, performing numerous anonymous acts of kindness. I’d had first-hand experience of this generosity. The last time I interviewed him, just before Christmas 2009, Michael insisted on giving me a lift home (this was shortly before he drove into Snappy Snaps). He was not only generous, he was great fun in his generosity. He agreed to knock on the door while I hid (my older daughter answered with, “Fucking hell, it’s George Michael!”, while the younger one shouted from the top of the stairs, “Who’s George Michael?”). Things quickly went from slightly surreal to the full Salvador Dalí when he came inside to watch EastEnders, which featured a storyline about George Michael obsessive Heather Trott giving birth to a baby she named George Michael. After he died, the tabloids hardly bothered with the sex and drugs. Instead they shocked us with scoop after scoop about his decency – how he worked at a homeless shelter, how he paid £1.67m for John Lennon’s piano and donated it to the Beatles Story museum so it could stay in Liverpool, how he gave a woman who he had seen on Deal Or No Deal £9,000 for IVF. And on and on it went. At a truly horrible time in our history – Brexit, Trump and the rise of populist bigotry – sad, sleazy George Michael stood out as a beacon of hope. We may have lost Michael last Christmas, but in 2017 he became a symbol of human goodness – a man who took pleasure in improving people’s lives without telling a soul. • Simon Hattenstone is a Guardian features writer"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"music/2018/jan/24/mark-e-smith-the-fall","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-24T20:25:42Z","webTitle":"Legend of the Fall: Mark E Smith kept swinging to the end","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jan/24/mark-e-smith-the-fall","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/jan/24/mark-e-smith-the-fall","fields":{"headline":"Legend of the Fall: Mark E Smith kept swinging to the end","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"I first met Mark E Smith in 1981, as I waited on the steps of Leeds University, about to see my first ever Fall gig. Suddenly I spied the singer coming out of the building and rushed over to get an autograph. I was a painfully naive schoolboy and had no idea how to approach a pop star – or, rather, an enigmatic cult figure with a fearsome reputation for taking no prisoners. Smith wasn’t exactly the darling of the music press but he was viewed with a mixture of curiosity, awe and fear: I’d already read enough about him to know that he was someone whom one should approach as one might a savage dog. In the event – and this was my first lesson in his unknowability and unpredictability – he could not have been nicer. He didn’t have a pen, nor did I, but the previous month I’d met Captain Sensible from the Damned on the steps of Unity Hall in Wakefield, and he’d taken a bite out of my concert ticket in lieu of an autograph. I asked Mark E Smith to do the same and I still have the perfect paper impression of his 1981 dental work, which presumably contains enough DNA traces for a clone. Not that there could ever be another Mark E Smith. I can picture that gig as if it were yesterday. The wilfully unfashionably outfitted Smith was visibly in charge, like a demented building-site foreman, barking out lyrics like they were orders as his band cowered behind him, hammering out a pulverising, hypnotic racket. Two bands changed my life. Joy Division introduced me to the power of music and the possibilities of sound, and demonstrated that pop songs could be far more – and come from somewhere far deeper and darker – than entertainment. But the Fall changed everything I felt about words and language. From the moment I heard Totally Wired in a friend’s cellar at an impressionable age, Smith’s lyrics had a seismic effect on me. To listen to my first Fall album, Grotesque (After the Gramme) was to enter an unknowable netherworld of “hydrochloric shaved weirds”, “new faces in hell”, hideous replicas of much-loathed dog breeders and a worldview that sneered at Englishmen, councils, rapists, northerners, southerners, students, tourists, dogs and, well, pretty much everyone and everything. This was not the language I knew from pop. It was more like musical science fiction. I developed an obsession with the Fall that evening in Leeds that has lasted a lifetime. On a good night, with Smith at full pelt and Steve Hanley grappling with the bass like it was a wild animal, they were the best band in the world. On a bad one, they could be an irritable, irascible row. I first vowed to never go and see the Fall again as long ago as 1985, and yet like a dog returning to its vomit, I’d always be drawn back. They were never quite my favourite band, but were always there or thereabouts, a microcosm of their relationship with the rest of pop. The Fall have had scores of charting records. Meanwhile, key incidents in my own life have been bound up in the Fall: first pint of bitter at that first Fall gig; losing my virginity to the girl who gave me my first Fall album. Later, I went out with a girl called Victoria whose name gave our coupling extra frisson because, well, the Fall were in the charts with a Kinks cover called Victoria. I’ve seen Smith deliver a professional performance worthy of Sinatra and gigs that were an epic shambles, with the seemingly drunken singer dismantling the band’s gear on stage or “singing” (or rather, making noises) from the comfort of the dressing room. This, as he well knew, was part of the fascination: you never knew which Smith you would get. We had two further encounters after that fleeting initial meeting. In 1997, when I nervously conducted a “pop summit” for Melody Maker with Smith, the Beautiful South’s Paul Heaton and New Order’s Peter Hook, the three luminaries ended up trudging around Manchester because it turned out that Smith had been barred from almost all the city-centre pubs. It ended up in a drinking session that went on for hours, and through the haze I vividly remember Smith devouring poor Heaton. His crime? He confessed to liking the Fall. After the third and last encounter, in September 2005, our worlds collided in a new way. Because Smith had been interviewed countless times in the Guardian, my editor had a new angle: how about getting the singer to talk about the numerous band members he’d fired (or who had fired him) over the years, and then get a few of them to talk about Smith? That plan went awry when Smith refused to divulge the whereabouts of any ex-members. Instead, I tracked them down myself – scouring the internet, old phone books and remote Lancashire hillsides, ending up finding more than 40. This epic quest destroyed my 17-year relationship, and my girlfriend even dumped me for a lorry driver (Container Drivers being my favourite Fall song), but by the time the Guardian article became a book, The Fallen: Life In and Out of Britain’s Most Insane Group, I’d uncovered the jealously guarded inner workings of the Fall, which were as weird as the songs. Smith ran the group like a small industrial factory, hiring and firing on a whim. I heard from wives and ex-girlfriends, who’d all been ultimately discarded or abandoned by him (one, girlfriend/manager/kazoo soloist Kay Carroll, exited the van on a freeway in the middle of a snowstorm). I heard tales of guitarists being blindfolded on the way to gigs or dumped in Swedish forests; there were stories of “creative tension” and psychological torture. Songs had been recorded live in the back of speeding vans. A drummer who hadn’t played for years found himself press-ganged into the Fall minutes before they played to thousands at Reading, by a singer and guitarist bloodied from going at each other with knuckledusters. However, Smith was far too complex or intelligent to be a mere ogre. He could be as hilarious as some of the songs (I love the story that the Fall’s contract to appear on Later … with Jools Holland included a clause stipulating that under no circumstances was Holland to play “boogie-woogie piano anywhere near the Fall”). Many ex-members had tales of extraordinary generosity and kindness: how he’d come to their aid when they needed it, or taken them around the world. Carroll travelled from the US to visit “the Smith” (as she calls him) and wounds were healed. Almost all said that the Fall experience had been character-building and most that they’d do it again in a shot. Granted, this probably didn’t apply to one particularly incredulous guitarist, who revealed how an entire Fall lineup abandoned Smith and his latest wife after he poured beer over the head of their coach driver, who was doing 80mph at the time. While some former members needed acupuncture to recover from being in the mighty Fall, Smith merely dusted himself down. The great tracks kept coming (if not, admittedly, as frequently as they once did) and the singer would emerge fronting another set of musicians he’d stumbled upon in the pub. Of course, it’s hard not to think of Smith without thinking of alcohol. He was a hardened drinker (and the rest) from his teens. Interviewing him meant matching him pint for pint (I managed to avoid the whisky chasers) and I can still picture him at that last encounter, cackling as he told me how he used to fine drummer Karl Burns £5 every time he hit the tom tom. After four hours, tape machine off, Smith suggested “going over the road for one” and I ended up so plastered that it was several hours before I felt able to get back in the car. I’ll always remember his last words to me, as he departed in a taxi, as cheery (and, weirdly, seemingly as sober) as he was in 1981: “Thanks Dave, I’ve really enjoyed it.” Then, when the book came out, he annihilated it, announcing: “I’ve just fucking burned it.” He was ever the contrarian, but if there was one thing that was predictable about him, it was his commitment to the Fall. As long ago as 1979, he said that his aim in life was “to keep it going as long as I can”. It says everything about him that he kept performing until the very bitter end – even visibly ill in a wheelchair. Music has lost one of its most distinctive, inimitable characters."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2017/dec/22/steelworkers-face-huge-pension-cuts-as-tata-completes-merger","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-22T14:17:57Z","webTitle":"Steelworkers face huge pension cuts as Tata completes merger","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/dec/22/steelworkers-face-huge-pension-cuts-as-tata-completes-merger","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/dec/22/steelworkers-face-huge-pension-cuts-as-tata-completes-merger","fields":{"headline":"Steelworkers face huge pension cuts as Tata completes merger","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The retirement plans of tens of thousands of steel workers have been thrown into disarray after their pensions were pushed into the Pension Protection Fund, the government lifeboat for failed schemes. The 122,000 members of the British Steel pension scheme (BSPS) have until Friday to decide whether to stay with the scheme, join a new one with reduced benefits set up by Tata Steel, or transfer to a personal plan. Tata was forced to offload the £15bn BSPS, to pave the way for a 50-50 merger of its European operations with Germany’s ThyssenKrupp to create the second biggest steel producer in Europe after ArcelorMittal. It is thought more than 20,000 members had still not indicated a decision to leave by the deadline. As a result, they will default into the PPF – a move that is likely to see their retirement savings dramatically slashed. The PPF steps in to save schemes when they face collapse, meaning savers do not lose everything. Stephen Kinnock, the Labour MP for Aberavon where Tata’s Port Talbot steelworks is situated, said: “It’s deeply worrying that we have a huge number that have not responded. “Why was the PPF the default? Why on earth wasn’t BSPS 2 the default? I have written to [the work and pensions secretary] David Gauke a few weeks ago about this and he still hasn’t responded. It is still possible for the government to step in and sort this out.” Allan Johnston, the chairman of the BSPS trustees, said the situation was a concern, because for around 99% of pensioners the new scheme, set up by Tata, still represents the best option. Alan Rubenstein, the chief executive of the PPF, disagreed, saying “most, but not all, BSPS pensioners would be financially no worse off or marginally better off in the new scheme”. The BSPS said the deadline could not be extended because it would cost the pension scheme an additional £200m if the transfers were not completed by the end of January. Scheme trustees, union leaders and the Financial Conduct Authority, the country’s main financial regulator, have all faced criticism for not providing sufficient advice and protection to members. BSPS trustees have held 40 events at 11 locations over the last five weeks in an attempt to reach out to members with advice on what to do with their pension pots, many worth as much as £300,000. The 4,500-strong British Steel Pension Members Group made a plea to staff in retirement and care homes in North Lincolnshire, close to British Steel’s former Scunthorpe works, to see if residents were aware of the deadline. The pension transfer process descended into chaos as unscrupulous financial advisers, charging large fees, flooded into the steel heartlands of south Wales and the north of England in a bid to persuade workers to transfer their retirement pots. Frank Field, the chairman of the work and pensions committee, said the practice had become a “feeding frenzy” and a “honey pot for scammers”. “Transferring out of a gold-plated final salary pension is generally a terrible idea, except in very particular circumstances,” he said. The regulator is investigating 17 such firms, but MPs said the efforts to protect steelworkers was inadequate, and that the FCA should have acted sooner. “The FCA has been asleep at the wheel,” Kinnock said. The aim of the joint venture with ThyssenKrupp is to create a leading European provider of flat steel, and position it as a leader in quality and technology. The new company will have annual sales of roughly €15bn and employ around 48,000 people. A source close to Tata said: “The pension is not an issue. It is a done deal. But ThyssenKrupp has got its own problems in Germany with the unions.” Workers at ThyssenKrupp initially opposed the deal, fuelled by concern that more steel jobs would be lost on top of the 2,000 already announced. IG Metall, the powerful German union, demanded 10-year guarantees for jobs, plants and investments. A deal was struck on Friday between the union and management removing the final obstacle to the planned merger."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/blog/2017/dec/22/jason-gillespie-no-ashes-dead-rubbers-australia-mcg-england-fourth-test","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-22T12:00:19Z","webTitle":"There are no Ashes dead-rubbers: Australia will be ruthless at the MCG | Jason Gillespie","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2017/dec/22/jason-gillespie-no-ashes-dead-rubbers-australia-mcg-england-fourth-test","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2017/dec/22/jason-gillespie-no-ashes-dead-rubbers-australia-mcg-england-fourth-test","fields":{"headline":"There are no Ashes dead-rubbers: Australia will be ruthless at the MCG","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"There is no such thing as a dead-rubber Ashes Test match. You are representing your country and whether you are an Australian cricketer or a touring Englishman, the prospect of playing in front of nearly 100,000 fans at the MCG on Boxing Day is reason enough to remember this. Christmas Day might seem a strange thing for a professional cricketer to enjoy with a match looming but it really can be a pretty special time and a welcome distraction in the buildup. During my career we would have lunch at the Crown Casino in Melbourne with the families, hold a Secret Santa among the squad and the man himself would also turn for up the children. As a fast bowler, I wouldn’t bowl in the nets that day. It is basically a top-up session for anyone who needs it. Batsmen may want an extra hit but my preference was always to have a swim, a stretch and a massage, knowing I had got my overs in during the days before and I was ready. The festivities in the afternoon were then a great way to clear minds before play starts. But once it does, suddenly Christmas is a world away. You focus on the job in hand and, as an Aussie, that means five days of toil and sweat in the hope that you will be singing the team song come the end of the match with a few cold ones. However good the side you are in, you cannot get enough of these moments in your career. So while the Ashes have been regained, expect Steve Smith’s side to just as be ruthless here in their pursuit of another one. My first Boxing Day Test, against the West Indies in 1996, was one to forget. A torn side after three overs left us a bowler short; we lost by six wickets and the overriding feeling was that I had let my team-mates down. Injuries meant I had to wait four years for my next one and with it came a chance to make up against the same opposition. I will never forget what followed, knocking over the top six in their second innings – including Brian Lara bowled for duck when shouldering arms to one that nipped back – for a cherished career highlight. It neither mattered to me then nor now that we were 3-0 up going into that fourth Test match of five, just as Australia find themselves currently. That said, for all the personal goals and a target of moving one match closer to whitewashing England, it is hard to see the management risking Mitchell Starc’s bruised heel. There is so much cricket coming up, not least the one-day series in January – Eoin Morgan’s side will be competitive – and the challenge of trying to beat South Africa away in March. The big left-armer will be pushing hard but, in my experience, those injuries can be misleading. You can do pretty much anything without feeling pain. That is until you slam the heel down in delivery repeatedly. So it all points to Jackson Bird coming in. Though a skilful right-armer, his pace is a touch lower so there is at least a bit of respite for the English tail. Their collective plight has been the topic of debate in Australia this week after Mike Atherton’s column in the Times. The former England captain made a though-provoking argument that during the barrage of hostile bowling from Australia the umpires should have been more proactive in protecting Jake Ball (in Brisbane), and Jimmy Anderson – aka the true rabbits. He is bang on about the law. It’s there in black and white. And so no one could complain if the umpires had, taking the ability of the batsman into consideration, deemed the bowling dangerous and stepped in. But they didn’t. And ultimately they run the game. Like the numerous other decisions they make, we need to accept their judgment here. Certainly as a bowler, it never occurred to me to consider the ability of the batsman when bowling. Glenn McGrath led the way here against West Indies in 1995 (just before my debut) when, at his quickest, he made a point of going hard against their tail despite being not much cop with the bat himself. With their attack, it was a bold move. Any batsman – specialist or a tail-ender – who says they enjoy facing pace is full of it. It is not nice. But England’s lower order need a better plan than what we’ve seen. Craig Overton showed the way in Adelaide when he looked to find scoring opportunities. It got him into good positions too. Far better than Anderson taking his eye off the ball in Perth and getting hit. With limited options in the squad I can’t see England making a huge overhaul for Boxing Day but they should seriously be considering Mason Crane for his Test debut. Moeen Ali has not been effective and with the Ashes now gone Joe Root has a chance to look to the future by tossing the leg-spinner the ball. Give him some protection but, ultimately, just let the kid bowl."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"cities/2018/jan/01/bratislava-spotlight-slovakia-25-years-capital","type":"article","sectionId":"cities","sectionName":"Cities","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-01T08:00:04Z","webTitle":"Bratislava in the spotlight: Slovakian city celebrates 25 years as capital","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/jan/01/bratislava-spotlight-slovakia-25-years-capital","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/cities/2018/jan/01/bratislava-spotlight-slovakia-25-years-capital","fields":{"headline":"Bratislava in the spotlight: Slovakian city celebrates 25 years as capital","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"“East of Vienna, the Orient begins,” the famous dictum of 19th century Austrian statesman Metternich has been associated by generations of writers with Bratislava, the Slovak capital 35 miles to the east. Visiting in 1933, Patrick Leigh Fermor described an exotic mix of Slav, Hungarian, Jewish and German: “A different cast had streamed on stage and the whole plot had changed.” But 25 years ago, Bratislava found itself thrust into a new role as capital of newly independent Slovakia. Since then it has carved its own niche in Central Europe, refusing to ape or be overshadowed by its neighbours, and shaking off its dour Communist-era reputation to rediscover a wealth of historic architecture and its enviable location on the Danube. The engine of Slovakia’s fast-growing economy, the city has developed tech and media companies, while increasing numbers of tourists come to enjoy its baroque palaces, fairytale cobbled streets and affordable bars. The exoticism may be gone, but so is the sense of the city’s position at the edge – Bratislava is at the heart of Central Europe. “The city has had only quarter of a century to develop as a capital, to develop the structures, while facing all the other issues faced by other capitals,” says mayor Ivo Nesrovnal in his sumptuous office in the Primate’s Palace, where the treaty dissolving the Holy Roman Empire was signed in 1805. “Twenty five years ago there were prophecies that Slovakia was not going to make it. But we did, and Bratislava is a success story because of that. The price of this is that change is very fast.” City in numbers 907 – the year Bratislava is first mentioned in historical sources, though the area has been settled for thousands of years 1993 – year of Slovakia’s independence 17.9% - proportion of the working-age population in “brain businesses” – the highest of any capital in Europe, according to the European Centre for Policy Reform and Entrepreneurship 14.9% - Slovaks as proportion of the city’s population in 1910, according to [figures compiled by] Lucia Molnar Satinska, a linguist who writes about the city 88.9% - Slovaks as a proportion of the population in 2008 History in 100 words Bratislava Castle, the whitewashed symbol of the city that looms over the centre, traces its roots back to the Late Stone Age, and was settled by the Celts before becoming a Roman fort. Slavs arrived in the region in the sixth century, part of a wave of invasions from the east. Between 1563 and 1830, Bratislava served as the coronation city of Hungarian kings, in the wake of Ottoman conquests in south eastern Europe. The second world war saw Slovakia operate as a Nazi puppet state, with the destruction of its large Jewish community. Post-war, the city was reintegrated into the Soviet-dominated Czechoslovak Socialist Republic. After the crushing of the 1968 Prague Spring, Bratislava became capital of the autonomous Socialist Slovak Republic. It became capital of Slovakia on 1 January 1993. City in sound and vision From the second half of the 18th century, Bratislava developed as a musical centre, benefiting from its geographical location, its role as capital of Royal Hungary, and the patronage of noble families. It was into this environment that composer Johann Nepomuk Hummel was born in 1778. He was taught by Mozart and Haydn, became a friend of Beethoven, and was an important influence on Chopin. He is primarily known for his piano works and his stirring trumpet concerto. Hummel’s birthplace, a pretty ochre house off Klobucnicka Street, is preserved as a modest museum. At the front is a record shop, a treasure trove of classical vinyl and CD recordings. Inside city hall Bratislava has traditionally tended to the centre-right, acting as a counterweight to the populist authoritarianism of the 1990s, says Michal Novota, a local journalist. Now politics are more fluid, and first-past-the-post gives independents more clout. The far-right, which made some gains nationally in the middle of the decade, has yet to make any serious inroads in the cosmopolitan capital. The 17 boroughs within the city, each with its own mayor, complicate the picture. The smallest, Devin, has just 1,000 inhabitants. Frustrated at a perceived lack of progress, urban professionals are rallying behind Matus Vallo, an architect and self-proclaimed “furious citizen” who will run as an independent in next year’s mayoral elections. Vallo has produced a book of 95 potential projects. Biggest urban risk Not all construction has been welcome. Citizens complain about green space being crowded out, and poorly planned development putting pressure on infrastructure. Communist-era neglect of public spaces (and the bulldozing of much of the Jewish quarter) has left a damaging legacy. As elsewhere, gentrification has driven alternative culture, including the rave scene, further out. The concreting over of the Vinohrady (“vineyards”) area and the development of the riverside Park of Culture and Relaxation (PKO) area are particular sore points, while damage to Roman remains beneath the castle during the construction of an underground car park for the adjacent parliament building caused a stir. The development of the site of the Apollo Refinery – bombed by the Allies in 1944 – is impressive on paper, including the Zaha Hadid-designed Sky Park, but critics question its integration into the city, and the risk of contamination from remaining oil. “People feel that the city is not able to resist developers,” says former mayor Milan Ftacnik. On the move Ask Bratislavans what their major beef is and one invariably receives the same answer – transport. Despite being a modest-sized city, its position on two sides of the broad Danube, together with the way it fans out into a range of scattered villages, makes connectivity difficult. Added to this a historic lack of investment and patchy execution of infrastructure plans. A metro was planned in the communist period, but the impractical project was mothballed after the Velvet Revolution. Popular opposition means Bratislava is reputedly the only EU capital without a parking policy to speak of. Things are changing, though, albeit slowly. July 2016 saw the return of trams to Petrzalka, but critics point out the system doesn’t extend far beyond the river. Nesrovnal will introduce bike-sharing in 2018, while an electric car-sharing scheme is planned. Further into the future, there is much local excitement about Hyperloop, a transportation concept developed from an idea by Elon Musk that could in theory carry passengers at speeds up to 1200 km/h. Initial agreements have been signed on a Hyperloop network connecting Bratislava with Vienna and Budapest. How liveable is Bratislava? For all the complaints about transport and parking, citizens are unanimous: Bratislava is a very liveable city. The centre is compact and eminently walkable, with a largely pedestrianised core. Due to its status as a cold war border zone, much of the green belt around the city is pristine. Particularly popular are the riparian forests near the confluence of the Danube and Morava. The Little Carpathians, a range of low mountains stretching north of the city, provide another option for outdoors activities. Some of the best cycle paths are around Petrzalka. Once a multiethnic village known for its orchards, the district was settled in the postwar period by Slovaks from around the country, with a wave of “panel block” developments followed in the 1970s. The concrete jungle was nicknamed “the Bronx” in the 1990s and was notorious for its drug problems. Now it has a reputation as one of the greenest areas of the city, with easy access to the Old Town. What’s next? The Nivy district to the east of the Old Town continues to be a centre for development, though not everyone appreciates the faceless architecture. Bratislava plays heavily on its multicultural past. While some feel this is merely a marketing gimmick, the city’s tumultuous history is one of its main tourist draws. “Bratislava now doesn’t have anything to prove to anybody,” says Vallo. “The city has a liquid identity that we can shape.” Closer zoom Visitors to Bratislava can learn more at Visit Bratislava. Bratislavske Rozky is an NGO promoting the city’s remarkable history. Patrick Leigh Fermor’s A Time of Gifts has a vivid section on his time in Bratislava in 1933, and is a beautiful portrait of a vanished Europe.

The 20 second advert features a lone man lighting up outside a building, with the blood vessels in his arms, face and hands quickly turning black as chemicals from the cigarette tar enter his body. “Every cigarette you smoke causes poison from tar to enter your bloodstream and spread to every part of your body. If you could see the damage, you’d stop,” the voiceover states. The advert, by Public Health England, has been released alongside other media including a short film in which a GP, Dr Dawn Harper, talks to a group of smokers about the levels of carbon monoxide, cadmium and cancer-causing substances called nitrosamines in their blood, and the damage these chemicals can cause to the body. The film stresses that when smokers quit, the levels of these chemicals drop off. Martin Dockrell, head of tobacco control at Public Health England said that January was a popular time to kick the habit. “Our campaign is to add to that motivation and give extra support to people who want to quit in the new year,” he said. The campaign, he added, is aimed at emphasising the dangers posed by tar. “Tar is this generic name we give for all the solid matter that you inhale [from a cigarette],” he said. Dockrell said that smokers who want to quit would benefit most from attending a local stop smoking service, where both medicines and behavioural support are available. However, he added that there are also numerous resources at the NHS smokefree website, including an app which helps smokers see how much money they save as they quit. And with e-cigarettes as well as nicotine replacement therapies such as patches, gum, microtabs and nasal sprays now available, Dockrell is sanguine. “There’s never been a better time to quit: more people are quitting and they are quitting more successfully than ever,” he said. With new, standardising packaging and an array of novel devices, “Smoking has never been more unpleasant and the alternatives have never been more appealing,” he added."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/live/2017/dec/23/burnley-v-tottenham-hotspur-premier-league-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-23T19:38:34Z","webTitle":"Burnley v Tottenham Hotspur: Premier League – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2017/dec/23/burnley-v-tottenham-hotspur-premier-league-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2017/dec/23/burnley-v-tottenham-hotspur-premier-league-live","fields":{"headline":"Burnley v Tottenham Hotspur: Premier League – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Paul Wilson was at Turf Moor for the Guardian and sent this on-the-whistle report. Tune in later for post-match reaction and have a very merry Christmas and a happy new year. Peep! Peep! Peeeeeeep! Referee Michael Oliver brings the match to an end and presents the match ball to Harry Kane, whose seventh hat-trick of the year was the difference between the two sides. He’s equalled Alan Shearer’s record of 36 Premier League goals in a single calendar year, set 22 years ago. Burnley took a hiding tonight and can probably consider themselves lucky to have only lost 3-0. It could have been a lot worse. Tottenham go fifth in the table. Burnley stay in seventh, two points behind. 90+3 min: Jan Vertonghen tries to tee up Harry Kane for his fourth, but the striker falls over. He is useless. 90+2 min: Burnley keep on keeping on, but it’s just not their night. 89 min: Spurs substitution I forgot to mention in all the excitement 10 minutes ago: Mousa Dembele on for Heung-min Son. 88 min: Steven Duffour is booked for some misdeameanour or other I didn’t see. 86 min: Burnley substitution: Nakhi Wells on for Scott Arfield. Tottenham substitution: Fernando Llorente on for Dele Alli. 84 min: So, back to that Kane goal, his third: after robbing Steven Defour of possession with a jarring tackle, he played the ball to Eriksen and continued his run towards goal. Eriksen played it to Alli, who spotted Kane’s run and picked out the striker. He promptly fired the ball across the bows of Pope, making no mistake as he found the bottom right-hand corner. 82 min: Ashley Barnes has yet another penalty appeal turned down as he claims to have been fouled by Serge Aurier as he tried to unleash a shot. Tottenham substitution: Eric Dier off, Erik Lamela on. 81 min: Sam Vokes heads the ball into the Spurs net, but is penalised for a shove on Hugo Lloris as the pair jumped to contest the ball. It’s a fair cop. 80 min: Kane looks to have scored his fourth of the night, but is penalised for offside. Harry Kane notches his seventh hat-trick of the year to put the game beyond Burnley. That’s his 53rd goal this calendar year and his 21st of the season. 77 min: Ashley Barnes launches the ball into the Tottenham penalty area in the general direction of Sam Vokes. Hugo Lloris clears, albeit a mite unconvincingly. 75 min: A heavy first touch from Sam Vokes scuppers his chance to pull a goal back for Burnley after finding himself through on goal with only Lloris to beat. He makes life far too easy for the Spurs keeper, who rushes off his line to claim the ball before the Welsh international can try to lift it over him. 72 min: There’s a break in play as Harry Kane and Ben Mee receive treatment after a nasty clash of heads. They’re both passed fit to continue. Burnley substitution: Sam Vokes on for Jeff Hendrick. 70 min: Tottenham needed that. After squandering numerous excellent chances to double their lead, they were under a period of sustained pressure from Burnley. By doubling their lead, they’ve dealt something of a hammer blow to Burnley’s hopes of mounting a comeback. Harry Kane makes it 20 for the season, beating the offside trap and darting between the two Burnley centre-backs to pounce on a through ball from Moussa Sissoko and slot the ball between the legs of Nick Pope. 68 min: Barnes goes down in the box again, this time under a challenge from Ben Davies. The offside flag silences his latest appeal for a penalty. 66 min: Another penalty appeal for Burnley, as Barnes goes to ground in the Tottenham penalty area again after being shoved by Vertonghen. 64 min: Ashley Barnes and Serge Aurier tussle in the box and the pair go to ground. Barnes appeals for a penalty, but the referee awards a free-kick to Tottenham. Moments previously, Jeff Hendrick had sent in a cross from the right, but Davinson Sanchez intercepted before the ball reached Barnes. A good spell for Burnley. 63 min: Jan Vertonghen runs to the sideline to change one of his boots, while play continues on the field. Gudmondsson attempts to wriggle down the right flank but is outmuscled by Sissoko, who wins the ball and clears. 61 min: Harry Kane goes close with a shot on goal, while the crowd continue to barrack Dele Alli. This being a family minute-by-minute report, I won’t tell you what you’re singing about him, but suffice to say they have suspicions about what he gets up to by way of relaxation in his “alone” time. 59 min: Harry Kane has a wonderful chance to play Christian Eriksen in on goal with a simple pass to his right, but his delivery is woeful. spurs have squandered enough chances to win three or four matches this evening - Burnley are still in with a shout as long as their visitors remains this profligate. 56 min: Moussa Sissoko gets booked for dragging out of the shirt and arm of Scott Arfield. 54 min: An incredible miss from Son, who fires high over the bar from about seven yards out after being teed up by a splendidly squared ball by Serge Aurier, who’d been sent galloping upfield by a neat Harry Kane flick. Son holds his head in hands ... and well he might. That was a shocking miss. 53 min: Gudmondsson sends the ball towards the far post, where Jan Vertonghen goes down under a challenge from Kevin Long, backing into him, before Ben Mee chests down the ball and shoots over. 51 min: Ashley Barnes wins a free-kick for Burnley just inside their own half, drawing a foul from Eric Dier. Nick Pope sends the ball long and Burnley win a corner following an indecisive mix-up between Hugo Lloris and Davinson Sanchez. 49 min: Another poor clearance from Pope goes straight to Harry Kane. He passes to Son, who tries to play Eriksen in on goal. His shot is deflected to the relieved Burnley goalkeeper, who won’t be impressing Gareth Southgate with his poor distribution. 47 min: Dele Alli picks up a pass from Ben Davies in the centre-circle and drives forward, to a soundtrack of boos from the home crowd. Son and Eriksen link up well down the right side, with the Dane firing a cross towards the near post. Kane bursts through the gap between Ben Mee and Kevin Long, but is unable to hook the ball inside the upright. 46 min: Burnley get the second half under way, with no changes to either side just yet. Watching replays of the penalty decision during the interval, I can say that Dele Alli did make the most of Kevin Long’s late tackle, but the defender was asking for big trouble sticking his leg in to try to nick the ball from the Spurs forward, when there was no real need. Harry Kane’s 19th goal of the season separates the sides as they troop off for their half-time refreshments. He scored from the spot after seven minutes, following a Kevin Long foul on Dele Alli. Burnley afforded Tottenham a little too much respect at first, but have improved markedly in the past 15 minutes. As long as there’s only a goal in it, they’ve got a decent chance of rescuing something from this game. 45+3 min: Tottenham Hotspur win a throw-in near the halfway line and tries to steal about 20 yards, further incensing a crowd that have booed him relentlessly since the fourth minute. 45 min: Charlie Taylor wins a corner for Burnley off Serge Aurier. Long and Mee come up for the set piece and Gudmondsson sends his out-swinger across the edge of the six-yard box. Harry Keane heads clear. 43 min: Ben Davies is upended by Phil Bardsley, who seems lucky to escape a booking. Son tries to take a quick free-kick on the left flank, but is called back by Michael Oliver. 40 min: Ben Davies gets down the left flank on the overlap again and has the ball played to him by Son. Not for the first time tonight, his attempt at a cross is woeful. 39 min: Chrsitian Eriksen concedes a free-kick wide on the right in a good position for Burnley. Gudmondsson attempts to swing the ball into the penalty area, but overhits his delivery and watches forlornly as the ball sails wide of Hugo Lloris’s goal. 38 min: More good play from Burnley, with Duffour and Gudmondsson linking up well before the winger gets a cross in to the Tottenham penalty area. Jan Vertonghen heads clear this time. 37 min: Johann Gudmondsson sends in the ball from the corner flag, but Moussa Sissoko clears for Spurs. 36 min: So, Sean Dyche elects to bring on Ashley Barnes over Sam Vokes, who would have been the obvious like for like substitute. It will be interesting to hear his thinking behind that move. Burnley win a corner after good play down the right from Duffour. 34 min: Chris Wood goes down injured again, apparently struggling with a knee injury he suffered when he landing awkwardly in that challenge on Lloris a few moments ago. Burnley substitution: Chris Wood off, Ashley Barnes on. 33 min: After a minute or two receiving treatment, Chris Wood is fit to continue. 30 min: Burnley squander a great opportunity to equalise after Serge Aurier gives the ball away in front of his own penalty area. The ball’s played wide to Steven Duffour on the left flank and he tries to pick out Chris Wood with a return ball across the face of the Spurs goal. It’s too near the goalkeeper and Chris Wood hurts himself as he dives in to try and beat the Spurs goalkeeper to the ball. 29 min: Spurs win a throw-in deep in Burnley territory, with Bardsley putting the ball out of play under pressure from Dele Alli. The home crowd are booing Alli anytime he gets on the ball, which I’m sure he finds highly amusing. 27 min: A poor clearance from Pope goes straight to Christian Eriksen, who picks out Kane on the edge of the Burnley area. He shoots from 20 yards, but fires high over the bar. Burnley are getting an absolute gubbing here. They’re lucky to be just one goal down. 25 min: So, two good saves from Pope there, who could well play himself into Gareth Southgates reckoning with the World Cup coming up. Sissoko made his job much more easy than it should have been, but he did well to save twice with his feet - sticking out a leg to block the first shot, before narrowly avoiding letting Sissoko’s second effort go through his legs. 22 min: Spurs attack on the counter, with Heung-min Son playing a lovely weighted ball for Moussa Sissoko to run on to. He’s through on goal, one on one with the goalkeeper and shoots straight at Nick Pope, who can only parry and is forced to make another save from Sissoko straight after. Phil Bardsley eventually eases the pressure on his goalkeeper by hacking clear. 20 min: In his technical earlier, Sean Dyche has been moaning at the fourth official, Mike Dean, since Spurs were awarded their penalty in the seventh minute. If it’s the penalty he’s picking the wrong battle because Kevin Long was caught bang to rights. On BT Sport, John Hartson is on co-comms duty and speculates that Dyche might be wondering aloud and at great length why Del Alli wasn’t sent off for his tackle on Charlie Taylor. 16 min: Having been at Goodison Park earlier to see Everton hold Chelsea, England manager Gareth Southgate is now at Turf Moor to run the rule over Harry Kane, Dele Alli and Eric Dier, among others. Kane goes close, pouncing on the deflection of a Del ALli shot and trying to turn on a sixpence and steer the ball goalwards from a tight angle. 13 min: Harry Kane goes down injured on the wrong end of a tackle from Ben Mee. From the ensuing free-kick, Tottenham win a corner. It’s sent towards Eric Dier at the far post, but Burnley clear. There follow some uncomplimentary less than festive songs about the “soft southerness” of Burnley’s opposition. 11 min: Tottenham win a corner, which Christian Eriksen sends short to Ben Davies on the left side of the Burnley penalty area. I’m not sure what exactly the plaqn was there, but the ball ends up in the warm embrace of Burnley keeper Nick Pope. 9 min: Burnley’s supporters are very upset with Michael Oliver and Dele Alli, but he made the correct call in awarding Tottenham that penalty. Alli was running through the Burnley penalty area, right side, and Long impeded him, tripping the player as he tried to win the ball. Alli went down as soon as he felt Long’s leg coming across. 8 min: Heung-min Son shoots low and hard from the edge of the Burnley penalty area, but it’s an easy save for Nick Pope, who was sent the wrong way by Harry Kane a few moments previously. Harry Kane scores! Spurs are ahead and it’s a nightmare start for Kevin Long, who is in for the suspended James Tarkowski. 7 min: Kevin Long trips Dele Alli in the Burnley penalty area and referee Michael Oliver points to the spot. 6 min: Ben Davies makes an overlapping run past Hung-min Son down the left flank, but completely overcooks his cross. 4 min: Dele Alli slides in on Charlie Taylor as the pair contest a 50-50 ball, catching the Burnley man on the follow through and earning himself a yellow card. The Turf Moor crowd were hoping for a red, but that would have been a mite harsh. 2 min: No chances for either side as they find their feet in the opening minutes. Tottenham are enjoying the lion’s share of the possession in these early stages, but lose it as Jack Cork tackles Moussa Sissoko and relieves him of the ball. 1 min: Tottenham kick off and assorted players on the visiting team ping the ball around between them for the best part of the opening minute. Not long now: The teams march out on to the Turf Moor pitch, led by their skippers Ben Mee and Hugo Lloris. Burnley’s players wear their usual home kit of claret and light blue shirts, light blue shorts and light blue socks. Tottenham’s are kitted out in their usual kit of white shirts and navy blue shorts and white socks. Tottenham’s manager has shipped out four of the players from the Tottenham Hotspur team that lost 4-1 against Manchester City. Serge Aurier, Davinson Sanchez, Ben Davies and Moussa Sissoko replace Kieran Trippier, Danny Rose, Mousa Dembele and Harry Winks. With James Tarkowski having picked up a retrospective three-match ban for playing fast and loose with his elbow against Brighton striker Glenn Murray last weekend, Kevin Long will partner Ben Mee in the heart of Burnley’s defence. It’s the only change from the Burnley side that drew at the Amex Stadium. Burnley: Pope, Bardsley, Long, Mee, Taylor, Gudmundsson, Cork, Defour, Arfield, Hendrick, Wood. Subs: Lowton, Vokes, Barnes, Westwood, Walters, Wells, Lindegaard. Tottenham Hotspur: Lloris, Aurier, Sanchez, Vertonghen, Davies, Sissoko, Dier, Alli, Eriksen, Son, Kane. Subs: Trippier, Rose, Lamela, Vorm, Llorente, Dembele, Foyth. Referee: Michael Oliver (Northumberland) Spurs face what is likely be a challenging trip to Turf Moor as they seek to bounce back from last week’s 4-1 defeat at the hands of Manchester City. Mauricio Pochettino’s side have won just one of their past seven on the road in all competitions, but will leapfrog their hosts if they can take all three points here.

I used to hate Christmas – but my children’s smiles made me think again Lots of nice comments under this piece about Christmas and how children’s joy at this time of year can banish Scrooge-like feelings. ‘Christmas is my time to bring out the sparkle’ Christmas is what you make it. Our small family draw names and buy one present. My granddaughter, 5, does get spoilt, but a few weeks ago she gave some of her toys away. It’s a time for us to spend a few days together as both our children live away. I realise there are homeless families, lonely people, sick people for whom Christmas is a painful time, but I give monthly to several charities, and donate to many more during the year. I live a quiet, responsible life and Christmas is my time to bring out the sparkle. And I don’t see why I should be made feel guilty for enjoying it. katiem111 From Tom Hardy’s hat to Blue Planet II’s giant trevally: the heroes and villains of 2017 TV The baddies outnumbered the goodies this year, and this article has got a lot of you talking. ‘The real TV hero of 2017 was Bob Newby in Stranger Things 2’ One could suggest the easy or predictable choice for TV hero of 2017 would be Jon Snow (Kit Harington) in Game of Thrones but the real TV hero of 2017 was Bob Newby (Sean Astin) in Stranger Things 2. TheCedarRoom Transplant patient’s Christmas plea: talk to your family Discussion under this article about experts and patients urging the public to register as organ donors has been thoughtful and engaged. ‘A successful transplant is akin to being given a new life’ Despite record numbers of people in the UK indicating their wish to donate their organs in the event of their death, in 35-40% of cases their families deny their wishes; in many instances because the topic had never been discussed. Around 6,500 people are on the waiting list for a kidney transplant and every year some 400-500 of them die for lack of a suitable donation. A successful transplant is akin to being given a new life, not only for the patient, but also for their family who get their own lives back too. To paraphrase a very old advert; signing up on the NHS Donor Register (and discussing it with your family) is not just for Christmas. Give the potential of a great Christmas to someone by signing up now. Auleejit Comments have been edited for length.

But now I know I was wrong","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"It’s been coming on for a while, so I can’t claim any eureka moment. But something did crystallise this year. What I changed my mind about was people. More specifically, I realised that people cannot be relied upon to make rational choices. We would have fixed global warming by now if we were rational. Instead, there’s a stubborn refusal to let go of the idea that environmental degradation is a “debate” in which there are “two sides”. Debating is a great way of exploring an issue when there is real room for doubt and nuance. But when a conclusion can be reached simply by assembling a mountain of known facts, debating is just a means of pitting the rational against the irrational. Humans like to think we are rational. Some of us are more rational than others. But, essentially, we are all slaves to our feelings and emotions. The trick is to realise this, and be sure to guard against it. It’s something that, in the modern world, we are not good at. Authentic emotions are valued over dry, dull authentic evidence at every turn. I think that as individuality has become fetishised, our belief in our right to make half-formed snap judgments, based on little more than how we feel, has become problematically unchallengeable. When Uma Thurman declared that she would wait for her anger to abate before she spoke about Harvey Weinstein, it was, I believe, in recognition of this tendency to speak first and think later. Good for her. The value of calm reasoning is not something that one sees acknowledged very often at the moment. Often, the feelings and emotions that form the basis of important views aren’t so very fine. Sometimes humans understand and control their emotions so little that they sooner or later coagulate into a roiling soup of anxiety, fear, sadness, self-loathing, resentment and anger which expresses itself however it can, finding objects to project its hurt and confusion on to. Like immigrants. Or transsexuals. Or liberals. Or Tories. Or women. Or men. Even if the desire to find living, breathing scapegoats is resisted, untrammelled emotion can result in unwise and self-defeating decisions, devoid of any rationality. Rationality is a tool we have created to govern our emotions. That’s why education, knowledge, information is the cornerstone of democracy. And that’s why despots love ignorance. Sometimes we can identify and harness the emotions we need to get us through the thing we know, rationally, that we have to do. It’s great when you’re in the zone. Even negative emotions can be used rationally. I, for example, use anger a lot in my work. I’m writing on it at this moment, just as much as I’m writing on a computer. I’ll stop in a moment. I’ll reach for facts to calm myself. I’ll reach for facts to make my emotions seem rational. Or maybe that’s just me. Whatever that means. It’s a fact that I can find some facts to back up my feelings about people. Just writing that down helps me to feel secure and in control. The irrationality of humans has been considered a fact since the 1970s, when two psychologists, Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman, showed that human decisions were often completely irrational, not at all in their own interests and based on “cognitive biases”. Their ideas were a big deal, and also formed the basis of Michael Lewis’s book, The Undoing Project. More recent research – or more recent theory, to be precise – has rendered even Tversky and Kahneman’s ideas about the unreliability of the human mind overly rational. Chasing the Rainbow: The Non-Conscious Nature of Being is a research paper from University College London and Cardiff University. Its authors, David Oakley and Peter Halligan, argue “that ‘consciousness’ contains no top-down control processes and that ‘consciousness’ involves no executive, causal, or controlling relationship with any of the familiar psychological processes conventionally attributed to it”. Which can only mean that even when we think we’re being rational, we’re not even really thinking. That thing we call thinking – we don’t even know what it really is. When I started out in journalism, opinion columns weren’t a big thing. Using the word “I’ in journalism was frowned upon. The dispassionate dissemination of facts was the goal to be reached for. Now so much opinion is published, in print and online, and so many people offer their opinions about the opinions, that people in our government feel comfortable in declaring that experts are overrated, and the president of the United States regularly says that anything he doesn’t like is “fake news”. So, people. They’re a problem. That’s what I’ve decided. I’m part of a big problem. All I can do now is get my message out there. • Deborah Orr is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"money/2018/jan/01/2018-consumers-price-rises-sterling-volatile-interest-rate-hikes","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-01T07:00:03Z","webTitle":"2018 for consumers: price rises, volatile pound and interest rate hikes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/jan/01/2018-consumers-price-rises-sterling-volatile-interest-rate-hikes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2018/jan/01/2018-consumers-price-rises-sterling-volatile-interest-rate-hikes","fields":{"headline":"2018 for consumers: price rises, volatile pound and interest rate hikes","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Looking back over the year that is gone, there were few signs of relief for the average household. The knock-on effects of the Brexit referendum resulted in price rises on everyday items from butter to electronics while the Bank of England increased interest rates for the first time in a decade, leaving the banks open to increase the mortgage repayments of homeowners. While inflation is creeping up – it was 3.1% in November – wage growth has not matched the rise, resulting in a squeeze on the average household budget. Even the family’s annual holiday in the sun is now more expensive as the weaker pound affects the price of travelling abroad. With those grim developments behind us, what does 2018 hold for the average household, and are there any signs of relief? More price rises Weaker sterling meant that even everyday products such as butter and tea cost more this year. Apple, Sonos and Microsoft have also hiked their prices. Unfortunately, it is expected that the hikes will continue in 2018, according to retail analyst Jonathan De Mello at Harper Dennis Hobbs. “Unless a ‘hard’ Brexit can be avoided, it is inevitable that UK consumers will face price rises for everyday goods in 2018 and beyond,” he said. “ Inflation is high currently and the government is finding it difficult to keep it under control. The recent interest rate rise was an attempt to do so, but sterling is still very weak – meaning retailers that import their products (ie most of them) will face increased costs, which given tight margins will have to be passed on to the consumer.” “The major additional downside risk to this is a hard Brexit – this would lead to tariffs on trade to and from the EU – increasing costs, inflation and therefore prices on the high street further.” Sterling trouble Families heading to the sun have been depressed when looking at the exchange rates for their two weeks on the continent. At its lowest point this year, £1 got just €1.08 – down from €1.31 in the month before the Brexit referendum in 2016. What happens to the pound over the next year – and the subsequent knock-on costs for holidays – will again be largely dependent on how the Brexit talks progress, said David Lamb of Fexco, an Ireland-based financial services company. “The ongoing uncertainty over how Britain will extricate itself from the EU will continue to drive both the news agenda, and by extension, sterling sentiment,” he said. “We should expect a volatile ride for the pound throughout the next stages of Britain’s negotiations with the EU. Any signs of significant progress will see the value … soar, while hints that talks are running into trouble will cause it to fall. “In that respect 2018 won’t differ that greatly from this year. During 2017, sterling has traded in a range that has taken it both 5% higher and 5% lower, pivoting around a midpoint of €1.14. Nevertheless, year-on-year sterling is only down by about 3% versus the euro, which given how far it fell in the immediate aftermath of the EU referendum, is pretty stable. “If we do see some movement in trade talks next year there is no reason sterling couldn’t test this year’s April high of €1.20 – but for that to happen, investors will want to see evidence of real, substantive progress.” Another rate rise? November saw the first interest rate rise in 10 years, resulting in millions of homeowners facing higher mortgage payments. Bank of England governor Mark Carney said the move was not part of a sustained trend but it is anticipated that there will be two further quarter-point rises by the turn of the decade. The move last month brought the interest rate from 0.25% to 0.5%, adding £22 to the cost of the average variable rate mortgage. Ray Boulger of mortgage broker John Charcol has predicted that the interest rate will go up by one quarter by the end of 2018, bringing it to 0.75%. “There is likely to be one 0.25% bank rate increase in 2018, or possibly two, but as for several years much larger increases have been factored in to the mortgage affordability assessment, this should not put those who have obtained a mortgage recently under financial pressure,” he said. “However, an immediate impact of any bank rate increase is likely to be the maximum amount available to new borrowers. The financial policy committee mandates that lenders assess affordability in most cases on the basis of a 3% increase in the revert-to rate, normally a lender’s standard variable rate (SVR), and so any increase in the bank rate automatically reduces the maximum mortgage available unless lenders don’t pass on the increase in their SVR even if, as with November’s increase, the cost of fixed rate mortgages doesn’t increase.” Energy prices Government plans for a cap on electricity bills and gas prices would affect some 11 million households from 2019 at the earliest and apply to those on a standard variable tariff, the expensive plans that customers are moved to when cheaper, fixed deals end. This planned legislation could result in energy suppliers putting up prices in advance of it being introduced, according to Emma Bush from comparison website uSwitch.com. “The threat of a widespread price cap could see some suppliers removing their cheaper deals and pricing up towards the level of an anticipated cap, although if it is introduced it’s not expected to happen before 2019,” she said. “A cap could lull consumers into a false sense of security whereby they think they are on a competitive tariff. If energy companies don’t fear losing their customers they won’t feel the pressure of competition to keep their prices and their costs low, resulting in a lose-lose situation for consumers.” “With savings of up to £491 available for households switching away from expensive standard variable tariffs, our advice is always to run a comparison and protect yourself against potential price rises by switching to a cheaper fixed-term deal.” House prices Recent reports have speculated that while the price of houses nationwide will probably increase marginally over the coming year, there will be drops in London, continuing a trend seen in the last few months. Rightmove has predicted that prices will rise across England and Wales by 1% in 2018 but that there will be a 2% drop in the capital. Such a rise in overall prices would be the lowest annual increase since 2011. A report from Savills predicts that house price growth in London will lag behind other regions for the next five years. A separate report last week, this time from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, predicted that house prices across the south-east will drop as well as those in the capital. Again, the Rics said that higher prices in areas such as Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and north-west England would stop an overall nationwide drop. And finally … pricier pop The sugar tax is expected to come into force in April. Under the new rules, producers or importers of soft drinks will have to pay a sugar tax of 18p per litre on drinks containing 5g or more of sugar per 100ml and 24p per litre more if their products contain 8g or more per 100ml. The Treasury expects the levy to raise £385m a year. The move has been opposed by the industry, which says it will disproportionately affect poor people. The money gathered from the new tax is earmarked to be used on increasing the funding for sports in schools."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"crosswords/2018/jan/01/annotated-solutions-for-genius-174","type":"article","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-01T00:01:11Z","webTitle":"Annotated solutions for Genius 174","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/2018/jan/01/annotated-solutions-for-genius-174","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/2018/jan/01/annotated-solutions-for-genius-174","fields":{"headline":"Annotated solutions for Genius 174","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"* In each clue the wordplay indicates one extra letter, not required for its solution.

The names on the labels were those of modest companies with distinctive identities, such as Susan Small, where she designed anonymously for over 30 years. Baker, who has died aged 97, first emerged in public at 53; she had for a while been personally designing for a special Susan Small customer, Princess Anne, who then said: “You will, of course, be making my wedding dress.” That dress, for the princess’s marriage to Captain Mark Phillips in 1973, was a very big deal. The court designer Norman Hartnell had created Anne’s mother Elizabeth’s wedding gown in 1947, and its relative glamour had been a national obsession amid austerity. Anne had more problems with fashion than her mother and grandmother: attempts by venerable British couturiers to do 1960s styles had made the teenage Anne look like lamb dressed as mutton, while new Brit fashion was too wild for courtly duties. When Anne was 18, Princess Alexandra, a long-term Susan Small customer, had recommended she should put herself in the hands of Baker, its chief designer since 1943. Maureen was one of six children of a bookmaker, Stephen Porter, and his wife, Ethel, and was educated at a convent school. She found her first job by walking from the family’s home in Hammersmith, west London, into the West End, calling at every clothing business on the way to ask for work. Initial employments were grim, but soon she met Leslie Carr-Jones and his wife, Fay, who had set up Susan Small in the mid-30s as “wholesale couture”, specialising in petite sizes. They took her on as an apprentice, and she rose quickly to be a designer, but the company’s output was restricted as clothes rationing ran from 1941 to 1949, and most staff had left to do war work. Shortage was a valuable discipline for Baker, who learned about simple but strong line, durability and wearability, and not getting in the way of a good fabric. After the second world war, the firm became a leading British label: “It’s a Susan Small world,” ran the ads in the glossies. “For a fortunate few”, it sourced quality textiles from newcomers such as Sekers as well as the giant Courtaulds, was respected enough to win UK licensing rights for some Christian Dior lines, was stocked in the best department stores and priced its top-of-the-line daywear, cocktail and hostess dresses in guineas. Leslie Carr-Jones led the London Model House group, which brought together similar companies to export, and modernise British clothing production. Baker headed a design team of three, who went to shows and suppliers worldwide; her job was to synthesise the mood into six Susan Small collections a year. She remained invisible. Any publicity featured Fay Carr-Jones. From 1968, Baker dressed Anne in everyday life as well as for grand events including the investiture of the Prince of Wales in 1969, in a compromise between the norm for female royals (floral coloured silk, precise fit and finish, blank spaces for the jewellery) and actual fashion. For the wedding dress, Anne suggested a mid-16th-century style - Glenda Jackson had recently swept all before her as Elizabeth I on television, and there was a Tudor vogue. Utterly thrilled, Baker drank a glass of champagne and then kept up a nervous silence for months, although she was pursued, with enormous bribes, for details of the outfit. In its pearl-bordered restraint, and discreet flattery, the gown looks far less absurd than Princess Diana’s meringue excesses at St Paul’s in 1981. Baker’s trousseau for Anne, with its sharp tailoring, was even better. The world of Susan Small did not survive the changes in UK clothing manufacture from the mid-70s, when firms requiring limited runs could no longer source domestic suppliers capable of working on time to a high standard. Courtaulds swallowed up the firm. In 1978, Baker carried Anne, and new clients including Margaret Thatcher, who was regally dogmatic in her demands, over to a tiny couture firm, Maureen Baker Designs, which employed just three seamstresses. They did thoroughly old-fashioned dressmaking – Anne’s maternity clothes, for instance, were altered so she could wear them after pregnancy. All outfits were made to last – some of Anne’s dresses continued to reappear for more than 25 years. Baker retired at 72. She had met her future husband, Roy Baker, later a dealer in classic cars, at Margate funfair one bank holiday in 1947. They had a son, Jonathan, who became a hotelier. When Roy died in 1990, Baker joined her son in his homes in New York and Jamaica, returning to Dorking, Surrey, each spring to look after her garden. She preferred the ease of her own creations, but in old age settled for shopping at Chanel and Dior. Jonathan survives her. • Evelyn Maureen Baker, fashion designer, born 26 May 1920; died 5 December 2017"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"crosswords/2018/jan/01/genius-crossword-no-175","type":"article","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-01T00:01:11Z","webTitle":"Genius crossword No 175","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/2018/jan/01/genius-crossword-no-175","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/2018/jan/01/genius-crossword-no-175","fields":{"headline":"Genius crossword No 175","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"From each down clue an item of misinformation must be removed to reach the solution.

The yacht took one day, eight hours, 48 minutes and 50 seconds to complete the course – wiping nearly five hours off the previous race record set last year by Perpetual Loyal. But Wild Oats’s crew will face a protest hearing in front of an international race jury to determine if she will be crowned a champion or face a penalty after a near collision with LDV Comanche at the start of the race in Sydney Harbour. “I think it was totally innocent and we should be able to defend ourselves against that quite clearly,” said Wild Oats XI skipper Mark Richards – who was soaked in champagne following dockside celebrations in Hobart. “I am not concerned about that at all.” After 628 nautical miles of racing less than half an hour separated Wild Oats XI, owned by the Oatley family, and sparring partner LDV Comanche in one of the closest ever finishes in the race’s storied history. “I thought this year Comanche was going to crush it. Words can’t express how elated we all are,” said Richards. After berthing at Constitution Dock LDV Comanche looked to congratulate the Wild Oats XI crew but a spokesperson confirmed to the Guardian their intention to protest against the line honours winner. The hearing is expected to take place on Thursday at the Royal Yacht Club of Tasmania in Hobart where Richards will rigorously defend his position. If the protest is upheld his crew will be hit with a time penalty of at least five minutes. Irrespective of the looming protest against Wild Oats XI it will be the second year in a row that time has been shaved off the race benchmark, with both yachts eclipsing Perpetual Loyal’s best in a tense climax between two blistering super maxis that nearly tangled at the start on Sydney Harbour. Earlier LDV Comanche rounded Tasman Island in first place, with thoroughbred Wild Oats XI breathing down her neck just two miles astern – setting up a thrilling finish – as both 100 footers eyeballed each other over the final hours of sailing. It was a frantic scramble to the end marker with a duel for the ages on the Derwent between LDV Comanche and Wild Oats XI – the latter pouncing when the wind dropped to close the gap to just metres before pulling away from the wider and heavier Comanche less than 10 miles from the finish. Comanche came in 26 minutes and 34 seconds behind. “All of a sudden the dream came true – seeing the Derwent with no wind in it,” said Richards. “Wild Oats was just a better boat in those conditions.” After failing to conclude her last two tilts towards Hobart it was a magnificent tactical effort from Richards and the crew aboard Oats, who had to clamber this morning to fix a ripped sail to get her back into contention for the tilt at yet more bluewater glory. New South Wales entry Quest leads the race on corrected time – handicap – ahead of Ichi Ban. Quest, a two-time handicap winner is a 52 footer and is co-owned by former television host Paul Clitheroe (who sailed her to victory in the 2015 edition of the race under the name Balance) and Bob Steel (a multiple winner of sailing’s holy grail). Clipper boat CV5 had a sailor washed overboard late on the second afternoon of racing, with yacht HotelPlanner.com offering assistance in the manhunt. The sailor was located and safely pulled back on board within 15 minutes and given the medical all clear. By the time the leaders had finished there had been three retirements from the once 102-strong fleet. Rockall, Jazz Player and Wots Next all had their races end prematurely."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"books/2017/dec/29/best-books-of-2017-indie-publishers","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-29T08:00:24Z","webTitle":"Best books of 2017: indie publishers on their favourite books of the year","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/dec/29/best-books-of-2017-indie-publishers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/dec/29/best-books-of-2017-indie-publishers","fields":{"headline":"Best books of 2017: indie publishers on their favourite books of the year","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Sarah Davis Goff Co-director, Tramp Press The book that made my year: We spoke last year about Mike McCormack’s wonderful Solar Bones, which garnered rave reviews and a rake of prizes including the Goldsmiths and two BGE Irish Book Awards.

Set in Wicklow just before the second world war, it’s an eerie and gorgeously written tale. I wish I’d published: The End We Start From by Megan Hunter (Picador) is all my favourites – short, sharp, apocalyptic and beautiful. Bibi Bakare-Yusuf Publishing director, Cassava Republic The book that made my year: When We Speak of Nothing by Olumide Popoola. We’re really proud of this one. Set in King’s Cross and Port Harcourt, it is the coming-of-age story about two black adolescents and their friendship. The novel taps into issues of queer identity and social divides at the time of the 2011 London riots. Olumide captures a voice of black British youth that has been almost entirely absent from literary fiction. Our book that deserved to do better: The Hidden Star by K Sello Duiker. Published posthumously, this magical YA quest is set in South Africa. We had a good deal of success with it in Africa, but I feel it was overlooked by UK reviewers. I wish I’d published: Irenosen Okojie’s Speak Gigantular (Jacaranda Books) is an eclectic, disturbing and erotically charged short story collection by a scorching talent. And Diana Evans’s Ordinary People (Chatto &amp; Windus) – brilliant. Sam Jordison Co-director, Galley Beggar Press The book that made my year: We That Are Young by Preti Taneja. A translation of King Lear into a contemporary Indian setting, We That Are Young is a devastating novel; we’ve been overwhelmed by the fantastic reviews and reader reactions. Our book that deserved to do better: We Are the End by Gonzalo Garcia is a wonderful book about a messed-up young man called Tomas, who (like all of us) gets things wrong. He isn’t much of a hero, though, and that’s proved tricky. It has really touched some readers – but I worry others judged the protagonist rather than the book about him, and maybe missed its humour and sadness. I wish I’d published: Man With a Seagull on His Head by Harriet Paige (Bluemoose) – I fell in love with it. Sarah Braybroke Managing director, Scribe UK The book that made my year: It was a real thrill to work on Client Earth, an uplifting and deeply pragmatic look at how a new generation of legal activists are defending the environment. Satisfyingly, the book’s release coincided with coauthor James Thornton’s legal triumph over the UK government on air pollution. Our book that deserved to do better: 1947: When Now Begins by Elisabeth Åsbrink is a work of narrative nonfiction that reads like poetry. Although it has received a share of acclaim already, it deserves to be a bona fide bestseller. I wish I’d published: I was electrified by The Adversary, by French writer Emmanuel Carrère. Reissued by Vintage this summer, it’s a true-crime account of an infamous con man, but the intensity and self-scrutiny of Carrère’s writing turns it into a disconcerting and unputdownable moral thriller. Daniela Petracco Director, Europa Editions The book that made my year: Ties by Domenico Starnone is a powerful short novel about relationships, family, love and the ineluctable consequences of our actions. Lucidly rendered into English by Jhumpa Lahiri, it was selected by the Sunday Times as best novel in translation of 2017. Our book that deserved to do better: The Gringo Champion by Mexican author Aura Xilonen is a contemporary take on the picaresque novel and a literary antidote to the growing xenophobia of our times. I wish I’d published: Broken River by J Robert Lennon (Serpent’s Tail): genre-defying, deeply unsettling and wickedly suspenseful. Jeremy Poynting Managing editor, Peepal Tree Press The book that made my year: Leone Ross’s sparky and transgressive short story collection, Come Let Us Sing Anyway, has gathered some very admiring reviews and sold respectably. The other book that made my year – it’s only just out – is Jacob Ross’s collected stories, Tell No One About This. Heart-breaking, radical in its social insights and finely honed. Our book that deserved to do better: Jennifer Rahim’s Curfew Chronicles hasn’t yet been recognised outside Trinidad for the brilliantly inventive way it builds short narratives into a kind of mini-Ulysses, taking place over 24 hours in Trinidad during a state of emergency. I wish I’d published: Lorna Goodison’s Collected Poems (Carcanet). A Caribbean and international great. Jacques Testard Publisher, Fitzcarraldo Editions The book that made my year: Compass by Mathias Énard (translated by Charlotte Mandell) is a brilliant novel, a fictionalised history of orientalism told by an insomniac musicologist in Vienna. It has been fun to watch Énard’s reputation grow in the anglophone world. In 2018 we’ll publish a fourth novel in English, on the possibly apocryphal story of Michelangelo designing a bridge over the Bosphorus. Our book that deserved to do better: This Little Art by Kate Briggs, a genre-bending song for the practice of translation, has had a lot of recognition in translation circles – but I’m longing for it to find a wider audience. Lydia Davis called it “highly enjoyable” – what more do you need? I wish I’d published: Ferocity by Nicola Lagioia (translated by Anthony Shugaar, Europa Editions), a Lynchian noir set in southern Italy. Nathan Connolly Publisher, Dead Ink The book that made my year: Without a doubt, Know Your Place: Essays on the Working Class By the Working Class. After raising £10k on Kickstarter, this collection has gone on to be our bestselling book ever. The important conversations it has started about being working class in Britain today are vital. Our book that deserved to do better: Not that it hasn’t done well, but Naomi Booth’s Sealed is a book that everyone should be reading. An expertly crafted eco-horror that is so beautifully written that it should be sold as poetry. No book has summed up our precarious position in the world so well for me. I wish I’d published: The Gallows Pole by Benjamin Myers. Within this book there is something beyond truth: a mythology of England’s North. Deborah Smith Publisher, Tilted Axis The book that made my year: Prabda Yoon’s The Sad Part Was – a witty, touching, whip-smart story collection by an author who has been a household name in Thailand for over a decade yet had never had anything in English; in fact, this is the first contemporary Thai fiction published in the UK. It was also Mui Poopoksakul’s first book-length translation – she did such a superb job. Our book that deserved to do better: We were expecting a lot from Abandon, the second novel from “India’s Ferrante” Sangeeta Bandyopadhyay, translated by Arunava Sinha. We were all set for a big UK tour, but Sangeeta couldn’t get a visa. This happens to far too many writers. I wish I’d published: I read the Singaporean edition of Unrest by Yeng Pway Ngon, translated from the Chinese by Jeremy Tiang, and loved it, but it had already been snapped up for UK publication by Balestier Press. It’s a wonderful novel. Kevin Duffy Director, Bluemoose The book that made my year: The Gallows Pole by Benjamin Myers is about a popular uprising against the establishment in the 18th century that has many links with our current political climate. Joanne Harris and Robert Macfarlane chose it as one of their books of the year. Our book that deserved to do better: Man With a Seagull on His Head by Harriet Paige was runner-up in the Guardian’s Not the Booker prize. It is already being compared to early Ishiguro and McEwan by the US publisher we have just sold rights to. I wish I’d published: Know Your Place, edited by Nathan Connolly (Dead Ink): 24 essays on the working class by working class writers. Every publisher, editor and agent must read this if the industry is really interested in challenging inequality. Stefan Tobler Publisher, And Other Stories The book that made my year: Yuri Herrera’s Kingdom Cons, translated with such verve by Lisa Dillman. It’s about a singer in the court of the King, a Mexican gang lord, but really it’s a fable about any artist working in a system of patronage: how to make a living and be truthful. It has been a joy to see it receive the acclaim it deserves. Our book that deserved to do better: Patty Yumi Cottrell’s novel Sorry to Disrupt the Peace had some high praise, but we thought more people should read it. It’s rare to find such a pleasurable, intelligent book. I wish I’d published: Han Yujoo’s The Impossible Fairytale, translated by Janet Hong, was a novel I tried to publish but lost out on. It is great. Kit Caless Co-director, Influx The book that made my year: Attrib. and Other Stories. When we asked Eley Williams to write this book we knew it would be brilliant, but we had no idea quite how brilliant. It’s a masterpiece. We’re really happy that so many people have felt the same. Our book that deserved to do better: In terms of publicity and media coverage, Hold Tight by Jeffrey Boakye. This is one of the first major books about grime music and its culture. The music press were brilliant in picking it up and shouting about it, but in general, arts and book editors ignored it. They missed an opportunity to reach a young, engaged audience and open up their readership. I wish I’d published: Know Your Place (Dead Ink) is excellent."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/live/2017/dec/27/bitcoin-price-bubble-digital-currencies-uk-mortgages-retail-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-27T18:26:53Z","webTitle":"London stock market hits record high but bitcoin wobbles - as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/dec/27/bitcoin-price-bubble-digital-currencies-uk-mortgages-retail-business-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2017/dec/27/bitcoin-price-bubble-digital-currencies-uk-mortgages-retail-business-live","fields":{"headline":"London stock market hits record high but bitcoin wobbles - as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Right, time for a quick recap. Britain’s stock market has closed at a new peak tonight, on the first trading day since Christmas. The FTSE 100 hit a record closing high, propelled by mining companies as optimism for the world economy in 2018 boosted commodity prices. The smaller FTSE 250 also finished at its highest ever level, partly due to a takeover bid for office manager IWG (which closed 27% higher). The rally came as new data showed that the world’s 500 richest people had collectively gained $1tn in 2017. But it was a volatile day for bitcoin. After surging 13% yesterday, the digital currency has fallen back this afternoon. It’s currently down 4% at $15,094 - having been valued at almost $20,000 10 days ago. This latest fluctuation came after Israel’s stock market regulator suggested it could ban cryptocurrency firms from listing on the Tel Aviv exchange. That’s all for tonight. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW The jump in commodity prices today helped to push the FTSE 100 to its record high, thanks to the various mining giants that are included in the index. Sky News explains: The rally was supported by an upturn in copper and other commodity prices, which helped to lift global mining giants including Fresnillo, Antofagasta and Glencore. Demand for commodities implies optimism about the outlook for rapidly advancing world economies such as China. Greg McKenna, chief strategist at AxiTrader, said: “The rally in copper supports expectations that 2018 is going to be a strong year for synchronised global growth.” Of course, the FTSE 100’s run of record highs is less impressive once you remember the tumble in sterling 18 months ago. The pound is still worth around 10% less than before the EU referendum; that made UK companies more affordable to overseas investors, and pumped up the value of their foreign earnings. Peer and pollster Lord Ashcroft tweets: The smaller, more domestically focused FTSE 250 has also hit a new record high tonight: Newsflash: the FTSE 100 index has closed at a new all time high of 7,620 points. Mining companies and supermarkets helped the index rise on the first trading day since Christmas. Newsflash: US consumer confidence has fallen back from its recent highs. The Conference Board’s measure of consumer confidence, just released, dropped to 122.1 in December, down from November’s 129.5 - which was the highest in 17 years. Lynn Franco, Director of Economic Indicators at The Conference Board, says: “The decline in confidence was fueled by a somewhat less optimistic outlook for business and job prospects in the coming months,” The wheels are coming off Bitcoin’s recovery. The crypocurrency is now down over 4% at $15,080, which means it has shed over $1,000 since this morning’s early bounce. Over in New York, the US stock market has opened very slightly higher as traders return to work after the Christmas break. The Dow Jones industrial average rose by 16 points, or 0.07%, with the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq also managed minuscule gains. While mining companies drove the FTSE 100 to today’s record high, engineering firm Rolls-Royce, building materials group Ferguson, broadcaster Sky and holiday firm TUI all held it back: Newsflash: Britain’s FTSE 100 has just hit a new all-time high, following the lead set by its little brother, the FTSE 250. The index of the biggest companies listed in London has risen by 22 points, or 0.3%, to 7615 - nudging over the previous intraday record set last Friday. The jump in commodity prices today, such as copper, has pushed mining stocks up (silver miner Fresnillo is the top performer, up almost 3%), with other natural resource companies also up. This means the FTSE 100 has gained around 6.6% this year, lagging behind other indexes such as the US Dow Jones (+25%), Germany’s DAX (+13%) or the Hong Kong Hang Seng (+34%). Maybe it was the prospect of Mrs Brown’s Boys as the highlight of TV on Christmas Day - but according to official HMRC figures, a total of 2,590 people said ‘bah humbug’ to the festivities and decided to spend the day filling in and submitting their tax return instead. Even as millions of kids across the globe were transfixed by Santa trackers on their computers, in the last hour of Christmas Eve, 92 grown-ups were instead glued to the HMRC’s homepage and sent in their tax returns between 23.00 and midnight. On Boxing Day, a further 7,655 returns arrived at HMRC. HMRC issued the figures as it began its annual plea to the 11m people in Britain who must complete a self-assessment form by January 31. This year it has a new advertising campaign, featuring ducks, of course. The strapline is “Don’t let your tax returns peck away at you”. It’s quackers. Via City AM, here’s a list of the billionaires who gained the most wealth in 2017. The full table is online here. Meanwhile a new poll in Greece has revealed that most citizens are not buying the leftist-led government’s cheery vision of a ‘clean exit’ from international supervision when the country’s latest bailout programme officially ends next year. Helena Smith reports from Athens In theory, Greeks should be going into the new year on an optimistic note. After seven years of gruelling austerity – the price of three economic adjustment programmes that have kept the debt stricken country afloat – Athens’ latest bailout officially expires in August 2018. But the excoriating terms attached to financial rescue won’t end there, with the result that most Greeks are not buying government assertions of post-bailout bliss come the summer. Instead, a poll conducted on behalf of the Real News newspaper by MRB Hellas found that 66.3% of respondents are convinced that international monitoring of Greek finances will continue in some form. A mere 17% accept the official version: that Greece will make a ‘clean exit,’ weaning itself off borrowed funds by returning to international capital markets. Under that scenario – one vividly expanded by prime minister Alexis Tsipras – Athens will have completed a compliance review in time for the country to build up a cash buffer that would enable it to return to markets and begin debt relief talks by the summer. However, only one in four Greeks expect a market return. Three out of five don’t think Greece would be able to tap markets to cover debt payments, according to the survey. Boom! Britain’s FTSE 250 index, which contains medium-sized companies too small for the FTSE 100, has hit a new alltime high. The FTSE 250 has gained 59 points to 20,540 this morning, putting it ahead of the previous record high set on 22 December. Offices group International Workplace Group (IWG) is leading the rally; its shares have jumped by almost 30% today after receiving a takeover offer from Canada’s Onex and Brookfield Asset Management. The FTSE 100 is also close to a record high today, up 13 points at 7606. Other European markets are lagging, though, with Germany’s DAX down 0.3% and Spain’s IBEX down 0.2%. Henry Croft at Accendo Markets explains: Miners are leading the FTSE’s charge higher after Copper traded a fresh three and half year high on Christmas Day, however a significant contribution from Oilers, the index’s largest sector, is aiding the latest foray in record territory. Continued concern as to the impact of last week’s Catalonian election victory for pro-independence parties, as well as a Euro recovery from its Christmas Day ‘flash crash’, are both weighing on mainland European equities, while US futures are clawing back gains following a negative Boxing day session impacted by an Apple sell-off. Commodity price are charging ahead today (doubtless pleasing billionaires in the raw materials sector). The copper price has hit its highest level in over three years, partly due to optimism that the strengthening global economy will push up demand. The prospect of supply cuts was also a factor - with China ordering its top producer to halt output for a week to combat winter pollution. Metal prices are also rising because the US dollar has weakened (as traders ponder the consequences of Donald Trump’s tax ‘reform’ plan). Palladium has hit a 17-year high, at $1,069 per ounce, while gold rose to $1.285 per ounce. The world’s roster of billionaires includes Tyler and Cameron Winkelvoss, the internet entrepreneurs who made a big investment in bitcoin back in 2011. Their $11m investment is probably worth around $1.3bn today - although their precise fortune is obviously as volatile as bitcoin itself. Craig Erlam of City firm OANDA predicts more wild price moves next year.... Bitcoin is going to continue to fascinate traders heading into the new year and while volatility by its own standards has been tame today, it’s likely to remain very active. Speculators appetite for Bitcoin has been tested in the run up to Christmas, with price having fallen from around $20,000 to not far from half that less than a week later, depending on the exchange. While prices have since rebounded back to around $15,000, it will be interesting to see whether we see the kind of wild gains that we’ve become accustomed to in the coming months, or whether the recent decline has shaken people’s confidence in the cryptocurrency. The world’s wealthiest people needn’t worry about their incomes being squeezed, though. New figures from Bloomberg show that the 500 richest people in the world saw their respective wealth expand by an astonishing 23% during 2017, from $4.4 trillion to over $5.3 trillion. Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon.com, had the best year - gaining over $34bn to become the world’s richest person at around $99.6bn, thanks to the surge in Amazon’s share price. The report also shows that lesser (!) billionaires also had a vintage year, as the strong gains on the world’s stock markets made the richest even richer (at a time when the average household in the UK was suffering from falling real wages) Here are some of the key points from Bloomberg’s report: The 38 Chinese billionaires on the Bloomberg index added $177 billion in 2017, a 65 percent gain that was the biggest of the 49 countries represented. Hui Ka Yan, founder of developer China Evergrande Group, added $25.9 billion, a 350 percent jump from last year, and the second-biggest U.S. dollar gain on the index, after Bezos. Technology billionaire Ma Huateng, co-founder of messaging service Tencent Holdings, became Asia’s second-richest person when his fortune nearly doubled to $41 billion. The number of Asian billionaires surpassed the U.S. for the first time, according to a UBS Group AG and PricewaterhouseCoopers report. The U.S. has the largest presence on the index, with 159 billionaires who added $315 billion, an 18 percent gain that gives them a collective net worth of $2 trillion. Russia’s 27 richest people put behind them the economic pain that followed President Vladimir Putin’s 2014 annexation of Crimea, adding $29 billion to $275 billion, surpassing the collective net worth they had before western economic sanctions began. It was also a banner year for tech moguls, with the 57 technology billionaires on the index adding $262 billion, a 35 percent increase that was the most of any sector on the ranking. Here’s the full story, which could fuel calls for higher wealth taxes to tackle the growing gap between the richest and everyone else. Hmmm, bitcoin’s rally seems to be fizzling out. The digital currency has now dipped back to around $15,500 - wiping out this morning’s gains. This sort of volatility is typical for bitcoin, but maybe the threat of a regulatory clampdown is worrying the market. FXTM’s Hussein Sayed says there are several reasons to be cautious: Israel became the most recent country to propose banning companies based on digital currencies to trade on its stock exchange. A South Korean bitcoin exchange has been hacked, leading it into bankruptcy. Cryptocurrency exchanges are disabling transaction temporarily due to high traffic. Professional traders on CBOE seems to be going short on Bitcoin. Britain should brace itself for another year of falling real wages. In news that might take the sparkle off your new year celebrations, the Resolution Foundation has predicted that pay rises won’t overtake inflation until the end of next year. If they’re right, that would mean the current cost of living squeeze will last two whole years. Rebecca Long-Bailey MP, Labour’s Shadow Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Secretary, blames the government’s economic policies: “The Resolution Foundation report succinctly encapsulates the hardship many across Britain are facing under the Tories and will continue to face in 2018. “After seven years of Conservative economic mismanagement, the figures speak for themselves. Real wages are still lower than they were in 2010 and Britain faces a productivity crisis. “This is not a Government willing or able to raise productivity and living standards for people in Britain.” Tech companies are suffering a hangover this morning, following reports that sales of Apple’s new iPhone X have been disappointing. Yesterday Taiwan’s Economic Daily reported that Apple will slash its sales forecast for the iPhone X in the first quarter to 30 million units, down from 50 million. This hit Asian chip makers overnight, and European technology companies are now following - sending the Stoxx 600 tech index down 1%. Austrian-based Apple supplier AMS is the biggest casualty, down almost 10% We had been expecting new UK mortgage data today, but it turns out that the figures are actually being released by UK Finance (the industry body) tomorrow. As predicted, European stock markets are rather quiet after the Christmas break. In London, the FTSE 100 is up a modest four points (perhaps traders are being distracted by the snowflakes that are now sweeping through the capital). Mining companies are leading the risers; Rio Tinto, Glencore, BHP Billiton and Anglo American have all gained around 1.5% while silver producer Fresnillo is up 2%. Jeremy Cook of World First sums up the situation: Bitcoin’s stumble last week came after two exchanges, CME and Cboe, both launched futures markets allowing investors to bet against the cryptocurrency - as this tweet shows: Shares in cryptocurrency-related companies have also risen today, on the back of bitcoin’s rebound. Reuters has the details: Internet provider GMO Internet Inc, which is engaged in the “mining” of bitcoin, rose 3.1%. Remixpoint Inc, an operator of virtual currency trading post services, gained 5%. The bitcoin futures price has also rebounded from last week’s slump. On CME Group’s new bitcoin derivatives market, the price of a bitcoin in January has risen by $430 today to $16,250. The bitcoin futures prices allow traders to bet on bitcoin falling, or rising, in value. As things stand, bitcoin has gained around 1,600% during 2017, despite last week’s wobble. Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, agrees that bitcoin looks like a bubble -- partly because it’s so hard to put a ‘proper’ value on it. He writes: After crashing by more than $8,000 from an all-time high, Bitcoin is up 3.5% at the time of writing. Although the recent plunge frightened many bitcoin fans, when looking at the relatively short history of bitcoin trading, the price action seems just normal. During 2017 the cryptocurrency crashed by 30% or more six times. Every fall was followed by huge price appreciation until it peaked on 17 December. Whether the Bitcoin bull market is close to an end or just pausing for a short break, remains to be a wild question for 2018. I still believe that Bitcoin is in a bubble formation. However, there’s no effective test to measure at which stage we are currently standing. For example, equity prices may be said in a bubble territory if investors are willing to pay much more for a stock than the intrinsic value which is justified by the discounted divided stream. Similarly, econometric tests may be run on bonds, commodities, currencies or any other asset to come up with a justified value. For Bitcoin, there isn’t any fundamental basis to justify the price. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. There’s a subdued atmosphere in the City of London this morning as traders struggle through the drizzle back to their desks following the Christmas break. But bitcoin is defying the quiet mood, and staging a strong recovery after its sharp plunge last week which saw it fall from around $19,000 to just $14,000 in two days. The price of bitcoin surged by 13% on Tuesday, and it’s extending those gains again this morning - currently changing hands at around $16,200. That should relieve those who jumped into the cryptocurrency arena in recent weeks, but may also spur concerns that the bitcoin bubble is still inflating. The rally comes despite another crackdown against bitcoin, this time from Israel. On Monday, Israel’s stock market regulator revealed plans to ban companies based on digital currencies from trading on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange. Shmuel Hauser, the chairman of the Israel Securities Authority, declared that the public need to be protected from potentially unscrupulous bitcoin operations: “If we have a company that their main business is digital currencies we would not allow it. If already listed, its trading will be suspended.” Hauser, who clearly isn’t a fan of bitcoin, added: “I think it looks like a bubble, smells like a bubble, acts like a bubble and feels like a bubble. This tough stance may embolden other regulators to take a closer look at bitcoin, which could mean further volatility in the weeks ahead. Apart from bitcoin, City traders will also be watching out for new UK home loan data this morning, and US consumer confidence stats this afternoon (unless they slope off early to finish off the mince pies). The agenda: 9:30am GMT: UK mortgage approvals data for November 3pm GMT: US Consumer Confidence index for December Update: the mortgage approvals figures have been pushed back to Thursday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/dec/27/unions-to-fight-casualisation-of-australias-workforce","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-27T01:42:22Z","webTitle":"Unions to fight casualisation of Australia's workforce","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/dec/27/unions-to-fight-casualisation-of-australias-workforce","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/dec/27/unions-to-fight-casualisation-of-australias-workforce","fields":{"headline":"Unions to fight casualisation of Australia's workforce","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Unions have signalled they will campaign for significant legislative changes to reverse the casualisation of the Australian workforce. In an interview with the Australian, the Australian Council of Trade Unions secretary, Sally McManus, said workforce casualisation would be a key priority for the union movement next year. “One of the key things we want to change for working people is turning around or reversing the casualisation of jobs,” she said. McManus said she would lobby Labor to support a new definition of casual work, which would include workers who have a “reasonable expectation of ongoing work” and who are completing regular shifts. Unions also want legislative changes to give casual workers the ability to automatically convert to permanent employment after six months with the same employer. Brendan O’Connor, the shadow workplace relations minister, said Labor was committed to examining the casualisation of the Australian workforce and the ACTU’s proposals. He said “something has to be done”, and indicated the need for an objective test to ensure casual employment was being used for proper purposes. “Too often now we see people working as their main job in what employers are deeming to be casual, even when they work for years on end,” he said. “For that reason, Labor is committed to examining this.” Industry groups have immediately dismissed the proposals, saying they are not new and had already been considered and rejected by the Fair Work Commission. Stephen Smith, the Australian Industry Group’s head of national workplace relations policy, said the union’s propositions, if adopted, would cause “enormous disruption”. “There’s about 12.5 million people in the workforce, there’s more than 2.5 million casuals,” Smith told Guardian Australia. “So any move to restrict casual employment would cause enormous disruption to employers, employees, and the broader community.” Smith dismissed the notion that casualisation was a worsening problem. He said the rate of casualisation had remained stable at 20% of the workforce for the past two decades. “There was an increase in casual employment in the mid 1990s, but it flattened off at 20% of the workforce in 1998, and we’re nearly at 2018 now,” he said. “So 20 years, casual employment has been at 20%. It hasn’t moved at all.” The federal government appears to have changed its focus on employment from the usual mantra of “jobs and growth” to the new slogan of “let’s keep Australians working”. Jobs Minister Michaelia Cash declared an economic revival fuelling strong jobs growth will be key to the coalition’s election fortunes, with her new super-portfolio to take centre stage. “To me that is just a good message that really does encapsulate what the government is all about – strengthening economic growth and creating more jobs for all Australians,” Cash told the West Australian. “We understand that Australian workers need Australian businesses to succeed if you are going to create more jobs and more opportunity.” McManus said the old slogan was being canned because it was clearly not ringing true. “There’s been more jobs, but they’ve been casual jobs,” she told reporters in Melbourne on Wednesday. “And growth? Well, we’ve seen profits grow but we haven’t seen wages grow. Wages are at a record low.” Labor’s O’Connor argued Australians did not need “patronising” or “insulting” slogans, but rather a government committed to ensuring wages were keeping up with prices. “We’d like the government to explore why is wage growth at its lowest in 20 years, and why are people confronted with only casual work, when in fact they have permanent families,” O’Connor said. “They need some sense of security in their workplace, they need opportunities at work that mean they can get a home loan or a car loan. But too often, you see that’s not happening.” The union’s proposal for automatic casual conversion was already considered in detail by the Fair Work Commission earlier this year, as part of its four-yearly review of modern awards. The ACTU had argued to the commission that casual employment was being improperly and unfairly used for “a significantly large category of workers” in a manner that undermined Australia’s safety net. Many casual workers were permanent in all but name, the union argued, and were afforded significantly inferior rights and conditions, despite working regularly for the same employer. That accords with the findings of the most recent Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (Hilda) study, which found 60% of workers who self-identified as casuals were doing regular shifts for an employer they had been with for at least six months. But the commission rejected the union’s conversion proposal, and instead gave workers the right to request a conversion to permanent employment after 12 months of regular work. Employers retained the right to reasonably refuse a casual worker’s request to become permanent. A 2015 report on workforce casualisation by Professor Raymond Markey of Macquarie University found casuals were most common in accommodation and food services (20%), retail (19%), and healthcare and social assistance (11%). It found about one quarter of Australian employees did not have leave benefits – a method of measuring casual employment. The proportion of casual employees increased rapidly in the 1990s, the report said, but stabilised in recent years. Regardless, Australia has a very high level of casual employment among OECD economies, the report found. But Smith said casual employment allowed for “critical” flexibility in the labour force. “When people are given the right to convert, very, very few pick up that right. They either don’t want to lose the flexibility that they enjoy with casual employment, or they don’t want to give up the 25% casual loading,” he said. “Whatever the reason, people seem happy with casual employment.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/27/australian-maria-elvira-pinto-esposto-death-penalty-malaysia","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-27T07:54:29Z","webTitle":"Australian woman escapes death sentence for drug trafficking in Malaysia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/27/australian-maria-elvira-pinto-esposto-death-penalty-malaysia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/27/australian-maria-elvira-pinto-esposto-death-penalty-malaysia","fields":{"headline":"Australian woman escapes death sentence for drug trafficking in Malaysia","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"An Australian woman has been found not guilty of drug trafficking in Malaysia, a charge that carries a mandatory death sentence. On Wednesday afternoon a Malaysian judge found that Maria Elvira Pinto Exposto did not know that there were drugs in her bag when customs officials found 1.1kg of ice – a potent form of methamphetamine – in her luggage at Kuala Lumpur airport in December 2014. Exposto’s lawyer, Muhammad Shafee Abdullah, said the judge was convinced of her innocence after hearing his client did not try to bypass searches at the airport. “The judge described her as naive, not merely innocent but naive,” he told reporters on Wednesday. After the hearing the judge ordered Exposto’s deportation from Malaysia, and she is currently being held in immigration detention. However the prosecution has indicated that it will appeal the decision, meaning that she is unlikely to be able to leave the country in the near future. Instead, Exposto’s lawyers have said that once an appeal is lodged they will file a bail application so that she can leave custody but remain in the country. Earlier Exposto’s lawyers had said their client would have been given a mandatory sentence of death by hanging if she was found guilty in the Malaysian high court. A 54-year-old grandmother and mother of four from Sydney, Exposto was arrested in December 2014 at Kuala Lumpur airport en route from Shanghai to Australia. But her lawyers argued Exposto was the victim of an online romance scam and believed she was in Shanghai to collect documents for her online boyfriend’s retirement from service in the US army to take to an embassy in Australia. Farhan Shafee, one of Exposto’s lawyers, said his client was the “victim of an internet romance scam”, most likely from west Africa. “When she was in Australia, Maria developed an online relationship with someone who she thought and perceived to be a captain in US army, stationed in Afghanistan,” Shafee told the Guardian. “This relationship developed for [about] a year, and during that time she’d given money to this online presence, believing that once he was discharged from the military they would be united and live happy ever after together in Australia.” Exposto said that before leaving Shanghai she was handed the bag containing the drugs by a friend of her online boyfriend’s and only saw clothes inside. But customs officials noticed an item inside that appeared “green” during scans of Exposto’s belongings at Kuala Lumpur airport. Upon closer inspection, they found odd pink and brown stitching at the back of the backpack. When they opened the stitching, grey packages were inside, customs official Mohd Noor Nashariq told the Shah Alam high court last year. Exposto’s lawyers said her behaviour before the arrest suggested she was “a victim” rather than a trafficker. Despite being able to remain in the transit area of the airport before her connecting flight to Australia, Exposto unnecessarily passed through customs and willingly approached officials to have her bags checked. “Unlike in Australia, in Malaysia customs doesn’t check everyone, so they would do a random selection as you pass through. But Maria voluntarily went and put her bag on the x-ray machine,” Shafee said. Malaysia has a mandatory death penalty by hanging for anyone found guilty of carrying more than 50 grams of a drug. In August the Malaysian government agreed to scrap the mandatory death penalty for drug traffickers by giving judges the discretion to give a life sentence in prison. However the change is yet to be ratified, and Exposto’s lawyers warned she faced a mandatory death sentence if convicted. Three Australian nationals have been executed by the state: Michael McAuliffe in 1993, and Kevin Barlow and Brian Chambers in 1986."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/live/2017/dec/27/newcastle-united-v-manchester-city-premier-league-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-27T21:56:22Z","webTitle":"Newcastle United 0-1 Manchester City: Premier League – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2017/dec/27/newcastle-united-v-manchester-city-premier-league-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2017/dec/27/newcastle-united-v-manchester-city-premier-league-live","fields":{"headline":"Newcastle United 0-1 Manchester City: Premier League – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"If your appetite for words about this match is not yet sated, here’s a match report for you. My work here is done. Bye! A couple of City players talk. First Raheem Sterling: I thought they soaked up the pressure really well and tried to counter-attack. We didn’t make it easy for ourselves but it shows the team spirit that we dug in, stayed together, stayed calm an got the win. At the end of the day we need to keep winning, keep getting three points. And then Bernardo Silva: We knew it would be a tough game. We played well in the first half. It’s not easy to play against a team that has 11 players behind the ball, and the last few games have been like this. In the second half, the last 10 minutes, it was very hard to keep the advantage but we did it. When you win 18 games in a row, you have to expect that teams will do whatever they can to try to stop you. We have to keep working the same way we have been doing since the start of the season, and that’s what we will be doing. We’re still in December, we just finished the first round. We have to play the second round with the same spirit and the same hunger. Newcastle were woeful in the first half, but they did enough in the second to worry City. They may be on to something: play defensively and all-round-abysmally enough to make Pep think he can take off defenders and bring on strikers, and then profit later on from their lack of defenders. It relies on City not scoring five goals while they’re totally dominant, and they could have done that - and surely would have had Murphy got a first-half red card - but it’s an approach that nearly paid dividends. Another telling statistic: 90+4 mins: The referee sounds his whistle for the final time, and they’ve won again. Eighteen in a row now. 90+3 mins: City are wobbling here. This has blossomed eventually into an exciting match. Sane, though, wobbles literally, after a Newcastle player runs into the back of him. Free kick. 90+1 mins: Newcastle push again, but Shelvey’s wayward shot from 25 yards ruins things. Goal kick. 90+1 mins: There will be three minutes of stoppage time. It starts with Danilo conceding a throw-in, which is something he seems to have done a lot of in the last quarter-hour. 89 mins: Ooooooh! A cross from the left, and Gayle throws his entire self at it in an attempt to generate enough power to score. And he does generate enough power to score, but not enough accuracy. Goal kick, but it was close. 87 mins: Murphy tries to lob the ball over the defence. Danilo heads it away. The crowd roars. They really have done their very best to be encouraging here. 86 mins: Gundogan has a shot from 30 yards which is terribly high and terribly wide. It is his team’s 21st shot of the night, of which six have been on target. 85 mins: City’s second-half failings exposed: 82 mins: With the game becoming stretched City bring on Sane, who is perfectly equipped to profit from it. Silva comes off. 82 mins: Newcastle look the more likely scorers at the moment. Gayle has a shot from outside the area, which deflects out for a throw-in. 81 mins: City win a free kick, which De Bruyne dinks into the area. But it’s headed out, Murphy does excellently to carry the ball to the half-way line and then passes to Yedlin, who is, criminally, offside. 79 mins: Sterling’s shot deflects to Jesus, who tries to backheel in but makes little contact. The linesman keeps his flag down, and that would have been a hilariously offside goal had it gone in. 77 mins: Aguero, who has not been at his best but should still have scored tonight , comes off, with Mangala coming on. And for Newcastle Mbemba is replaced by Merino. 76 mins: This game isn’t won yet, though. The home fans have worked this out, and are quite excited to be just the 1-0 down. 75 mins: Newcastle attack! Gayle bursts into the area, runs in front of Danilo and flings himself to the ground. The crowd roars again; Gayle is booked for diving. 74 mins: Newcastle string several passes together in their own half, each one uproariously oléd by the home fans. 73 mins: City win a corner, and De Bruyne doesn’t take it. Sterling does instead, and it’s headed away. 70 mins: Another substitution for Newcastle, who bring off Aarons and bring on Atsu. 69 mins: Aarons runs towards a loose ball on the right flank, inside City’s half. The crowd roars. Danilo gets there first, falls over and gets a free kick. 66 mins: De Bruyne hits the post! Newcastle nick the ball away from City and start heading upfield, the only problem being that none of them have actually got the thing. Danilo comes and claims it and passes to De Bruyne, whose 25-yarder clatters the meat of the upright. It rebounds to Aguero, who tucks it away but is offside. 64 mins: Newcastle have been much better in this second half: City’s possession is down to just 82%. 62 mins: Newcastle make a change, taking off Joselu and bringing on the pacier Gayle. 60 mins: Sterling, found wide on the left, controls the ball beautifully and then executes a series of showy shimmies and feints without moving the ball or progressing things in any way, before passing backwards and the move peters out. 56 mins: Chance for De Bruyne, who plays a one-two with Jesus, runs into the area and then sidefoots way wide with his left foot. I think they’ve been pretty irrelevant, but that the ownership models of Chelsea, Manchester City and Manchester United, and a couple of others, lack any relation to decency and humanity and all things good. At least City play enjoyable football, though, which is something. 54 mins: So far this half City’s short passing around the penalty area has been a little imprecise. Gundogan finds a way around the problem by not passing, and instead running to the edge of the box before shooting, but Elliot saves. 51 mins: Newcastle boot the ball out of defence and Joselu doesn’t just flick it on, he also gets on the end of his own flick on. Then he’s tackled. 50 mins: Sterling wriggles between two defenders and into the penalty area before shooting across goal, but he doesn’t get enough curl on the ball for it to go in, and it doesn’t go wide enough for it to set up Aguero. Goal kick. 46 mins: Peeeep! We’re back under way, with no changes to either side. Manchester City had 83% of possession in the first half, and 15 shots to Newcastle’s three. There have been hints that City might be defensively vulnerable - the only time Newcastle put a decent ball into the penalty area they pretty much self-destructed - but the home side have only tested them the once. Here’s a painfully revealing statistic: 45+2 mins: Of all the tactical finagling that various teams have attempted in an effort to avoid defeat to Manchester City, Newcastle’s tonight must be among the most inept. On the plus side, they’re only one goal down, and an upset remains theoretically possible, which is a victory of sorts. 45+1 mins: And into stoppage time we roll. There’ll be a minute or so of it. 45 mins: A prolonged spell of City possession in irrelevant areas, mostly within 20 yards of the half-way line. 42 mins: Another ludicrous De Bruyne pass to Sterling, who finds Aguero, who shoots wide. 40 mins: City counter-attack in numbers and really should have scored, but Sterling’s pass to De Bruyne was a little weak, and after that all the precision disappeared from the move. Aguero did have a shot, though, which went wide. 40 mins: Newcastle win two corners. Two! 39 mins: Fernandinho trips Aarons as Newcastle try to break, and would have been booked but for a) the referee being a bit embarrassed about the whole Jacob Murphy business; and b) he actually didn’t touch him. 37 mins: The last five minutes, since Newcastle woke up to the fact that their tactics were failing abysmally, have been quite fun. “I recently learned that guitar legend Mark Knopfler hails from Newcastle, and that the St. James’ Park PA plays his song Local Hero on match days,” writes Peter Oh. “Given today’s visitors, segueing straight into Money for Nothing would have been a nice touch.” 36 mins: “Rafa probably does not want Newcastle to win but to draw heroically,” writes Ian Copestake. “Otherwise he won’t be able to read out his list of demands necessary to join the elite.” 34 mins: Newcastle nearly score! A really good goal!A looping cross from the right bounces to Aarons on the left of the area, and with Ederson coming out he lifts the ball over the goalkeeper, and it would have gone in had Otamendi not headed it off the line! 33 mins: The goal was, I think, City’s 13th shot of the game. Newcastle had 10 men behind the ball, and still there was a steady stream of chances. It was just total tosh. 32 mins: It’s all very well playing defensively, but Newcastle have defended pretty hopelessly, while simultaneously offering no attacking threat whatsoever, except for from kick-offs. The most hilariously one-sided half-hour of football ends with City taking the lead in stylish, um, style. Sterling has the ball on the left wing, passes inside to De Bruyne and sets off for the penalty area; De Bruyne lifts the ball into his path and Sterling swings a left foot to divert the ball in at the near post. 30 mins: Aguero, 25 yards out, goes past Mbemba and sends a dipping shot onto the outside of the far post. 28 mins: An excellent long pass sets Aguero running against Mbemba. The Argentinian realises that he won’t win the header, so at the last moment stops and positions himself where he thinks Mbemba’s clearing header might drop. Mbemba’s clearing header drops onto his chest. He then fluffs a pass to Sterling, but that was lovely anticipation. 27 mins: Newcastle’s shot direct from the kick-off mean they are behind on the shot count by just 10 to one. 26 mins: De Bruyne shoots wildly high from the edge of the area, having been picked out by Otamendi’s no-look 25-yard pass. 25 mins: I mean, Yedlin touched the ball maybe two yards beyond the half-way line, and sent it straight to a blue shirt. 24 mins: To describe that single Newcastle touch as “danger” is hilariously but beautifully optimistic. 22 mins: Newcastle kick the ball in the Manchester City half! Just once, but it’s a start. 18 mins: That free kick came from a Jacob Murphy foul on Gundogan which Gary Neville thinks should have led to a red card. He’s got a point, as well - he landed his foot studs-first on Gundogan’s leg, nowhere near the ball. The linesman is a few yards away, and flags for a foul; Murphy isn’t even booked. 17 mins: Another free kick from out wide, and De Bruyne’s delivery is perfect this time, Aguero heads and Elliot saves brilliantly! 16 mins: Another City corner, and a better delivery from De Bruyne, but the ball bounces through the area and out the other side.“As a Bristol City fan, I’ve always had a liking for Luton Town since learning about their 12-0 victory over Bristol Rovers on 13th April 1936,” writes Steven Hughes. “Luton’s wing-half, Joe Paine was played up the pitch at centre-forward, due to the club’s injury crisis: he hit 10 of his side’s 12 goals that day.” A fine yarn, of which more here: 15 mins: Newcastle, closing down their opponents, force City to pass back to Ederson, an event that is loudly cheered by the home fans. It is as close as they’ve come to attacking since the first second of the game. 14 mins: Aguero, briefly free in the area after a one-two, is closed down and wins only a corner, which leads to another corner, which leads to nothing much. 13 mins: Walker is tripped, winning a free kick, but De Bruyne’s delivery is - whisper it - not very good. 11 mins: Just before the substitution, De Bruyne blasts a shot wide from a decent position on the edge of the penalty area. 10 mins: Fortunately it looks unlikely that City will need to do any defending tonight, so Kompany isn’t strictly necessary. Indeed, Guardiola is going to bring on Jesus. 9 mins: Unbelievably, Vincent Kompany appears to be injured. 7 mins: Chance for City! And it should have gone in! Fernandino sends a dipping diagonal ball into the area, and it arrows onto the toe of Aguero, just beyond the far post, who prods wide! I think Elliot might have got a touch to it, but it’s a goal kick. 4 mins: Newcastle string two passes together. They might even have completed three, just. But they are protecting their area well, and so far City have tried two crosses that have flown straight to Elliot, and one long-range Otamendi shot that flew wide. 3 mins: Newcastle, playing as expected with five at the back, have had possession for less than three seconds so far. Elliot is the only member of their team to have had control of the ball. 1 min: Action! And we’ve had our first shot on target! Shelvey had a pop from the kick-off, and Ederson caught it easily. Pre-match ad-break complete, there’s nothing now between us and action. And they emerge from the tunnel. Nice to see a team eschew the current trend for Premier League anthem-specific leisurewear: City are in snuggly long-sleeved training tops, but Newcastle just wear their kits. The players are betunneled. That sounds like a moment. A bit like when Ashley Young returns to Watford, only with applause and happiness. Rafael Benitez speaks on his selection and tactics. He’s giving nothing away: They have three games in a few days so we use the squad. At the moment we have an idea. We’ll try to stop them, try to go forward and score. We have a chance to have players everywhere around the ball, and we’ll try to do it. And Pep Guardiola speaks about his first visit to Newcastle, and his squad rotation. Yeah, it’s the first time. Nice to be here. Because it’s a famous stadium, a famous club. A lot of tradition. We have a lot of games. Everybody’s going to play. There have, it must be said, been more revelatory interviews. For me football clubs fall into three rough groups: the one I support, the ones I am ambivalent about, and a few that I dislike, mainly because of some pathetic grudge picked up in the away end about 20 years ago. In addition I have liked particular teams that have represented random clubs or countries at various points in our shared histories, but I can’t really think of any teams I’m particularly fond of at the moment, though I have something of a blossoming crush on Huddersfield. David Silva misses the game with unspecified personal issues, which have apparently forced him to once again return to Spain. The game will be poorer for his absence and I hope whatever-it-is resolves itself as happily and swiftly as possible. And three changes for City: IN come the three players who came off the bench against Bournemouth, namely Danilo, Gundogan and Bernardo Silva. OUT go Delph, David Silva and Sane. That’s five - count ‘em - changes for Newcastle. IN come Mbemba, Dummett, Murphy, Shelvey and Aarons, while OUT slip Clark, Ritchie, Saivet, Atsu and Perez. The team sheets have been handed in, and tonight’s protagonists will be ... Newcastle: Elliot, Mbemba, Lascelles, Dummett, Yedlin, Shelvey, Diame, Manquillo, Murphy, Aarons, Joselu. Subs: Clark, Gayle, Ritchie, Perez, Merino, Darlow, Atsu. Man City: Ederson, Walker, Kompany, Otamendi, Danilo, De Bruyne, Fernandinho, Gundogan, Bernardo Silva, Aguero, Sterling. Subs: Bravo, Mangala, Sane, Adarabioyo, Gabriel Jesus, Toure, Diaz. Referee: Andre Marriner. Hello world! Manchester United have tried. Chelsea, Liverpool and Tottenham have had a go. Arsenal, Burnley, Leicester and Watford have chanced their arm. Huddersfield, Brighton, Stoke and Southampton gave it a whirl. Crystal Palace, the Wests Ham and Brom and Swansea have all taken their shot. Bournemouth have done it twice. Only Everton, who earned an honourable draw at the Etihad back in August, haven’t failed completely. Tonight Manchester City complete the set: Newcastle are the last club to come up against Pep Guardiola’s rampaging record-compiling league leaders. Can they be stopped? Well, let’s examine the evidence. Since 21 October, when Newcastle beat Crystal Palace 1-0 at home, Rafa Benitez’s side have been officially the worst in the Premier League, amassing four points from 10 games, scoring nine times. In the same time City have won 30 points and scored 28. Since the start of 2007 City have won seven times here, drawn twice and never lost, their recent head-to-head record against Newcastle so good that if they avoid defeat tonight it would set a new club record for games unbeaten against a single team, at 20. In short, Benitez’s pre-match exhortation for his side, having beaten West Ham last time out, to “back that result up against Manchester City” sounds not so much optimistic as downright hilarious. Still, it’s a funny old game etc and so forth, anything can happen, and you never know who has perhaps a few too many festive mince pies and imbibed one dram of brandy too many. Time will tell, and I’m glad to be spending that time with you. Unless you go somewhere else.

His Chelsea side had huffed and puffed their way through the opening period, their shot tally mounting without success (for all that their efforts were occasionally rather wild), with Brighton &amp; Hove Albion holding firm until concentration lapsed in the opening 40 seconds after the break. The champions would eventually win in comfort to paper over some of the cracks but a half century of shots in the fixtures either side of Christmas have yielded only two goals. The Italian was rather stating the obvious with his post-match assessment that “if we learn to be more clinical, and to try to exploit the many chances we have during games, it will be better for us”. Álvaro Morata now has 10 goals, six assisted by César Azpilicueta, to show for his first Premier League campaign, and yet it is still tempting to wonder whether Diego Costa’s brute strength or ability to unnerve his markers, whether legitimately or not, is still being missed. Certainly while this contest drifted Chelsea were far too reliant upon Eden Hazard for inspiration, with the Belgian retreating ever deeper to collect the ball. He was only properly liberated once the hosts were ahead. Conte will use his team’s initial toils here, as well as at Goodison Park on Saturday, as evidence that reinforcements are required next month: another forward to ease the burden on both Morata and Hazard, a forward-thinking wing-back to challenge Marcos Alonso down the left and, if the budgets stretch far enough, maybe a central creator. Alonso, plucked from Fiorentina in the summer of 2016, has been excellent since returning to the English game and forced Mat Ryan into fine blocks from a free‑kick and a header before flicking another Cesc Fàbregas corner into the far corner on the hour. That was his fifth goal this term and broke Brighton’s resistance for good on a day the hosts leant upon their Spanish contingent – Alonso, Fàbregas, Morata and Azpilicueta – to see them home. No club across Europe’s elite five leagues boasts more goals scored by Spanish players. It was still Hazard who illuminated the occasion. His own standards rarely dip these days, even while team-mates labour in possession or in the pass. The 26-year-old has the speed of thought to unsettle even the most stubborn of rivals, with his scuttling presence alone enough to distract a resolute back line. Chelsea’s problems tend to stem from opponents swarming around the playmaker’s every touch, which forces the collective ever deeper in their buildup play. At least they boasted an aerial threat here which eventually yielded a lead, Azpilicueta whipping in a centre beyond Lewis Dunk for Morata, in between centre-halves, to guide home via Ryan’s outstretched left hand. Conte could bask in the onfield relationship which has been struck between ball-playing centre-half and No9. “Morata owes Azpi not one dinner, but many,” he joked. “And I want them to invite me, also.” He could afford to smile at the end, raising a glass of Champagne to wish the room a merry Christmas before departing with the gap to Manchester United in second place trimmed to a single point. One defeat in 11 league games would normally be cause for celebration, but Manchester City have warped accepted levels of excellence this term. The summit still feels distant. Brighton had reason to curse their lapse of concentration and subsequent concession at a set play, and have their own problems in front of goal, having registered a solitary penalty in their meetings with the top six over the first half of the season. They had sacrificed some invention here, with Anthony Knockaert and Pascal Gross starting on the bench, but, for all their defensive discipline, were still rather too blunt for comfort and never came closer than Shane Duffy’s header which drifted wide of the far post. Their more pivotal occasions will be against Newcastle and Bournemouth over the remainder of the festive period. January will see the pursuit renewed of a striker to supplement the ranks, though any move for Moussa Dembélé – Chris Hughton denied any contact with Celtic, rather than any interest – will surely be challenged by rivals. Chelsea, amongst others, have monitored the Frenchman’s progress since his switch north of the border from Fulham. If the Scottish champions will indeed listen favourably to offers in excess of £25m, plenty will consider the forward’s credentials. “Particularly in January, what you’d like to do and what you can do can be different things,” said Hughton, whose moves for Vincent Janssen and Florin Andone had floundered on deadline day in August. “It’s a tough time to bring players in. Clubs don’t like losing players and their demands are high. But, if we can strengthen, we will.” Brighton are 12th beyond the campaign’s halfway point and can be proud of their efforts so far, but their manager is well aware of the potential pitfalls ahead."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/27/girls-mental-health-crisis-harassment-abuse-poverty","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-27T11:00:15Z","webTitle":"Girls are facing a mental health crisis – and it’s not just because of Instagram | Katharine Sacks-Jones","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/27/girls-mental-health-crisis-harassment-abuse-poverty","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/27/girls-mental-health-crisis-harassment-abuse-poverty","fields":{"headline":"Girls are facing a mental health crisis – and it’s not just because of Instagram","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"In 2017 there has been report after report of a growing gender divide in mental health, with rising rates of mental illness among girls and young women. There has been little action to tackle these. In 2018, we have an opportunity to get things right. From the intervention of a senior judge in the case of Girl X to rising numbers of girls and young women undergoing mental health admissions, self harm and suicidal thoughts, there has been wide range of evidence over the last year showing that our girls are facing a mental health crisis. The reasons given by commentators for the worrying deterioration in young women and girls’ mental health tend to be the same: pressures of social media, body image and school. These things are undoubtedly part of the picture. But they are not the full story. One of the biggest issues of the year has been the spotlight shone on sexual violence, harassment and abuse – from Harvey Weinstein and Westminster to the grooming gangs targeting vulnerable girls. This is an issue that is not going away. For young women, the risks are particularly marked. They are facing sexual pressures, including from the availability of porn, which is informing relationships and driving the way men and boys behave towards girls and women. Sexual harassment and assaults in schools have increased in recent years. Sexual abuse and exploitation of girls remains widespread and young women are the most at-risk group for domestic abuse. When you look at the types of mental health problems young women face, the more common disorders such as depression and anxiety are, as you might expect, widespread. But what is perhaps especially shocking is the prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder, which one in seven young women experience. Far from this being a condition solely affecting veterans returning from wars, young women are being traumatised by sexual and physical violence and abuse on the streets, in our schools and in their homes. The links between mental health issues and violence are well-established. Research for Agenda has found that out of all women who face a mental health problem, more than half have been abused. For one in four, that started in childhood. At the same time, 2017 has seen a further increase in poverty, something that disproportionately affects women and children and which is another risk factor for poor mental health. There can be a tendency for commentators to look at mental health from a middle-class perspective, and to focus on social media, body image pressure and exam stress as causes. But we know that the links between poor mental health and poverty are marked. We need to better understand and respond to these links. We need to help young women now, not store up problems for the future. Unresolved trauma and the stresses and pressure of poverty underpin many mental health issues. For some girls, their way of coping is to self-harm. For others, it is using drugs and alcohol – sometimes, it is both. This can lead to more problems such as addiction and homelessness, leaving women even more vulnerable to exploitation and enduring poverty. To avoid this, we need to make sure help is available earlier. We urgently need to invest in mental health support in schools and communities that takes into account the particular needs of girls and young women, and identifies and supports those with experiences of abuse and trauma. The government recently published a green paper on how to help children and young people with their mental health. Any real analysis of gender disparities was, however, lacking. But it is not too late, as these plans are currently out for consultation. 2018 is a chance to get them right. Next year there will also be a review of the Mental Health Act, legislation on the use of restraint (something which again disproportionately affects girls and young women), and a domestic violence bill offering an historic opportunity to improve the response of public services to abuse. I am also delighted to be co-chairing, alongside junior health minister Jackie Doyle-Price, the Women’s Mental Health Taskforce. This brings together experts on women’s mental health and involves key national organisations responsible for policy, commissioning and delivery of services, including NHS England and Public Health England. This is an opportunity to address and reverse the rising tide of mental ill health among young women. Above all, in 2018, we must not ignore this alarming crisis, and acknowledge that gender inequality is a key driver. We need to recognise the impact of violence, abuse and poverty on young women and girls, and act now to prevent it having a devastating impact on their lives. • Katherine Sack-Jones is director of Agenda, an alliance of 50 charities working to help women and girls at risk"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sport/2017/dec/26/lewis-hamilton-accused-of-humiliating-his-young-nephew-online","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-26T22:30:40Z","webTitle":"Lewis Hamilton apologises for 'inappropriate' comments about nephew","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/dec/26/lewis-hamilton-accused-of-humiliating-his-young-nephew-online","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/dec/26/lewis-hamilton-accused-of-humiliating-his-young-nephew-online","fields":{"headline":"Lewis Hamilton apologises for 'inappropriate' comments about nephew","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Lewis Hamilton has apologised for making “inappropriate comments” about his young nephew wearing a dress. The Formula One world champion was accused of humiliating his nephew online after he posted a video in which he disapproved of his relative’s choice of Christmas attire, telling him: “Boys don’t wear princess dresses.” Hamilton has since deleted the Instagram post, which showed his nephew wearing a purple and pink outfit and carrying a pink wand with a heart on it. He was heavily criticised for negatively stereotyping his nephew on the basis of his gender. On Tuesday, Hamilton told his 5.2 million followers on Twitter that he regretted his “unacceptable” post. In the video he posted on Instagram, he said: “I’m so sad right now. Look at my nephew,” , as the camera focuses on the boy. “Why are you wearing a princess dress? Is this what you got for Christmas?” he asks, as the boy nods delightedly. “Why did you ask for a princess dress for Christmas?” he goes on. “Because it’s pretty,” the boy replies enthusiastically, waving the pink wand. “Boys don’t wear princess dresses!” says Hamilton. The 32-year-old was abroad celebrating Christmas with his family when he posted the video. In response, Travis Alabanza, a performance artist, had said: “I hope Lewis Hamilton properly thinks and apologises to his nephew for that video.” In November, the Guardian revealed that Hamilton avoided paying tax on his £16.5m private jet by using an Isle of Man scheme that is to be investigated by HM Revenue and Customs. Before that, his use of social media has caused various controversies, from saying “this s--- is killing me” on Snapchat during a Formula One press conference in Japan, to taking selfies while riding a Harley-Davidson motorbike in New Zealand."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/dec/26/might-bite-wins-king-george-vi-chase-kempton-nicky-henderson-horse-racing","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-26T15:30:29Z","webTitle":"Might Bite wins King George VI Chase at Kempton for Nicky Henderson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/dec/26/might-bite-wins-king-george-vi-chase-kempton-nicky-henderson-horse-racing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/dec/26/might-bite-wins-king-george-vi-chase-kempton-nicky-henderson-horse-racing","fields":{"headline":"Might Bite wins King George VI Chase at Kempton for Nicky Henderson","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"“He likes to say ‘look at me’,” Nicky Henderson said of Might Bite after the King George VI Chase here on Tuesday, and it seems that a horse with a reputation for melodrama no longer needs to shout. While Might Bite idled after the last and allowed Double Shuffle, a 50-1 chance, to within a length at the line, this was as polished and professional as he has ever been. The question now is whether he can also resist the urge to ham it up on the hill at Cheltenham in March. If so his new price of 6-1 for the Gold Cup, for which he is second-favourite behind Sizing John, could look very generous, though Henderson and Nico de Boinville, his jockey, have long since learned to take nothing for granted where Might Bite is concerned. Twice in the past Might Bite has jumped the last at Cheltenham and then veered sharply rights towards the exit from the course, seemingly happy that he has done enough. If he tries to do it for a third time on 16 March, De Boinville should at least be ready for him. Even the final fence here was cleared without incident, banishing the memory of last year’s Kauto Star Novice Chase, when Might Bite fell at the last when 20 lengths clear of his field. Instead, it was Might Bite’s main opponents who found various ways to beat themselves. Fox Norton, who was running over three miles for the first time, was pulled up before the third-last after weakening suddenly not long after starting the final mile. Bristol De Mai, the second-favourite, made a few uncharacteristic mistakes on the first circuit and was also a spent force before the turn out of the back straight on the second circuit, while Thistlecrack, last year’s King George winner, ran better than he had on his return to action this month without ever threatening to trouble the favourite. Whisper, a stable-companion of the winner, was also beaten a long way out. That left Might Bite and De Boinville in a dominant position on the turn for home, several lengths clear of Double Shuffle and another outsider, Tea for Two, with just three fences to jump. Whether Might Bite was tiring in the final quarter-mile, or simply idling in front as De Boinville suggested, may be a cause for debate in the run-up to the Festival, but the jockey was in little doubt. “I think he would have gone again if something had come to me,” he said. “You don’t jump the last like he did if you’re a tired horse.” Sizing John, last year’s Gold Cup winner, is a probable runner in the Grade One Christmas Chase at Leopardstown on Thursday. Yorkhill, also a possible runner in the same race, is the only other horse at a single-figure price for the Festival, so Might Bite seems sure to be the leading British-trained contender for a race that has gone to Ireland in three of the past four seasons. “We have our little scheme, which is to try not to press before the last,” Henderson said. “If you don’t let him know that it is the last, then you can go for your life after it. I could see that Nico was on a good stride a long way out from it. What happened here last year was just one of those things and it didn’t happen again today. “The question now is what do we do next? We’ll probably have another run but it won’t be a slog in a bog, wherever it is, and if it froze up until March that wouldn’t bother me. Now he has just got to behave himself at Cheltenham. It’s a different ball game and he will probably want to go right after the last.” Henderson completed a Grade One double on the day thanks to Buveur D’Air’s bloodless success at 2-11 in the Christmas Hurdle, and last year’s Champion Hurdle winner is the narrow favourite to retain his title at 15-8, ahead of Faugheen, the 2016 winner, on 9-4. Black Corton, meanwhile, is a 20-1 chance for the RSA Chase after winning for the sixth time in seven starts for Bryony Frost in the Kauto Star Novice Chase. Frost, who was making her debut at Grade One level, is only the second female riding to win at the highest level in Britain following the success of Lizzie Kelly on Tea For Two in the same race two year ago. “This little horse started off just an average little chap at the back of the class, but now he’s an A-star student,” Frost said. “It is a little bit awesome. Today, I’ve made a memory.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/26/chechnya-ramzan-kadyrov-social-media-russia-instagram-facebook","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-26T11:22:49Z","webTitle":"Russia calls for answers after Chechen leader's Instagram is blocked","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/26/chechnya-ramzan-kadyrov-social-media-russia-instagram-facebook","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/26/chechnya-ramzan-kadyrov-social-media-russia-instagram-facebook","fields":{"headline":"Russia calls for answers after Chechen leader's Instagram is blocked","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The Russian internet watchdog has demanded an explanation from Facebook and Instagram over the blocking of social media accounts belonging to the controversial Chechen leader, Ramzan Kadyrov. Kadyrov has accused the US government of pressuring the social networks to disable his accounts, which he said were blocked on Saturday without explanation. The US imposed travel and financial sanctions on Kadyrov last week over numerous allegations of human rights abuses. The former rebel fighter, who is now loyal to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, is a fan of social media, particularly Instagram, which he has used in recent years to make barely veiled death threats against Kremlin critics. He has also used Instagram to issue official Chechen government statements, and post bizarre images of himself wrestling crocodiles and cuddling tigers. Last year, Kadyrov appealed for information on Instagram about his lost cat, which inspired mockery from the comedian John Oliver. Kadyrov has more than 3 million followers on his Russian-language Instagram account and more than 750,000 on Facebook. His less popular English-language Instagram account is still active. Roskomnadzor, the media and telecoms regulator, said it would officially request an answer from the companies. Leonid Levin, the head of the Russian parliament’s information technologies and communications committee, suggested the move by Facebook and Instagram was an attack on freedom of speech. Dzhambulat Umarov, the Chechen press and information minister, described the blocking of Kadyrov’s accounts as a “vile” cyber-attack by the US. Neither Instagram nor Facebook had commented at the time of publication. In 2015, Kadyrov urged Chechen men not to let their wives use the WhatsApp messaging service after an online outcry over the forced marriage of a 17-year-old Chechen to a 47-year-old police chief. “Do not write such things. Men, take your women out of WhatsApp,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/live/2017/dec/26/liverpool-v-swansea-city-premier-league-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-26T19:36:52Z","webTitle":"Liverpool 5-0 Swansea City: Premier League – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2017/dec/26/liverpool-v-swansea-city-premier-league-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2017/dec/26/liverpool-v-swansea-city-premier-league-live","fields":{"headline":"Liverpool 5-0 Swansea City: Premier League – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"And with that I’m off. Andy Hunter’s match report will be with you very soon, but here’s a sneak preview of the first paragraph. Bye! Huw Jenkins, the Swansea City chairman, slumped lower and lower in his padded seat in the Anfield directors’ box as Liverpool served up a Boxing Day rout. Jurgen Klopp’s team were a league apart from the struggling south Wales club and next season they will be unless Leon Britton, or whoever does replace Paul Clement on a full-time basis, can conjure another remarkable escape from relegation. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain isn’t happy with his own performance. It’s not often a player says something interesting and considered in a post-match interview: I was a bit disappointed with myself. Happy I got the goal in the end. I managed to work hard through the 90 minutes, and the goal made it a bit better. We knew we had to step up second half, and I think we did that. I just want more out of myself, and there were a few moments when I thought I could have done better. We train every day and when you get into certain situations, you work hard to get into those situations, you want to do better. There was a few times today I could have done better, for sure. But 5-0 for the boys, I’m really happy with that. I just want to keep pushing myself to do better, which is why I’m not so happy. There was good quality all round, it’s a positive result and we can build from it. But for a gorgeous opening goal, the first half was a massive disappointment. But eventually Liverpool got in the flow, and from there Swansea were in very deep trouble. 90+3 mins: Mignolet makes a save! A cross from the right, and Tammy Abraham’s header is looping in until Mignolet flings out a fist and pushes it behind! And the referee’s had enough – that’s the last touch of the game. 90+2 mins: The wall jumps, and Coutinho’s shot hits the top of it. 90+2 mins: Liverpool have a free kick, just outside the area, the perfect shooting position. Perhaps a little too close. 90+1 mins: As we enter the first of three minutes of stoppage time Solanke flings out a leg but can’t get his studs on Milner’s low cross. 88 mins: Lallana’s long-ranger floats high, and probably also wide. “I’m pleased to see Liverpool pick up maximum points, but Swansea are a likeable club and I hate to see them so deep in the relegation doldrums,” writes Peter Oh. “They’re in real trouble, aren’t they?” Oh indeed, of the deepest, darkest, foulest kind. 88 mins: And another chance! Coutinho chips the ball into the box, and Solanke’s volley flies a couple of feet wide of the far post. 87 mins: Nearly another! Can’s lovely pass finds Milner on the left of the area; he nudges it inside, off a defender to Solanke, who has no time and no space and whose shot hits Fabianski. 85 mins: Oxlade-Chamberlain has another shot, but this one is deflected wide off Olsson. 85 mins: Swansea win a corner! Mawson’s header loops wide. Goal kick. Lallana has a chance, stopped by Mawson’s studs, but Swansea can’t clear. Oxlade-Chamberlain wins it, the ball goes to Alexander-Arnold on the right, whose cross hits a defender and bounces back to AOC, who hits a lovely shot that dips in at the far post! 82 mins: Finally Solanke tries to get into the area, and is tackled. Swansea have the ball for several seconds, before giving it away again. 81 mins: Liverpool stroke the ball about for a while. 78 mins: Renato Sanches comes on for Swansea, replacing Fer. 77 mins: Lallana gets into the area, spins, goes back a bit, spins again, goes forward again and then shoots over. 77 mins: Swansea win a corner! Certainly one of the highlights of their half. Milner heads it clear. 75 mins: Liverpool’s final substitution brings Milner on in place of Robertson. 74 mins: Had Oxlade-Chamberlain completed his attempted return pass to Coutinho it would have completed an excellent move and Liverpool would have had another excellent chance. But he didn’t, because a defender intercepted. 71 mins: Alexander-Arnold, who has done most things well today and a few things brilliantly, chests down an awkward ball and in the same motion volleys it back to a team-mate to prevent it going out of play, earning a round of applause. 68 mins: Now Liverpool can give some of their stars a rest. Solanke comes on for Firmino, and Lallana replaces Salah. And another one! This is a self-inflicted wound – the ball is passed to Fer in midfield, and his first-time flick back towards his defence goes nowhere near any of them and instead sets Salah running into the box, and he squares to the unmarked Firmino, who can’t miss! 65 mins: Robertson’s left-wing cross is headed out by Mawson, but Alexander-Arnold beats Ayew to the loose ball on the edge of the area, is carried by momentum into the box, and then crashes a shot into the roof of the net from 10 yards! That’s a first Premier League goal for Alexander-Arnold, and it nearly took the net off! 62 mins: McBurnie’s full debut ends, as Tammy Abraham replaces him. 60 mins: Swansea do a shot! Routledge has too much space on the right, and his cross finds Fer, who half-volleys wide. 60 mins: Wijnaldum goes on a lovely run, starting with a saucy spin just outside his own area and ending when he runs out of steam just inside Swansea’s. 59 mins: Swansea do an attack! McBurnie crosses from the left and if it hadn’t been for Alexander-Arnold’s little touch Ayew would probably have been able to head tamely at Mignolet! 57 mins: And another chance! Robertson hits a long pass to Salah, bursting into the box, but by the time he reaches the ball Fabianski is only a yard or so away, and the shot hits the keeper. 57 mins: That’s one they’ve worked at on the training ground, Salah looking ready to attack the far post but then running back to the penalty spot, Coutinho picking him out from the free kick, and the shot going wide. 56 mins: Olsson gets booked for bringing down Firmino, released on the left, by Alexander-Arnold’s ludicrous 50-yard pass. There’s the perfect cross! It’s from the foot of Coutinho, from a set piece, and it’s just impeccable, looping over the entire defence and dipping onto the right foot of Firmino, on the corner of the six-yard box, who volleys in! 50 mins: Chance! Firmino passes to Salah, who runs into the box, cuts onto his left foot – Fernandez allowing this to happen a little too easily – and shoots too close to Fabianski. 49 mins: Liverpool this time give the ball away foolishly in their own half, but the best Swansea can muster in response is an outlandishly optimistic long-ranger from Ayew. 48 mins: A lovely cross from Alexander-Arnold on the right, but it’s just out of Firmino’s reach. There have been a few nearly-perfect crosses today, but as yet no perfect ones. 46 mins: Peeeeep! The home side start half two. The players return from their dressing rooms. There have been no half-timely changes. 45+2 mins: A beautiful goal, and then not a lot else until that very late chance for Firmino. Liverpool have lacked intensity and conviction, and for the most part defending against them has been fairly straightforward. But Swansea are offering almost nothing, but for occasional disastrous own-half possession-surrender. 45+1 mins: It should have been two! Mesa gives the ball to Salah, who finds Firmino. He makes space for an easy shot, but decides to check back onto his right, giving Mawson time to get in position, and then shoots wide! 45+1 mins: There will be two minutes of stoppage time, or something like it. 44 mins: After some treatment, Can plays on. “McBurnie’s legs are the whitest, most undead looking things in the history of football,” writs Bill. “He needs to be careful he doesn’t get sunburn from the floodlights.” 43 mins: Can goes down with some kind of leg ache. 42 mins: It wasn’t a penalty. Carroll was marking him, and perhaps pulled him a tiny bit, but Salah then pushed his arm into Carroll’s torso and twisted himself unnaturally as if he was being held, but it was a situation he had entirely contrived. 41 mins: Coutinho finds Salah in the area, but he can’t quite get the ball onto his left foot without being tackled. Moments later Firmino chips a cross from the left to the far post, and this too just misses Salah. He wants a penalty for something, but doesn’t get one and Swansea clear. 39 mins: Mawson does excellently to stick out a foot and prevent Salah’s one-two with Coutinho from ripping up the Swansea defence. 37 mins: McBurnie wriggles into the area and slaps in a shot. It’s blocked by Klavan, sent back in, and all looks a little bit threatening until Routledge takes a poor touch and the ball runs away from him. Goal kick. 35 mins: It’s like the penalty areas have invisible forcefields around them. 31 mins: For all the possession they’ve had, and all the fine attacking runs from fine players, Liverpool just can’t stop shooting from distance. Firmino is the latest, his 30-yarder bouncing wide. 28 mins: I apologise for not mentioning more things that the away team are doing. Swansea occasionally have the ball, but never do anything interesting with it. 27 mins: Oxlade-Chamberlain buys a ticket for the long-range lottery, but his shot flies high. 26 mins: Liverpool’s decision-making in attacking situations is extremely frustrating. Salah bursts into the box from the right, and inevitably tries to curl the ball inside the far post, but Mawson has anticipated, and blocks. 23 mins: Firmino intercepts the ball and passes to Can, who advances before shooting with insufficient power and accuracy from too great a distance. 20 mins: McBurnie’s first shot is from too tight an angle, and taken at too great a stretch, to seriously threaten, but it was on target. There was a moment, as the forward ran onto a ball bouncing towards the box while Mignolet was poorly positioned inside it having briefly also set off for the ball, when a first-time chip seemed on. Sadly, McBurnie was actually playing rather than watching on television, and didn’t spot it. 18 mins: Salah runs into the penalty area, and three defenders gang up to stop him. He might have found a pass, but he tries to wriggle through them and fails. 17 mins: Coutinho chips the ball into the box and the ball brushes Salah’s eyebrows, but is just out of reach of his forehead. 16 mins: “Simon the penalty spot seems to my eyes to resemble a large polo rather than a ‘spot’,” writes Elliot Wilson. “Does it, or am I – and my eyes – getting old?” You may very well be getting old, but it is true that Liverpool’s spot is a small circle. In fact the phrase “penalty spot” is a misnomer, it being properly called a “penalty mark”. Any kind of reasonable spot/circle/cross/thing seems acceptable. 13 mins: Naughton takes out Firmino on Liverpool’s left wing, level with the penalty spot, and the home side have a dangerous free kick. But the cross hits the wall, loops up to Klavan beyond the far post, and his header back into the mixer misses the mixer. Goal kick. 11 mins: A lovely pass from Salah finds Coutinho running into the area, but instead of shooting from an angle he heads for the byline and his pull-back hits a thicket of defenders. 10 mins: Fernandez does well to block Firmino’s cross, leap up, and reach the loose ball first. He then took a bit of a risk by brushing Firmino and crumpling to the turf – it was a 50/50 call, but it goes his way. Free kick. 9 mins: Now Mignolet has to make a save, Routledge crossing from the right and Ayew climbing high and heading low, but close enough to the goalkeeper for it to be a pretty straightforward stop. 7 mins: Firmino won the ball from Ayew 30 yards from Swansea’s goal and picked out Coutinho, who shifted it forward to give himself space to whip his foot around it, and then whipped his foot around it, outside the centre of the area, 20 yards out. The shot curled beautifully into the top corner, with Fabianski nowhere. That is as sweet a strike of a football as you’ll ever see. I’d have that for Christmas dinner with a bit of brandy butter. Yum. 5 mins: Swansea have the familiar two banks of four stationed on the edge of, and then about 10 yards from, their box, leaving two players to close down defenders while they wonder which of their marked team-mates they should try passing to. Another defender eventually goes long. Goal kick. 2 mins: Liverpool keep the ball for a bit, and then Klavan pings it long, looking for Salah’s burst into the box, but overhits. Goal kick. 1 min: Swansea, clad all in black, get the game under way, McBurnie getting the all-important morale-boosting early touch from the centre circle. So Liverpool have played away from home on Boxing Day on 21 of the last 31 years. That seems a little rough. The players are in the tunnel. Exciting times, particularly for fans of the official Premier League anthem. The managers have spoken, starting with Leon Britton on why Ollie McBurnie’s in the team: I think Ollie’s done well. He’s played for the Under-23s, scored a lot of goals, and I just thought this was the right opportunity for him to get a first start. We need belief. We need the players to play at a very high level, giving everything, then we’ll see where we go from there. And Jurgen Klopp on Swansea: They’re not typical for a struggling team because they play football, they have their own style of play, not with 100% confidence because of results but they still do it. It’s really different. We will see, I don’t know what their plan is exactly, but if we do what we want to do then they have to react to our things. I’m pretty sure those yellow things are bananas, though. Here’s a picture from inside the Liverpool dressing room. What’s in the boxes? Maybe cashew nuts to the left, dried mango in the middle and unidentifiable brown stuff to the right? Swansea also make four changes, with Oliver McBurnie making his first Premier League start, after seven substitute appearances this season. Matip strolls straight into the starting XI after a month out with injury, one of four changes to the Liverpool of which only one – Jordan Henderson is injured – was enforced. “It’s very important for us that we can line up like this,” says Jurgen Klopp. “We could have lined up completely differently – they are all fit.” Tonight’s protagonists: Liverpool: Mignolet, Alexander-Arnold, Matip, Klavan, Robertson, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Can, Wijnaldum, Salah, Firmino, Coutinho. Subs: Karius, Lovren, Milner, Gomez, Mane, Lallana, Solanke. Swansea: Fabianski, Naughton, Fernandez, Mawson, Olsson, Fer, Roque, Carroll, Routledge, Ayew, McBurnie. Subs: Van der Hoorn, Abraham, Dyer, Nordfeldt, Clucas, Rangel, Sanches. Referee: Kevin Friend. Hello world! So Swansea, with one top-flight away win this season, visit Liverpool, with no top-flight home defeats. Liverpool, unbeaten in 10 league games, against Swansea, with eight defeats in their last 11. For all that, anything could happen. Well, Liverpool will probably win, but we can’t be totally certain. After all, back in the early days of this year Swansea pitched up at Anfield and won 3-2, taking the lead three times. Indeed, the Swans have won two of their last three games against Liverpool, after losing six of the previous eight in all competitions. “We know it’s going to a very tough game with the players they’ve got,” said Leon Britton, who still occupies Swansea’s caretakerly hotseat. “Look at the amount of goals Liverpool score, it’s right up there with one of the best frontlines in the Premier League. I’ve experienced it as a player how tough it is to go there – the way they play their football and press, it’s high intensity football. But we went there in January and won in difficult circumstances when the team was low in confidence. So we go there knowing we can get a result.” They travel, in short, hoping that lightning does in fact strike twice, and ideally that it hits Mo Salah when it does so. Meanwhile: “I don’t know how many it is now; I don’t think about or count this,” Jurgen Klopp said of his side’s unbeaten record. “But I really think performance-wise we are in a really good way; that’s what we need to keep. It’s not too easy to play this kind of football for the boys, it’s intense.” An intense experience, then is in store for all of us. Which is, of course, just as we like it.

Shoppers started queuing outside branches of high street chain Next at 12.30am while on Oxford Street, in London a crowd started forming outside Selfridges at 2.30am. However, retail experts said that overall shopper numbers were significantly down on 2016. The power of the Boxing Day sales has been diminished in recent years due to a combination of internet discount extravaganzas such as November’s Black Friday and the fact that major stores such as Marks &amp; Spencer and John Lewis start their sales online on Christmas Eve. But even if crowds were thinner, shopping centre owners reported brisk trade as those who did venture out spent more. “People like to come sale shopping because it is the thrill of the kill,” said Tom Nathan, general manager at Brent Cross, one of London’s biggest shopping centres. “Some chains have also held back putting discounted items online, which has forced people out from behind their computers.” Nathan said there was was also an element of people trading up to branded products: “Popular items are full-length boots, cashmere coats and knitwear. People have waited for expensive items that are heavily discounted. People are also buying more cleverly. In perfumery Boots and Fenwicks have gift items that are 30% off and people are stocking up for later in the year.” In London, one Selfridges shopper, Matthew O’Clery, a 19-year-old student from Perth, Australia, who braved the crowds in London’s West End described the store as “an absolute zoo” as sharp-elbowed shoppers hunted down discounted Alexander McQueen handbags and half-price Stella McCartney dresses. Selfridges’ tills banked £4m in the first three hours of its sale with the retailer reporting that Boxing Day would be its biggest trading day of the year after 120,000 shoppers trekked to the London store. Leaving Brent Cross, Arnold Ilunga, 26, a lorry driver from Stanmore, north-west London, said he had not meant to buy anything on the shopping trip but by lunchtime was holding more than 10 Zara bags, containing two coats and shirts and jumpers for his three children. “My wife dragged me out,” said Ilunga. “I ended up getting more than I imagined. Even with the long wait I prefer going to shops rather than buying online because if the item doesn’t fit it’s a pain to return online stuff.” In the run-up to Christmas fewer people visited the shops to buy their gifts and that trend continued on Boxing Day. Near closing time total shopper numbers were 4.5% down on last year, according to research group Springboard which tracks visits to shopping centres and high streets. “What we have seen in the last couple of years is a structural shift in the Christmas trading period,” said Springboard analyst Diane Wehrle. She said the Black Friday sales had changed the way people shop because retailers started discounting in November. Unlike most high street rivals, Next does not cut its prices before Christmas and the 1,000-strong crowds outside its branches in Birmingham and Silverburn, Glasgow, indicated the enduring appeal of big discounts, even in an age of non-stop discounting. The same is true for stores such as Zara. Nathan said visitor numbers had held up at Brent Cross. “It looks as if we were ahead of last year [in terms of footfall] and we are very busy today with trading somewhere around last year’s figure,” he said. “But it’s not just footfall but the level of spend. Retailers are seeing the average take per basket going up because people are busier and have reduced the number of shopping trips. So when they do come they spend more.” Analysts are expecting consumers to cut back in the new year as inflation, linked to the weakness of sterling, erodes spending power and a wobbling housing market chips away at consumer confidence. Britons are also absorbing the impact of the first Bank of England base rate rise in over a decade on their finances. Independent retail analyst Richard Hyman, said consumer confidence was paper thin: “There’s massive uncertainty. You’ve got inflation coming through, you’ve got earnings lagging to where they were years ago. This makes life difficult. Why would people be optimistic?” But the upmarket stores in London’s West End are insulated from the country’s wider economic woes as high-spending tourists flocked to Oxford Street, Bond Street and Regent Street. The New West End Company predicted that more than £50m would be spent there on Boxing Day alone, up 4% on 2016. “The Boxing Day sales have become a tradition for domestic customers but we also predict a high number of international visitors will take advantage of currency fluctuations and low-cost flights to come to the West End,” said Jace Tyrrell, chief executive of New West End Company, who predicted West End stores would rake in £190m over the Boxing Day week. In Selfridges, Yang Cui is admiring an expensive haul that includes makeup, a suit, handkerchiefs and a scarf. “I am from China and there is high taxes there on goods, that’s why people buy clothes and handbags here,”he said. • Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/26/us-to-make-at-least-285m-cut-to-un-budget-after-vote-on-jerusalem","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-26T15:17:56Z","webTitle":"US to make at least $285m cut to UN budget after vote on Jerusalem","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/26/us-to-make-at-least-285m-cut-to-un-budget-after-vote-on-jerusalem","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/26/us-to-make-at-least-285m-cut-to-un-budget-after-vote-on-jerusalem","fields":{"headline":"US to make at least $285m cut to UN budget after vote on Jerusalem","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The US government has announced significant cuts in its United Nations budget obligations for 2018-19 in what will be interpreted as a further ratcheting up of pressure from the Trump administration looking to bend decision-making at the international body to its will. In a statement released over the holiday, the US mission to the United Nations said next year’s budget would be slashed by over $285m and unspecified reductions would also be made to the UN’s management and support functions. The announcement did not make clear the entire amount of the budget or specify what effect the cut would have on the US contribution. “We will no longer let the generosity of the American people be taken advantage of,” the US ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, said, adding that the “inefficiency and overspending” of the organization was well-known. Under the UN charter, the US is responsible for 22% of the the body’s annual operating budget, or around $1.2bn in 2017-18, and 28.5% of the cost of peacekeeping operations, estimated at $6.8bn over the same period. In her statement, Haley said she was pleased with the results of budget negotiations, and the US mission would continue to “look at ways to increase the UN’s efficiency while protecting our interests”. But the timing of the announcement sends a clear message. On Thursday, the general assembly voted 128-9 in favor of a resolution condemning the US recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. After the vote, Haley reminded the assembly that the US was “by far the single largest contributor to the UN” and would remember the vote “when we are called upon to once again make the world’s largest contribution to the United Nations, and we will remember it when so many countries come calling on us, as they so often do, to pay even more and to use our influence for their benefit”. Before the vote, the US president, Donald Trump said at a cabinet meeting: “Let them vote against us. We’ll save a lot. We don’t care. But this isn’t like it used to be where they could vote against you and then you pay them hundreds of millions of dollars ... We’re not going to be taken advantage of any longer.” On Sunday, Guatemala became the first country to follow the US decision to move its embassy to Jerusalem. Guatemala’s president Jimmy Morales made the announcement via Facebook."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/dec/26/police-officer-and-woman-die-in-sheffield-car-crash","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-26T16:21:00Z","webTitle":"Police officer and woman die in Sheffield car crash","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/dec/26/police-officer-and-woman-die-in-sheffield-car-crash","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/dec/26/police-officer-and-woman-die-in-sheffield-car-crash","fields":{"headline":"Police officer and woman die in Sheffield car crash","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Police have paid tribute to a “passionate and professional” officer who died when the police car he was driving was in a collision with another vehicle, also killing a 61-year-old woman. Emergency services were called to reports of a collision on the A57 in Sheffield at about 8.15pm on Christmas Day. South Yorkshire police said the marked BMW 3 series police car was responding to an incident when it collided with a silver Citroën C3 travelling in the opposite direction. The 46-year-old man driving the police car, who had served with the force for 12 years, was pronounced dead shortly after the crash. The 61-year-old woman, from Sheffield, who was a passenger in the Citroën, was taken to hospital but died a short time later. A 63-year-old man, who was driving the Citroën, was taken to hospital, where he was in a serious condition on Tuesday. Police said specialist officers were supporting the families of both victims. South Yorkshire police said investigators were working to determine the circumstances surrounding the collision. The force has referred itself to the Independent Police Complaints Commission, as is standard practice after a person dies following contact with police. Asst Ch Con David Hartley said: “On behalf of the force, I’d like to offer my sincere condolences to all of those left bereaved by this terrible tragedy. Our thoughts, love and support are extended to all those affected. “We are doing everything we can to support them through this difficult time. I ask that their privacy is respected at this sad time. “We have lost a friend and a colleague from our police family in this incident. The officer has been with us for 12 years and was a passionate, professional and universally liked officer. His colleagues, and everyone across the force, are devastated by what has happened.” The crime and policing website Police Hour launched a crowdfunding campaign on Boxing Day to raise money for the families of both victims of the crash. Trevor Sherwood, the website’s editor, said: “We have lost a member of the thin blue line and tragically a member of the public also. A police officer should never have to leave his family on Christmas Day knowing he’ll never return. “My thoughts are with both families and those officers, paramedics and fire crews who attended his tragic incident. Let’s raise as much as we can in the memory of these fallen victims.” The crash had been cleared from the busy road by mid-Tuesday. The only evidence of the incident were some marks on the road and police signs by the side of the carriageway appealing for witnesses. The road is one of the main routes into and out of Sheffield from the south. It is a single carriageway road with a 50mph limit."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"crosswords/cryptic/27395","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-02T00:00:12Z","webTitle":"Cryptic crossword No 27,395","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/27395","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/cryptic/27395","fields":{"headline":"Cryptic crossword No 27,395","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/26/families-heartbroken-after-two-men-die-in-car-swept-away-in-ireland","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-26T11:50:58Z","webTitle":"Families 'heartbroken' after two men die in car swept away in Ireland","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/26/families-heartbroken-after-two-men-die-in-car-swept-away-in-ireland","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/26/families-heartbroken-after-two-men-die-in-car-swept-away-in-ireland","fields":{"headline":"Families 'heartbroken' after two men die in car swept away in Ireland","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The families of two men who died after their Jeep was swept away in a river on Christmas Day have said they are heartbroken. Declan Davitt, 26, and Martin Needham, 27, were in the 4x4 when it fell into the Carrowniskey river in County Mayo, west Ireland, in the early hours of the morning. The vehicle soon became fully submerged in the water and was carried downstream amid gale force winds and high water levels. It has been reported that the vehicle was crossing a stretch of water used locally as a shortcut by tractors and four-wheel drives. The men were returning from a night out socialising with friends. However, the crossing was more dangerous than usual because of the bad weather, which swelled the stretch of water, and the vehicle became caught in the tide. It entered the water near Louisburgh, close to the Mayo Atlantic coastline, at around 2.30am on Monday. Another man, 19, managed to escape and reach land, where he raised the alarm and alerted emergency services at about 3am. A major search and rescue operation involving garda divers and the coastguard was soon launched to find the two missing men. A helicopter was also dispatched and carried out aerial searches downstream throughout the early hours and into Monday afternoon, when the bodies of the men were found. A yellow weather warning is in place due to the heavy rainfall. It is understood that heavy flooding is not uncommon around the area where the accident occurred. The men’s bodies have been taken to University hospital in Castlebar where postmortem examinations are expected to take place on Tuesday. Garda officers are continuing to investigate the cause of the incident. The two men’s funerals will be held later this week. Tributes soon came in for the men, who were said to be well respected in the local community. Public notices said they would be deeply mourned by their “heartbroken” families. A friend of Needham’s told the Sun: “He had been working in New Zealand where he was doing very well for himself and had decided to come home for good. “He was well known in the farming community and this has come as a huge shock to all who knew him.” The Louisburgh Macra Na Feirme, a rural youth organisation which said the men were members, expressed its condolences to the families. “Unbelievably numbing day today as we learned that these two fine men [were] tragically lost in an accident last night,” read the statement on social media. “Two valued members since the beginning.” The Mayo independent councillor Christy Hyland said the local community was in shock. “Our thoughts go out to their loved ones, their families and friends,” he said. “This is a terrible tragedy to happen at any time but especially on Christmas morning.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/dec/27/world-cup-qualification-to-ffa-crisis-australian-footballs-weird-year","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-26T17:00:01Z","webTitle":"World Cup qualification to FFA crisis: Australian football's 'weird' year","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/dec/27/world-cup-qualification-to-ffa-crisis-australian-footballs-weird-year","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/dec/27/world-cup-qualification-to-ffa-crisis-australian-footballs-weird-year","fields":{"headline":"World Cup qualification to FFA crisis: Australian football's 'weird' year","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"2017 was a weird year for Australian football. It was the best of times and it was the worst of times, occasionally simultaneously The past 12 months have played host to an unusually large number of significant moments. The Socceroos, the Matildas, and club sides wearing sky blue all reached great heights. The destructive congress dispute on its own provided enough negative counterbalance, but it was far from the only low note of a year containing the messy departure of Ange Postecoglou, the VAR debacle and painful farewells to Les Murray and Mike Cockerill. Frustratingly, many of the most important events of the year have yet to fully resolve. The governance crisis in particular remains a live grenade, and one with competing interpretations. Penning the 2017 annual review at the end of 2018 or 2019 would prove a more comprehensive exercise. It’s a measure of the year that the Socceroos qualifying for Russia 2018 isn’t even a straightforward write-up. On the four previous occasions Australia’s men have qualified for a World Cup, the achievement has deservedly monopolised attention, replete with triumphalism and gushing praise. Not this time around. The most arduous qualification process in history took its toll, and the longer it dragged on the wearier the mood became. The decisive victory over Honduras was met with blessed relief that the interminable slog was over. Euphoria was in short supply. The absence of a satisfying emotional crescendo owed a lot to the dark cloud that hovered over Postecoglou for much of the year, ending in a departure that lacked a clear-cut explanation. Postecoglou did everything expected of him during his time in charge, notably winning the 2015 Asian Cup and qualifying for Russia. But these were only components of a much grander project. Postecoglou was on a mission to philosophically reposition Australia as a confident, ambitious, expectant footballing force. This was not only about how his teams would play football but how, as a nation, he wanted us think about the game and Australia’s place in it. It is much too soon to tell if Postecoglou is to be remembered for his achievements in their isolated block, or lauded as the architect of a more enduring accomplishment. In the short term this relies greatly on the recruitment of the next Socceroos coach, one of many significant decisions facing a deluged FFA in 2018. After guiding Sydney FC to the three pieces of silverware on offer in 2017 Graham Arnold has to be the standout candidate for the national job. Should he be overlooked for the post, it will beg the question – what else does a local aspirant have to achieve to be offered the country’s most prestigious coaching role? Arnold’s Sky Blues were the year’s bright spark in a domestic men’s competition that is desperately losing momentum. As Sydney’s 2016-17 dominance flowed into 2017-18, so did public disinterest in the A-League. Nearing the end of the year crowds are declining, TV ratings are poor and administrators are under siege. It may be no bad thing that some supporters have turned away recently; they will have at least spared themselves the disastrous VAR trial that has hijacked the A-League agenda. The year’s highest peaks were to be found in the women’s game. At the recent AIS Sport Performance Awards, the Matildas were named the Public Choice Team of the Year, Alen Stajcic was crowned Coach of the Year and Sam Kerr the Sports Personality of the Year. These honours reflect a breakthrough period for women’s sport more broadly, and the Matildas in particular, who delivered arguably the standout moment of 2017 when they defeated Brazil in Newcastle in front of almost 17,000 fans. The women’s game is a core component of Football Nation Radio, one of the year’s left-field landmarks. FNR is a 24-hour radio station dedicated to football, and with such a large schedule to fill it has become a platform to showcase all aspects of the football community, including plenty the mainstream media is unable to cover. The outcome is a medium celebrating football success stories from the grassroots to the Socceroos, but also offering an outlet for discontent, of which there is no shortage. There is no finer example than FNR’s coverage of the governance crisis, addressed in-depth from multiple angles with the broadest array of insight. FFA’s inability to democratise its governing congress has proven a significant distraction throughout 2017. The prospects are brighter for 2018, which will begin with a Fifa mandated Congress Review Working Group – hopefully the final stage in this drawn out process. This offers a golden opportunity to reframe the entire fiasco. It is a chance not simply to make the best of a bad hand, but to establish an optimal governance arrangement, engaging all of the game’s stakeholders, thereby harnessing maximum ambition. Be it by revolution or evolution we are on the cusp of FFA 2.0. Regardless of how radical the congress review proves, it will alter the status quo. The imbroglio has already made a new A-League operating model a fait accompli, while a second tier is finally under discussion; both better late than never, but there is growing impatience at the lack of progress in other areas. The opportunity to reboot has to be seized. The wishlist for a reboot should read: A-League expansion, player development, infrastructure, improved cost of grassroots participation and much more. Answers will not be straightforward and action may not be immediately forthcoming, but the conversations need to be had and the game re-energised. FFA has fudged too many issues for too long, the ‘safe pair of hands’ approach storing up discontent. The governing body needs to reflect the will of its constituents and respect their concerns. Football in Australia needs to have every member of the tribe pulling in the same direction. The handling of the AAFC this year is a case in point. When the lobby group representing NPL clubs announced their discussion paper into the feasibility of a second tier, the immediate response from Whitlam Square was to smother the idea with a wet blanket. Faced with a backlash at their handling of the situation (not least from Victoria, at the time a congress swing voter) FFA invited AAFC into the fold. The parties are now in negotiation to smooth out longstanding issues with the NPL and explore models for growth. Time then to sign off for the year with a favourite aphorism, attributed to former Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai. When asked in the 1970s about the impact of the French Revolution, so the story goes, he replied “it is too soon to say”. It turns out the details of that exchange may no longer stand historical scrutiny, but the sagacity of the comment endures. So, how was 2017 in Australian football? It’s too soon to say. Ask again in a decade or so and we might be somewhere nearer an answer."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jan/02/indigenous-childrens-commissioner-rejects-out-of-home-care-targets","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-01T18:00:05Z","webTitle":"Indigenous children’s commissioner rejects out-of-home care hard targets","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jan/02/indigenous-childrens-commissioner-rejects-out-of-home-care-targets","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jan/02/indigenous-childrens-commissioner-rejects-out-of-home-care-targets","fields":{"headline":"Indigenous children’s commissioner rejects out-of-home care hard targets","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The outgoing Aboriginal children’s commissioner in Victoria opposes hard limits on the number of Indigenous children being removed from families, saying it could put lives at risk. Andrew Jackomos, the country’s first Indigenous children’s commissioner, favours measures to reunite families. But he says hard targets to limit removals could have dangerous consequences. Reducing the number of Indigenous children removed from their families and placed in out-of-home care was one of the two areas most commonly cited by Indigenous organisations in the lead up to the Turnbull government’s review of the Closing the Gap targets, many of which expire in June. The other is a target to reduce the overrepresentation of Indigenous people in the prison system. The two are inextricably linked: the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare found in 2016 that children who were known to the child protection system were 14 times more likely to also be involved in the youth justice system. Jackomos said: “I would oppose a straight out-of-home-care target. My worry is that if you have targets straight on the number of kids removed then you may see kids who need to be removed not removed, so we just need to be smart about it.” But one reason for his one-term tenure, and his reluctance to accept hard targets on rates of child removal, is contained in closed files delivered to the children’s minister, Jenny Mikakos, concerning the deaths of children who were known to child protection. Thirty-six children died in those circumstances in 2016, of which four were Indigenous. “Many of the child death inquiries we do are of young babies who have been murdered,” Jackomos said. “They are of young babies that should have been removed because the situation wasn’t safe. And in other cases I see child death inquiries where the children are teenagers and they’ve stayed in resi[dential] care. I wonder, was it safer for them at home?” Jackomos said the focus should be on getting separated families back together as quickly as possible – with targets to promote reunification rather than simply limiting removals, which he said could put some children at risk. “We can achieve that by intervention and prevention, and working with mums and dads. In a lot of cases I see children have been removed and then we just forget about mum and dad,” he said. “If we had that reunification target I think that would go a way towards improving services to them. “It’s about getting kids home quicker.” For Aboriginal children, “home” might mean returning to live with their parents, or it might mean living with a grandmother, aunt or cousin. Whichever family situation applied, Jackomos said, they should be supported, and that would ensure fewer children were removed in the long run. The Yorta Yorta man will finish in his current role on 31 January – and start work the next day as a special adviser on Indigenous self-determination in Victoria’s Department of Premier and Cabinet. Speaking in his office in his final weeks in the role, Jackomos said the commissioner’s job, which includes providing independent oversight of children in the child protection and youth justice systems, was not one that anyone should do for more than five years. “If you’re a Koorie person, if you’re involved in reading the stories and trying to make changes … I think you need time out,” he said. About 5.5% of the Australian population under the age of 18 identifies as Indigenous, yet Indigenous children made up 36.2% of all children in out-of-home care in 2016 and 55% of all children held in youth detention. Rates of out-of-home care for Indigenous children are 10 times higher than for non-Indigenous children, and rates of youth detention are 24 times higher. You can’t fix one without addressing the other, Jackomos said. He recalled an interaction with a 14-year-old boy when he first started the job, in 2014. The boy was in Parkville youth detention centre and proudly showed Jackomos the floor of the cell in which he had been born. “I think that just sums it up, the sickness in society, when a young boy can actually be proud of the cell floor in which his young mum gave birth to him,” he said. “That young boy is still in the system five years after, and I imagine will be in and out of the system for some time. Hopefully he gets the right care and protection, but that’s one, and there are many stories.” Addressing the issues that led to overrepresentation in the child protection and justice systems would take a generation, Jackomos said. “It’s just sad because we’re going to lose many of our kids,” he said. “The majority of our kids who are in youth detention, we will see kids from there graduate to the adult prison system, both male and female, and it’s going to be difficult for many of those kids to come home to a safe life where they can feel proud of themselves. I think it’s going to be some time before we see a significant reduction in overrepresentation.” He argues for wraparound services at Aboriginal community-controlled organisations, targeting issues such as homelessness, family violence and drug abuse affecting the parents, particularly the mother, starting the moment she finds out she is pregnant. Mallee District Aboriginal Services in the regional Victorian town of Mildura has modelled such a program, and it is being emulated in Bendigo and Shepparton. “It was very much about how we can overhaul the system so it’s upfront investments with Aboriginal community organisations,” Jackomos said. A report published last month by Family Matters, an Indigenous campaign that aims to close the gap on Indigenous child removal rates, warned that unless the system was restructured to focus on early intervention the rate of child removal would triple by 2036. Jackomos said the federal government’s rejection of the core proposal of the Uluru statement on Indigenous constitutional recognition, the proposed Indigenous voice to parliament, was “hugely disappointing on a national level, but I’m thankful I’m in Victoria”. The Andrews government has made a public commitment to self-determination and a treaty with Aboriginal people. Both Victoria and South Australia, the second to announce treaty negotiations, will hold elections in 2018, and in both the opposition’s support for treaty negotiations is, at best, equivocal. Senior Indigenous bureaucrats such as Jackomos are in a flurry of activity to make changes stick in case of a change of government. “I have worked in places where self-determination were dirty words, not supported, so we have an opportunity to make a difference now,” he said. “We need to make hay while the sun shines.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/26/chinese-human-rights-lawyer-jailed-for-eight-years-for-subversion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-26T04:37:52Z","webTitle":"Chinese human rights activist jailed for eight years for subversion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/26/chinese-human-rights-lawyer-jailed-for-eight-years-for-subversion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/26/chinese-human-rights-lawyer-jailed-for-eight-years-for-subversion","fields":{"headline":"Chinese human rights activist jailed for eight years for subversion","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A prominent Chinese human rights activist has been jailed eight years in jail for subversion on Tuesday, the harshest sentence to be passed so far in a government crackdown on activism that began more than two years ago. Wu Gan, a blogger better known by his online name of Super Vulgar Butcher, regularly championed sensitive cases of government abuses of power, both online and in street protests. He was sentenced to eight years in prison on charges of “subverting state power” at the Tianjin no 2 people’s court. He has been in pretrial detention for more than two years after staging a protest outside a court. “The court found that the defendant Wu Gan became dissatisfied with the existing political system,” according to the verdict. “Wu Gan has long used information networks to spread a great deal of rhetoric and to attack state power and the system established by the constitution.” But Wu was defiant at his sentencing, pledging to appeal his case and saying he was “grateful to the [Communist] party for granting me this lofty honour”, according to his lawyer. He is known for his attention-grabbing protests, at one point posing for a photo with two knives and saying he would “slaughter the pigs”, referring to corrupt officials. On the same day as Wu’s sentencing, a prominent lawyer Xie Yang was retried but not punished after he previously pleaded guilty to subversion charges. While in detention he gave an explosive account of being tortured, beaten and threatened by interrogators. Xie was arrested more than two years ago as part of a sweeping crackdown on human rights lawyers and activists that saw nearly 250 people questioned or detained by authorities. Wu was detained two months earlier. That crackdown represented an unprecedented attack on lawyers who took on politically charged cases at the same time president Xi Jinping said he wanted to strength the rule of law in China. Rights groups condemned the sentencing over the Christmas period, a common tactic for Chinese courts when sentencing high-profile dissidents. Liu Xiaobo, the Nobel peace prize laureate, who died in custody in July, was sentenced to 11 years for subversion on Christmas Day 2009. “It is disgraceful that the Chinese authorities have chosen the day after Christmas to deal with two of the remaining people left in legal limbo from the unprecedented July 2015 crackdown on human rights lawyers and activists,” said Patrick Poon, a researcher at Amnesty International in Hong Kong. “Carrying out unfair trials and politicized sentencing of human rights defenders at the very time when diplomats, journalists, international observers and the general public are less likely to be able to respond reeks of a cynical political calculation”. “By trying to avoid scrutiny from the press and the international community, the Chinese government betrays the fact it knows well these sham trials cannot withstand scrutiny,” Poon added. Before his trial, Wu predicted a harsh sentencing for refusing to cooperate with the authorities. “I will be convicted not because I am really guilty, but because of my refusal to accept a government-appointed lawyer, plead guilty in a televised propaganda confession, and for exposing torture, mistreatment and violence and prosecutorial misconduct,” he said in a statement released through his lawyers ahead of his trial in August."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/dec/26/sydney-to-hobart-black-jack-lands-surprise-blow-with-early-lead","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-26T04:04:42Z","webTitle":"Sydney to Hobart: LDV Comanche holds narrow lead in race for line honours","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/dec/26/sydney-to-hobart-black-jack-lands-surprise-blow-with-early-lead","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/dec/26/sydney-to-hobart-black-jack-lands-surprise-blow-with-early-lead","fields":{"headline":"Sydney to Hobart: LDV Comanche holds narrow lead in race for line honours","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Sydney to Hobart frontrunner LDV Comanche holds a narrow lead in the race for line honours in the 73rd edition of the Sydney to Hobart yacht race as night descends on day one of the blue water classic. After opening up a buffer over the three trailing super maxis, the crew aboard the yacht that was first to tie up at Constitution Dock in 2015 insists they were lucky to escape the heads unscathed after narrowly avoiding a collision with race darling Wild Oats XI. “We had a near miss with Wild Oats XI,” said LDV Comanche’s Jim Cooney “We needed to take evasive action but nothing was damaged.” Despite the close call within the first passages of the race, the crew aboard LDV Comanche were still pointing the finger of blame at Wild Oats XI three hours into the racing. “We did authorise,” said Mr Cooney aboard the race leader. “And we did fly the protest flag around the event that a boat that infringed didn’t execute any penalty turns.” It could prove to be a decisive moment in the 628-nautical mile race south with LDV Comanche in the lead and with Wild Oats XI astern. Both 100 footers are trailing the virtual hull-print of last year’s line honours and race record holder Perpetual Loyal – but both are expected to make up considerable ground as the winds freshen up this evening. “Everyone is in great spirits and we are happily flying down the coast now,” said LDV Comanche’s Jim Cooney. “Everyone is on the rail, everybody is enjoying themselves so we are doing well.” The experienced crew, who have enlisted the skills of world renowned navigator Stan Honey are still very much eyeing off a new race record and are planning a sail change. “[We hope to] start rolling a little faster with the conditions,” said Cooney. “We are looking for and if things stay true to the forecast and shift around in the next couple of hours then we expect to pick up the pace and start getting some miles behind us.” Tactical decisions over the first night will be a major factor for the front running yachts, all in the same weather pattern, with less than ten nautical miles separating all four super maxi runners as they neared Jervis Bay off the New South Wales coast. Recently purchased American yacht Wizard is the best placed international in fifth with Karl Kwok’s Hong Kong-labelled Beau Geste the only other outsider in the top ten, which includes Wild Oats XI’s sister ship Wild Oats X. Travelling four times slower than the front-running super maxis and the last on the line is Freyja. The wooden beauty didn’t make it out of the harbour in her last edition of the blue water classic and is new to offshore racing, having mainly been used for family holidays and the odd race out of her home base at the Newcastle Cruising Yacht Club. All 102 yachts are still in the race to Hobart. Earlier, Queensland’s Black Jack landed a surprise blow at the beginning of the 73rd Sydney to Hobart yacht race, upstaging line honours winners to be the first yacht to clear the heads. LDV Comanche nailed the start of the blue-water classic, but eight-time line honours champion Wild Oats XI uncharacteristically started well adrift, battling behind Infotrack as the last-placed super maxi. The two-time America’s Cup winner Jimmy Spithill was the calming voice and cool hand on the helm of LDV Comanche, putting her to the top of the class early, ahead of the three other Australian-owned 100-foot behemoths. But after 10 minutes of racing in light air and sloppy water it was Black Jack that provided the greatest test to the yacht owned by the Sydney local Jim Cooney, who is on board Comanche with his son and daughter for the 628-nautical mile journey to Hobart. Black Jack, named after the Australian motor-racing legend Sir Jack Brabham, took the most direct line to the first turning marker and virtually boxed LDV Comanche off the course, but there was more drama to follow as the Queensland super maxi pulled clear. As Wild Oats XI scythed her way into third place she nearly collided with LDV Comanche. Spithill took evasive action and lodged a protest at the close call between the multimillion-dollar super maxis. Weather modelling on Tuesday showed a building breeze that could help the leaders shave up to four hours off the race record. The patterns play nicely for reaching specialist LDV Comanche, favoured to be the super maxi most likely to be leading the fleet by Wednesday morning after a fast run down the coast. The forecast indicates the leaders will reach Tasman Island around sunset on Wednesday in record time but the critical element for breaking the benchmark of one day, 13 hours and 31 minutes will be when the front-running yachts arrive at the mouth of the Derwent, where breezes often vanish in the evening. Yachts will need to eclipse an average speed of 16.8 knots to set a new race record. Further back but in handicap contention, PSP Logistics led the Clipper flotilla out of the heads. For the Olympic gold medallist Hannah Macleod, on board the Great Britain Clipper, anticipation was high before the start of the race. “Most nerves come from thinking about what could happen – the secret is to just get the job done that’s in front of you,” she said. “You also learn that a few sacrifices can make a big difference when it comes to competition.” The professional hockey player, who won gold in Rio in 2016 and bronze at her home Olympics in 2012, has been bolstered by her team-mates cheering on from a distance. “Some will be viewing on Facebook Live,” Macleod said. “The support they have provided has been brilliant.” Sean Langman’s 85-year-old Maluka of Kermandie, made from Huon pine, was the last yacht to make the first mark."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"film/2017/dec/25/sound-of-music-actor-heather-menzies-urich-dies-aged-68","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-25T20:42:02Z","webTitle":"Sound of Music actor Heather Menzies-Urich dies aged 68","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/dec/25/sound-of-music-actor-heather-menzies-urich-dies-aged-68","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/dec/25/sound-of-music-actor-heather-menzies-urich-dies-aged-68","fields":{"headline":"Sound of Music actor Heather Menzies-Urich dies aged 68","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Sound of Music actor Heather Menzies-Urich, who became famous after playing Louisa von Trapp, has died aged 68. The Canadian-born actor’s death was announced by the estate of the musical’s creators, Rodgers and Hammerstein. She was diagnosed with brain cancer a month ago and died on Christmas Eve surrounded by her family, her son Ryan confirmed. Menzies-Urich was just 14 years old and had no acting experience when she landed the role of the third-oldest von Trapp child in 1964 in the movie starring Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer. The movie is based on the story of the singing von Trapp family who fled Nazi rule. “She was an actor, a ballerina and loved living her life to the fullest,” Ryan told TMZ. Rodgers and Hammerstein president, Ted Chapin, paid tribute to her: “Heather was part of the family. There is really no other way to describe the members of the cast of the movie of The Sound Of Music. “Heather was a cheerful and positive member of the group, always hoping for the next gathering. We are all lucky to have known her, and she will happily live on in that beautiful movie. We will miss her.” Her character Louisa was mischievous and put a spider on the governess who preceded the former nun played by Andrews. The film went on to win five Oscars, including best picture, and became a perennial favourite on Christmas day television schedules. The songs Menzies-Urich performed in the film include So Long Farewell and the Lonely Goatherd. After her debut in The Sound of Music she appeared in many television films and programmes, including the TV series of Logan’s Run, TJ Hooker and The Bob Newhart Show. She married actor Robert Urich in 1975 and the couple had three children. He died in 2002. Her death comes a little over a year after that of Charmian Carr – who played the eldest von Trapp daughter Liesl."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/dec/25/doctor-who-christmas-special-review-time-gentlemen-now-its-jodies-turn","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-25T18:45:27Z","webTitle":"Doctor Who Christmas special review – time, gentlemen.

Now it’s Jodie’s turn","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"“Aw brilliant!” she says, Yorkshire-ness present and correct and looking chuffed to bits. It’s hard to disagree. Jodie Whittaker becomes the Thirteenth Doctor – not unluckily, for her, or for the universe let’s hope. Though then things don’t go well, with the Tardis. Anyway, that’s all to come and to look forward to. First there was a goodbye, a final adventure for the Twelfth Doctor, and for the First. They meet at the South Pole, both fighting their own regeneration, Peter Capaldi and David Bradley – who takes on the William Hartnell role, is cleverly morphed into Hartnell in fact – a leap of hundreds of episodes and from flickery black and white to super HD colour. It takes a little getting one’s head around: two dying characters meeting each other, meeting themselves because they’re the same character, frozen in time and in a frozen landscape, three actors, one actually deceased. “You know, I really don’t think I’m following,” says the Captain (Mark Gatiss), and it’s hard not to sympathise. But it doesn’t really matter if you can’t quite place everything on a timeline (if indeed time is a line) or see how this episode, Twice Upon a Time, actually takes place during another episode, the Tenth Planet, that went out in 1966. There’s so much for the non fundamentalist Whovian to engage with and enjoy as well. The Captain? A charming British soldier plucked from a bomb crater at Ypres in 1914 at the moment of his death. There’s a lot of death in the episode, as you would expect, but it’s far from pessimistic; the opposite in fact. Doing the plucking are Enchanted Glass People from the distant future. You’ll see, they’ll be waiting for you at the end of your life, too, to lift you gently from your timestream and without pain or distress, duplicate your memory, so that your testimony can live on and the dead can be heard among the living. Ooh, that’s good isn’t it? There’s so much that is good about the episode. Good jokes – mainly about the First Doctor’s embarrassing un-PC old-fashioned attitudes (“Aren’t all ladies made of glass, in a way?”). I like the second world war spoiler too. “Yes, but what do you mean, [world war] one?” asks the Captain, not understanding the unthinkable. I like Twelve’s “over to you Mary Berry” to One, just because he’s old, I think. Anyway, it’s funny. And I like Bill Potts saying arse (she calls the Doctor a stupid bloody one) in the nation’s family living room at 6pm on Christmas Day – though some won’t, there may be complaints. She – Bill (Pearl Mackie) – is here, to say goodbye to the Doctor, with a tender kiss. Nardole (Matt Lucas) too. And Clara – Jenna Coleman dropping in before dashing off to be Victoria at Christmas on the other side. “Hello, you stupid old man,” Clara says. Hello, and goodbye. It’s sad, so sad. If you don’t have a lump or shed a tear too then you’re a probably a Cyberman. Because the Twelfth Doctor’s companions and friends – I include myself, that’s what he’s become over the past four years – are saying goodbye to a brilliant Doctor, which is what Capaldi has been – warm, wise, kind, funny, human. He does get to go out in style though. Steven Moffat – also checking out (he will regenerate, less spectacularly, into Chris Chibnall, who has written for Whittaker of course, on Broadchurch) – has given him a spectacular, moving send-off. It’s not just about goodbye, and death and the fear of death, but also memories and a reminder that there can be hope even in humanity’s darkest hours. Like at the Christmas truce of 1914, when soldiers from both sides – including the Captain – emerged from their trenches, laid down their weapons, played football together and sang. Capaldi gets a barnstorming valedictory speech. “Time to leave the battlefield,” the Doctor at last accepts – the battlefield of his life as well as this one on the western front. He steps inside the Tardis for the last time, where he has some advice, for himself, for his successor, for everyone. “Hate is always foolish, love is always wise,” he says, borrowing from Bertrand Russell. “Always try to be nice.” Naive? No! Important, more so than ever right now. Have you seen what’s going on out there? And finally: “Laugh hard, run fast, be kind,” he says. And: “Doctor, I let you go.” Over to you, Jodie, you’re on."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2017/dec/25/queen-pays-tribute-to-grenfell-tower-survivors-in-christmas-speech","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-25T15:10:59Z","webTitle":"Queen pays tribute to Grenfell Tower survivors in Christmas speech","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/dec/25/queen-pays-tribute-to-grenfell-tower-survivors-in-christmas-speech","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/dec/25/queen-pays-tribute-to-grenfell-tower-survivors-in-christmas-speech","fields":{"headline":"Queen pays tribute to Grenfell Tower survivors in Christmas speech","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The Queen chose the theme of “home” for a highly personal Christmas broadcast in which she paid tribute to victims and young survivors of the Manchester Arena bombing and those of the Grenfell Tower fire. She highlighted how the “powerful identities” of London and Manchester “shone through over the past 12 months in the face of appalling attacks”. Her message was broadcast across Britain and the Commonwealth as the royal family welcomed the American actor Meghan Markle, Prince Harry’s fiancee, who became the first unmarried partner to be invited to Sandringham for Christmas, and was making her first public appearance with the royal family. In her broadcast, the Queen spoke of the “privilege” of meeting child survivors and parents of the Manchester suicide bombing in which 23, including the attacker, died at an Ariana Grande concert. She praised the survivors as an “example to us all, showing extraordinary bravery and resilience”. The benefit concert held days later had been “a powerful reclaiming of the ground, and of the city those young people call home”. In London, there were attacks at Westminster Bridge, in which five died, and Borough Market, where eight died. She asked: “Who can forget the sheer awfulness of the Grenfell Tower fire?” and spoke of those who died and those who lost so much as footage was shown of her and the Duke of Cambridge meeting emergency services workers close to the site of the fire that claimed 71 lives. On the 60th anniversary of her first televised Christmas message, which was broadcast live from Sandringham, she also displayed a dry sense of humour in paying tribute to her 96-year-old consort, Prince Philip, and joked about the couple’s longevity. As archive footage of the first televised broadcast was screened, showing the 31-year-old monarch talking about the medium of television, the Queen, now 91, observed: “Six decades on, the presenter has ‘evolved’ somewhat, as has the technology she described.” The year had seen another, more personal, anniversary. “I don’t know that anyone had invented the term ‘platinum’ for a 70th wedding anniversary when I was born. You weren’t expected to be around that long,” she said. Even Prince Philip has decided it’s time to slow down a little, having, as he economically put it, “done his bit”, she said of her husband’s decision to retire from solo public engagements. “But I know his support and unique sense of humour will remain as strong as ever, as we enjoy spending time this Christmas with our family and look forward to welcoming new members into it next year.” Those words will be seen as a reference not just to the birth of the Duke and Duchess Cambridge’s third child, due in April, but also to the addition of Markle to the Windsor fold on 19 May with her marriage to Harry. Having already successfully navigated “the walkabout” and the Buckingham Palace pre-Christmas royal lunch, Markle was undertaking her most critical challenge to date ahead of joining “the firm” by spending her first Christmas with the royals on the Queen’s 20,000-acre Norfolk estate. Several hundred well-wishers had queued from dawn outside the gates of Sandringham to see the actor, best known for her role in the US legal drama Suits, join other senior members of the family for their traditional Christmas Day service at St Mary Magdalene church on the estate. Wearing a light brown coat, brown hat, boots and bag, she walked arm-in-arm with Harry as they made the short distance from Sandringham House to the church. It is the first time future sisters-in-law, the Duchess of Cambridge and Markle, have been photographed in public together. While the Queen arrived by car at the church, a sprightly Philip decided to walk with other family members. Markle is the only unmarried partner to have been invited to spend Christmas at Sandringham, and the Queen’s approval of the match was further evidenced by the prominence during the speech of a framed photograph of Harry and his fiancee on a table, as were other family photographs, including of the Queen and Philip on their wedding day. Harry, his future bride, and other royals stopped to chat to well-wishers on their walk back to Sandringham House following the church service. Several Americans from nearby RAF Lakenheath had made the journey to see the family. The wait provided an opportunity for Michael Metz from Texas to propose to his girlfriend, Ashley Millican, who accepted. Markle demonstrated she had perfected one important royal skill when both she and the Duchess of Cambridge curtsied to the Queen as the monarch left the church to return to Sandringham House by car. The actor’s coat was by the Canadian brand Sentaler, and made from baby alpaca wool selling for £986, while her leather Chloe pixie bag sells for £1,400. The royal family traditionally gather in front of the television after Christmas lunch to watch the broadcast. Produced this year by Sky News, it included a video montage of senior royals, including Philip doffing his bowler hat during his final solo engagement at Buckingham Palace. The message ended as it had begun with a performance by the Commonwealth Youth Orchestra and choir, and the Queen’s closing words, reflecting her faith: “It is Jesus Christ’s generous love and example which has inspired me through good times and bad.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2017/dec/28/government-crackdown-rogue-landlords","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-28T15:20:49Z","webTitle":"Government to tell rogue landlords: 'shape up or ship out'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/dec/28/government-crackdown-rogue-landlords","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2017/dec/28/government-crackdown-rogue-landlords","fields":{"headline":"Government to tell rogue landlords: 'shape up or ship out'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A package of measures to crack down on rogue landlords, including a tougher licensing regime for house shares and a minimum size for bedrooms, has been announced by the government. Alok Sharma, the housing minister, said “far too many” tenants were being exploited by unscrupulous landlords, who would now have to “shape up or ship out”. The measures come after the government was accused of undermining efforts to protect private sector tenants by curtailing the powers of local authorities to introduce landlord licensing schemes. Figures published two months ago under the Freedom of Information Act revealed that most councils had failed to secure a single landlord prosecution. Meanwhile, in an interview with the Independent, the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said at the next election his party would scrap laws that allowed landlords to evict tenants under so-called no-fault evictions. Ministers are to seek approval from parliament to widen the criteria for landlords in England, who need to secure a licence when renting out a “house in multiple occupation” (HMO). There are about 500,000 HMOs in England, and national mandatory licensing applies only to properties that are three or more storeys high. This is to be changed so that many flats and one- and two-storey properties would be subject to licensing, provided they are occupied by at least five people from two or more households. The move will affect about 160,000 houses. Rules have also been proposed that would set minimum size requirements for bedrooms in HMOs to prevent overcrowding. Rooms used for sleeping by one adult would have to be no smaller than 6.51 sq metres (70 sq ft), and those slept in by two adults would have to be no smaller than 10.22 sq metres. Rooms slept in by children aged 10 or younger would have to be at least 4.64 sq metres in size. As part of the licensing requirements, councils will be able to make sure only rooms meeting the standard are used for sleeping. The Department for Communities and Local Government said there would also be new rules to help people “fed up” with living near shoddily maintained properties without proper bins and rubbish dumped everywhere. Ministers intend to introduce a mandatory condition in HMO licences requiring landlords to comply with local council rules on refuse and recycling. The government has set out details of criminal offences, which would automatically ban someone from being a landlord. From April, an individual convicted of offences including burglary and stalking can be added to the database of rogue landlords and barred from renting out properties. Sharma said: “Through a raft of new powers, we are giving councils the further tools they need to crack down on these rogue landlords and kick them out of the business for good.” This month, however, Newham council in London – which has arguably led the way in tackling bad landlords, with 331 prosecuted as of last October – accused the government of standing in the way of councils that were trying to protect their tenants. In 2013, Newham became the first council in the country to introduce borough-wide licensing, requiring all landlords to licence all properties offered for private rent. However, in 2015 the government introduced legislation requiring ministerial permission to introduce such schemes, while the Newham scheme renewal a few weeks ago had conditions placed upon it – one part of the borough was excluded – and was also delayed unnecessarily, resulting in a gap of two to three months between the end of the old scheme and the start of the new one, according to the council. Sir Robin Wales, mayor of Newham, has called on the government to “remove this bureaucratic and anti-democratic piece of legislation, and let councils get on and introduce the right schemes to protect their private sector tenants from rogue landlords”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"football/2017/dec/28/swansea-carlos-carvahal-new-manager","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-28T12:07:56Z","webTitle":"Carlos Carvalhal says he is a ‘football romantic’ as he aims to keep Swansea up","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/dec/28/swansea-carlos-carvahal-new-manager","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/dec/28/swansea-carlos-carvahal-new-manager","fields":{"headline":"Carlos Carvalhal says he is a ‘football romantic’ as he aims to keep Swansea up","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Carlos Carvalhal described himself as a “footballing romantic” as he was presented as Swansea City’s fifth manager in the space of little more than two years, although the Portuguese has no time for fanciful storylines and made it clear that any act of escapology at the Premier League’s bottom club would be down to hard work rather than a miracle. Appointed as Paul Clement’s successor on a short-term contract until the end of the season, the former Sheffield Wednesday manager did his best to radiate positivity as he vowed to bring “a new dynamic” to a Swansea side five points adrift of safety and sleepwalking towards the Championship for months. It is a thankless task on the face of it, yet Carvalhal seemed grateful for the opportunity, perhaps not surprisingly given that he has never managed in the Premier League before. The 52-year-old, whose managerial career has seen him work in five countries and included spells in charge of Besiktas and Sporting Lisbon, revealed that he turned down offers in Turkey, England and Japan because he wanted to take a break from the game in the wake of leaving Sheffield Wednesday on Christmas Eve. “Then I had the call from Swansea and immediately I said I was ready to work,” Carvalhal said. “For the other situations I had said I needed some rest, but for this I knew my rest was over, I wanted to be here. I like difficult challenges. A lot of people will say that Swansea need a miracle to stay in the Premier League, but I don’t agree because miracles is something not from our world. It’s a very good challenge and we will fight to put the team in a better position. “I am a very positive person and I know that if you asked 100 people, other than Swansea fans, if they are going to get relegated, this is what they are thinking. They are five points adrift, the team aren’t playing good football, they aren’t scoring or creating chances. Nobody has many expectations of Swansea. But we can change things – that’s what we believe. We can improve the players and create a new dynamic.” It has been a whirlwind few days for Carvalhal, who only accepted Swansea’s offer late on Wednesday evening and left his home in Yorkshire at 4am on Thursday morning to be in Swansea in time to take training before his first game in charge, at Watford on Saturday. Carvalhal, who is bringing in two assistants and two analysts to work alongside him, said he would need to talk to Leon Britton, the player-coach who was placed in charge in a caretaker capacity for the previous two matches, before deciding what role the 35-year-old will fill. “Let’s see in which position he can help the club more,” the new man said. The burning issue for many Swansea supporters is how active the club will be in the market next month to improve a team desperately short of creativity and firepower and who finished the summer window with the lowest net spend in the Premier League. Carvalhal chose his words carefully in that respect, maybe mindful that he needs to keep everyone in the squad onside for the time being. “The clock is ticking, that’s absolutely correct, but we can’t do anything until 1 January so we have to try to give confidence to the players that are here first,” he said. “They need to show commitment and after that we will take decisions. We have talked about the possibility of bringing in players if we need it, and the chairman was open about that, but let’s see the weaknesses in the team first.” As well as suggesting Swansea would not be selling Alfie Mawson or anyone else next month, Carvalhal spoke about how he hopes to help Renato Sanches, a compatriot, rediscover some form. “I think he needs confidence. We can forget that even though he played for the national team and Benfica, he’s still a kid. He’s still learning, he needs a role in the team. When he understands exactly what we want, he can be a completely different player.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"business/2017/dec/30/a-record-breaking-year-the-global-economy-in-10-charts","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-30T08:00:07Z","webTitle":"A record-breaking year - the global economy in 10 charts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/dec/30/a-record-breaking-year-the-global-economy-in-10-charts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/dec/30/a-record-breaking-year-the-global-economy-in-10-charts","fields":{"headline":"A record-breaking year - the global economy in 10 charts","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"World equity markets boom Global stock markets have roared ahead in 2017, with the MSCI index of bourses in 47 countries up by 22% and almost $9tn (£6.6tn) according to Reuters. This has been fuelled by a boom in growth among developed nations and Donald Trump’s plan to cut US corporate tax rates – which is expected to boost company profits in the world’s largest economy and returns to shareholders. China managed to maintain its rate of expansion, dispelling fears over a potential sharp slowdown as it matures after decades of rapid growth, while the eurozone also staged a recovery after years of uncertainty. In Britain, the FTSE 100, packed with companies that earn much of their profit in foreign currencies, has surged as a result of stronger global growth and the weak pound since the Brexit vote. Buoyant global trade The Baltic Dry index is used as a proxy for global growth because it measures dry freight costs for commodities such as coal, rice and wheat. When there is a jump in demand for shipping these products, it signals expansion for the world economy. This year it has risen to its highest levels in four years amid a recovery in global trade. Other barometers for growth, such as surveys of business activity from firms’ purchasing managers, have shown appetite for goods and services in rude health across developed economies in recent months. Still, fears linger over a breakdown in trade from rising protectionism in the US and Europe. Investors stay relaxed Known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index is a measure of the stock market’s expectations for how much prices might swing by, up or down, over a 30-day period. The higher the index, the more likely it is investors will be in for a wild ride. This year, the barometer fell to its record low of below 9 points. Anything above 20 indicates that things are going awry, and is a common feature of falling markets. Pound stages Brexit comeback The pound has staged a recovery on global exchanges since the start of the year amid gradual progress in the Brexit negotiations. Although sterling is still about 10% below its level before the EU referendum, the currency has risen by almost 10% this year to stand at about $1.3505. Meanwhile, the dollar has struggled to benefit in 2017 from the Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes in March, June and December, while the euro has gained ground amid a strengthening eurozone economy and as expectations grow for the European Central Bank to finally start tightening monetary policy by curbing its quantitative easing programme. Eurozone on the mend One of the biggest surprises this year was stability in the eurozone after years of tumult. After the election of Donald Trump, many market watchers expected the next countries to succumb to populist politics would be in the EU – which could have spelled doom for the single currency. Marine Le Pen failed to take power in France, as did anti-Islam, anti-EU populist Geert Wilders in the Netherlands and Alternative für Deutschland in Germany. Meanwhile, amid a more stable political backdrop, growth has roared ahead. Still, accommodative monetary policy that is expected to be gradually withdrawn has helped, with ECB governor Mario Draghi saying the recovery will still heavily rely on stimulus from the central bank for now. Wage growth remains subdued There has been tepid growth in the price of goods around the world, barring the UK, where the pound’s sudden devaluation following the Brexit vote led to surge in imported food and fuel costs. Wage growth in particular was missing in action in 2017, despite low rates of unemployment across most major developed economies. This has left many in the economics profession puzzled, because tight labour markets typically lead to greater levels of bargaining power among workers to demand higher wages. It also poses an additional challenge to central bankers – who would like to see stronger wage inflation before they raise interest rates, normalising the world economy after years of stimulus in the wake of the global financial crisis that started 10 years ago. Productivity puzzle persists The failure to drive up the productivity of workers has puzzled economists the world over this year, not least in the UK. Although the problem is particularly sharp in Britain, each of the G7 nations has experienced sluggish growth since the crash a decade ago. That’s a worrying sign for wage growth, because greater output per hour worked, or per worker, can help to support higher pay for that output. The culprit could be higher levels of employment, low interest rates, or low levels of investment in productivity boosting projects by governments and businesses. In the UK, weak productivity growth was behind a sharp downgrade to GDP growth alongside Philip Hammond’s budget in November. It’s also one of the key reasons why UK workers aren’t expected to see their wages after inflation go back above pre-crisis levels until the mid 2020s. Oil bubbles up The global oil price has recovered sharply in 2017, benefiting from increasing demand from factories around the world, particularly in China, amid a boom in economic activity. After crashing in late 2015 to spook global markets, this year has been one of calm and steady gains. Opec has reined in production to keep a lid on supply, while there have been no major escalations in tensions to drive up the price to unsustainable levels. One warning: US shale oil production may start to come back online at current prices, as the more expensive costs involved with extraction become economical once more. This could boost supply, leading prices to fall. Bitcoin mania takes hold Probably the financial story of the year. Even though there are fears of a coming crash, 2017 will go down as the year of the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin’s rise has been meteoric, beginning the year valued at about $1,000 and reaching almost $20,000 by the middle of December. There have been wild swings on the way, with the currency losing more than a quarter of its value in a single day this month, before staging a recovery. Economists think bitcoin has all the telltale signs of a bubble, with worrying parallels to the Tulip mania of the 17th century, when the price of bulbs crashed in spectacular fashion after a buying frenzy. Chinese debt worries China’s rapidly accumulating debt pile, having quadrupled since the financial crisis, became of increasing concern this year – although has not yet roiled the global markets. The International Monetary Fund warned that Chinese debt is now high versus international norms and that rapid growth may have led to an unwillingness among officials to let struggling firms fail. In September, Standard &amp; Poor’s downgraded its credit rating citing the risks from total debts in, which have quadrupled since the financial crisis. While China has started taking steps to rein in debt without having affected growth so far, economists worry a wrong move by officials could upset the apple cart in the near future. • Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/dec/29/homebase-boss-opts-three-month-break-back-home-australia-bunnings","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-29T08:33:25Z","webTitle":"Homebase boss opts for three-month time-out back home in Australia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/dec/29/homebase-boss-opts-three-month-break-back-home-australia-bunnings","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/dec/29/homebase-boss-opts-three-month-break-back-home-australia-bunnings","fields":{"headline":"Homebase boss opts for three-month time-out back home in Australia","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The UK boss of Bunnings is taking a surprise three-month break as the new Australian owner of Homebase struggles to crack Britain’s DIY market. Peter “PJ” Davis will start his extended period of leave in mid-January, a decision that will raise eyebrows in the City. The 59-year-old company veteran defended his decision to take time out. He said: “I’ve been away from my family in Australia for three years and I want to take a break and I’m going to take a break. “We have brought in a number of new senior executives so now seems like a good time. Then I’ll come back fresh as a daisy and get on with it.” Asked about the performance of Homebase, Davis said: “The business is tough.” Wesfarmers, the Australian conglomerate, took a gamble with its £340m purchase of the struggling Homebase chain in 2016. It intends to give the 250-store chain a facelift, spending £500m to turn it into a British version of the successful Australian DIY chain Bunnings, which is famous for low prices and customer service. But at last count Homebase’s figures made grim reading, with sales tumbling nearly 14% in the three months to September, a disastrous performance blamed on clearing discontinued stock. The chain lost £54m in the first full year of Wesfarmers’ ownership and that figure is expected to increase in the current financial year, which runs until June. Damian McGloughlin, who joined from the rival DIY chain B&amp;Q this year, would be stepping up as acting managing director, the company confirmed. Bunnings has also drafted in David Haydon from sister chain Officeworks to run Homebase. Haydon, who has worked for Wickes and B&amp;Q, will be acting chief operating officer in Davis’s absence. With years of hard work and a lot of cash required to reinvent Homebase, there are questions mark over whether new Wesfarmers chief executive Rob Scott, who according to Australian press reports recently visited the UK, will be as committed to the expensive project as his predecessor Richard Goyder. John Gillam, who as boss of Bunnings was a keen supporter of the deal, has also left the group. At Wesfarmers’ quarterly update in October, Bunnings’ managing director, Michael Schneider, said: “While the performance of Homebase is disappointing, we continue to be encouraged by the performance of the Bunnings pilots. We will patiently trial a range of formats, locations, and competitive environments to achieve proof of concept.” There are 15 Bunnings stores in the UK, with the most recent Homebase conversion in Bicester, Oxfordshire. At just 36,700 sq ft, the Bicester branch is half the size of its big box format Bunnings Warehouse and its success will provide a template for smaller stores in the chain. • Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/dec/28/the-breakdown-alternative-rugby-rulebook-2018","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-28T11:26:10Z","webTitle":"The alternative rugby rule book: welcome to the Breakdown laws","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/dec/28/the-breakdown-alternative-rugby-rulebook-2018","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/dec/28/the-breakdown-alternative-rugby-rulebook-2018","fields":{"headline":"The alternative rugby rule book: welcome to the Breakdown laws","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"World Rugby is bringing out a simplified version of the game’s law book on New Year’s Day, ushering in 2018 by untangling the complex web of dos and don’ts so even the most casual TV viewer will have some idea of what is going on when the referee’s whistle is blown. The law book is slimming down by 42% after a two-year process undertaken by an eight-strong working party which consulted every one of World Rugby’s 120 member unions and its six associations. It was decided early on that the laws were not the problem but the long-winded way in which they were written down with more subsections than a newspaper in the glory days of print. The simplification, it is said, will make the laws easier to understand while not altering their meaning or affecting the way the game is played. The Breakdown has been given a preview and is able to provide (tongue-in-cheek) examples of how the less prolix version reads … Law 3: Definition. A team consists of 15 players. A substitute replaces a team-mate for tactical reasons. A replacement replaces a team-mate with a tactical injury. 3.3: A Union may authorise matches to be played with fewer than 15 players in each team. When that happens, all laws of the game must apply except the one that says a team must consist of 15 players. 5.1: Duration of a match. A match lasts no more than 80 minutes, plus time lost and the hours it takes for referrals to the television match official and reset scrums. 6.a.4: The referee is the sole judge of fact and of law during a match, until he or she consults the television match official. 8.2: Advantage. The advantage must be clear and real. A mere opportunity to gain advantage is not enough. If the non-offending team do not gain an advantage after 10 minutes or that team’s scrum-half demands a penalty, the referee blows the whistle and, if he or she remembers where it is, brings play back to the place of the infringement. 10.2.d: A player must not commit any act that may lead the match officials to consider that player was subject to foul play or any other infringement committed by an opponent. So if a player is punched, he or she must not go to ground and must hide any bleeding. 10.3.1: A player must not repeatedly infringe any law. Repeated infringement is a matter of fact based on opinion. The question of whether the player intended to infringe is irrelevant because none of them knows the laws. 10.4.c: A player must not deliberately kick an opponent. Claiming to mistake a bald head for the ball is not an excuse that will be accepted by a disciplinary panel. 10.4.h: A player must not charge into a ruck or a maul unless his team are in possession. 10.4.k: Players must not intentionally collapse a scrum, ruck or maul by accident. 10.4.1: A player must not retaliate unless he or she does so first. 11.1: General play. A player is offside when he or she is not onside. Loitering without intent is no excuse. A player who is in an offside position is not automatically penalised but always is. 12.1.f: Intentional knock or throw forward: A player must not deliberately knock the ball forward with hand or arm. Hands or arms are another matter. 16: Ruck: Definition: A ruck is a phase of play where one or more players from each team, who are on their feet, in physical contact, close around the ball on the ground and then fall on it. 16.7.c: When the ball has been clearly won by a team at a ruck and the ball is available to be played, the referee will call “Use it” after which the ball must be played within five seconds. No extra time is allowed for players who do not understand English. 17.2.6: Placing a hand on another player in the maul does not constitute binding but this law is not often binding. 18: Definition: To make a mark, a player must make a clean catch from an opponent’s kick and do so with his mouth open. 19.7.c: A player must not intentionally or repeatedly throw the ball into a lineout not straight. The definition of not straight is not patently crooked. If the ball goes straight to the thrower’s scrum-half, the non-offending team shall be awarded a scrum when it will be allowed to put in the ball crookedly. 20.5: Throwing the ball into the scrum: The scrum-half must throw the ball in straight – straight to his or her No8 so there is every chance of getting the ball away quickly with the referee not having to worry about a reset. 20.12.b: Offside at the scrum: When a team have won the ball in a scrum, the scrum-half of that team is offside if both feet are in front of the ball while it is still in the scrum. If the scrum-half has only one foot in front of the ball, he is half off and half on. 21.3.c: Penalty and free-kicks: The kicker must use the ball that was in play unless the referee decides that he or she is defective. Bill Beaumont, the World Rugby chairman, reckons the slimline law book will make rugby union easier to understand: “The laws can be difficult for new participants and fans and the new law book goes a long way towards simplifying it as we continue to strive to make the sport accessible to all,” he said.

The former prime minister’s aversion may have reflected a reluctance to imitate her predecessor, Ted Heath, who brought back pandas from China, dislike of manipulative political stunts or, possibly, a deeper antipathy towards the slow-moving creatures. A confidential file on London Zoo, which records repeated debt crises at the Regent’s Park attraction, contains a letter from the cabinet secretary, Robert Armstrong, to her private secretary, Clive Whitmore, proposing an Anglo-American initiative that would generate mutually beneficial publicity. The Smithsonian Institution in Washington had asked London Zoo for the loan of its male panda, Chia Chia, brought back by Heath from China in 1974, so that it could be mated with its female panda. Lord Zuckerman, president of London Zoo, enthused that it would be a “demonstration of the special relationship” and that he was happy to time an announcement of the loan to suit Thatcher, the letter reported. “He even suggested that the prime minister might like to take the panda in the back of her Concorde when she goes to Washington next month.” Appalled at the prospect, she scribbled in her customary, blue felt pen on the note: “I am not [double underlined] taking a panda with me. Pandas and politicians are not happy omens! Lord Z knows more about pandas than I do. I am sure he can arrange these things”. Although Whitmore transcribed her comments in a subsequent Number 10 note as “not happy omens”, the original writing looks more like ‘ … not love omens’. Whitmore may have been sanitising her remarks. The following year, Thatcher expressed a weary acceptance that more money would have to be given to London Zoo to save it from closure. “The zoo is a British institution,” the prime minister commented on another letter. “I fear there will have to be a further interim grant.” In September 1982, Armstrong was prompted again by Lord Zuckerman about his hopes for a fresh round of panda diplomacy. “As it turns out the female of [the] pair [brought back by Heath from China] is highly unlikely ever to breed,” the cabinet secretary recorded. “London Zoo would clearly like to have a fertile female and, in due course, a baby Panda. I think that Lord Zuckerman hopes that, if the prime minister were to be offered a female giant panda for the British people she might feel able to accept it.” On the letter, an official wrote: “Prime minister. A bit passé, but no doubt you would not look a gift horse, or even a panda in the mouth?” Thatcher replied: “Yes, I would. The history of pandas … is unlucky.” Her hostility towards the animals was in stark contrast to her readiness to meet the disgraced ex-president Richard Nixon, despite civil servants warning her off. The newly released files record several attempts by the Conservative MP Jonathan Aitken to obtain an audience for Nixon, who resigned in 1974 following the Watergate scandal. The Foreign Office advised against her seeing him in 1980. Two years later, Aitken wrote to her office again requesting that Nixon, who was passing through London, be allowed to call in. “Yes”, she noted on the letter. A telegram despatched by Nixon shortly after their conversation suggests their encounter had been mutually engaging. “Congratulations on your rail strike victory,” he sent from New York. “Your gutsy leadership both domestically and internationally continues to inspire free peoples everywhere.” She wrote back: “I very much enjoyed our talk the other day”. Nixon pioneered the art of panda diplomacy, bringing back two from China to the US in 1972. Presumably, that topic did not surface."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/dec/28/everton-cenk-tosun-besiktas-turkey-striker","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-28T10:22:51Z","webTitle":"Everton agree £25m deal with Besiktas for Turkey striker Cenk Tosun","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/dec/28/everton-cenk-tosun-besiktas-turkey-striker","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/dec/28/everton-cenk-tosun-besiktas-turkey-striker","fields":{"headline":"Everton agree £25m deal with Besiktas for Turkey striker Cenk Tosun","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Everton have agreed a £25m deal with Besiktas to sign the Turkey striker Cenk Tosun, with the 26-year-old ready to sign a four-and-a-half year contract when the transfer window reopens on 1 January. Despite an unbeaten run of seven matches that has pulled them clear of the relegation battle, Everton have scored only 24 league goals this season and have been searching for a striker to replace Romelu Lukaku. Another attempt to sign Arsenal’s Olivier Giroud was rebuffed earlier this month, with Arsène Wenger keen for the France international to remain at the Emirates. This led to a formal approach for Tosun. Allardyce has tracked the former Eintracht Frankfurt and Gaziantepspor player for some time and recommended him to Crystal Palace, who had a bid rejected in the summer. A brilliant season for Besiktas in which Tosun has scored 13 times – including four in the Champions League as his club reached the knockout stages – has seen his stock rise considerably. Everton’s offer of £15m was rejected before an agreement was struck on Tuesday, with Besiktas set to receive around £20m up front and another £5m in performance-related clauses. It is understood Tosun’s father and agent accompanied him to the club’s training ground on Wednesday to discuss personal terms and complete his medical. Born in Germany, Tosun joined Eintracht Frankfurt’s youth system in 1997 but made only one appearance for the first team before moving to Gaziantepspor in 2011, where he spent three seasons. He joined Besiktas in 2014 and has scored 41 goals in 96 matches. Despite making two appearances for Germany’s Under-21 side, Tosun opted to play for Turkey at senior level and has eight goals from his 24 caps."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"money/2017/dec/28/apples-tim-cook-paid-102m-this-year-including-bonuses-worth-98m","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-28T13:05:13Z","webTitle":"Apple's Tim Cook paid $102m this year including bonuses worth $98m","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/dec/28/apples-tim-cook-paid-102m-this-year-including-bonuses-worth-98m","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2017/dec/28/apples-tim-cook-paid-102m-this-year-including-bonuses-worth-98m","fields":{"headline":"Apple's Tim Cook paid $102m this year including bonuses worth $98m","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Apple’s chief executive, Tim Cook, was paid $102m (£76m) this year after collecting a huge share bonus linked to the iPhone maker’s stock market performance. Cook was paid a basic salary of $3.06m, a cash bonus of $9.3m (up from $5.4m last year), and collected share awards worth $89m taking his total 2017 payout to $102m, Apple disclosed in a regulatory filing. The bonus of 560,000 shares paid out in September. Cook received half the award because Apple’s stock delivered shareholder returns in the top third of the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 index during the past three years. He got the other 280,000 shares for simply staying in the job. The stock package awarded to Cook when he became chief executive in 2011 was originally valued at $376m, but is now worth much more because Apple shares have increased six-fold since he signed the deal. As long as he remains the boss, Cook will receive 560,000 shares of stock annually until 2020. He will then get 1.26m shares in August 2021 as the final payment under his original contract. Apple’s filing also revealed that it requires Cook to travel by private aircraft “for all business and personal travel” for security reasons. Cook’s use of the private jet for his holidays cost the company $93,000. The cost of his personal security detail was $224,000. Cook collected an extra $104,000 in “vacation cash out”, and his basic $3m salary was increased to $3,057,692 “because 2017 was a 53-week fiscal year, the 2017 salary amounts reflect an extra week of pay”. That extra week’s pay is slightly more than the median US annual household income of $56,516, according to the US Census. Cook’s top five lieutenants were paid about $24.2m each. Luca Maestri, chief financial officer; Angela Ahrendts, head of retail; Johny Srouji, head of hardware technology; Dan Riccio, head of hardware engineering; and Bruce Sewell, the outgoing general counsel, collected $20m in share awards, cash bonuses of $3.1m and basic pay of just over $1m. The amount paid to Jony Ive, the company’s British chief design officer, was not included in the filing. Apple’s shares have increased by more than 200% since Cook became chief executive in August 2011, shortly before founder and previous chief executive Steve Jobs died. The shares peaked at $176.4 on 18 December but have since weakened slightly to $170.60 following reports of weaker than expected demand for its new $999 iPhone X."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/dec/30/partner-of-man-due-for-deportation-begs-dutton-not-to-make-her-a-single-mother","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-30T03:05:44Z","webTitle":"Partner of man due for deportation begs Dutton not to make her a single mother","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/dec/30/partner-of-man-due-for-deportation-begs-dutton-not-to-make-her-a-single-mother","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/dec/30/partner-of-man-due-for-deportation-begs-dutton-not-to-make-her-a-single-mother","fields":{"headline":"Partner of man due for deportation begs Dutton not to make her a single mother","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The partner of a Vietnamese man who is scheduled to be deported from Australia on 1 January has pleaded with the immigration minister, Peter Dutton, to let him remain and help raise their 10-month-old child. HPN arrived in Australia by boat as a 12-year-old in 2010 and has lived for the past seven years in community detention in Perth with other asylum seekers who travelled as unaccompanied minors. He met his partner, Kesinee Kingrak, when they both attended Greenwood College high school and they began dating in 2014. Their daughter, Lily, was born in February and they planned to announce their engagement in the new year. His application for refugee status and subsequent review were rejected in 2011 and then reviewed again after a data breach. He was taken from community detention to the Perth immigration detention centre on 22 December, the day before his 20th birthday. On Thursday his lawyers lodged a federal court application requesting a judicial review of his refugee application on the grounds that the initial rejection failed to consider all the relevant protocols. The high court this month heard a challenge to the fast-track assessment process that applies to asylum seekers who arrive by boat, a later iteration of the non-statutory process used in HPN’s case, which Legal Aid Victoria argued was “fundamentally unfair”. Anna Copeland, a lawyer from Southern Community Advocacy Legal Education Service, wrote to Dutton last week requesting ministerial intervention to allow HPN to apply for a temporary partner visa to remain with Kingrak and Lily. She said Kingrak was very distressed at being forced to separate from HPN. But the Department of Home Affairs has said that because HPN is classified as an unauthorised maritime arrival, and his refugee claim was therefore assessed in a non-statutory process rather than by the migration tribunal, he does not meet any of the ordinary categories for ministerial intervention. As a boat arrival, he is also not eligible to apply for a visa. Copeland is seeking an exemption under section 195A of the Migration Act 1958, which states that the minister may grant a visa of any class to a person who is held in immigration detention “if the minister thinks that it is in the public interest to do so”. HPN told immigration authorities in 2010 that his parents, who are devout Catholics, had sent him away because the Vietnamese government reclaimed land belonging to their church and they feared he would be exposed to persecution. In an immigration interview, he said: “My mother told me to go and don’t come back.” He remains a practising Catholic. In a letter to the immigration department, Copeland said deporting HPN would negatively impact Kingrak, a permanent resident, and Lily, an Australian citizen, by depriving them of his support and making Kingrak a single mother. She requested he grant a temporary partner visa, which would allow HPN to work and live with Kingrak to apply for a permanent partner visa. The ministerial guidelines for intervening in migration cases state that the minister has discretion to intervene where there are “strong compassionate circumstances that if not recognised would result in serious, ongoing and irreversible harm and continuing hardship to an Australian citizen or an Australian family unit, where at least one member of the family is an Australian citizen or Australian permanent resident”. “He has formed this little family and it is not good for any of them to be separated,” Copeland said. “It is unnecessary as he would clearly meet the criteria for a partner visa, as he and Kesinee have a genuine and continuing relationship.” Through Copeland, HPN told Guardian Australia that he did not want to be separated from his daughter. He said that he helped Kingrak with Lily every day, despite his community detention order meaning they are unable to live together, and had taught her to sit up and wave goodbye. Two earlier letters from the Labor MPs Tim Hammond, on behalf of HPN, and Anne Aly, on behalf of Kingrak, who lives in her electorate, requesting ministerial intervention have gone unanswered. If HPN is deported, Copeland said, it could be some years until he was cleared to reapply to enter Australia and able to afford the $8,000 fee to apply for a partner visa. Copeland said HPN’s detention had already caused “unnecessary suffering”, including causing him to miss his daughter’s first Christmas. In a statement, a spokeswoman for the Department of Home Affairs said the department was unable to comment on individual cases, but that “individuals who have exhausted all avenues to remain in Australia are expected to depart”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/28/us-and-germany-call-for-release-of-chinese-activist-super-vulgar-butcher","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-28T03:45:29Z","webTitle":"US and Germany call for release of Chinese activist 'Super Vulgar Butcher'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/28/us-and-germany-call-for-release-of-chinese-activist-super-vulgar-butcher","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/28/us-and-germany-call-for-release-of-chinese-activist-super-vulgar-butcher","fields":{"headline":"US and Germany call for release of Chinese activist 'Super Vulgar Butcher'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The United States and Germany have called for China to release a prominent human rights activist who was jailed this week for eight years on subversion charges, in a rare rebuke that called on the government to view dissidents as partners rather than enemies. The two countries were “deeply disappointed” by the sentence of Wu Gan, better known by his online nom de plume “Super Vulgar Butcher”, according to a joint statement by the US and German embassies in Beijing. Wu’s sentence was the harshest in a spate of politically motivated trails targeting civil rights lawyers and activists. “We call on the Chinese authorities to release Wu immediately,” the two embassies said in a joint statement. “We urge Chinese authorities to view lawyers and rights defenders as partners in strengthening Chinese society through development of the rule of law.” China launched an unprecedented crackdown on human rights lawyers beginning in 2015, detaining and questioned nearly 250 people in what some have dubbed a “war on law”. Wu remained defiant after his trial and said his harsh sentence was the result of his refusal to become a “slave” to China’s “autocracy”. “I got eight years, but I feel no grief or despair. This was my choice, because opposing autocracy means you are already on the road to jail,” Wu said in the statement relayed by his lawyer after the trial. “I call on the international community to pay attention to China’s deteriorating human rights situation.” Another prominent attorney, Xie Yang, was tried on Tuesday but was not given any punishment after he retracted claims he has been tortured in custody. “As Xie has been exempted from punishment, we urge China to allow Xie to resume his professional activities without preconditions and be free of any restrictions,” the US and Germany said. Chinese state media was quick to condemn the two governments, calling the comments “a naked interference in internal affairs”. The human rights lawyers arrested in the crackdown were a “poisonous mushroom growing in Chinese society”, said an editorial in the Global Times, a state run tabloid."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/dec/28/shopkeeper-karate-skills-tackle-attempted-robber","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-28T16:44:13Z","webTitle":"Shopkeeper uses karate skills to tackle robber","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/dec/28/shopkeeper-karate-skills-tackle-attempted-robber","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/dec/28/shopkeeper-karate-skills-tackle-attempted-robber","fields":{"headline":"Shopkeeper uses karate skills to tackle robber","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A man apparently trying to carry out an armed robbery on a corner shop on Christmas Eve ended up pinned to the floor by the shopkeeper – a black belt in karate – and “begging” to be released. CCTV footage showed the man threatening Sibu Kuruvilla and an assistant with what appeared to be a pistol inside the shop, before being thrown to the floor. Police later arrived, alerted via the shop’s silent alarm. “You get to a point where you think you have to do something and you have to react. That is where I thought I could do something and I have the courage to do it,” Kuruvilla said. Despite the assailant’s pleas, Kuruvilla held him down for about a quarter of an hour – refusing to let him go in case he went to rob another nearby shop. The incident happened in the branch of Premier Supersaver in Evington, on the outskirts of Leicester. Kuruvilla, 43, was about to close up for the evening when the man shouted at him and his colleague to hand over the day’s takings, waving the gun in the air. He pointed a gun at Kuruvilla’s head and dragged him towards the till. But the married father of two, a 1st dan black belt in Seibukan karate, waited for a chance to snatch the pistol. He and his colleague then wrestled the attacker into submission, using a leg lock that left the attacker pleading to be released. Kuruvilla said his teacher had instructed him to tackle people when put in such a situation. “I do a bit of martial arts, I do Seibukan karate, so it is probably because of that I got the courage to tackle him.” He said his assailant, whom he described as a “big bloke”, was not expecting the sudden attack. “He was thinking: ‘Easy money, two minutes, two grand,’ something like that.” The shopkeeper, a former chef, said the man was begging to be freed. “He was tired. He gave up I think.” He said the man promised not to return to the shop but Kuruvilla told him: “You will not come back to this shop – but you’ll go to another shop, so I won’t let you go.” The shopkeeper’s two daughters, aged seven and nine, were locked in the back office during the incident and watched it unfold on CCTV. The experience left them scared and Kuruvilla shaken up, he said. Of the man he tackled, he added: “I hope he will learn his lessons and move on as a better person.” Leicestershire police said a 17-year-old male had been arrested in connection with the incident and bailed pending police inquiries."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2017/dec/28/unclear-unfunny-delete-editors-notes-on-milo-yiannopoulos-book-revealed","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-28T15:43:35Z","webTitle":"'Unclear, unfunny, delete': editor's notes on Milo Yiannopoulos book revealed","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/dec/28/unclear-unfunny-delete-editors-notes-on-milo-yiannopoulos-book-revealed","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/dec/28/unclear-unfunny-delete-editors-notes-on-milo-yiannopoulos-book-revealed","fields":{"headline":"'Unclear, unfunny, delete': editor's notes on Milo Yiannopoulos book revealed","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Court documents filed in the US have revealed the editorial concerns of the publisher Simon &amp; Schuster about the manuscript of the “alt-right” controversialist Milo Yiannopoulos’s autobiography Dangerous. Having reportedly secured the book for an advance of $255,000 (£200,000), Simon &amp; Schuster cancelled the deal in February after a recording emerged that appeared to show Yiannopoulos endorsing sex between “younger boys” and older men. In July, Yiannopoulos set out to sue Simon &amp; Schuster for $10m for breach of contract. As part of the case, Simon &amp; Schuster have submitted documents that reveal the problems they had with the book. Among other criticisms, the publisher’s notes say Yiannopoulos needed a “stronger argument against feminism than saying that they are ugly and sexless and have cats” and that another chapter needs “a better central thesis than the notion that gay people should go back in the closet”. In addition to the documents, a full copy of an early manuscript of the book, complete with the Simon &amp; Schuster editor Mitchell Ivers’s notes, is available to download from the New York state courts’ website. The tone is set in notes on the prologue to the manuscript. Ivers writes to Yiannopoulos: “Throughout the book, your best points seem to be lost in a sea of self-aggrandizement and scattershot thinking,” and adds: “Careful that the egotistical boasting … doesn’t make you seem juvenile.” “Add something like this – only less self-serving” reads another comment early in the manuscript. Ivers frequently calls on Yiannopoulos to back up his assertions in the text. In the first nine pages of chapter one, notes include: “Citations needed”, “Do you have proof of this?”, “Unsupportable charge” and “Cite examples”. Yiannopoulos was permanently banned from Twitter in 2016 after his role in the online harassment of the Ghostbusters actor Leslie Jones. The editor makes several notes asking the author to tone down racism in the text. “Delete irrelevant and superfluous ethnic joke,” Ivers writes of a passage about taxi drivers. “Let’s not call South Africa ‘white’” is another request, while elsewhere Yiannopoulos is reprimanded for using the phrase “dark continent” about Africa. Yiannopoulos, who was filmed singing America the Beautiful while the white nationalist leader Richard Spencer and others gave the Hitler salute in the audience, is also criticised for attempting to suggest that the Hollywood left is more racist than Nazis. “I don’t like using Nazi analogies. Ever,” is the editor’s note. Yiannopoulos is repeatedly warned his choice of words is undermining any argument he is attempting to make. “The use of phrases like ‘two-faced backstabbing bitches’ diminishes your overall point,” reads one comment. “Too important a point to end in a crude quip” is another. “Unclear, unfunny, delete,” reads another. The early sections of a chapter on feminism prompt the note: “Don’t start chapter with accusation that feminists = fat. It destroys any seriousness of purpose.” Yiannopoulos goes on to criticise contemporary feminism as “merely a capitalist con-job – a money-grab designed to sell T-shirts to Taylor Swift and Beyoncé fans with asinine slogans”. “Um … like your MILO SWAG?” the editor responds. Ivers’s evident exasperation becomes clear by page 84, where Yiannopoulos’s call for lesbians to be thrown out of academia altogether simply elicits the all-upper-case comment: “DELETE UGH.” On Wednesday, Ivers “retweeted without comment” Publishing Perspectives’ Editor-in-Chief Porter Anderson pointing out that Ivers’ overall review described the book as “at best, a superficial work full of incendiary jokes with no coherent or sophisticated analysis of political issues”. However, the emergence of the notes have not allowed Simon &amp; Schuster to escape continued criticism for their initial striking of a deal with Yiannopoulos, or their editorial efforts to make his ideas more palatable to the market. The comments from Ivers came to wider attention when excerpts were posted to Twitter by software engineer Sarah Mei, who suggested some of them might make great observations to use in the future. Dangerous was eventually self-published in July 2017. While Yiannopoulos claimed that it had sold 100,000 copies in its first few days on sale, data revealed that it had in fact sold fewer than 20,000."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/31/face-the-facts-about-the-internet-gig-sharing-economy","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-31T08:00:25Z","webTitle":"It’s time to face the facts about our digital world | John Naughton","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/31/face-the-facts-about-the-internet-gig-sharing-economy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/31/face-the-facts-about-the-internet-gig-sharing-economy","fields":{"headline":"It’s time to face the facts about our digital world","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"For me, the tech stories of 2017 turned out not to be really tech stories at all. Mostly they were about politics, as the non-tech world woke up to the fact that this digital stuff really affected them. As, for example, when they realised that for a mere $30,000 the Russians could beam subtle political messages to as many as 126 million US voters in an election year without anyone (including Facebook) apparently noticing. Or when big consumer brands suddenly realised that it wasn’t a good idea to have their ads running on YouTube alongside beheading or white supremacist videos. Or when parents woke up to the fact that not everything running on the YouTube Kids channel was wholesome or harmless. That people were so surprised by these discoveries suggests that the perceptual time lag between technological change and public awareness is longer than we had supposed. The internet, after all, is more than four decades old. For the first 20 years of its existence, cyberspace and the physical world were parallel universes. One was a virtual space with no crime, warfare, violence, politics, espionage or government regulation; the other was exactly the opposite. But from about 1993 onwards (when the web began to take off) things changed, and the two universes merged to produce the networked world we now inhabit – a place where it no longer makes sense to distinguish between offline and online activity. It’s all just stuff that happens. The technical has become social. Given that, we would expect to see new kinds of literature emerging, composed not by techies celebrating the wonders of digital technology but by writers puzzled or disturbed by what it’s doing to society, or by people who are on the receiving end of the disruption. We need something like Humphrey Jennings’s wonderful compendium Pandaemonium: The Coming of the Machine as Seen by Contemporary Observers, 1660-1885, which gave us such a vivid impression of how people experienced the first industrial revolution. Two marvellous essays appeared this year that suggest promising stirrings in our own literary undergrowth. Both are by workers in the so-called gig economy. Jaime Christley is an Uber driver in New York and his A Day in the Uber Life provides a riveting insight into what it’s like to be managed by an algorithm in a merciless world. He’s a former yellow cab driver who switched to Uber, and his account of the coming of the Silicon Valley barbarians has echoes of Tom Wolfe and Hunter S Thompson in their heydays. “Management panicked because we were all independents, and could walk away with absolutely no advance notice. Handmade signs and photocopied news articles, taped up by the management, started to appear around the office and waiting areas, bad-mouthing Uber for unfair practices. The morning dispatcher who glared at you every day, just for living, suddenly was all smiles, cracking jokes. You started getting newer cars with low miles, not the junkers that had fun features like ripped seat belts and trunks that don’t open. There were two or three other employees around the garage, hard guys from the bad old days who’d rather be framed for murder than treat hacks with an iota of human respect. Because they wouldn’t change their ways, well, one day you noticed you hadn’t seen so-and-so for a couple of weeks. They vanished like political dissidents under an authoritarian regime.” The other writer, Sam Riches, is a bike courier in Toronto working for a Deliveroo-type algorithm. Like Christley, he writes taut conversational prose in which the humiliation of gig employment hisses like a firehose forced through a very narrow aperture. Here he is, for example, in What Being a Bike Courier Taught Me About Our Broken Economy: “I wonder what happens when someone orders a pizza. A pizza won’t fit in the delivery bag. I figure there has to be something in the algorithm, something built into the app, that funnels pizza orders to those with vehicles. Then I get a call. It’s a pizza delivery. At the restaurant, a server hands me two bags of food and a cartoonishly large pizza box. ‘I’ll let you figure that out,’ he says. “I push my bike along the busy sidewalk, trying to get back on to the road. I keep the pizza balanced across my handlebars. An older woman glares at me and shakes her head and clicks her tongue, tsk-tsking. I’m trying. I want to tell her, I’m trying.” We need more of this, more challenges to the Orwellian cant of an industry in which renting out your spare bedroom makes you a part of the “sharing economy”, intrusive messages are described as “reaching out”, and humans getting paid two cents a time for vetting possibly pornographic images are called “Mechanical Turks”. As Wittgenstein once put it, anything that can be said can be said clearly. So how about this as a New Year resolution: call a spade a spade, even when it’s digital?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"society/2017/dec/28/scottish-police-to-be-trained-to-spot-new-domestic-abuse-offence","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-28T13:46:33Z","webTitle":"Scottish police to be trained to spot new domestic abuse offence","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/dec/28/scottish-police-to-be-trained-to-spot-new-domestic-abuse-offence","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/dec/28/scottish-police-to-be-trained-to-spot-new-domestic-abuse-offence","fields":{"headline":"Scottish police to be trained to spot new domestic abuse offence","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Around 14,000 Police Scotland officers are to receive specialist training in preparation for a new domestic abuse crime coming into force in Scotland, which is believed to be unique in law internationally. The training will help officers spot seemingly innocuous actions which are in fact part of a cycle of psychological abuse or coercive control. Although an offence of coercive control was introduced in England in 2015, the Scottish legislation takes a unique approach which has been hailed as offering “victimless prosecution”. It reflects a growing understanding that domestic abuse is often a course of behaviour that extends over a period of time and includes not only physical violence. The domestic abuse bill, which reaches its final stage through Holyrood early next year, will create a specific offence which will cover not only physical domestic abuse but other forms of psychological abuse and coercive and controlling behaviour that cannot easily be prosecuted using the existing criminal law. It allows the police and courts to pursue someone on a “course of conduct” offence – that is a single offence where physical, psychological and coercive behaviour can be prosecuted at once. This course of conduct offence includes a “reasonable person test”. For example, would a reasonable person consider that limiting a woman’s access to her bank account or prescribing her meal times amounted to controlling behaviour? The chief executive of Scottish Women’s Aid, Marsha Scott, said: “Women have been telling us for years that it is emotional abuse that is most harmful. “This is a unique way to draft legislation that allows for victimless prosecution of domestic violence. Because you don’t have to prove harm to the victim [because of the reasonable person test] it could reduce the re-victimisation of women in court. It’s a shift in the culture to focus on the perpetrator rather than the victim, and concentrating on the key question of how we stop men abusing.” Since the introduction of the English coercive control legislation, concerns have been raised that it is not being used enough and has created an unhelpful hierarchy of harms, in part due to a lack of specialist training for police officers. Committing to funding the officer training on Thursday, the justice secretary, Michael Matheson, said: “Attitudes towards domestic abuse are changing – it’s no longer seen as a private matter, or no business of criminal law. We’re doing everything we can to tackle the scourge that is domestic abuse at every opportunity – supporting victims, tackling perpetrators with enhanced legislation, and also tackling the underlying attitudes and inequalities that very often create the conditions for violence against women and girls to take place. There’s no place for it in Scotland and this new funding will greatly assist in tackling it.” The assistant chief constable of Police Scotland Gillian MacDonald said specialist training would help officers to spot the signs of domestic abuse. “We know that the controlling behaviours used by perpetrators to maintain power and control over victims can be both devious and devastating. However, to those outside the relationship, the ways in which a perpetrator will conceal their actions can often make them appear innocuous in isolation. We have committed to this critical training to address these issues so our officers and staff can better recognise the signs of controlling behaviours in domestic abuse, support victims and bring perpetrators to justice.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/dec/29/police-not-equipped-to-enforce-new-domestic-abuse-laws","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-29T00:01:15Z","webTitle":"Police 'not equipped' to enforce new domestic abuse laws","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/dec/29/police-not-equipped-to-enforce-new-domestic-abuse-laws","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/dec/29/police-not-equipped-to-enforce-new-domestic-abuse-laws","fields":{"headline":"Police 'not equipped' to enforce new domestic abuse laws","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Two years after new domestic abuse laws made “coercive or controlling behaviour” criminal offences for the first time police forces remain poorly trained and ill-equipped to deal with the new crimes, MPs and campaigners say. Latest official figures show that only eight out of 43 police forces across England and Wales have rolled out a new national training programme and this lack of training is reflected in the low number of prosecutions involving the new offences. A recent freedom of information request by the Bureau for Investigative Journalism revealed that just 532 charges have been brought under the new laws in the 29 police force areas that responded to the request. Six police forces have brought five charges or fewer since the new offences were brought into force on 29 December 2015. The Office for National Statistics says police forces recorded only 4,246 cases of coercive or controlling behaviour in the 12 months to March 2017. This is against a backdrop in which it is officially estimated that 1.2 million women and 713,000 men have suffered some form of domestic violence in the past year. A recent University of Gloucestershire report found that controlling behaviour was an element in 92% of 358 domestic murders they had studied. Elfyn Llwyd, the Plaid Cymru MP, whose 10-minute rule bill in February 2014 first proposed the new offence, said he was frustrated that there had been such a poor take-up of training by police forces across the country, which had been reflected in the low number of prosecutions. The official definition of “coercive and controlling behaviour” is an act or a pattern of acts of assault, threats, humiliation and intimidation or other abuse that is used by an individual to harm, punish, or frighten their victim. Controlling behaviour is officially defined as a range of acts designed to make a person subordinate and/or dependent by isolating them from sources of support, exploiting their resources and capacities for personal gain, depriving them of the means needed for independence, resistance and escape and regulating their everyday behaviour. Examples can include preventing victims from seeing friends, stopping them from having hobbies, controlling their finances or where they are allowed to go. Llywd’s private member’s bill led to the government bringing forward its own legislation which was due to be enacted in March 2015. However, concerns raised by Plaid Cymru about the need for police training before the new offence came into effect led to its delay and it finally reached the statute book on 29 December 2015 – exactly two years ago. Llwyd said: “It was important that coercive and controlling behaviour were made criminal offences and I am proud to have secured that step forward but that it has been so poorly followed up by the Westminster government is very frustrating, particularly given the warnings Plaid Cymru made at the time that the police needed to be trained. “The poor take-up of training amongst the Welsh and English police forces is reflected in the low number of prosecutions. The Westminster government must now ensure that training is made mandatory and funded centrally.” The Home Office minister Nick Hurd told MPs in a Commons written answer earlier this month that the new College of Policing training programme, Domestic Abuse Matters, which focuses on improved evidence gathering and understanding of controlling and coercive behaviour had been rolled out in eight police forces so far and plans were in place to roll it out in a further two. “In addition, the college national curriculum relating to domestic abuse and coercive control is embedded in full into national recruit training, and the college has published authorised professional practice on investigating domestic violence and abuse capturing controlling or coercive behaviour,” the minister added. But Llwyd and Plaid Cyrmu’s home affairs spokesperson, Liz Saville Roberts, said the Home Office needed to fund a centrally procured training programme for the police to ensure there were adequately informed on the new law. Harry Fletcher, director of the Victims’ Rights campaign, who was involved in drafting the new law, said: “It was essential that ministers recognised that psychological abuse in a domestic setting was made an offence. But training was critical, indeed we asked for a six-month delay so that it could be delivered to the police. The latest figures for prosecutions started is extremely worrying and is no doubt related to the training failures. There needs to be a cultural shift amongst police mangers and first responders. We would urge that government invest in such training without delay,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/dec/28/snp-invites-opposition-leaders-cross-party-summit-fight-hard-brexit","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-28T10:16:13Z","webTitle":"SNP invites opposition leaders to summit to fight hard Brexit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/dec/28/snp-invites-opposition-leaders-cross-party-summit-fight-hard-brexit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/dec/28/snp-invites-opposition-leaders-cross-party-summit-fight-hard-brexit","fields":{"headline":"SNP invites opposition leaders to summit to fight hard Brexit","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The leader of the Scottish National party at Westminster, Ian Blackford, has invited opposition leaders from across the Commons to a new year summit in order to coordinate cross-party efforts to limit the “catastrophic damage” of a hard Brexit. In a letter sent on Thursday to the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, Vince Cable of the Liberal Democrats, the Green party’s Caroline Lucas, and Liz Saville Roberts of Plaid Cymru, Blackford urges his fellow opposition parties to unite in the Commons as the UK government enters the second phase of UK-EU Brexit negotiations with the focus turning to trade. The letter calls on them to “work with [the SNP] to keep the UK in the single market and stop a catastrophic Tory Brexit which threatens jobs, the economy and the Good Friday agreement”. The SNP believes that, with the Liberal Democrats, the Green party and Plaid Cymru already committed to remaining in the single market and customs union, a parliamentary majority to protect the UK’s membership could be secured with support from Labour and soft Brexit Conservatives. Recent polling found Labour supporters were confused about the party’s stance on Brexit and that more than half would oppose Labour backing Brexit. Blackford plans to host the Commons meeting on Monday 8 January, the first day after the Christmas recess. He said: “As we move into the crucial second phase of the Brexit negotiations, it is now absolutely vital that we have an effective cross-party effort to safeguard our membership of the single market and customs union. “It is time for MPs of all parties to put politics aside and work together, in the national interest, to protect our place in the single market and customs union. Short of retaining our EU membership, that is by far the least damaging option, the best compromise, and the only way to protect jobs, incomes, and workers’ rights. He added: “As we saw with the successful amendments to the EU withdrawal bill, when opposition parties work together effectively it is possible to secure a parliamentary majority and deliver change in the national interest.” Blackford made a similar overture to Corbyn in early December, after the conclusion of stage one talks when DUP intervention nearly scuppered the process. In the same week, the SNP leader and Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, called for the Labour leader to “get his act together” and join the SNP in fighting for a Brexit compromise. These interventions reflect a growing confidence among the SNP leadership that they can rebuild support for the Scottish government’s stance on Brexit, after linking it directly to a second independence referendum proved so damaging in June’s general election. The SNP assumes that any special terms for Northern Ireland will fuel public anger that the Tories have no mandate to enforce a harder line for Scotland, given the country’s majority support for the remain campaign and continued consensus that preserving the closest possible economic ties with Europe is the most desirable outcome."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/dec/28/football-transfer-rumour-mill-yannick-carrasco-alex-sandro-transfer-january","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-28T09:26:09Z","webTitle":"Football transfer rumours: Yannick Carrasco and Alex Sandro up for grabs?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/dec/28/football-transfer-rumour-mill-yannick-carrasco-alex-sandro-transfer-january","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/dec/28/football-transfer-rumour-mill-yannick-carrasco-alex-sandro-transfer-january","fields":{"headline":"Football transfer rumours: Yannick Carrasco and Alex Sandro up for grabs?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"And lo, it came to pass that before the last lazy layabout had cleared away the snapped crackers and swept up the torn party hats the Mill had been given the greatest Crimble gift imaginable – never again, or at least not for a long while, would we be forced to write the words Virgil van Di … no, we’re not doing it. You can’t make us. The funny thing about the whole business is that, according to the Liverpool Echo, Liverpool were so worried about Manchester City beating them to a deal for the Dutchman that they “flew a medical team to Bournemouth Airport so they were ready to complete the formalities as soon as a fee had been thrashed out”, only for it to turn out that City didn’t want him at all. That’s what Pep Guardiola said, when asked later that evening if he ever had any interest in signing the player: “Nope. No, no no.” Which is the opposite of what Atlético Madrid will say to anyone who wants to buy Yannick Carrasco in January, according to AS. “Despite Carrasco’s ability to bring a level of flair to the attack that is offered by few others, Simeone is said to be ready to admit defeat in his attempts to tame the 24-year-old,” they write, making Bayern Munich or “a number of potential Premier League suitors” his most likely destination. Luciano Vietto and Nicolás Gaitán are also up for grabs. Barcelona meanwhile still want to add creative options to their squad, and with Philippe Coutinho likely to be stuck at Liverpool at least until the summer have drawn up a shortlist of alternatives: according to Marca these are Nabil Fekir, Max Meyer, Leon Goretzka, Aleksandr Golovin and Arsenal’s very own (for now) Mesut Özil. There will also be outgoings, with Internazionale hoping to sign Gerard Deulofeu and Aleix Vidal on loan next month. Tuttosport say that Juventus are ready to sell Alex Sandro in one of the next two transfer windows, thus placing a number of Premier League clubs, probably the same ones who also might buy Carrasco, on high alert. Stefan Lichtsteiner, who turns 34 next month, and Kwadwo Asamoah, who turned 29 this month, are also available, and Juve are preparing to replenish their stock of full-backs after their departures, with Napoli’s Faouzi Ghoulam, Valencia’s José Gayá and Manchester United’s Matteo Darmian on the shortlist. Everton’s, um, Tosun one is the 26-year-old Besiktas striker Cenk Tosun, who has rattled in eight league goals in 16 games so far this season to get their scouting hearts aflutter. They also want a left-back and Steven Nzonzi. Meanwhile Aleksandar Mitrovic wants out of Newcastle, his dreams of Premier League goal-getting having turned to a reality of getting a place on the bench if he’s really lucky. “I loved Newcastle but it’s time for me to look after myself, to find the best solution for my career,” he said. “I do not have a special desire, nor can I stay in the Premier League. The chances are I leave the island. But there is no concrete offer.” Watford will not sell their coveted midfielder Abdoulaye Doucouré at any price in January, and instead will offer him the bumperest five-year contract in the entire history of all Watford, “worth up to £70,000 a week”, according to the Mirror. De Graafschap want Leicester’s 19-year-old prodigy Layton Ndukwu on loan for the remainder of the season. According to the Mail the winger “is viewed as one of the brightest prospects in the country”, so much so that at an age by which Michael Owen had already wowed the world at France 98, Wayne Rooney and Marcus Rashford had been key players at a European Championship and Theo Walcott had been mystifyingly selected for a World Cup squad he has “played four games in the Checkatrade Trophy”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/dec/28/hundreds-spend-night-at-stansted-airport-as-wintry-weather-hits-flights","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-28T09:30:11Z","webTitle":"Hundreds spend night at Stansted airport as snow and ice hit flights","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/dec/28/hundreds-spend-night-at-stansted-airport-as-wintry-weather-hits-flights","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/dec/28/hundreds-spend-night-at-stansted-airport-as-wintry-weather-hits-flights","fields":{"headline":"Hundreds spend night at Stansted airport as snow and ice hit flights","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Hundreds of people were forced to spend the night at Stansted airport as wintry conditions hit, causing dozens of flights to be cancelled or delayed. Snow and ice affected Ryanair and EasyJet flights to and from the airport, as well as more services at Liverpool and London Luton airports. Passengers at Stansted described waiting into the early hours of the morning for flights to be turned around or for their baggage to be returned to them. One man, Joe Allen, posted a video of the arrivals area at Stansted packed with people at around 4am on Thursday. He said: “[It is] a little busier than you might expect. Some flights have been delayed up to five hours. The one I am waiting for is currently over five hours delayed and is currently sitting on the tarmac with no staff able to offload it, even though it’s been due to arrive for five hours, which is obviously a little bit frustrating. “The tension is quite high. People are sleeping here. I guess they have been here for a while. Not very pleasant because of a few centimetres of snow.” Stansted said the runway was closed for snow clearance but had reopened on Thursday morning. The airport advised people to check their flight’s status before leaving home and not to travel if it was cancelled. It said it had handed out beds and blankets for people stuck at the airport, as well as giving out free food and drinks. One passenger said she had seen no sign of such help, however. Lucy Weyinmi said she had spent eight hours waiting to reclaim her baggage and had seen “no blankets or food or any support for passengers” during that time. She condemned the “shocking lack of comms or support from airport or Ryanair”. She said there was “no information whatsoever. The passengers weren’t told anything at all. There were hardly any staff around to answer questions or give advice.” A London Stansted spokeswoman said there were “up to 300 passengers in the terminal waiting to rebook flights” on Wednesday. She said additional help was also being given to elderly passengers and those with young children. There were 27 inbound and 27 outbound Ryanair flight cancellations, she added, though all flights were expected to operate as scheduled on Thursday. Met office forecasters warned of more wintry weather on Thursday and Friday mornings. They said northern and western Scotland, as well as almost all of southern England, were at risk of icy conditions on Thursday, while northern England was likely to see snow on Friday. Each of the areas was issued a yellow warning;, the least severe. The snow was expected to cause delays on roads and railways and further problems with air travel, while people in ice-affected areas were warned to take care on untreated roads and paths. EasyJet apologised as it confirmed it had had to cancel eight flights to and from Stansted airport and said another three had been diverted to nearby airports. A Ryanair spokesman also apologised and said: “Due to snow-related runway closures at several UK airports, including Liverpool, Luton and Stansted, we regret we were forced to cancel a small number of flights [on Wednesday]. All affected customers were contacted by email and SMS text message and advised of their rebooking options.” Further delays were expected on Thursday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jan/05/bloodlust-hysteria-sorcery-accusations-a-brutal-death-sentence-in-png","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-04T18:00:01Z","webTitle":"'Bloodlust hysteria': sorcery accusations a brutal death sentence in Papua New Guinea","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/05/bloodlust-hysteria-sorcery-accusations-a-brutal-death-sentence-in-png","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jan/05/bloodlust-hysteria-sorcery-accusations-a-brutal-death-sentence-in-png","fields":{"headline":"'Bloodlust hysteria': sorcery accusations a brutal death sentence in Papua New Guinea","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"In 2008 a man died of malaria in Togoba, in Papua New Guinea’s highlands region. Doctors had treated him for malaria and the report on his death specified malaria as the cause. Neighbours who went to the hospital were told it was malaria that killed him. But the residents of Togoba didn’t believe in malaria. He was killed by sorcerers, they said, specifically a woman called Thresia Hari and her mother-in-law, who must have killed him with their “powers”. Thresia was from Chimbu province, a region known for its sorcery, or sanguma. To be certain, the villagers captured the two women and tortured them until they confessed, then set them alight in a horrific dispensation of summary justice. Sitting in a quiet Togoba garden, amid the lush mountain rainforest, it is harrowing to hear Thresia’s widower, Hari Puri, describe the ordeal. “When they interrogated them it was really brutal,” he says through a translator. “Both of them said they didn’t do anything. Then [the villagers] started getting knives, bashed them up, started to cut their arms and legs. “They got the hot rods from the fire and put them on their skin. It was a hell of a thing they went through. It was really a terrible event.” Puri says the two women lost consciousness. “Both of them were locked inside the house – a traditional hut house – and they closed the door and burned the house.” Puri tried to help his wife and mother when he heard what his neighbours were doing, but he was stopped from rescuing them. “I couldn’t do anything, I was helpless. Because the majority of the community people were on the side of the person who died and they were thinking these two were behind the man’s death.” Until recently, many remote places in PNG had little to no contact with the outside world. Now they have camera phones. The speed at which the highlands have modernised has swept away some old practices, but traditional beliefs in sorcery remain. The area around Mount Hagen does not have a reputation for sorcery among those who believe in it, but it has hosted some of the most gruesome murders. Puri’s wife and mother were far from the first to die, nor the last. Just a few days after the Guardian sat with Puri, PNG seemed to finally find a case brutal enough to shock the country. In Sirunki, Enga province, a six-year-old girl was accused of sanguma and tortured with hot knives. She survived after Lutheran missionary and highlands resident Anton Lutz convinced the community to release her and her guardian. She was taken to hospital and treated for her injuries. Pictures of her tiny burned body shamed the populace. Politicians stepped up and condemned the attack. Newspapers wrote strident editorials. Enough was finally enough. The prime minister, Peter O’Neill, labelled the alleged torturers “cowards who are looking for someone to blame because of their own failure in life”. “Let’s be clear, sanguma beliefs are absolute rubbish,” he said. O’Neill invoked God, his nation’s reputation, and the rule of law in vowing action. “In the modern day sanguma is not a real cultural practice, it is false belief and involves the violent abuse and torture of women and girls by pathetic and perverted individuals.” The last time PNG had been this upset about a sorcery-accusation was in 2013, when the young girl’s mother, Kepari Leniata, was burned alive on a stack of tyres. “Because of the mother, they believed the child was a probable suspect for anything that happened in the village,” Lutz says. “So when there were repeated illnesses in the village, and even a death, it was blamed on the child.” The mother’s death prompted a long overdue change in PNG law – until that year suspecting someone of sorcery was a legitimate legal defence for murder. But since then little has changed. In fact the frequency of attacks appears to be increasing. PNG is one of the most dangerous countries in the world for women and girls, but a recent study by Oxfam and the Queensland University of Technology suggested sorcery violence also targeted many men. The report looked at 232 incidents over three years, and found about 56% of victims were women. More than a third said they had some kind of disability. The study found 89% of perpetrators were men. There are many theories about why the phenomenon is growing – PNG’s dysfunctional education system, the spread of beliefs through intermarriage between people from different regions or the fact that perpetrators know they will have broad public support. “[The villagers] were very concerned the girl or her guardian would tell the police who had done the torture and the police would show up and arrest people,” says Lutz. “There was a feeling in the village ... that boys who did this horrific torture were naughty, but certainly not guilty of a major crime for which they should be imprisoned or even killed.” The PNG Tribal Foundation, which assisted in the young girl’s rescue, says she is recovering well, and will be supported in a place far from the village where the crime took place. Only one man has been arrested and charged over any of the dozens of recent incidents. The director of the foundation, Ruth Kissam, has called for justice. “Nothing will change as long as those who perpetrate accusation-based violence continue to be allowed to carry out their barbaric acts with impunity,” she says. Enga’s acting police provincial police commander, Epenes Nili, has stood up publicly against sorcery-related violence. Because of his work he was appointed to jointly head a national taskforce, which – like many well-intentioned PNG bodies – has received little to no funding. Since the attack on the young girl the government has launched another task force. From a small and rundown office, Nili says his force does not have the resources to respond. He has repeatedly requested funding for an investigations desk devoted to sorcery and a dedicated vehicle. In previous interviews with the Guardian, Nili has said his officers often don’t have petrol to pursue investigations. The PNG economy is in trouble and flagged budget cuts are reportedly not sparing the police force, although perhaps in response to the growing outrage the PNG government allocated about $4m in its recent budget for awareness campaigns. Despite this, the lack of resources for police and health providers means emergency situations are frequently left to a grassroots network of first responders such as Lutz and Kissam. Just hours after the interview with Nili, he and Lutz rescued three women about an hour’s drive from Mount Hagen. For their own protection, the victims were kept in police station cells for three days because there were virtually no support services for them. They have more shocking tales of violence than one would care to hear. Lutz recounts one, describing it as “bloodlust hysteria”. He shakes his head recalling the callous and casual confession of a man who “chopped up” his own wife. Some stories stay with him more than others. In September Lutz heard of two women, Yakol Anton and Shirley Kangup, who were kidnapped and detained by villagers in Wapanamanda. Anton had been with a third woman and the woman’s child in Pompobus, Enga province, but shortly after they separated the child died. Villagers assumed Anton had caused the child’s death so they grabbed her and began torturing her. At that moment Kangup was travelling home by bus from Wabag but was dropped off at the wrong stop. “She had her market shopping over her shoulder, and she started walking down the road,” Lutz says. “As she walked into the area where this woman was being tortured, they grabbed her and questioned her and said: ‘Why are you here?’. She was a grade 12 student with some kind of a speech impediment, so she was hesitating with her answers in a way they took to be suspicious. So they began torturing her too.” Under torture the two women confessed to anything they were asked, Lutz says. Lutz received word about the attacks late at night and tried to raise the police. The following morning – more than 24 hours after the torture began – a team of officers arrived, but it was too late for Anton. Kangup was still alive – barely. She was taken to hospital, but then people yelled through the windows and she received no treatment. Lutz sourced a vehicle and moved her himself that evening. Kangup was still alive when she got medical help, but died almost a week later. “Her mother, Miriam, had come with her, and she was still carrying the bag of shopping with some greens and a bit of rice and some tin fish. Like it was her evidence that ‘my daughter is innocent, she was coming home with her shopping, and now she’s dead, tortured’. “She was carrying this bag around like a totem or something.” There have been no arrests that Lutz is aware of. While terrible crimes are still committed, local organisations and increased media support are having an impact, says Oxfam PNG’s programs director, Charlotte Kakebeeke. NGOs such as Oxfam and the Red Cross work with victims and communities. The Red Cross focuses on inter-tribal violence, but in the PNG highlands this often involves – or is sparked by – sorcery accusations. “People not from PNG find it mind-boggling,” says one man. The Guardian asked to talk to someone involved in an accusation. “Who? Like my uncle, or brothers, or father?” one man responds. “We’ve all seen our relatives accuse other people of sorcery.” Highlanders see the violent consequences from accusations of sorcery, but they also say they have also seen “evidence” of sorcery itself. These contradictions mean those who work to stop the violence work in a strange space that still legitimises sanguma belief. Many who rescue the victims and who seek to educate communities are Christians. How does someone of one faith tell others their belief is simply superstition? Is that even the most effective way to address it? “There is a lot of conversation happening and there are two main strands of it,” Lutz says. “One is that people are horrified that this is happening in their country, and saying the people who are doing this are barbarians and cavemen, and they are quite derogatory in their comments. That’s both within Papua New Guinea as well as overseas. “But there is also a strand of people saying: this is a spiritual problem and we can’t deny the reality of witchcraft and sorcery, and you as a Christian should know better, Anton, and you should shut up if you don’t believe in it. “I’m not sure if the two sides are able to communicate with each other. I think they are talking past each other.” Back in Togoba, Puri has no answers. Since the murder of his wife and mother, time has passed without consequence or justice. Puri still lives in the community where they were killed, with three of his four children. The oldest child, the only one who was likely to remember their mother, died at the age of 15. He holds some fear the others could one day be accused on the basis of bloodlines, as Leniata’s daughter was. Puri has no belief in sanguma, putting his faith in the Christian God and his own ability to raise his children. “People die from other stuff and then people place blame,” he says. “I’ve been through it, I don’t believe in it. It’s zero. It’s just a word.” • The Guardian travelled to PNG with the assistance of the International Committee of the Red Cross."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/27/barbuda-fears-possible-loss-of-land-rights-is-bid-to-spread-tourism-from-antigua","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-27T09:00:13Z","webTitle":"Barbuda fears land rights loss in bid to spread tourism from Antigua","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/27/barbuda-fears-possible-loss-of-land-rights-is-bid-to-spread-tourism-from-antigua","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/27/barbuda-fears-possible-loss-of-land-rights-is-bid-to-spread-tourism-from-antigua","fields":{"headline":"Barbuda fears land rights loss in bid to spread tourism from Antigua","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Nearly four months after Hurricane Irma devastated the tiny Caribbean island of Barbuda, residents fear the central government on neighbouring Antigua is poised to revoke a centuries-old system of communal land rights in what activists have described as “disaster capitalism” at work. Since emancipation from slavery in 1834, Barbudans have governed their land in common, without private ownership. But the Antigua and Barbuda government says that change is necessary to rebuild the island. The prime minister, Gaston Browne, has pushed for the change since the Category 5 storm hit in September, arguing that freehold tenure is the only way to finance Barbuda’s reconstruction, where half of the island’s 1,250 structures are severely damaged or destroyed. He is likely to get his way on 28 December, when parliament is expected to amend legislation that codified the 200-year-old tradition of communal ownership. Browne has dismissed the law as “illegal” and a “myth”. Under the existing law, all land on Barbuda is owned communally and land parcels cannot be bought and sold. Residents and their descendants can identify parcels for new agricultural, residential, or commercial development and confirm their claim with the democratically elected, 11-member Barbuda council. Browne’s proposed amendment would eliminate that system and establish private, freehold land ownership. “Antigua and Barbuda is a unitary state,” Browne told the Guardian in November . “You will never see anything in the constitution of Antigua and Barbuda speaking to any ownership of any land in common. It does not exist in the constitution so you cannot pass a law that supersedes the constitution. But Barbudan activists view the change as an effort to develop their island for mass tourism as in neighboring Antigua. Barbuda’s 1,600 people live in a single settlement, Codrington, while the rest of the 63-square-mile island has largely been left to its natural state of mangroves and scrub brush. In constrast, tourism dominates 109-square-mile Antigua (population 80,000), from all-inclusive resorts to a downtown cruise port. In an interview, Browne dismissed such concerns as the work of “a handful of deracinated imbeciles [who] are creating this problem”. Three years ago, actor Robert de Niro and Australian billionaire James Packer signed a $6.45m lease with the government for a 391-acre mega-resort on Barbuda. Most Barbudans are sheltering on Antigua following a mandatory evacuation when Hurricane Jose passed near the island in September. About 350 people have returned, but they continue to live off humanitarian aid without reliable access to power and running water. Only one shop is open, and the local primary school is in ruins. Browne announced his proposals to end the existing system just one week after the storm, but held no formal consultations with Barbudans. Since the November interview, his office has not responded to further questions. “The matter affects Barbudans deeply,” said secondary school principal John Mussington. “Land is the seat of resources and it is the resources which people use to make their daily livelihoods.” Many Barbudans supplement their incomes by hunting and fishing. Human rights lawyer Leslie Thomas filed an emergency injunction against the new law, but judgment has been reserved until at least January. If the amendment passes as expected, legal challenges are likely to follow, with the ultimate court of appeals the Privy Council. Meanwhile, foreign governments who have pledged millions towards recovery are unwilling to get involved. DfID, which pledged £3m ($4m), referred the question to the Caribbean Development Bank, which will implement a $29m recovery project. “We will continue to monitor developments with regard to the issue of freehold title, in the context of the entire recovery effort,” a bank spokesman said. Canada, which pledged $78m to the Caribbean, also referred to the land issue as an “internal matter”. The European Union, which pledged €300m ($360m) to the region, declined to comment. “Western governments are proving slow to grasp that land rights are a basic human right in land-dependent economies that communities will rightly fight to the death for,” independent land tenure expert Liz Alden Wily told the Guardian. “Any donor which idly lets its donation for disaster relief be used to dispossess vulnerable populations is party to a violation of human rights and will in due course be held to account for this.” Travel for this story was supported by the Pulitzer Center for Crisis Reporting."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/25/consider-all-sides-in-the-catalonia-dispute","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-25T11:57:19Z","webTitle":"Consider all sides in the Catalonia dispute | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/25/consider-all-sides-in-the-catalonia-dispute","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/25/consider-all-sides-in-the-catalonia-dispute","fields":{"headline":"Consider all sides in the Catalonia dispute","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Can we all please stop referring to the two sides in the dispute over how Catalonia is governed. It’s not Barcelona v Madrid. There are at least four sides to this. The separatists may seem to be pitted against Spanish prime minister Mariano Rajoy, but that is a reduction of the truth that former Catalan president Carles Puigdemont and his allies want the world to believe in. Most Catalans who voted against independence-seeking parties are not to be conflated with the Madrid government: they deserve to be treated as a “side” in the dispute. And there is a fourth side: the Spanish people who do not support the Rajoy government, except in his resolve to uphold the democratic, federal, legal constitution. The only way out of the impasse is for the interests of the two “invisible” sides to be heard, but that spoils a good story. Oversimplification always plays into the hands of extremists and populists. Nick Inman Larreule, France • Alex Orr (Letters 23, December) should stop seeing the world through his Scottish separatism. In the Catalonia elections those favouring union with Spain won a small but significant majority of the votes, as did those Scots voting for the union in the Scottish independence referendum. Only the defects of the Catalan electoral system allowed pro-separatist parties to gain a small majority of the seats. A result for further political conflict, but hardly an argument for independence, and certainly an argument for a reformed Spanish constitution on more federal lines.

The 4-0 victory against Bournemouth on Saturday extended City’s record of consecutive Premier League wins to 17. They travel to Newcastle United for a 7.45pm kick-off on Boxing Day before heading to London for a midday fixture at Crystal Palace on New Year’s Eve. A schedule of four matches in 11 days is completed with Watford’s visit to the Etihad Stadium on 2 January. Yet Guardiola has no concerns about tiredness. “Fatigue, I don’t think so,” he said. “It may happen but we’ve a good enough squad. Gabriel [Jesus] didn’t play against Bournemouth – he played 120 minutes against Leicester and he’s the biggest fighter in high pressing I’ve seen in my life. He helps us a lot with our intensity. “Danilo, Bernardo [Silva], [Ilkay] Gündogan all helped us against Bournemouth [as replacements]. We have Yaya [Touré]. Last game, [Oleksandr] Zinchenko was man of the match and he was not in the squad against Bournemouth. “Of course we will rotate in this period. We have a game every four days. Everyone that has played in the past is going to play in the future.” Two goals from Sergio Agüero – to take his tally at the Etihad Stadium to 101 – plus strikes from Raheem Sterling and Danilo took City to 55 points at the season’s halfway stage. Manchester United could only draw at Leicester City so City’s lead at the top of the table now stands at 13 points. Asked how he can maintain intensity, Guardiola said: “Focus on Newcastle – do what we have done until now. That is what we have to do. I want to tell them what Newcastle is. “[Newcastle] won against West Ham [on Saturday] when West Ham were in a good moment in terms of results. They have to focus on Newcastle, focus on what they have to do on the pitch. Offensively, defensively, individually, like a group. That is the only way to be focused in what we have to do. Forget about the table, the schedule, and focus on what we have to do, that is the best way. “We ran a lot last season as well. As a manager, I’m good with that – I am able to make them run at a high intensity. That is a quality of the players I had in Barcelona and Bayern and now here. “We are able as staff and a team to convince them how good it is going forward, be aggressive without the ball. Because after that we are quick and we take decisions with the ball. “There is no reason to say that if we are able to do that in two years, why we cannot do it in the future. To that, I have no doubts.” If City win their remaining three matches over the holiday period the run would extend to 20 wins – one more than Guardiola recorded when in charge of Bayern; his best at Barcelona was 16. He said: “Our lives are better when we win, it’s simple like that. But I’m not going to sleep thinking about if I am going to break a record from my time at Bayern Munich. It’s nothing special. It’s about Newcastle. I could not see them over the last few days of this Christmas time. “So now I’ll sit down with my staff with our laptops, try to discover what they do and keep our pace and intensity with and without the ball.” Kevin De Bruyne started against Bournemouth having been ill in the days beforehand and he is not thought to be a doubt for the Newcastle match."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"education/2017/dec/26/jo-johnson-universities-no-platforming-freedom-of-speech","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-26T00:01:33Z","webTitle":"Jo Johnson to tell universities to stop 'no-platforming' speakers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/dec/26/jo-johnson-universities-no-platforming-freedom-of-speech","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2017/dec/26/jo-johnson-universities-no-platforming-freedom-of-speech","fields":{"headline":"Jo Johnson to tell universities to stop 'no-platforming' speakers","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Universities could face fines for failing to uphold free speech if their student unions do not give a platform to speakers such as Germaine Greer and Peter Tatchell, the higher education minister has said. Jo Johnson said some student campaigners were trying to stifle debate as he confirmed plans to allow the newly created Office for Students (OfS) to fine or suspend institutions that fail to protect freedom of speech on campuses. The government’s Boxing Day announcement does not name universities or student campaigners that have suppressed free speech and follows a similar one in October. But speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Johnson suggested fines could be one of the punishments used to deal with “no platforming” of campaigners with controversial views. Asked about cases where students had tried to deny speaking slots to Tatchell, a gay rights campaigner, and Greer, a feminist writer, over their views on transgender issues, he said: “The Office for Students will have a range of remedies at its disposal which do include fines at the more extreme end of the spectrum. I think it is important that we look at the cases mentioned. “These are speakers who have been potentially banned or harried under no-platforming or safe spaces decisions. On all reasonable definitions, they are advocates of openness and liberal values and should be welcomed on our campuses.” He claimed that at some universities students had insisted on extensive lists of “trigger words” that should not be used and had demanded the removal of books from their libraries. Critics will say the announcement does not help universities define when individuals are actively engaged in hate speech and when they are merely expressing their opinion. However, Johnson said the law on hate speech was clearly set out by parliament and argued that students who felt uncomfortable with views that did not come within that definition had to become “resilient and learn to deal with controversial opinions”. Student unions and campaigners have banned – or attempted to ban – a number of high-profile people from speaking at universities because of their controversial opinions. Rachael Melhuish, the women’s officer at Cardiff University, called for Greer to be no-platformed for what she believed to be transphobic views. Greer eventually spoke at the university under tight security. Johnson will speak about no-platform policies at the Limmud festival in Birmingham, which is a series of events celebrating Jewish culture. He will say: “Universities should be places that open minds not close them, where ideas can be freely challenged. In universities in America and worryingly in the UK, we have seen examples of groups seeking to stifle those who do not agree with them. “We must not allow this to happen. Young people should have the resilience and confidence to challenge controversial opinions and take part in open, frank and rigorous discussions. That is why the new regulator, the Office for Students, will go even further to ensure that universities promote freedom of speech within the law.” As a condition of registration to the OfS, the Department for Education is proposing that publicly funded universities must show that their governance is consistent with the principles of free speech. The department does not at this stage outline how they would measure the governance or how they should comply with free speech. The OfS is expected to be given regulatory powers to issue formal sanctions against universities, such as fines or deregistration. Nick Lowles, director of Hope Not Hate, and Johnson’s brother Boris, the foreign secretary, have faced being barred from speaking. The feminist activist, journalist and writer Julie Bindel has been no-platformed by the National Union of Students (NUS) for several years for her views. Johnson will also signal backing for universities that continue to ban far-right groups that advocate forms of discrimination such as racism and antisemitism. “A racist or antisemitic environment is by definition an illiberal one that is completely in opposition to the liberal tradition of our universities,” he will say. Earlier in the year the government extended the statutory duty to secure free speech so that it will apply to all providers of higher education registered with the OfS. The NUS’s no-platform policy was launched in 1974 and bans six organisations from speaking at its events. They are al-Muhajiroun, the British National party, the English Defence League, Hizb ut-Tahrir, the Muslim Public Affairs Committee and National Action. However, many student unions have their own no-platform policies A survey last year found that most university students (63%) are in favour of the NUS having a no-platforming policy. Analysis by Spiked magazine, supported by the Joseph Rowntree Reform Trust, found that more than nine in 10 UK universities were restrictive of free speech. Universities and other higher education providers are required by the Education (No 2) Act 1986 to take reasonable steps to secure freedom of speech within the law for staff, students and visiting speakers."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/dec/24/brexit-campaign-tax-demands-boris-johnson-michael-gove","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-24T14:10:54Z","webTitle":"UK cabinet ministers 'concerned over Brexit campaign tax demands'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/dec/24/brexit-campaign-tax-demands-boris-johnson-michael-gove","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/dec/24/brexit-campaign-tax-demands-boris-johnson-michael-gove","fields":{"headline":"UK cabinet ministers 'concerned over Brexit campaign tax demands'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Senior UK cabinet ministers have reportedly expressed concerns after prominent leave campaigners who donated large sums to the Brexit campaigns during the 2016 referendum recently received tax demands from HMRC. The demands from HMRC hinge on inheritance tax rules that require tax to be paid upfront on large gifts. Party political donations, as well as donations to charities, are usually exempt, but HMRC has said that does not apply to individuals who donated to the referendum campaign. Eurosceptics have argued they will bear more of a tax burden for donations to the leave campaign than remain supporters, because the large donations were more likely to come from wealthy individuals or businessmen, not listed companies. HMRC dismissed the suggestion that the tax demands were evidence of bias, saying it applied the law equally across all donors. Others derided the complaints as pleas for “bungs” for wealthy donors. Those reported by the Telegraph to have received payment demands in the last fortnight include the banker and former Conservative party co-chair Peter Cruddas, worth a reported £750m, who gave £900,000 to Vote Leave. The former Ukip donor Arron Banks, who donated £8.1m to his Leave.EU campaign group, told the Telegraph the £2m bill he had received in the past month was the “revenge of the establishment”. Another who has received a payment demand is Robert Edmiston, a millionaire motor trader worth a reported £440m, who donated £850,000 to Vote Leave and £150,000 to the Grassroots Out campaign through his company IM Group. Lord Edmiston told the Times he had been sent a bill from HMRC for £200,000. It is understood one remain campaign donor has also received a similar substantial tax bill. The Sunday Telegraph reported concerns from both Boris Johnson and Michael Gove about the payment demands, quoting a friend of the environment secretary as saying: “Michael is obviously concerned about action that appears to impinge on our democratic values. This will appear to many like an attempt to silence anyone who dare challenge the establishment and status quo.” A HMRC spokesman said: “Donations to campaign groups don’t qualify as exempt gifts to political parties, unless the recipient is a political party meeting the criteria set out in section 24 of the Inheritance Tax Act 1984. “No special exemption was granted ahead of the 2016 referendum. Obviously, the legislation is applied equally to all organisations and groups.” The Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg told the Telegraph it showed the government was “penalising people who had the audacity to challenge it”. Other MPs said it was clear the tax should be paid if it was owed. The prominent Conservative MP Nicholas Soames said: “Surely it should be quite clear on so-called ‘Brexit tax’ demands – if the tax is owed under statute then it should be paid.” Jolyon Maugham QC, a tax expert and pro-remain campaigner who has set up the Good Law Project to challenge both tax evasion and Brexit matters, wrote in an article for his blog on Sunday that HMRC was “doing no more than acting as parliament and the law compel it to”. He wrote: “Rees-Mogg, Johnson and Gove are suggesting that the law should be disapplied to give these immensely wealthy men huge bungs. That’s what the leaders of Brexit are saying. That you should fund unlawful bungs of money to immensely wealthy Brexiters. That’s how much they care about normal working people.” Separately, it was revealed on Sunday that the former Ukip leader Nigel Farage has told newspapers he will not receive an award in this year’s New Year honours list. The lack of a peerage or knighthood has been a sore point for the MEP for several years. He has previously claimed a feud with the former Ukip MP Douglas Carswell blocked him from receiving one. Farage, now a talk radio host, told the Telegraph: “Of course I have not got an honour of any kind – I am not a remainer. Every one of them got CBEs, they got knighthoods, quite extraordinary. I have got a Brexmas present far more important than the honour. A campaign to get back British blue passports has been successful.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2017/dec/25/lorde-cancels-israel-concert-after-pro-palestinian-campaign","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-25T09:34:00Z","webTitle":"Lorde cancels Israel concert after pro-Palestinian campaign","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/dec/25/lorde-cancels-israel-concert-after-pro-palestinian-campaign","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/dec/25/lorde-cancels-israel-concert-after-pro-palestinian-campaign","fields":{"headline":"Lorde cancels Israel concert after pro-Palestinian campaign","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The New Zealand singer-songwriter Lorde has cancelled a planned concert in Israel following an online campaign by activists opposed to the Israeli occupation of Palestine. The announcement of the cancellation of the June concert, barely a week after it was announced, came as the singer cited an “overwhelming number of messages and letters” she had received as having led to her decision. Israel’s culture minister, Miri Regev, called on Lorde to reconsider and she was denounced by pro-Israel supporters on social media. She follows a number of other artists who have cancelled performances in Israel including Elvis Costello, Lauryn Hill and Gorillaz. Radiohead resisted high-profile campaign asking them to cancel a gig in Israel last summer. Lorde, 21, whose most recent album Melodrama was released this year, had engaged with critics on social media following her announcement of the tour date, announcing on Twitter that she had been taking advice on the complexities of the political situation and was “considering all options”. Among those who had contacted her were fellow New Zealanders Nadia Abu-Shanab and Justine Sachs who wrote an open letter to the singer online asking her to cancel her Israel concert. “Dear Lorde ... we’re two young women based in Aotearoa, one Jewish, one Palestinian,” the women wrote. “Today, millions of people stand opposed to the Israeli government’s policies of oppression, ethnic cleansing, human rights violations, occupation and apartheid. As part of this struggle, we believe that an economic, intellectual and artistic boycott is an effective way of speaking out against these crimes. This worked very effectively against apartheid in South Africa, and we hope it can work again.” “We can play an important role in challenging injustice today. We urge you to act in the spirit of progressive New Zealanders who came before you and continue their legacy.” In reply Lorde had said she was considering cancelling. “Been speaking w many people about this and considering all options. Thank u for educating me i am learning all the time too,” she wrote. On Sunday she announced she had decided not to go ahead with the concert. In a statement, released by the Israeli public relations firm that had been handling the planned June performance in Tel Aviv, the singer said she had not “made the right call” in initially deciding to play in Israel. “I have had a lot of discussions with people holding many views, and I think the right decision at this time is to cancel the show,” Lorde wrote, adding: “I’m not too proud to admit I didn’t make the right call on this one.” Eran Arielli of Naranjah, one of the promoters who said fans would be reimbursed, wrote on Facebook following the cancellation that he was “naive to think that an artist of her age would be able to face the pressure of appearing in Israel”. News of Lorde’s cancellation quickly prompted the intervention of Regev, Israel’s controversial rightwing culture minister. “Lorde, I’m hoping you can be a ‘pure heroine’ like the title of your first album,” Regev said in a statement. “To be a heroine of pure culture, free from any foreign – and ridiculous – political considerations.” In the aftermath of her decision the singer garnered both praise and criticism on social media with the pro-Israel lobby organisation StandWithUs accusing Lorde of punishing Israel. She was also condemned as a “bigot” by the actor Roseanne Barr. Others praised her decision and the calm way she engaged with the issue."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/25/perus-jailed-ex-president-alberto-fujimori-pardoned-sparking-protests","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-25T02:19:02Z","webTitle":"Peru's jailed ex-president Alberto Fujimori pardoned, sparking protests","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/25/perus-jailed-ex-president-alberto-fujimori-pardoned-sparking-protests","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/25/perus-jailed-ex-president-alberto-fujimori-pardoned-sparking-protests","fields":{"headline":"Peru's jailed ex-president Alberto Fujimori pardoned, sparking protests","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Peru’s president Pedro Pablo Kuczynski has pardoned the jailed former autocrat Alberto Fujimori in a Christmas Eve announcement that has sparked protests across the country. The president, who last week survived a vote to force him out of office, said in a statement on Sunday night that he had “decided to concede a humanitarian pardon to Mr Alberto Fujimori”. “A medical panel has determined Mr Fujimori has a progressive, degenerative and incurable disease and the jail conditions present a grave risk to his life and health,” it read. The move comes a day after Fujimori, 79, who is serving a 25-year sentence for corruption and human rights crimes, was rushed to hospital on Saturday after suffering a severe drop in blood pressure and abnormal heart rhythm. His doctor said he could die. Alberto Fujimori, who governed Peru from 1990 to 2000, is the figurehead of the party which dominates Peru’s Congress and a deeply divisive figure in the country. He was jailed in 2009 for authorising death squads, overseeing rampant corruption and vote-rigging. The writing was on the wall when Kuczysnki was saved from impeachment late on Thursday night by Fujimori’s son Kenji, a congressman who led a rebel faction of the majority Fuerza Popular opposition party – led by his older sister Keiko – in voting against ousting him from office for lying about links to the Brazilian firm Odebrecht, which is at the centre of Latin America’s biggest corruption scandal. Kenji Fujimori thanked Kuczynski in a tweet for his “noble and magnanimous gesture” on behalf of the Fujimori family, adding “we are eternally grateful to you”. “It’s a night of joy and happiness,” said Keiko Fujimori, speaking outside the hospital where he father was being treated. “It’s been more than 10 years of waiting with my father without liberty. Finally justice has done.” Not so for Gisela Ortiz, the sister of one of the victims of a 1992 death squad massacre for which Fujimori was convicted, who said Kuczynski had robbed them of “tranquility and right to justice when handing out this undeserved pardon to Fujimori”. “We haven’t had Christmas for 25 years, just painful absences. Carry that with you today,” she tweeted. Pedro Cateriano, a former prime minister, called it an “act of treason to democracy and human rights”, adding “the pardon of the dictator is not a humanitarian act, it has been a infamous political pact”. The news provoked mixed reactions on the night when Peruvians celebrate Christmas. Angry protesters gathered in Lima’s Plaza San Martín, the place where marches traditionally begin, while TV images showed Fujimori’s supporters cheering the decision outside the hospital where he was rushed on Saturday night. Reacting to the news, Jo-Marie Burt, senior fellow with the Washington Office on Latin America, said Kuczynski, popularly known as PPK, had “bartered his political survival for the dictator’s freedom”. “PPK has long intimated that he would pardon Fujimori. But to do it in this way – after just barely surviving impeachment, on Christmas Eve – is an incredible show of disrespect to the victims of Fujimorismo,” she told the Guardian. “This is going to be explosive.” At least two lawmakers from PPK’s party have resigned in protest. Ministerial resignations are expected. The 79-year-old former strongman leader looms large over present-day Peru. The hard-right populist political movement he began in the 1990s continues under the leadership of his daughter Keiko Fujimori who commands an absolute majority in Peru’s legislature despite an apparent split with her younger brother Kenji. She has twice narrowly lost presidential elections in 2011 and 2016, the second time by the narrowest of margins to Kuczynski. Kuczynski’s decision is even more controversial because he owes his victory in 2016 to support from anti-Fujimori campaigners in the election runoff. Verónika Mendoza, a leftist candidate who came third in the race, called on her supporters to vote for PPK in order to stave off the possible return for the Fujimori dynasty. She did so while decrying the former Wall Street banker as a lobbyist but the lesser of two evils. But Kuczynski has been publicly mulling the idea for much of the year. The former World Bank official, who is the same age as Fujimori, insisted he cannot allow him to die in prison. “A reprieve is something humanitarian. It is not a pardon,” he has said. Peruvians remain bitterly divided over Fujimori’s legacy. His supporters credit him with laying the foundations of the country’s robust, investor-friendly economy after it was sunk by massive hyperinflation. His supporters say he pacified the country, defeating the brutal Maoist Shining Path movement. He remained popular even when he dissolved Congress in April 1992 and in spite of his government’s violent repression. But Peruvians eventually tired of the regime’s rampant corruption, and after a rigged election in 2000, Fujimori fled to Japan. In 2005 he visited Chile from where he was extradited in 2007 to face trial. According to late historian Alfonso Quiroz, the Fujimori regime was likely the most corrupt in Peruvian history, with $1.5bn to $4bn lost due to corruption. Transparency International ranked him number seven in a top 10 of the most corrupt leaders in the world, estimating he had stolen some $600m. Steven Levitsky, a political scientist at Harvard University, said the release of the former leader would stir up a power struggle between his youngest son and daughter Keiko. “Nobody outside of the Fujimori family knows this for sure. I don’t think Keiko wants her father out of prison. I think Kenji does. I think PPK has considered using the pardon to divide Fujimorismo and make a pact with Kenji,” he told the Guardian. “If Keiko has total control of the party, she is the next candidate and quite possibly the next president if things stay the way they are. With Alberto out of prison it’s a different game.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/dec/24/leicester-saracens-aviva-premiership-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-24T17:25:04Z","webTitle":"Jonny May red card angers Leicester and helps Saracens to stop the rot","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/dec/24/leicester-saracens-aviva-premiership-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/dec/24/leicester-saracens-aviva-premiership-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Jonny May red card angers Leicester and helps Saracens to stop the rot","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Jonny May’s red card for two deliberate knock-ons ultimately ensured this thrilling if error-riddled match ended in Saracens’ favour. The decisions over May’s transgressions – one in each half – appeared, to the letter of the law, the right ones but that did not stop the Leicester head coach, Matt O’Connor, calling for the relevant legislation to be revised. “I would dearly love for the law-makers to look at it because it is never a red card,” said O’Connor, whose side have lost five in a row and face a trip to Exeter on New Year’s Eve. “It is tough but that is the way they are refereeing it and the way it is going.” This was a chaotic if entertaining match, punctuated by repeated handling errors, an absorbing scrum tussle between Dan Cole and Mako Vunipola – won emphatically by the former – and the contrasting styles of George Ford and Owen Farrell, a battle edged by the latter. Leicester were left to lament May’s knock-ons – the second coming when they were nine points down with 13 minutes remaining and ending any hopes of victory – and too many mistakes with ball in hand, not to mention their horribly sluggish start, having fallen 17-0 behind after 26 minutes. “[There are] no question marks about the result,” O’Connor said. “You can’t give Sarries 17 points and expect to pull it back.” If this was a clash of two of England’s heavyweights, it was won by the team that could less afford to lose. Saracens are the two-times European champions and had lost seven on the spin – defeat here would have been their worst sequence in the professional era – but now they are up to second in the table. “Like I kept saying, we didn’t think there was that much wrong,” the Saracens director of rugby, Mark McCall, said. “I thought it was a confident display. We didn’t look like a team drained of confidence. I think we got what we deserved today.” Saracens’ early dominance was such that they were 10 points and a man up before they had even made a tackle. May was sent to the sin-bin by the referee, Matt Carley, for his first deliberate knock‑on with Sean Maitland denied in the right corner. Saracens ought to have stretched their lead but poor final passes form Alex Goode and Chris Wyles proved costly. May returned but Jamie George was next on the score sheet. Vunipola produced one of those pullback passes that are swiftly becoming a trademark, with Farrell the recipient. His quick hands freed George to thunder in under the posts. With Farrell also having added an earlier penalty, Saracens were 17-0 up and coasting. The Tigers stirred, however, and responded through Mathew Tait after Adam Thompstone’s dextrous inside pass. Ford nailed the tricky conversion and the Welford Road faithful roused themselves. There had not been a Christmas Eve fixture here since 1927 and until that point they were doubtless hoping for a similar wait for the next. Ben Youngs’s neat grubber on his own 22 had the crowd on their feet. It led to a breathless passage of play – Farrell attempting to ignite a counterattack on Saracens’ left before Ford followed suit. If England’s No9, 10 and 12 were sparkling, however, the man many wish to see back in the No13 jersey continues to show signs of rust. Manu Tuilagi’s first touch was a knock-on – it was not his last of those – and he was also penalised for crossing in the opening half. He was blowing as hard as anyone when the half-time whistle went – a Ford penalty bringing Leicester to within seven before Farrell put Saracens back into a 10-point lead shortly after the restart, extending it soon after with a sweetly struck drop-goal. Cue four Leicester scrums with Cole making mincemeat of Vunipola before Carley eventually awarded the penalty try. The Tigers were back to within six but again proved the masters of their own downfall, swiftly conceding a penalty which Farrell dispatched. Then came May’s second transgression, the harsher of the two considering how close he was to Michael Rhodes when the Saracens replacement made the pass. To twist the knife, Farrell was on target again with the resulting penalty, and although Vunipola was shown a yellow card late on Saracens had by that stage made sure the rot had been stopped.

The strongest of the known fundamental forces of nature is something of an enigma. It holds together the nucleus of every atom – easily overcoming the electromagnetic repulsion between the positively-charged protons in there. The simplest atomic nucleus, that of hydrogen, is a single proton, but even that is held in one piece by the strong force, so tightly that it never falls apart – or at least, it lives billions of times longer than the current age of the observable universe. Truly, strong and stable. We have a good theory of the strong force, which sits proudly in our Standard Model of particle physics. However, making predictions with this theory is very difficult. This is not simply to say that the sums are hard (they are), but that in many cases we don’t even know what sums we should be doing. BFKL proposed, or discovered, a new set of sums which could be done using the theory behind the strong force. These sums should have a big effect on a particular type of particle collision, when very small fractions of the particle’s momentum are involved. If the energy of the colliding particles is high enough, this type of collision dominates all the others. So anything that has a big effect on these collisions is an important feature of nature, one that we would like to understand. One striking feature of particles which are strongly interacting (like the proton) is that if two of them are approaching each other, the chance of them actually colliding increases as the energy of the particles increases. This behaviour was well-known experimentally, and was modelled in a precursor to the Standard Model called “Regge theory”¹. Amongst other things, the BFKL approach offered, for the first time, a chance of understanding this behaviour from first principles using the Standard Model. Back in 1993, I was a fresh postdoc working on the HERA electron-proton collider which had just started operating at DESY in Hamburg. One thing we were on the lookout for was whether the features predicted by BFKL would show up in our data. The scattering probability for electrons and protons is generally expressed in terms of mathematical objects called structure functions, and the BFKL predictions said that one particular structure function should rise very rapidly as the fraction of the proton’s momentum involved in the collision got smaller. We measured that structure function, and it did rise. But there were problems to sort out before declaring BFKL vindicated. The structure function did not rise as quickly as might have been expected by BFKL. It was also possible to explain the rise using different calculations – not featuring their sums. Most importantly, none of these calculations, by BFKL or others, was very precise, and nor were the data. We were in a grey area. Over the years, many more data have come in, and better calculations have been made, by a generation of theorists and experimentalist wrestling with some formidable challenges. The qualitative impact of the BFKL sums is not now expected to be as dramatic as the initial calculations indicated, but it is still there, and still important. A global analysis published on the arXiv this year by physicists from Amsterdam, Edinburgh, Genoa, Oxford and Rome pulls lots of this work together and makes the qualitative statements about the BFKL sums quantitative. Including these sums (in their newer and more precise form) gives a significantly better description of the data than is the case if they are omitted. What this means is that we have pushed our understanding of the strong force into a new, previously unobserved region, and verified a qualitatively new emergent behaviour. The formidable mathematics behind these calculations connects a deceptively simple underlying theory with a ubiquitous and counter-intuitive observational fact: scattering probabilities rise at high energies. This has implications for our understanding of many things, from the collisions at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN to the propagation and detection of high energy particles in cataclysmic cosmological events. It may even be important in understanding possible new strongly-interacting theories that may still to be discovered beyond the Standard Model. There is more to be said about this physics, and I’m sure there will be further twists and turns. Still, this year we learned something about the basic materials of the universe we live in that we did not know before. The fact that we moved from not knowing to knowing over many years without a single identifiable “eureka” moment or sudden big announcement, doesn’t make the knowledge any less intriguing or significant. ¹Personally I’d say the Standard Model is more of a theory, while Regge theory is more of a model, but there we go.

In the King Power Stadium, with the pain of Leicester City’s late equaliser still raw, José Mourinho stared incredulously at his inquisitor and snarled back without pausing. “Do you think I’m worried with that now, in this moment? With captain and Paul and Paul and captain? No. Do you have any more questions about the game?” “It’s related to the game,” came the reply. “No, it’s not related to the game,” said Mourinho, rising from his chair. “What do you mean the armband? What is the influence in the game?” “We’re just trying to do our job and get a line.” “Which line? The line of the captain? Pfff. That’s not a line,” the Manchester United manager shrugged dismissively as he started walking towards the door. “Any more questions? Merry Christmas, eh.” Even as Mourinho rants go, his reaction to being asked about Paul Pogba’s first Premier League match as United captain was one of the more bizarre matters over which to lose his temper. But this has been a month in which the 54-year-old has been involved in a tunnel bust-up at Old Trafford, walked out of a press conference accusing the media of a lack of respect for Bournemouth, and referred to Bristol City as lucky after a cup defeat. He is growing increasingly frustrated as Manchester City sweep all before them. Accusing his players of making “childish decisions” in the dying moments of Saturday’s match was an indication that Mourinho is quickly losing patience with some of the senior members of his squad, with Anthony Martial, Ashley Young and Chris Smalling – forced to play on with an injury because United had no substitutes remaining – the potential culprits he had in mind. It brought back memories of his bitter attack on his Chelsea side after their defeat at Leicester a little more than two years ago. On that occasion Mourinho accused his players of betraying him as they suffered a ninth league defeat of the season despite having won the title a few months earlier – he was sacked two days later. Although there is a long way to go before he reaches that scale of meltdown, there is compelling evidence that the early stages of his notorious third-season syndrome may have arrived way ahead of schedule. For a manager who has never failed to win the domestic title in his second season at any of his clubs, it is easy to understand why. Even with United starting the second half of the season in their highest position since they won the Premier League in 2013, Mourinho finds his team cut adrift of Pep Guardiola’s City. A lack of professionalism against Leicester cost them, with Martial and Jesse Lingard spurning opportunities to secure a win. But the withering assessment that there was a “lack of maturity” is unlikely to have been well received in the dressing room, especially by Young, whom Mourinho accused of failing to get his message across. The England international has emerged as one of his most trusted lieutenants, captaining the side on more than one occasion this season, so it was surprising to hear him singled out. But, as Mourinho admitted so publicly, the armband does not mean much to him. In the absence of the club captain, Michael Carrick, Antonio Valencia has been the regular choice for most of this season along with Smalling, with Pogba stepping in on Saturday. Perhaps that is part of the problem? It is difficult to imagine a United side containing Steve Bruce or Roy Keane succumbing to such a sloppy equaliser against 10 men with the last kick of the match and Mourinho’s inability to relay his instructions to his team via Young when Smalling was injured does not reflect well on the manager’s relationship with his team. A trusted captain can provide the crucial link between players and manager that appears to be missing at the moment – a role to which Pogba should be perfectly suited. His suspension for the Manchester derby was a bitter blow to Mourinho’s hopes of taking the game to City but with the midfielder back in the side it would make sense to entrust him with the captaincy for the long term. The home fixture against Burnley on Boxing Day provides United with the chance of immediate redemption, and the subsequent games against Southampton and away at Everton must be won to stand any chance of keeping the title race alive. As Mourinho himself once said: “As the coach and leader you must be the master motivator of your team.” Now is the time for him to prove that his methods can still have an effect."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"environment/2017/dec/25/when-butterflies-aplenty-hatched-on-the-tv-set","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-25T11:57:19Z","webTitle":"When butterflies aplenty hatched on the TV set | Brief letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/dec/25/when-butterflies-aplenty-hatched-on-the-tv-set","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/dec/25/when-butterflies-aplenty-hatched-on-the-tv-set","fields":{"headline":"When butterflies aplenty hatched on the TV set","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"George Monbiot’s memory (Our selective blindness is lethal the living world, 20 December) is indeed bittersweet.

Two goals from Juan Mata had seen United battle back from 1-0 down but, despite enjoying a man advantage following the sending-off of the substitute Daniel Amartey, they allowed Leicester to snatch a point with the last kick of the game. “It is as bad as a defeat,” Mourinho admitted. “Sometimes you take a point and you say: ‘OK’ and you accept it as it was hard to get a positive result. That is not the case. That is not the case. It is a game to win easily and then it is not easy to say we lost two points. For the last two minutes the players had to immediately adapt, to read the game, which they didn’t. So we had childish decisions in front of goal and bad decisions as it was not just about the goals we missed, or dribbling or hitting the post. “It was not just about missing chances with an open goal, it was also about decisions. Easy decisions to make in easy transitions to counterattack.” Pressed on who he was referring to, Mourinho refused to single out any of his players in particular but admitted his frustration at United’s failure to press home their advantage. “Some players have childish decisions and time helps them to have maturity and to decide better,” he said. “But some other players stay with childish decision until the end of their career. You know it depends on what is inside and the way they learn or they don’t learn. “I say for example – and he didn’t play today – that Scott McTominay has still a lot to learn, he is a kid who last year was still playing with kids, but no childish decisions at all. Some other guys have childish decisions for many, many years.” United play Burnley on Boxing Day knowing they have an opportunity to reduce the gap to 10 points, with City not in action until Wednesday against Newcastle. Clearly still fuming from his side’s lapse in concentration, Mourinho refused to discuss the meeting with Sean Dyche’s side. “You know I’m not thinking of that or looking at that,” he said. “I’m looking at this match and in half an hour I will be looking at the next match. And the only thing I can say was that it was an easy match to win. Even at half-time with the result 1-1 I told the players more than one time, the match is very easy to win.

A staff notice appended to a rota for the Christmas period told workers that “calling in sick during the next two weeks will result in disciplinary action being taken”, according to a copy sent to the Unite trade union. Unite said one of its members had sent it the document, and while “it may be a shocking example … it’s sadly quite normal across the industry – particularly at this time of year”. A Wagamama spokesperson confirmed that the report was accurate but said that it was an isolated incident. “The manager involved feared team member shortages over the festive period and regrettably decided to take this highly unusual approach,” the spokesperson said. The statement continued: “We sincerely apologise for what has happened and wish all our team members and customers a very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.” The note read: “No calling in sick! May I remind you that if you are unable to come for your shift it is your responsibility to find somebody to cover your shift (as per contract and handbook). Calling in sick during the next two weeks will result in disciplinary action being taken.” The Labour MP Frank Field was critical of the threat of disciplinary action, saying: “Even a brief glimpse of such Scrooge-like behaviour is enough to make anyone feel sick, let alone actually having to work for a company behaving this way. I’m sure Wagamama’s customers would feel sick too, knowing that staff are on the receiving of this rotten behaviour over Christmas.” In a Facebook post, Unite’s hospitality division said: “This is why we need to come together in a union to stop such exploitation. Fair Hospitality [a Unite campaign] was created for that very purpose. Get involved and let’s transform the sector, together.” Before the chain apologised, circulation of the note sparked a #boycottwagamama campaign on social media as people expressed anger at the threat to workers and voiced concern that the approach could put customers’ health at risk by forcing unwell kitchen and restaurant workers to undertake shifts when they are carrying contagious illnesses. Wagamama employs 4,800 people and has 166 branches in the UK, most of which are operated directly but some of which have franchise agreements.

Now I get it","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"There are worse character traits, I know, than sanctimony. After all, it’s really just good liberal instincts taken to overly pious extremes. But the urge to sit in self-righteous judgment on everyone else, to luxuriate in one’s own moral superiority, is so often what helps the left make enemies out of potential friends. So when the phrase “check your privilege” began to be bandied around on social media some years ago – as a sort of rough shorthand for “you can’t possibly know what you’re talking about, because unlike me, you have never truly suffered” – it grated. I told myself that was because it was invariably deployed by sanctimonious people when losing arguments. But in the last couple of years, as “check your privilege” has gone wherever fashionable catchphrases go to die and been superseded by a more thoughtful examination of what privilege means and what responsibilities it confers, I’ve come to realise that isn’t really why I hated it. It’s probably not why anyone hated it. The real problem is that nobody likes to think of themselves as privileged, with its connotations of pampered ignorance and thoroughly undeserved success. Yet most of us are vulnerable to the charge on some level, myself included. This autumn, reading Reni Eddo-Lodge’s Why I’m No Longer Talking to White People About Race just as the Harvey Weinstein affair was breaking, it dawned on me – that spasm of irritation, triggered every time a genuinely nice, well-meaning man tried to say something sympathetic about sexual harassment and got it wrong? That’s what nice, well-meaning white people must sound like on a regular basis, trying and failing to say the right thing about race. You only have to be a fraction off, a tiny bit careless with words or unaware of nuances, to make someone wince. And in truth, most of us are a fraction off on something. Oh yes, you are. If you’re a man, or straight, or healthy and able-bodied; if you have more than the median national household income coming in, or would be secretly surprised to know that that is £27,700, then you’re privileged on at least one score, and there may well be some experiences you don’t properly understand. If you’re old enough to have bought a house while that was still even remotely possible, or to have got a university degree for free, or to have gone to university full stop – well, then you were in some senses a winner in life’s lottery, and should bear that in mind when judging others. Failure to check generational privilege is behind virtually all articles suggesting millennials could become owner occupiers by spending less on avocado toast. Privilege isn’t reserved for those who went to Eton, and it’s all relative. If you can read this, you’re privileged compared to the 15% of Britons who aren’t functionally literate, and so should think twice before making snotty assumptions about people who don’t follow the news. And yet to confess to having been dealt even one good card in life invites the charge of not having succeeded on merit, which is why so many people refuse to accept it. We’d rather see ourselves as the deserving guys, the ones who made it against the odds, and so we dwell lovingly on the ways in which we were disadvantaged, because most people can tick at least one of those boxes too. Like many people, I could tell my life story in two ways, and both would be true. In one version, my dad grew up on a council estate and left school at 15 with no qualifications. Money was tight when I was small, and he was often out of work, so despite earning a good living now I’ve never lost the fear that it could all be over tomorrow. Growing up, I didn’t know anyone in journalism and wasn’t encouraged at my state school to consider that as a career. Life in a male-dominated industry hasn’t always been easy and yes, #metoo. But in the version without the background violins, my mother was from a middle-class background and our fortunes changed dramatically in my teens, when my dad got his big break as an actor. I went to Cambridge, which must have opened some doors for me. And being white, the closest I’ve ever come to experiencing racism was ending up on some far-right hate list of Jewish journalists despite not actually being Jewish (foreign-sounding surname, apparently). Privileged? It all depends who’s asking. And if that’s what used to be called checking a privilege – recognising that you’ve been lucky in ways it would be churlish to ignore, that consequently it sometimes pays to shut up and listen, that truths each of us hold to be self-evident may look very different from a different perspective – well, then I was wrong. It’s no bad thing, or at least so long as everyone strives to avoid sanctimony in response. Because I definitely wasn’t wrong about that. • Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"artanddesign/2017/dec/26/colin-dick-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-26T17:19:52Z","webTitle":"Colin Dick obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/dec/26/colin-dick-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2017/dec/26/colin-dick-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Colin Dick obituary","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"When my friend Colin Dick died aged 88, I was part way through cataloguing his prolific output of paintings. This fascinating journey followed on from Richard Yeomans’ critical survey Colin Dick: Seeing Life (2011). Colin was born in Cheam, Surrey, the son of Stanley Dick, an administrator for BP, and his wife, Mabel (nee Cant); wartime evacuation of his father’s company took the family to Henley, in Oxfordshire. After the second world war, Colin studied at St Martin’s School of Art in London (now Central Saint Martins), with contemporaries such as Frank Auerbach, Eva Frankfurther, Sheila Fell and Leon Kossoff, and subsequently worked as a scene painter for West End shows. He always maintained that the broad technique required for the theatre loosened his art school practice. He married Delia Whiston in 1954. The needs of a growing family prompted them to move to the Midlands, where Colin taught art in Coventry and Leamington Spa, but without any diminution in his already prodigious output. He found subjects in traditional landscapes and townscapes, but was also intrigued by the more exotic reaches of society. The theatre, musicians, circuses, the glitter of funfairs, beggars and Gypsy gatherings had a persistent allure for him. A collection of his work, including watercolour drawings of buildings damaged by wartime bombing or lost in postwar redevelopment, is held by the Herbert Art gallery, in Coventry. He also exhibited all over the UK and in France. Colin had an easy manner and his expectations of rapport were usually fulfilled. In a Moscow church, for instance, he was once taken for an Orthodox priest and, during an exhibition in Biarritz, France, he was approached by a grandee of the Societé des Amis de Napoleon III with a proposal that he should repatriate the emperor’s remains from Hampshire. He kept painting until a few weeks before his death, despite ill-health – diabetes resulted in the amputation of a leg last year. Colin’s granddaughter, Rosanna, recalls Colin and Delia’s belief in “the importance of keeping jolly” and Colin’s mastery of “the fine art of living”. He is survived by Delia, their children Sara, Oliver and Elspeth, and four grandchildren, Patrick, Alexander, Rosanna and Emilia."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/28/festive-period-prison-homeless","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-28T10:35:01Z","webTitle":"Why I’d like to spend the festive period in prison | Tom Hughes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/28/festive-period-prison-homeless","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/28/festive-period-prison-homeless","fields":{"headline":"Why I’d like to spend the festive period in prison","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"This year, I want just one thing over the festive period: a nice, short prison sentence. Why? Because a spell in jail would be immeasurably preferable to facing life on the streets, homeless. I know this because I have been both homeless and in prison before. I was educated in the UK public school system and being sent away to a tough 1980s boarding school aged seven made my three-month prison term seem like a negligible hardship. Once I had been through the ordeal of police custody, court and processing, and had survived the first two weeks, I found I had no real fear of life behind bars. Inside, I got a job easily, was treated by the prison officers with care and respect, got fed hot meals twice daily and could watch TV. I was warm, dry, secure and safe. Contrast this with what this time of the year will hold for me on the streets. Three weeks ago, I lost my full-time, minimum wage job making coffee on a mobile street stand following the owner’s abrupt decision to close the business. Because of the precarious long-term viability of the business and the cash-in-hand pay, I was unable to commit to a rental contract. I stayed in Airbnbs and struggled to make ends meet due to the extortionate cost of short-term London rent. When I was made redundant with a day’s notice, my world collapsed around me. In summer, homeless life can be tolerable, even entertaining. The eight weeks I spent living in Hyde Park in a tent hidden among bushes, surviving mostly on custard cream biscuits bought with coins fished out of the fountain or the surprisingly rich pickings uncovered in the bins of Green Park, were memorable. But in winter, life on the streets is awful. Night shelters are little different to the Victorian workhouse. They are noisy, smelly, dangerous and difficult to get into. To access them, you have to be “found” up to three times sleeping on the streets by an outreach team. This is generally negotiated with the team in advance, so you have to sleep somewhere prearranged. I was first criminalised in July 2014 for harassment (via email). After being handed a suspended sentence, I went away and travelled across Europe as a tramp, violated the restraining order, and flew back to the UK to be questioned by police. Within three days of landing at Heathrow, I was in prison. But just over two weeks after that, I had become the prison library orderly and established a routine of sorts. I enjoyed having a job and thrived on the structure and boundaries imposed by prison life. In May 2015, I was released back into homelessness with £47.90 in my pocket and no clue about what to do next. I spent the first night drunk, sleeping in a bus shelter. I found life outside much harder to navigate than the one I’d had in prison, and ever since a return to jail has been a constant, niggling temptation. It’s a place where, at least for me, life is far more straightforward. The key issue is one of respect. Once you are in prison, you aren’t treated like shit. In the outside world, the homeless are patronised, talked down to and disrespected. It’s very hard to work your way out of this kind of dependence. So if I relent and decide to just give up, I will head into a police station and pull a perfectly innocent party popper. Under the standard terms of release from prison, I signed a F2050F firearms certificate and was clearly warned that handling as much as a party popper in the five years after release would be a serious criminal offence. It’s probably the fastest, easiest – and, crucially, least harmful – route back into prison. But for the moment, I am still determined to beat the statistics. According to a 2012 report from the Ministry of Justice, prisoners who reported being homeless before prison were more likely to be reconvicted upon release than prisoners who were not – 79% compared with 47% in the first year alone. These figures make grim reading and I am determined to do my best to prove them wrong. But as I wonder which doorway or underpass to sleep in, it will be hard to resist the call of prison life. • Tom Hughes is a former business and technology journalist, traveller and adventurer"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/dec/27/today-programmes-royal-coup-was-smart-move-for-bbc-and-prince-harry","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-27T15:31:00Z","webTitle":"Today programme’s royal coup was smart move for BBC and Prince Harry","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/dec/27/today-programmes-royal-coup-was-smart-move-for-bbc-and-prince-harry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/dec/27/today-programmes-royal-coup-was-smart-move-for-bbc-and-prince-harry","fields":{"headline":"Today programme’s royal coup was smart move for BBC and Prince Harry","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Prince Harry has provided an unprecedented insight into the issues that he considers important and his relationship with his father, Prince Charles, by guest-editing BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. But agreeing to edit one of the BBC’s flagship current affairs programmes has also shone a light on the royal family’s approach to the media. The prince’s edition of Today has been broadly well received, with presenter Sarah Montague praising the 33-year-old as more hands-on than other guest editors and Catherine Mayer, author of a 2015 biography on Prince Charles, describing it as a “stunning public relations feat”. Attracting the royal to edit Today – one of the BBC’s flagship current affairs programme – will be seen as a coup within the BBC, as will his interview with Barack Obama, which is the first that the former US president has granted since his term in office ended in January. The prince has had a notoriously rocky relationship with the press. Last year he criticised coverage of his relationship with Meghan Markle, accusing the media of introducing “racial overtones” into comment pieces. However, agreeing to guest edit Today fits with the broader media strategy adopted by the younger members of the royal family – they are willing to open up but on their terms. The prince has tried to take more control of his communications and image with the general public – often using social media to bypass traditional media outlets – and Today provided another platform to discuss issues that matter to him. Mayer, who is also the co-founder of the Women’s Equality party said the interview between Prince Harry and Prince Charles could help the different generations of the royal family be more closely aligned as a brand. She said on social media: “You cannot separate the man from the office and for the same reason BBC Radio 4’s Today decision to give a substantial platform to royalty will raise concerns among republicans but also traditionalists, who fear that royalty espousing causes sacrifices ‘neutrality’ and weakens the institution. “Republicans are right to worry. Prince Harry’s Today was a stunning public relations feat that achieved several different goals at once – showcasing the utility of royalty and building the brand, aligning his ‘young royals’ brand and his father’s. “Republicans do struggle to get a hearing, because of bias and also the movement’s own weaknesses. But bigger forces are also at play. Those who believed the end of the Elizabethan age signalled republicanism’s best chance now find themselves staring at a royal resurgence.” In a sign of how much interest the royal family can take in interviews, the editor of Channel 4 News said that he had been asked to sign a 14-page contract before interviewing Prince Charles. Ben de Pear said: “I wonder if Prince Harry or Today had to sign the 14-page contract including clauses ceding editorial control, pre-approved questions &amp; final cut to Prince Charles I was sent when Channel 4 News was offered HRH.” Prince Harry addressed Prince Charles as “pa” in the interview and a large portion was dedicated to climate change. When asked by Prince Harry what issue he wanted to focus on in 2018, Prince Charles said: “I think you know because I have probably bored you to tears for so many years. I mean there is a whole lot of things that I have tried to focus on over all these years that I feel needed attention. Not everyone else did but, maybe now, some years later they are beginning to realise that what I was trying to say may not have been quite as dotty as they thought.” As well as interviewing Prince Charles and Obama, Prince Harry spoke to the co-founder of artificial intelligence company DeepMind, Demis Hassabis, and personally asked boxer Anthony Joshua to appear on the programme. Other topics that Today explored during Prince Harry’s edition were the armed forces, youth violence, mental health, conservation, women’s rugby and the future of the Commonwealth. He chose Abdurahman Sayed from al-Manaar Muslim Cultural Heritage Centre in North Kensington, which has been helping residents following the Grenfell Tower fire, to conduct the programme’s Thought for the Day and also played grime music made by a Nottingham-based charity at the start of the show. At the end of the show Prince Harry was himself interviewed in the studio by Montague and co-presenter Justin Webb. He refused to be drawn on his political views – or whether the Obamas will be invited to his wedding to Meghan Markle next year – but did provide some details about his Christmas with Markle and royal family, saying that he had an “amazing time” and that his fiance had “really enjoyed it”. Prince Harry was also clearly happy with how the programme had gone, despite a 6am start on 27 December that led to him commenting about the importance of coffee. Kensington Palace posted on social media throughout Today and afterwards published Prince Harry’s reflections on the programme. “I’m hugely grateful for this platform to be able to discuss topics that I think really need to be discussed and thought about,” he said. For their part, both the BBC and Kensington Palace are likely to be celebrating the success of Prince Harry’s rare foray into the media world."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2017/dec/28/nhs-hospitals-made-174m-from-car-park-charges-this-year","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-28T00:01:31Z","webTitle":"NHS hospitals made £174m from car park charges this year","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/dec/28/nhs-hospitals-made-174m-from-car-park-charges-this-year","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/dec/28/nhs-hospitals-made-174m-from-car-park-charges-this-year","fields":{"headline":"NHS hospitals made £174m from car park charges this year","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"NHS hospitals made a record £174m from charging patients, visitors and staff to park in 2016/17, up 6% on the previous year. Data from 111 hospital trusts across England shows that as many as two-thirds are making more than £1m a year. More than half of trusts now charge disabled people to park. Some trusts defended the charges, saying they were essential to pay for patient care. But opposition parties and patient support groups were critical, with one group saying they were “cynical” but blaming the state of NHS finances rather than the trusts themselves. The Liberal Democrats condemned the charges as a “tax on sickness” while Labour said it was committed to ending them. The government condemned “complex and unfair” parking charges and called for reform, but a Department of Health spokesman said they were a matter for local NHS organisations rather than central regulation.Parking remains largely free at hospitals in Scotland and Wales. The 40 trusts in England that provided data on parking penalties made £947,568 in 2016/17 from fining patients, visitors and staff on hospital grounds, up 32% on the £716,385 taken by the same trusts the previous year. A total of 120 NHS trusts across England were asked to provide data on charges and fines, in requests under the Freedom of Information Act by the Press Association, and 111 responded. Some were giving private firms hundreds of thousands of pounds to run their car parks. The Heart of England NHS foundation trust took in the most in parking income across the year (£4,865,000). Royal Surrey County hospital, in Guildford, charged the most at £4 per hour. If a patient required a day’s worth of treatment then they would have to pay £32 for an eight-hour day. Longer-term concessions were available at some hospitals, such as for people having regular chemotherapy. Some hospitals defended the charges, saying some or all of the money was put back into patient care or was spent on site maintenance. Rachel Power, chief executive of the Patients Association, said the current state of NHS finances meant it was sometimes difficult to blame hospitals for trying to find money, although this did not make the current situation acceptable. “For patients, parking charges amount to an extra charge for being ill,” she said. “The increase in the number of trusts who are charging for disabled parking is particularly concerning. “Patients who require disabled parking may have little choice but to access their care by car, and may need to do so often. Targeting them in this way feels rather cynical.” Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, said: “Hospital parking charges are an entirely unfair and unnecessary burden, which disproportionately affect the most vulnerable people using our health service. “Even Jeremy Hunt has described this outrageous practice as a ‘stealth tax’, and yet Tory underfunding of our NHS has resulted in hospitals and private companies extracting record fees from patients and staff. Labour will abolish car parking charges and scrap this needless strain on already worried families.” The Lib Dem health spokesman, Norman Lamb, said: “The vast sums of money that hospitals are making from parking charges reveal the hidden cost of healthcare faced by many patients and their families. All hospitals should be following the national guidelines to make sure that patients, relatives, and NHS staff are not unfairly penalised.” A Department of Health spokesman said: “Patients and families should not have to deal with the added stress of complex and unfair parking charges. NHS organisations are locally responsible for the methods used to charge, and we want to see them coming up with flexible options that put patients and their families first.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/jan/01/from-blade-runner-to-chasing-asylum-the-best-of-streaming-in-january","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-01T02:10:31Z","webTitle":"From Blade Runner to Chasing Asylum: the best of Australia's streaming in January","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jan/01/from-blade-runner-to-chasing-asylum-the-best-of-streaming-in-january","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jan/01/from-blade-runner-to-chasing-asylum-the-best-of-streaming-in-january","fields":{"headline":"From Blade Runner to Chasing Asylum: the best of Australia's streaming in January","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Netflix Film: Groundhog Day (US, 1993) by Harold Ramis – out 1 January A perfect film. Groundhog Day is a comedy that strikes its pitch, themes and characters’ psychology so precisely and good-naturedly that you can easily overlook its expert always-the-same-always-different structure. Sneering, cynical weatherman Phil (Bill Murray) finds himself trapped in the same day, covering what he dismisses as a parochial holiday in a small Pennsylvania town, and falling in love with perennially sunny TV producer Rita (Andie MacDowell). As the miserable day repeats, we see snippets of his doomed efforts to break out of the cycle and realise that the secret lies in overhauling his worldview. It can sometimes be easy to overlook the skill inherent in a successful big-studio comedy – or as this turns out to be, an existential romcom. Mass entertainment with emotional intelligence. Film: Hook (US, 1991) by Steven Spielberg – out 1 January Though hardly one of Spielberg’s finest film-making moments, Hook, a then contemporary reimagining of Peter Pan, still makes for enjoyable viewing. Returning to it after Robin Williams’s death, I was struck by the genius of his casting: Williams plays a remote work-obsessed father, revisiting his hazy past in Neverland, (re)encountering Tinkerbell (Julia Roberts) after Captain Hook (Dustin Hoffman) kidnaps his children. Williams plays the flipsides of his character – a man who has made daily life into an unthinkable stress and must return to valuing the love of his family – beautifully and the action-fantasy sequences in which he remembers to fly are a lovely vision of recaptured childhood. Embrace the cheesiness. Film: Mad Max (Australia, 1979) by George Miller – out 26 January How’s this for perverse Australia Day viewing? Then again, the baking-desert vistas, cracked-out vehicles and male maniacs of George Miller’s now classic dystopian action film – in which one man, Max Rockatansky (Mel Gibson), must struggle to protect his family after societal collapse in the near future – could be the ideal choice for 26 January. After the uber-success of Mad Max: Fury Road (comparably slick against the rough-as-guts production values here), returning to the director’s initial vision of a dysfunctional society ruled by tribes of revheads after some unnamed disaster shows how much action filmmaking has changed over the decades. The pacing and slow-motion storytelling beats of the original Mad Max serve to make the build-up to the crazed punctuations of violence even more suspenseful, and the emotional engine of fear – triggered by the threat to Max’s wife and son, the perils of trusting strangers and the breakdown of human solidarity – lurks just beneath the surface at all times. An apocalyptic vision of Australia gone berserk. Honourable mentions: It’s a Wonderful Life (film, out now), Grace and Frankie season four (TV, 19 January), Kong: Skull Island (film, 19 January), The Wolf of Wall Street (film, 28 January). Stan TV: Romper Stomper (Australia, 2018) by Geoffrey Wright – out 1 January While the political spectrum polarises and the middle ground between right and left evaporates, Geoffrey Wright has rehabilitated his classic Australian crime film Romper Stomper as a six-part series for Stan. Where the original 1992 film delved into the minds of working-class skinheads obsessed with Asian migration, the new series contemplates the growth of the far right and anti-Muslim sentiment. Melbourne, grimily urban and blue-tinted, stands on the precipice of racially motivated riots. The extremist Patriots, led by Blake (Lachy Hulme), have a new member, Kane (Toby Wallace), who may push them toward a more overt form of paramilitary vigilantism after their surprise demonstration outside a halal festival is violently disrupted by an anarchist group. Meanwhile, Laila (Nicole Chamoun), a young Muslim student, finds herself caught between the groups and in a difficult leadership role for her community. Early commentary on the new series questioned the worth of another story from the viewpoint of the alt-right but the first episode introduces a range of intelligent Arab characters, and offers a progressive political critique of the present dead end of Australian politics. Its Melbourne is a place where all members of the community – middle class, down and out – are disenfranchised by the major parties and motivated by disillusionment. It’s not the cinematic TV of today’s golden era but, as a teleseries, it’s a step beyond the crass commercial sensibilities of something like Channel Nine’s Underbelly franchise. Worth watching to see for yourself. Film: The Assassin (China, 2015) by Hou Hsiao-hsien – out now In ninth-century China, a solitary assassin-in-exile (Shu Qi) is brought back to the job to kill a powerful man who was once her lover. The task becomes a terrible, impossible choice between ruined love and duty, but the emotion in The Assassin plays out in such repressed, delicately managed tremors. As a wuxia film (a particular type of fantastical drama/action film involving Chinese martial artists and set in deep history), its loveliest resonances are found its finely executed martial arts sequences, costuming and period setting, as well as the still charisma of Shu Qi’s performance. This is a slightly plotted, elaborately staged, beautifully made genre film. You may as well switch the subtitles off and immerse yourself in the sound, vision and nonverbal feeling. Film: Chasing Asylum (Australia, 2016) by Eva Orner – out now Perhaps the most devastating aspect of Chasing Asylum is that, less than two years after its release, the state of Australia’s human rights abuses in offshore detention centres has actually – unimaginably – worsened. In both theme and storytelling conventions, Oscar-winner Eva Orner’s film is less a documentary than a horror film. Her production team valiantly snuck secret cameras into island hellholes and we see shaky, handheld footage of refugees creeping around empty corridors, seeing their family members in the most horrendous conditions and even stumbling across scenes of terrible violence – desperate messages scrawled in blood, traumatised figures in the distance. A final epilogue of needed reprieve points to the future and how previous governments managed and even welcomed refugees. A story that is even more necessary now than it was during its original release. Honourable mentions: Truth (film, out now), The Bad Sleep Well (film, out now), Internal Affairs (film, out now), Adventure Time season nine (TV, out now), RuPaul’s Drag Race: All Stars season three (TV, 26 January), Antichrist (film, 27 January). Foxtel Now TV: Divorce, season two (US, 2018) by Sharon Horgan – out 8 January Perhaps the hardest to watch comedy on TV, Divorce is a droll, perverse examination of the end of a relationship. Season one saw upper-middle-class parents of two, Frances (Sarah Jessica Parker) and Robert (Thomas Haden Church), descend into an increasingly hostile separation after 10 years of marriage. It’s a darker, less chick-flick vision of relationships and New York life than many of the family sitcoms we’re used to and the characters are not so much likeable as relatable for the mistakes they make and the opposites-attract nature of their crumbling partnership. No previews were available for season two but it’s worth checking out if the laughs are as grim and irksome as the first season, and if you enjoy abrasive comedy with a hard edge. Honourable mentions: The X Files, season 11 (TV, out 4 January), Golden Globes and Live from the Red Carpet (TV, 8 January). Dendy Direct Film: Good Time (US, 2017) by Ben and Josh Safdie – out 10 January New American auteurs Ben and Josh Safdie have moved away from the unhurried style of their earlier films (Daddy Longlegs, Heaven Knows What), producing a tense, funny crime film set over one terrible night when everything goes wrong for its underclass crim protagonists. Connie (Robert Pattinson) tricks his developmentally delayed brother Nick (Ben Safdie) into helping him rob a bank. It’s (predictably) a disaster, which opens the way for a crazed night through New York’s poverty-stricken underworld (this is not the gentrified vision of NYC we’re accustomed to), in the grand tradition of the “one damn thing after the other” chase film. This low-budget arthouse crime thriller draws on the classic American cinema of the 1970s – films such as Dog Day Afternoon and Taxi Driver – when a new mood of pessimism was taking over politics and culture, but comes to articulate its own strange sweetness and hope. Soaked in neon lights, shot in a hectic, tight-framed style and with a furiously tense electronic score by Oneohtrix Point Never, Good Time is not just one of the most striking and memorable crime films of last year, it’s a sideways portrait of the US’s lost and forgotten urban poor. Film: Blade Runner (US, 1982) by Ridley Scott – out 17 January Forget the recent sequel, which played like a self-serious, moody contemporary action film rather than a science fiction classic. The original – in which a veteran called Deckard (Harrison Ford in peak harrowed grace mode) must hunt four robots (replicants) who have escaped from an off-world hellhole of slavery to find their creator – is eternal. What mattered in Ridley Scott’s neo-noir wasn’t whether Deckard was himself definitively a replicant but the suggestion that he may have been. Scott’s film created a hazy, acid-rainy dreamworld of conflated memories and copied identities for viewers to feel and fear their own way through. The 1940s-inflected design wasn’t cosmetic; rather, it conjured the kind of black-and-white classic noir in which Humphrey Bogart-type figures slunk around the edges of careless, lonely, alienated, criminally organised cities. The science fiction genre depends on taking an element of today’s society and extrapolating it into an entire future world to illuminate the truths of the present. Blade Runner’s world, in which humans and robots are indistinguishable and fated to love and kill one another, and where flecks of solidarity flicker in a soulless industrial society, remains both an ideal tonic and surreal warning for today. Honourable mentions: Dunkirk (film, now). SBS On Demand Film: Boy (New Zealand, 2010) by Taika Waititi – out now In 1980s New Zealand, Boy is an 11-year-old kid getting to know his father (played by writer-director Taika Waititi), a rather hopeless figure who was unprepared for parenthood and has returned home only for a stash of money he buried years earlier. This was the first of Waititi’s sad comedies, or funny tragedies. Waititi manages to articulate the plaintive realities of childhood trauma – another abandoned boy was at the centre of his 2016 film, Hunt for the Wilderpeople, too – so deftly and sensitively that you barely notice the pathos behind the laughs. Fast forward to 2017 and Waititi has busted open Hollywood, applying his zippy, childlike style to re-energise the Thor blockbuster franchise. But Boy is enough to make you miss the simpler storytelling of Waititi’s early work; this is a film of great sweetness. Honourable mentions: Adventureland (film, out now), Growing Up Tough (TV, out now). ABC iView TV: Behind the Second Woman (Australia, 2017) by Olivia Rousset – 15 January One of the most compelling contemporary theatre works I’ve seen this year, or perhaps ever, Nat Randall and Anna Breckon’s The Second Woman, saw Randall perform the same scene – marking the end of a romantic relationship between a couple – 100 times over 24 hours with 100 different male strangers. It was a privilege to experience such an affecting feminist artwork, both epic in its duration and intimate in its themes, that revealed so much about how men and women interact: how the big-picture questions of sexism manifest in tiny private moments. Although a full preview of this half-hour doco was unavailable, the trailer promises significant insight based on impressive backstage access to the show as it was happening. Between clips of Randall and Breckon sneaking cigarettes in quiet offstage moments and close-up portraits of the male participants, the documentary focuses on those men’s experiences, along with insights into how this remarkable theatre-screen-live performance work was made. Honourable mentions: The Checkout (weekly episodes on Tuesdays from 30 January)."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/dec/26/grenfell-tower-management-company-hands-responsibility-back-to-council","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-26T19:35:33Z","webTitle":"Grenfell Tower management company hands responsibility back to council","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/dec/26/grenfell-tower-management-company-hands-responsibility-back-to-council","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/dec/26/grenfell-tower-management-company-hands-responsibility-back-to-council","fields":{"headline":"Grenfell Tower management company hands responsibility back to council","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The organisation that managed Grenfell Tower and manages thousands of other properties across the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea is temporarily handing back responsibility for them to the council, saying it can no longer guarantee to meet the standards expected by residents. In a letter sent to residents just before Christmas, Fay Edwards, chair of Kensington &amp; Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation (KCTMO), said: “The TMO board has reluctantly decided that it can no longer guarantee to fulfil its obligations with respect to the delivery of services contained in its contract with the council … to a standard that residents should expect.” It adds that management responsibility will temporarily be handed back to the council while it carries out a consultation exercise about the future management of its housing stock. A spokesman for the borough said the council would be taking over repairs, looking after the council’s estates and running day-to-day services. The news has been greeted with anger from residents. Joe Delaney of the Lancaster West Estate Residents Association and a member of the council’s Grenfell recovery scrutiny committee, accused the council and KCTMO of a “cynical, unethical and completely underhand move”. Delaney said residents had no confidence in the council’s ability to manage housing and wanted KCTMO to continue to exist so that its role in the fire could be scrutinised at the public inquiry. Council and KCTMO officials insist that even though it is handing back day-to-day management of estates across the borough it will still be scrutinised at the public inquiry for its role in the fire which claimed 71 lives. Delaney said: “It was agreed to give residents made homeless by the fire a payment for Christmas lunch but many of us haven’t yet received those payments. If they can’t manage to organise Christmas lunch payments how can they manage estates across the borough? “There is institutional indifference to the residents from this council,” he added. “I will be calling for this transfer of management not to go ahead at the council’s next scrutiny committee on 18 January.” A letter being sent by the council to the 10,000 KCTMO residents in the borough states: “We are already making progress on an urgent and thorough review of all the KCTMO’s operations including health and safety, finance, repairs and estate management services. We have been prioritising this since the new leadership of the council took over, and we believe it is essential following the tragedy of the Grenfell fire. We will continue to share the results of this as we find them and make improvements and changes wherever needed.” Concerns have been raised about shortcomings in KCTMO’s management of properties in the borough. These failures may have contributed to the devastating impact of the fire. KCTMO will continue to exist as an independent corporate entity. The board will scrutinise the delivery of services to residents. A spokesman for the organisation said: “The TMO has informed residents that its board has reluctantly decided that, in current circumstances, it can no longer guarantee the delivery of services to a standard that residents should expect. Therefore, in the best interests of residents, services which the TMO currently provides are to be temporarily handed back to the council while the consultation about the future management of its housing stock is completed. It remains a priority that the answers, which we all want about the Grenfell tragedy, are obtained.” A spokesman for the borough said: “We are aware of the update from the TMO to residents and we will be writing to all residents to make sure they have clarity on next steps. We are clear, though, that this is only an interim measure.” Seraphima Kennedy, a former neighbourhood officer for KCTMO, said: “They do not care about the impact of their decisions on the lives of those who live in the homes they are legally required to look after.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/dec/26/watford-leicester-city-premier-league-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-26T16:59:54Z","webTitle":"Kasper Schmeichel’s error hands three points to Watford against Leicester City","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/dec/26/watford-leicester-city-premier-league-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/dec/26/watford-leicester-city-premier-league-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Kasper Schmeichel’s error hands three points to Watford against Leicester City","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Watford have bemoaned their misfortune in recent weeks but here Marco Silva’s team were grateful for the unwitting assistance of Kasper Schmeichel as they fought back from a deficit to end a miserable series of results. The Leicester City goalkeeper turned a cross by Abdoulaye Doucouré into his own net in the 65th minute to complete Watford’s comeback after Molla Wagué had negated Riyad Mahrez’s opening goal for the visitors. Silva was under pressure to find a solution to his team’s rotten form, which took root when the manager was courted by Everton last month. The Portuguese triggered the turnaround here, changing things when he made a first-half substitution that altered the course of the match. Watford came into the game with a record of eight defeats from their previous 11 matches and initially it did not look as if Leicester would grant them any respite. The visitors were the sharper side for most of the first half and could have taken the lead through Jamie Vardy even before Mahrez scored. It was a splendid finish by the Algerian, who headed the ball beyond the reach of Heurelho Gomes from eight yards after a typically fine cross by Marc Albrighton. The fact that Mahrez was free in the box, as he had been on several previous occasions, highlighted the extent to which the hotchpotch home team were malfunctioning. Silva, faced with a spate of injuries and suspensions on top of that dreadful run of results, had opted for a surprising formation in which Richarlison was deployed in an unfamiliar lone striker role. The home side struggled to find fluency, even though the Brazilian should have equalised within two minutes of Mahrez’s goal. André Carrillo, Watford’s most threatening player throughout, created the chance with a jagged run in from the left and a cute pass. The Brazilian dodged past Schmeichel but fired into the side-netting from a tight angle. That chance did not fool Silva into thinking his original plan was working so he changed it, introducing Stefano Okaka when the ineffective Roberto Pereyra complained of a slight injury. Richarlison moved to the left and Watford immediately looked more comfortable. But it is unlikely that even Silva anticipated their breakthrough coming moments later through Wagué. The Mali international made a single start for Leicester while on loan last season, suffering a season-ending injury in February’s FA Cup defeat at Millwall. That was one more than he had made before this match for Watford, whom he joined on loan from Udinese in the summer. He marked the occasion in unexpected style just before half-time, stabbing the ball into the net from close range after Richarlison’s shot from a corner was blocked by Wilfried Ndidi. “He gave me everything I asked,” Silva said of Wagué, explaining he picked the Malian mainly because his speed would enable him to keep pace with Vardy. “He has been improving in the last weeks in training so now I gave him the chance and he answered well. It is a sign for everyone in the club that you always have to be ready.” Watford underlined their transformation by almost scoring a second before the interval, but Richarlison blasted against a post after a flowing move. Their vibrancy carried over into the second half but the adventure left them exposed to Leicester’s counterattacks. Gomes saved from Mahrez early in the second half and he should have been required to make another on the hour, but Albrighton attempted a pass rather than a shot after being sent clear. The pass was cut out. That misjudgment was soon compounded by Leicester’s defence. A free-kick by Tom Cleverley was allowed to travel beyond the far post, where Doucouré hooked the ball back from the touchline. Schmeichel tried to block it at the near post but instead helped it over the line. Doucouré celebrated like a midfielder who had scored his seventh goal of his impressive campaign but the goalkeeper’s touch was decisive. Leicester have conceded more goals from set pieces than any other team in the Premier League this season. “We need to correct this,” said Claude Puel, their manager. “We need good attention and have to focus on second balls and mark well. When you lose a game like this, it’s a big frustration.” Leicester attempted to rescue a point but were thwarted by Gomes, who made two marvellous saves following Leicester corners, first from Wes Morgan and then from Leonardo Ulloa. “The way we reacted after going behind showed the personality and team spirit we have, and that must always stay,” Silva added."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/23/charity-appeal-cancer-syrian-children-damascus","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-23T20:00:31Z","webTitle":"Charity launches Syria emergency appeal to save critically ill children","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/23/charity-appeal-cancer-syrian-children-damascus","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/23/charity-appeal-cancer-syrian-children-damascus","fields":{"headline":"Charity launches Syria emergency appeal to save critically ill children","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"A charity and a leading British surgeon have made a desperate appeal for the evacuation of seven children with “curable cancer”, aged between eight and 12, trapped in a besieged Syrian town. The children, and 175 others in need of treatment no longer available in the area, live in Ghouta, an area just to the east of Damascus that was a bread-basket for the Syrian capital before the war. It has been under siege by forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad for years, but troops tightened their cordon after a ground offensive in April, pushing an estimated 400,000 people still living there “to the brink of disaster”. Eastern Ghouta should be covered under a de-escalation agreement brokered by Russia, Turkey and Iran to reduce conflict across Syria, but residents have seen no let-up in the fighting or the siege. “Hospitals in Ghouta are on their knees, with few medicines left and kind words for the dying children the only palliative care available,” surgeon David Nott and chemical weapons expert Hamish de Bretton-Gordon wrote in their Christmas appeal, on behalf of the Union of Medical Care and Relief Organisations. Both have extensive experience working in Syria, and last year successfully appealed for another ceasefire to evacuate around 500 children from Aleppo, reaching out to Assad and Russia’s Vladimir Putin, a key backer. They hope to repeat that success, and say they have reached out to both governments. “We now appeal to at least give these seven children a chance of life by getting them to places which can treat their curable cancers,” they wrote. MP Alison McGovern, who chairs the all-party Friends of Syria group in parliament, called on the government to make the evacuation a priority."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/dec/23/damian-green-plotted-kate-maltby","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-23T22:53:00Z","webTitle":"Damian Green’s allies plotted to discredit me – Kate Maltby","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/dec/23/damian-green-plotted-kate-maltby","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/dec/23/damian-green-plotted-kate-maltby","fields":{"headline":"Damian Green’s allies plotted to discredit me – Kate Maltby","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Kate Maltby, the Tory activist who made allegations of inappropriate behaviour against Damian Green, believes that his allies orchestrated a ferocious media onslaught in order to discredit her. The Observer understands that the Whitehall inquiry that led to the de facto deputy prime minister’s sacking last week was handed material, seen by Maltby, which suggested Green’s supporters fuelled negative articles about her after she made her claims. It has emerged that text messages between Maltby and Green, some apparently edited to suggest she had been pushing for a meeting with the former minister, had ended up in the hands of the media. She told the Sunday Times that only Green or his allies could have leaked the material. However, Green and his closest aides deny any suggestion that they contributed in any way to the attacks on Maltby or passed on the texts. Maltby is understood to believe that collusion between Green’s allies contributed to an article in the Daily Mail headlined “One very pushy lady”. The claims of inappropriate behaviour made by Maltby were eventually judged “plausible” by the Cabinet Office inquiry into the first secretary of state’s actions. Green ultimately lost his job after admitting that he had lied about the fact that pornography was found on his parliamentary computer during a police investigation in 2008. May now faces the prospect of replacing Green, who had chaired a series of sensitive Brexit cabinet committees. Senior government figures on both sides of the EU referendum debate pointed to David Lidington, the justice secretary and former Europe minister, as the “ultimate safe pair of hands” who could do the job without upsetting Remainers or Brexiters. Opinion is split among senior Tories over whether May should make the changes as part of a major reshuffle next month. It has not gone unnoticed by party whips that the main troublemakers for May have been former ministers such as Anna Soubry, Nicky Morgan and Dominic Grieve. The latest twist in the affair comes as debate still rages over the role of the two police officers, Bob Quick and Neil Lewis, who were involved in Scotland Yard’s 2008 investigation into Home Office leaks. The investigation led to Green’s arrest and seizure of his parliamentary computers. It was during the course of that inquiry that online pornography was discovered. Green had denied any knowledge of the existence of the material, but has now admitted that his denial was misleading. The College of Policing, which sets standards for serving officers through an official code of ethics, said that it expected the ethical code that the two officers signed in connection with their policing career to be upheld after they depart the force. The code states: “I will treat information with respect, and access or disclose it only in the proper course of my duties.” It also makes clear that officers must “access police-held information for a legitimate or authorised policing purpose only” and “not disclose information, on or off duty, to unauthorised recipients”. The College of Policing told the Observer: “We expect that members of the profession will be proud to maintain the standards contained in the code of ethics in relation to their policing career, after retirement.” However, senior police sources believe there is a whistleblowing defence for Quick and Lewis, arguing that they acted in the public interest to highlight inaccurate statements made by a senior public employee. Sources also say there is significant support for the two officers. Georgina Halford-Hall, chief executive of WhistleblowersUK, said: “It raises really serious issues about when people have information, who they disclose it to, how they should disclose it and how they should be treated.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/dec/23/us-ambassador-netherlands-apologises-fake-news-interview-muslim-no-go-zones","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-23T19:43:14Z","webTitle":"US ambassador to Netherlands says sorry for 'fake news' interview debacle","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/23/us-ambassador-netherlands-apologises-fake-news-interview-muslim-no-go-zones","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/dec/23/us-ambassador-netherlands-apologises-fake-news-interview-muslim-no-go-zones","fields":{"headline":"US ambassador to Netherlands says sorry for 'fake news' interview debacle","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Pete Hoekstra, the newly sworn-in US ambassador to the Netherlands, issued a public apology on Saturday for comments he made in a 2015 interview about so called “no-go” zones in Muslim communities in Europe. The comments came to light during a cringeworthy exchange on the current affairs programme Nieuwsuur on Friday where Hoekstra directly contradicted himself twice in a matter of less than a minute on live television. “I made certain remarks in 2015 and regret the exchange during the Nieuwsuur interview. Please accept my apology,” Hoekstra shared on Twitter. The myth of “no-go zones”, concentrated pockets of Muslim immigrants in Europe so hostile to outsiders that non-Muslims cannot safely pass, has been widely debunked. It still, however, remains popular in some conservative and anti-Islamic circles and reached its peak shortly after the January 2015 terror attacks in Paris. In the interview, reporter Wouter Zwart says: “You mentioned in a debate that there are no-go zones in the Netherlands, and that cars and politicians are being set on fire in the Netherlands.” Hoekstra replies: “I didn’t say that. This is actually an incorrect statement. We would call it fake news.” Hoekstra is then shown clips of him saying: “The Islamic movement has now gotten to a point where they have put Europe into chaos. Chaos in the Netherlands, there are cars being burnt, there are politicians that are being burnt … and yes there are no-go zones in the Netherlands.” Challenged about having called this “fake news”, Hoekstra then went on to deny to Zwart that he had in fact used the phrase “fake news”. “I didn’t call that fake news. I didn’t use the words today. I don’t think I did.” Hoekstra, who was born in Groningen in the Netherlands, was a Republican congressman for Michigan between 1993 and 2011, and served as chair of the House intelligence committee for two years during that time. In his statement he described himself as being “passionate about confronting the global threat of terrorism”, and elsewhere has described himself as a “Frequent writer and commentator on intelligence issues and the threat from radical Islam”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/dec/23/fifa-trial-questions-2022-qatar-world-cup","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-23T20:00:31Z","webTitle":"Fifa trial leaves questions over 2022 Qatar World Cup","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/dec/23/fifa-trial-questions-2022-qatar-world-cup","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/dec/23/fifa-trial-questions-2022-qatar-world-cup","fields":{"headline":"Fifa trial leaves questions over 2022 Qatar World Cup","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"The most stunning and tantalising revelations of the Fifa trial in Brooklyn, New York, had nothing much to do with the two of the three defendants finally hit with guilty verdicts on Friday. They were comparative small fry among football’s financial feeding sharks. Gripping as it turned out to have live, lurid evidence presented of endemic bribery on the sale of television rights for South American tournaments, that wretched, racketeering reality had already been established from the guilty pleas of 23 other football officials from the Americas to a medley of corruption charges. Yet almost as an aside, one defendant revealed in his evidence that key South American Fifa barons received bribes for voting to send the 2022 World Cup to Qatar. These allegations have been left hanging, prompting only further questions, as the defendants José Maria Marin and Juan Ángel Napout, found guilty of bribe-taking on South American TV deals, wait to receive their sentences and the jury continues to deliberate on the third defendant, Manuel Burga. The claim about Qatar was said early in damning evidence given by Alejandro Burzaco, one of the sports rights company executives pinned by the US justice authorities into pleading guilty to bribing football officials and informing on what they did. The Argentinian’s evidence was key to convicting Marin, the former president of the Brazilian Football Federation (CBF), and Napout, the Paraguayan former president of the South American football confederation, Conmebol. They were found guilty of bribe-taking when selling TV rights for Copa América and Copa Libertadores tournaments, plus, in Marin’s case, the Copa do Brasil. But Burzaco also testified that one of the most powerful Fifa chiefs of all, Julio Grondona, the Argentina FA president from 1979 until his death, while still in office, in 2014, was prodigiously corrupt. Burzaco said that while he was doling out the bribes in 2011 for the Copa América Grondona had told him he should have another $1m, which was heading for the then CBF president, Ricardo Teixeira. Grondona was a Fifa executive committee member for 26 years and effectively a deputy to Sepp Blatter in his latter years as world football’s president. According to Burzaco, the Argentinian said that Teixeira “owed him”. This was because “Grondona voted for Qatar to host the 2022 World Cup”. Burzaco said he travelled to the vote in Zurich in December 2010 with Grondona, Teixeira and the Paraguayan Nicolás Leoz, the Conmebol president for 27 years, and it was “not a private thing” that they were all voting for Qatar. He testified that during the early rounds of voting Grondona and Teixeira had berated Leoz, saying: “What the hell are you doing? Are you the one not voting for Qatar?” Leoz did then vote for Qatar, according to Burzaco. He also said Grondona was enraged by adverse media reports and that he had seen his compatriot demand that Qatari officials pay him $80m or write a letter certifying that they never paid him bribes. The multibillion-dollar stadium construction work mandated by that 2010 vote continues in Qatar, the tiny, mega-wealthy Gulf emirate currently blockaded by its neighbours in an almighty political confrontation. Qatar’s official bid team have always denied any bribery and none was found in the investigations by the former Fifa ethics committee chairman and US prosecutor, Michael Garcia. In Brooklyn, for all the visceral testimony heard against the three in the dock, their trial partly provided a daily reminder of the ones who have got away so far or declined to appear. Marin was the CBF president for three years, having taken over in March 2012 from Teixeira, who is charged with much longer-prevailing and mountainous bribe-taking. The former son-in-law of João Havelange, the corrupt Brazilian Fifa president from 1974-1998, Teixeira, who clung to the gilded office of CBF president for a much-resented 23 years, has always denied wrongdoing and remains in his country with no intention of facing US justice. Napout was the Conmebol president for one year, from August 2014 until his arrest in Zurich in December 2015. He succeeded Eugenio Figueredo, the Uruguayan who pleaded guilty then, but the meatier target, even at 89, remains Leoz. He ruled into the era of multiplying media millions for televised football and is accused of in effect pioneering this culture of kickbacks for every rights sale. A power-wielding member of the Fifa executive committee alongside Grondona and Teixeira throughout Blatter’s years, Leoz also denies the charges and is expected to appeal against last month’s decision by a Paraguayan court to grant extradition to the US. Burga, the former president of the Peru FA about whom the Brooklyn jury is taking longer to reach a verdict, was never a major Fifa figure and may forever now be known mostly for his alleged throat-slicing gesture to Burzaco in court, which his lawyer claimed was just “itching his neck”. The other big beast who remains out of reach despite having his name on the criminal indictment is Jack Warner, president of the Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Football Associations (Concacaf) for 21 years until 2011. Blatter, whose presidency fell after the dawn raids in Zurich in May 2015, has always raged at the US investigation, rightly arguing that it uncovered corruption largely in the US and the Americas, yet labelled Fifa as the criminal enterprise. Warner is charged with one of the few alleged crimes involving Fifa business, that he took a $10m bribe to vote for South Africa to host the 2010 World Cup. He denies that, as do the South Africa bid team and government, and he remains at home in Trinidad, fighting the country’s extradition law. As a result that dreadful allegation remains unresolved, as does this new accusation, that Leoz, Teixeira and Grondona were paid bribes, from somebody, to vote for Qatar. The key question is whether this evidence, offered up almost in passing in a Brooklyn courtroom, has any solid basis or is just an unprovable secondhand anecdote about a Fifa baron no longer alive to account for himself. And whether the FBI, which has now notched up two criminal convictions to add to 23 guilty pleas, continues to investigate."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/commentisfree/2017/dec/23/madrid-barcelona-catalonia-nationalists-spanish-government-trust-fate","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-23T21:00:32Z","webTitle":"Madrid and Barcelona need to talk.

That’s not on the cards","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"When Spain’s prime minister Mariano Rajoy decided to impose direct rule over Catalonia in October, and call a snap election to replace its regional parliament – after it had declared independence from Spain – he thought he was “restoring normality” to Catalan politics and putting an end to the conflict. Instead, the election has shown that conflict is the new normal. The pro-independence parties have again secured an absolute majority, and they vow to restore the same government Rajoy dismissed two months ago. But far from a deja vu, this will be something never seen before, for the likely president of that government, Carles Puigdemont, is in self-imposed exile in Belgium, some of his ministers are in jail in Spain, and all are accused by the supreme court of rebellion, a charge that could result in up to 30 years in prison. Rajoy’s gamble has certainly backfired. It could be argued that he didn’t have much choice, once the Catalan parliament had broken the law. And the move did defuse the declaration of independence. But the idea that it would permanently resolve the crisis was predicated on an assumption that is very popular in Spain but is wrong: that there is a “hidden pro-Spain majority” in Catalonia, which has never been allowed to express itself at the polls, cowed by the prevailing nationalist atmosphere. If only – the argument went – there could be an election with the central government in control instead of the nationalist-led one, a different Catalonia would emerge. But the result of last week’s election, with a record turnout of almost 82%, shows there are no more “hidden votes” for Spain. There’s no clear pro-Spain majority, and there is no majority for independence either. Catalonia is what it is, take it or leave it – and I don’t mean either literally. So, what now? The obvious course of action would be a dialogue, but that is still not on the cards. Puigdemont would not settle for anything less than independence or a legally binding referendum. Rajoy says the constitution does not allow it, which is true. Changing the constitution, if there were the will to do so, is a daunting task. The majorities that are needed – including an all-Spain referendum on the reform – make it almost impossible. Only a consensus among all the parties, like the one that made possible the constitution itself, could work the miracle. But not even at Christmas does that seem likely. For now, we’re left with what has been the main driver of this conflict for five years: fate. Both sides seem to put all their trust in theirs. Puigdemont may have won a majority, but he knows he must return to Catalonia to be pronounced president, and then he will be arrested and sent to jail. He certainly hopes the ensuing international scandal will help him out. He shouldn’t count on that. Half his government has already been jailed without the international community uttering a whisper. Even in Catalonia the reaction has been surprisingly muted. The main asset of the Catalan movement has always been its ability to mobilise hundreds of thousands of supporters on the streets. Now the quiet imposition of direct rule has shown that to be a paper tiger, at least for now. Puigdemont can only hope to resist, but not to win. As for Rajoy, he may stick to the orthodoxy of the law and hope things will change, his trademark strategy. To be fair, it has worked for him many times. But in this case, it means worsening the surreal situation in Catalan politics. In the absence of a political initiative, the judges will continue to treat the nationalist movement as a “rebellion against the state”, an obvious exaggeration. This will inevitably result in the jailing of the Catalonia government, many of its MPs and perhaps dozens of other leaders, who will be given decades-long prison terms. Even Europe, which has remained unquestionably on Rajoy’s side, may begin to ask questions. But then, if both sides have chosen to let fate decide, they will have to live with its verdict. If we are to trust the centuries-old literature on the subject, fate rarely makes good decisions.

Colliver was jailed for perverting the course of justice after offering a friend £2,500 to claim that he crashed Colliver’s pick-up truck into a wall, when it was Colliver, who had twice the legal limit of alcohol in his bloodstream, who was behind the wheel. He was released in October last year after serving two months of his 10-month sentence, saying he intended to “rebuild my life and my career if I’m given the chance”. With the support of Micky Hammond and Jedd O’Keeffe, Colliver has worked his way back onto the northern circuit. Sam Spinner, who was also O’Keeffe’s first winner at the highest level over jumps, now offers both jockey and trainer a chance to compete at the pinnacle of the sport, as he is now the clear favourite with most bookmakers for the Stayers’ Hurdle at the Cheltenham Festival. Sam Spinner ran away with a handicap hurdle at Haydock Park in November, and took the step up to this company in his stride. A habitual front-runner, he was going easily on the lead from the off and one by one, his rivals tried and failed to challenge for the lead. After Unowhatimeanharry, the 6-4 favourite, started to drop away following a mistake two out, it was L’Ami Serge who moved smoothly into a position to challenge. He is well-known for finding very little off the bridle, however, and Colliver had more than enough in reserve to kick on again approaching the final flight on the way to a two-and-three-quarter length success. Colliver said that he was in a daze after the race and the trophy presentation was delayed for several minutes as the word went out to recall him from the weighing room. “I was just about in the shower, which is why I’ve not got the colours on,” Colliver said. “He raced a bit lazily and waited for something to come to him, and every time something did, he kept kicking on. I rode him first time in a bumper at Catterick and look where we are now. Each time I ride him he gets better and better. “I regret everything that happened and the day I went to court I thought that was me as a jockey over and done with. I’d almost mentally prepared myself for that. I was lucky enough that my boss Micky Hammond stood by me and the staff and other trainers in Middleham. “This is just a dream, to win a Grade One on my first trip down to Ascot, but the jockey can only do so much and you can’t do it without the horses.” Lizzie Kelly, who will ride the 20-1 chance Tea For Two in the King George on Boxing Day, also rode her first winner here as One Of Us made all the running in the opening handicap hurdle. Her next ride will be in the showpiece of the Christmas programme, aboard a horse that finished within four lengths of Thistlecrack in last year’s King George and took the Kauto Star Novice Chase over the same course and distance in December 2015. “We’re pleased with him at home, he seems well and happy, and we’re going with a pretty live chance,” Kelly said. “I know he’s long in the betting, but he always is. “Some of his best form is at Kempton. We’re up against really smart superstars, the front-page horses, but we’ve won there before and there’s no reason why he can’t win again.” Nicky Henderson, whose Might Bite is expected to start favourite for the King George, also went into the brief Christmas break in winning form after Gold Present took the Lavazza Silver Cup Handicap Chase."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2017/dec/24/plan-collect-data-excluded-pupils-lifelong-risk-stigma","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-24T00:04:36Z","webTitle":"Plan to collect data on excluded pupils could put them at ‘lifelong risk’ of stigma","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/dec/24/plan-collect-data-excluded-pupils-lifelong-risk-stigma","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/dec/24/plan-collect-data-excluded-pupils-lifelong-risk-stigma","fields":{"headline":"Plan to collect data on excluded pupils could put them at ‘lifelong risk’ of stigma","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"The privacy of vulnerable children who leave mainstream education could be put at risk by a plan to store more of their data, a coalition of charities, academics and teachers has warned. Sensitive reasons why a child may have left a school – such as physical or mental health issues, pregnancy or having committed a criminal offence – would be recorded under plans to expand a survey of those educated outside the mainstream school system. The plan has caused concern among some in the sector who warn that the expansion of the so-called “alternative provision” census from January could lead to sensitive details being collected without the knowledge of parents and pupils. The Royal Mencap Society, the Alliance for Inclusive Education and the young offenders mentoring charity Trailblazers are among more than 20 organisations to put their names to the Defend Digital Me campaign demanding a rethink. They say the information could be added to the national pupil database, which holds data on millions of pupils. They raise concerns that there are not enough safeguards to ensure that sensitive data does not end up being passed on to third parties and damaging the privacy of those it covers. Officials insist that more information needs to be collected to ensure the reasons for pupils being sent to “alternative provision” are understood. They say there is a robust approvals panel charged with guarding the data, and that there are no plans to share the new information. Teenage pregnancies would not be recorded as a matter of course, they say, but pregnancy could be selected as an option explaining a placement. However, in a letter to the Observer, the coalition write that the new survey would “put school children in England at lifelong risk”. “The government must pause, rethink, and put children’s best interests first,” the letter states. “The Department for Education will collect reasons why children age 2-18 move from mainstream school into alternative provision education. Those sensitive reasons include a mental or physical health need, pregnancy, and whether a child moved to a young offender institution. “These labels will be added to a child’s named record in the national pupil database, which now holds the confidential data of more than 23 million people without their knowledge or consent.” Campaigners point to an audit of the use of NHS data in 2014 uncovered “significant lapses” in protecting patient confidentiality. The letter comes amid increasing concerns about the number of children leaving the mainstream schools system, with both Ofsted chief Amanda Spielman and children’s commissioner Anne Longfield accusing schools of ridding themselves of difficult children to boost their results. A recent report by the Institute for Public Policy Research thinktank warned that official figures on the number of children who had been excluded were “the tip of the iceberg”, and that five times more were being educated in schools for excluded pupils than official data suggests. Figures from the Department for Education show 6,685 pupils were permanently excluded from schools in England in 2015-16, most of them in the run-up to their GCSEs. The coalition, which includes the Parents Union and Teenage Pregnancy Knowledge Exchange, warns that some data released to third parties from pupil databases since 2012 had been identifying. “New data protection law is in parliament, and while the government talk about giving children’s personal data special protections, and privacy by design, their actions do not,” the letter states. “We must see safeguards put in place to uphold children’s rights. “We appreciate the importance of understanding these children’s education, often ‘managed out’ from mainstream school to boost league table results. But this knowledge should not cost any child their confidentiality. “If the department cannot stop the distribution of identifying data for indirect purposes, and commit to the rights of the child, the government should not collect the data at all.” A spokesman for the Department for Education said: “The reasons for a pupil being placed into alternative provision can be wide ranging. It is important that we understand these different reasons so we can ensure that we have an education system that works for all. “The robust approvals panel and other controls are in place to ensure that this data, like all our data, is very safely guarded and only used in legal, secure and ethical ways.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/dec/23/everton-chelsea-premier-league-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-23T14:39:20Z","webTitle":"Everton frustrate Chelsea after Ashley Williams enjoys lucky escape","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/dec/23/everton-chelsea-premier-league-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/dec/23/everton-chelsea-premier-league-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Everton frustrate Chelsea after Ashley Williams enjoys lucky escape","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Antonio Conte shared a joke with Lisa, the dedicated host of the media room, as he politely asked for some sweets. That moment of brevity apart, the Chelsea manager was a model of frustration as he digested two points dropped and a performance that highlighted the champions’ over-reliance on the magic of Eden Hazard. Another sign of progress for Everton under Sam Allardyce was another afternoon of torment for the Chelsea manager. His team dominated at Goodison but were stifled by a well-drilled Everton defensive display with their two £30m summer signings, Jordan Pickford and Michael Keane, excelling. When the visitors did find a way through, a finishing touch and fortune deserted them. Hazard was a mesmerising presence but Álvaro Morata’s one-match suspension proved costly against a rearguard whose resilience and confidence has been restored under their new, unbeaten manager. “When you dominate possession, shoot 26 times, but only eight on target, hit the crossbar and a defender clears twice off the line, for sure you must be disappointed,” said Conte. “We deserved to win. “I consider Everton to be the best team in this league after the top six and we played with great personality and intensity, and with great concentration because they defended very deep. But if you want to win this game you must score and you must be more clinical.” His assessment brooked no argument and he departed with a request for a few more sweets. There were echoes of the recent Merseyside derby draw as Allardyce’s team were encamped deep in their own half against a fluent attacking unit and reliant on Dominic Calvert-Lewin turning water into wine up front. As at Anfield, they managed to frustrate the team dominant in possession. Conte’s body language also betrayed an annoyance with the movement and final ball his team. Hazard excepted. The Belgium international took the game to Everton, shouldering responsibility to lead the Chelsea line, but the supporting cast of Pedro and Willian struggled to exert the same influence and were withdrawn. Credit was due to a changed Everton defence and improved performances from Morgan Schneiderlin and Keane, the latter producing his best game for the club. Illness swept through the home squad before the game and sidelined Wayne Rooney. Ashley Williams and Mason Holgate dropped to the bench as Allardyce rotated with the festive schedule in mind. The two defenders have epitomised Everton’s recent recovery but their absence was not felt thanks to the contributions of Keane and Phil Jagielka, who made two goalline clearances in quick succession to deny Tiémoué Bakayoko and Willian from Chelsea’s first clear opening. The visitors’ best chance of the first half fell to Pedro when released by Bakayoko but Pickford tipped his rising drive over the crossbar. Everton’s hopes of alleviating the pressure centred on long balls up to Calvert-Lewin and a requirement on the young centre-forward to hold up play against three Chelsea defenders. It was a tall order. Change was necessary and Allardyce made a double substitution at the interval to match Chelsea’s 3-4-3 formation. Williams and Sandro Ramírez replaced Tom Davies and Aaron Lennon respectively. However, five minutes into the new system, Everton lost Idrissa Gueye to a hamstring injury that could sideline him for a fortnight. Gueye had impressed in the battle of the midfield shields with N’Golo Kanté and his departure was a blow to Everton’s resistance. Yet resist they did. Pickford enjoyed another impressive afternoon. The keeper saved well from Pedro, Hazard and Antonio Rüdiger as the visitors pressed for a breakthrough. When he was finally beaten it was by his own player, Williams, who met Victor Moses’s cross with a header that Morata would have been proud of. Fortunately for the Wales captain, his effort cannoned against the bar and clear. Everton almost stole victory in the 90th minute when Keane rose highest to meet Gylfi Sigurdsson’s corner but his header was a yard over. “We scrapped it out, there is no doubt about that,” Allardyce said. “The changes I made to try and get up the pitch more didn’t work as I would have liked but defensively I can’t knock the team in terms of the effort and commitment and organisation. Our defending is outstanding compared to when I arrived.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2017/dec/23/real-madrid-barcelona-la-liga-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-23T16:26:00Z","webTitle":"Barcelona rout Real Madrid to go 14 points clear of clásico rivals in La Liga","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/dec/23/real-madrid-barcelona-la-liga-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/dec/23/real-madrid-barcelona-la-liga-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Barcelona rout Real Madrid to go 14 points clear of clásico rivals in La Liga","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"At the beginning of the clásico, a huge banner was unfurled at the south end of the ground welcoming a “White Christmas”. At the end, it was the handful of Barcelona fans high in the opposite stand who celebrated. Way below, their players applauded back, marking a victory whose consequences will be profound: theirs will be happy holidays. Their coach, Ernesto Valverde, insisted that the league is not yet won and Real Madrid’s Zinedine Zidane said the same, but goals from Luis Suárez, Lionel Messi and Aleix Vidal carried the Catalans 14 points ahead of their biggest rivals. The last time these two teams met, back in August, Gerard Piqué admitted feeling inferior to Madrid. How quickly things change. Twenty-five games have passed since, Barcelona have lost none and by the close here the superiority was theirs, imposed almost by stealth, bit by bit until it was complete. “It’s a defeat that hurts,” Zidane said. “They were sunk [in August], people said; tomorrow, we’re the ones that are ‘sunk’. We accept that, that’s football. We’re pissed off but Madrid never surrender, no matter what. People can think the league is over but I don’t think so and I don’t think the opposition coach thinks so either.” With Valencia later losing 1-0 at home to Villarreal, Barça’s lead is up to nine points from Atlético Madrid, who had already lost, at Espanyol on Friday. The game at the Bernabéu ended with the ball in Real’s net; it had started with the ball in Barcelona’s when Cristiano Ronaldo’s header went in off the bar only for the linesman’s flag to be raised for offside. Then Ronaldo swung and missed by the penalty spot. Ten minutes had gone and with Mateo Kovacic a surprise inclusion detailed to prevent Sergio Busquets from bringing the ball out and Messi from finding time or space the visitors had barely had possession. “We struggled to overcome that pressure,” Valverde said, yet it also appeared they were in no hurry. They arrived with an 11-point lead over their hosts, after all, and as Valverde had warned: “It is when you think you’re on top that Madrid hit you.” Those fears were borne out: Thomas Vermaelen brought down Luka Modric as he broke through; Ronaldo shot against Sergi Roberto and another Ronaldo effort hit goalkeeper Marc-André ter Stegen’s foot. Karim Benzema then hit the post from Marcelo’s cross. For Barcelona, Paulinho had two good chances. Messi clipped a wonderful ball into the midfielder’s run and his excellent shot was pushed over by Keylor Navas after half an hour before the goalkeeper saved a near-post header. From the corner, Piqué’s header hit Dani Carvajal and Messi’s 45th-minute free-kick thudded against Ronaldo’s head. As they departed at half time, he held out a hand. When they reappeared, the visitors asserted themselves. Madrid appeared to take a step back, symbolised by Kovacic’s shift from Busquets to Messi, although Valverde suggested that was more a consequence of his side’s improvement than a conscious decision. Andrés Iniesta released Jordi Alba, but Luis Suárez’s shot was under-hit. A minute later Busquets turned near his own area. Stepping away from Toni Kroos, he found Ivan Rakitic. The space opened up in front of him, Kovacic heading out of his path to follow Messi, and Rakitic laid it to Sergi, who crossed for Suárez to score. Madrid were preparing a change, Gareth Bale and Marco Asensio standing at the side of the pitch, when Barcelona doubled the lead. Messi put Suárez clear, Navas saved the first shot but Messi collected the rebound and returned it to Suárez, whose second effort came off the post to Paulinho. From his header Carvajal made a neat one-handed save. Paulinho bundled the ball over the line, but the referee blew, pulled out a red card and pointed to the spot, from where Messi thumped in the penalty. Carvajal walked, head down and 10 minutes later, Bale and Asensio were introduced, a last attempt to break Catalan control. Messi drew another save from Navas, who also stopped Nélson Semedo. Twice more Navas denied Messi but Madrid had not given up. Ter Stegen made a fantastic save from Bale, then blocked a Sergio Ramos effort. There was still time, but it was Barcelona who used it. Messi evaded Marcelo and crossed for Vidal to score. He had been on the pitch less than a minute. It was over. The clásico, and maybe the league, too."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jan/29/fords-trial-minibus-ride-sharing-scheme-to-launch-in-london","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-29T18:55:11Z","webTitle":"Your Chariot awaits: shuttle bus service gets green light in London","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jan/29/fords-trial-minibus-ride-sharing-scheme-to-launch-in-london","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jan/29/fords-trial-minibus-ride-sharing-scheme-to-launch-in-london","fields":{"headline":"Your Chariot awaits: shuttle bus service gets green light in London","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"An experimental shuttle bus service operated by Ford has been approved by London’s transport authorities. The vehicle manufacturer’s Chariot service, which has started in five US cities, will run four set routes and pick up passengers who pre-book via its app. Passengers will pay a premium (£2.40) over normal bus fares (£1.50), and get a guaranteed seat on a Ford Transit minibus for their money. The move by Ford is one of a series by vehicle manufacturers to provide shared mobility services as the traditional industry model is threatened by declining car ownership among younger people and city dwellers. Ford welcomed the decision by Transport for London to grant a permit for its “microtransit” scheme. Ford said the Chariot commuter ride-share service would complement London’s existing public transport system “by offering in-app ride booking for first-and last-mile commuting solutions, and the potential to reach underserved areas”. It will announce further details of the scheme later this week. A TfL spokesperson said: “After a thorough licensing process, we have issued Chariot with a licence to operate their service on four routes as a trial basis. This service has the potential to provide useful transport links in the areas they will serve, largely outside central London, and we will carefully monitor this trial.” Four routes have been approved for up to a year, generally south of the Thames and serving areas without tube stations such as Battersea. Two routes were declined following comments from local residents and concerns about safety and existing services. The Chariot service sits somewhere between ride-sharing services and local buses. It will be pre-bookable only, and can only pick up its passengers at set stops along the designated routes. It will be a commercial service and not part of TfL’s system, or accept Oyster. TfL has signalled it wants to work with technology companies on innovative schemes that could improve transport links in London, despite turning down Uber’s licence renewal. Experimental bus services have been launched by CityMapper, while BMW has brought its Drive Now car sharing scheme to parts of the capital. Ford operates Chariot in San Francisco, New York, Austin, Seattle and recently launched in Columbus, Ohio."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/30/momentum-sedgefield-tony-blair-labour","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-30T09:46:39Z","webTitle":"There’s no Momentum march on Blair’s old seat.

Don’t believe the spin","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Hard left thugs are on the march. Corbynistas and Momentum activists are taking over the Labour party. It’s a move reminiscent of Putin, or Stalin, or possibly even Hitler. We should all be worried. At least that’s what you’d believe if you listened to the breathless reporting over the last few months. Among others, my old home constituency of Sedgefield in County Durham has found itself the subject of reports in the Times and the Mail that the constituency Labour party has been targeted by hard-left Momentum thugs, with 11 out of the 12 seats on the executive committee changing hands at its annual meeting on 28 July. Normally an AGM in a safe north-east seat would be too humdrum and niche to even make the local news, but as Tony Blair’s old seat, Sedgefield holds a certain amount of symbolic importance. If even the home of Blair can be swept by the hard left, the moderates are really in trouble. The thing is, there’s absolutely no evidence of any of the things that have been claimed. Momentum haven’t staged a takeover – nobody even knows about a Momentum group active in the constituency. The new CLP executive are, for the most part, long-standing party members from a broad range of the political spectrum, including some town councillors. One source for the Mail and Times stories is John Burton, who was Tony Blair’s election agent and his representative in the constituency for many years, as well as being one of the “famous five” who originally got Blair selected as Sedgefield’s MP. His involvement gives legs to the Corbynites v Blairites narrative, but even other Famous Five alumni seem less than keen to get involved. Phil Wilson, who succeeded Blair as MP in 2007 and has held the seat for Labour ever since, did not wish to comment on the story at all. The old CLP chair, Paul Trippett, another Famous Five member who works as Wilson’s office manager, simply said he thought this was “a non-story”. It was a struggle to find anyone who thought there was substance to this. Arun Chandran, a local town councillor who recently left Labour to stand as an independent, who describes himself as “to the right” of the party with a history of facing off against Militant in the 1980s, told me “if these people are hard left then I’m Santa Claus”. The reasons underlying the changes seem to be much more prosaic and rooted in local issues. John Clare, a long-standing party member and town and county councillor, told me “in the run-up to the 1997 election victory, the CLP was dynamic, united and full of activists. Lately, however, by any measure it had run out of steam, and I believe most people who turned up to vote for change primarily wanted to restore energy and activity into the CLP.” One thing that was repeatedly mentioned is a now infamous letter that Wilson sent out in the run-up to last year’s general election, in which he said he was “for Labour, not for Corbyn”. Even party members who were themselves sceptical of Corbyn felt rather put out by this. One member said they thought the “use of Labour party money to attack the leader” was unacceptable. Others were more conciliatory, believing that Wilson simply “panicked” as a result of the low poll numbers. With the CLP and the MP’s office being effectively run by the same people, there was a sense that the narrow concentration of power led to a foolish decision which “embarrassed the Labour party”. This, rather than some nefarious Trotskyite agenda, is a much more plausible explanation for the shift in sentiment against the old guard. Wilson himself may feel somewhat embattled by the way his national party is going, but while his feelings on Corbyn may put him at odds with some new members, few people seem to think he’s a bad MP as such. He was a strong advocate of getting the Hitachi Rail Europe manufacturing plant to the region, which opened in 2015. His voting record is solid on benefits and other issues many Corbyn supporters care about, and while he disagrees with the leadership’s stance on Europe, he’s no serial rebel. He has also recently called for a bill to introduce measures to make it easier to track absentee landlords to deal with the problems of abandoned and boarded-up properties. Nobody I talked to was interested in deselecting Wilson, who, like many Labour MPs, increased his majority in the last election. Rather, the new committee is focused on increasing engagement and supporting the manifesto, something they seem to have actually done fairly well. John Clare told me “in any other situation, the [new] officers would be being greatly praised for their hard work and successes, and it is a tragedy that, instead, they have been pilloried in the media.” So where did all this “hard left” nonsense come from? Internal arguments between members of local political parties happen all the time, and it’s a ridiculous stretch to take a change in leadership, no matter how acrimonious, and extrapolate out to imply a “hard left plot”. The idea that people in the north-east might need an email from outside activists to get irate about the Labour party is almost insulting – we can create our own factional disputes all by ourselves, thanks! As with many other issues, it seems as if our irresponsible rightwing press has decided that the story exists and then conducted “reporting” only far enough to confirm what they want to say anyway. It’s as blatant and biased as advertisers who conduct surveys which surprisingly find out that their brand of hair conditioner or cheese sauce really is the best. “Momentum thugs” exist as a matter of faith, and the usual suspects in the press know that truth matters far less than repetition. There is a case to be made that the Corbyn shakeup is permeating down to the lower levels of the Labour party, but very little evidence that this is a top-down plot. Frankly, anyone who’s held a political position for more than a decade should not be surprised when their time runs out, let alone those who have held posts for 30 years. Such a reckoning has been coming to local politics for a while, and this is by no means exclusive to Sedgefield, or Haringey, or any of the other local areas supposedly under attack by the “hard left”. Something is happening in local politics, and if all you write about is the sour grapes of losers blaming the communists, you’re going to miss what it is. • Phil McDuff writes on economics and social policy"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/29/tories-abyss-theresa-may-leadership-contest","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-29T17:29:01Z","webTitle":"The Tories are ready to leap into the abyss to get rid of Theresa May | Katy Balls","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/29/tories-abyss-theresa-may-leadership-contest","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/29/tories-abyss-theresa-may-leadership-contest","fields":{"headline":"The Tories are ready to leap into the abyss to get rid of Theresa May","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"“What I’d say to all my colleagues is the Conservative family – left, right and centre, because we’re a broad church – needs to come together in a spirit of mutual respect.” This is the kind of plea that is normally delivered to MPs behind closed doors. But in a sign of the dire state that the Tory party is in, David Lidington – Theresa May’s de facto deputy – was reduced to issuing it this weekend from the set of The Andrew Marr Show. Lidington’s big pitch to stick together is that things could be worse. His list of lukewarm reasons to be cheerful include neck-and-neck polling with Labour and better-than-expected growth forecasts. This call for calm comes after a week of government unravelling that has seen Theresa May go from “weak but stable” to “weak and on her final warning”. Instead of providing calm, the pause in the Brexit negotiations exposed May’s lack of domestic agenda and proved the final straw for many Conservatives. Ambitious MPs who returned from the Christmas break with new year optimism feel ignored by No 10 and are losing patience with a prime minister who seems constitutionally incapable of getting on to the front foot. Concluding that the Maybot 2018 reboot hasn’t solved the problems that dogged the 2017 edition, grumpy Tories have taken to Twitter with anti-May hashtags: #dulldulldull. Others have opted for the more traditional medium of print, with Johnny Mercer warning it’s time to prepare for Prime Minister Corbyn unless we “get our shit together”. The headlines couldn’t get much worse and there are reports that the number of letters sent to the 1922 Committee chairman, Graham Brady, is perilously close to the magic number required for a confidence vote. It’s a sorry state of affairs for a party of government in the midst of the most important negotiations in decades. Yet it’s still not clear that anything has actually changed when it comes to May’s position. The same factors that kept her in place in the immediate aftermath of the election disaster remain: there’s no obvious successor, let alone an agreed one. This means that any future leadership contest will most likely be unpredictable, vicious and potentially ruinous for the party. Speak to a Conservative politician and they freely admit this – yet still their mind wanders. The calculation being made: could the alternative really be worse than the current state of drift? There are many reasons to conclude that it would be. First, it seems near impossible to pick a caretaker prime minister. Even if the cabinet rallied around Jeremy Hunt – the health secretary who has managed to keep remainers and Brexiteers on side – it’s likely a leave candidate, such as Priti Patel, would announce their candidacy in the name of true Brexit. This would lead to more candidates and before you’d know it the playing field would be so wide you couldn’t fit them all in one TV studio. “If Theresa May can be prime minister, it does lower the standard,” remarks one Tory MP. Voters would see a leadership contest at this point as an act of profound, and possibly unforgivable, self-indulgence. Despite this, many Conservatives think it’s the only chance they have to turn the negotiations around. But even if a true Brexiteer were to lead the Conservative party – and the membership would lean to a Brexit candidate in any contest – there are some things no amount of charisma can solve. The party would still have no majority and would still require the support of the DUP to govern. It’s also not clear that the type of Brexit favoured by Jacob Rees-Mogg could get through parliament. But changing leader, even with all the risks that it entails, is becoming more and more attractive to Tory MPs. As each day passes, they wonder whether they could actually make it to 2022 with May as their leader. While they may have agreed in theory to support her until the negotiations are over, the day-to-day reality is worse than most anticipated. Everything hangs in the balance. Theresa May must prove she can lead; the government needs to start “fucking doing something”, one grumpy MP explains. A look at this week’s grid suggests this isn’t about to happen. Unless it does soon, expect the number of MPs willing to take a chance on the unknown to swell to the 48 required to trigger a no-confidence vote. The longer Theresa May drifts, the more chance there is that Conservatives will conclude that things couldn’t be worse. • Katy Balls is the Spectator’s political correspondent"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"science/2018/jan/29/vaping-may-raise-cancer-and-heart-disease-risk-study-suggests","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-29T17:09:17Z","webTitle":"Vaping may raise cancer and heart disease risk, study suggests","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/jan/29/vaping-may-raise-cancer-and-heart-disease-risk-study-suggests","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2018/jan/29/vaping-may-raise-cancer-and-heart-disease-risk-study-suggests","fields":{"headline":"Vaping may raise cancer and heart disease risk, study suggests","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Vaping may raise the risk of certain cancers and heart disease, according to a team of scientists who studied the effects of e-cigarette smoke on healthy mice and human cells. Researchers found evidence that nicotine inhaled from e-cigarettes could be converted into chemicals that damage DNA in the heart, lungs and bladder, and dampen down the body’s genetic repair mechanisms. Moon-shong Tang, professor of environmental medicine at New York University, said the DNA changes were similar to those linked to secondhand smoke, but added that more work was needed to see whether vaping really did increase cancer rates. The researchers have now launched long-term experiments to look at the development of tumours in mice exposed to vapour from e-cigarettes, but Tang does not expect to have answers any time soon. “The results may take years to come in because cancer is such a slow process,” he said. While some researchers said the work was important, others all but dismissed it as irrelevant to humans. The mice were exposed to high levels of e-cigarette smoke and the effects may be very different in people who inhale nicotine from vaping, critics caution. “This study shows nothing at all about the dangers of vaping,” said Peter Hajek, director of the Tobacco Dependence Research Unit at Queen Mary University of London. “It doesn’t show that vaping causes cancer.” “This is one in a long line of false alarms which may be putting people off the switch from smoking to vaping which would undoubtedly be of great benefit to them,” he added. “The best current estimate is that vaping poses, at worst, some 5% of risks of smoking.” Tobacco smoke contains thousands of chemicals and at least 70 are known either to cause or drive cancer in the body. The vapour from e-cigarettes contains far fewer toxic chemicals, with most of the smoke containing only nicotine, the addictive substance that gives users their hit. Tang exposed mice to e-cigarette smoke for three hours a day, five days a week for three months. The amount of nicotine in the vapour was 10 milligrams per millilitre, making it as concentrated as the e-cigarette smoke that humans inhale. This amounted to what Hajek called “extremely large doses of nicotine.” At the end of the three months, Tang found DNA damage in the hearts, lungs and bladders of mice exposed to the vapours that was not evident in a control group of animals that breathed filtered air. Natural DNA repair mechanisms were also suppressed in the mice exposed to the smoke. Tang went on to look at human lung and bladder cells and found that exposing the cells to nicotine and its breakdown products made the cells turn into tumour tissue more easily. Details of the study are reported in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Last week a major US report into the health effects of e-cigarettes found that vaping might be useful to help people quit smoking. The report found vaping was likely to be less harmful than conventional cigarettes. Jasmine Just at Cancer Research UK said: “The evidence so far shows that e-cigarettes are far less harmful than smoking. Research like this is important, but this lab study only looked at the effects of e-cigarette smoke on cells and on mice, which means it’s not possible to draw any conclusions from this about how e-cigarettes might affect people in real life. “Up to two-thirds of long term smokers will die because of their addiction, but e-cigarettes don’t contain tobacco. Instead they contain nicotine, which is what keeps people addicted, but is not responsible for the major health harms from smoking. “Research in people has shown that those who make a complete switch from smoking tobacco to e-cigarettes can significantly reduce their exposure to key harmful chemicals in tobacco smoke.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/jan/30/support-children-foster-carers-agency-councils","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-30T12:00:18Z","webTitle":"‘Support us and children will benefit’: Foster carers on how their role has changed","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jan/30/support-children-foster-carers-agency-councils","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/jan/30/support-children-foster-carers-agency-councils","fields":{"headline":"‘Support us and children will benefit’: Foster carers on how their role has changed","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"‘The amount carers earn when starting out with the council is below minimum wage’ - Jane, 40 I wanted a change and to foster in my local area and community. Fostering with a private agency means the children you care for can come from anywhere. That makes continuity difficult when they have to leave the ties they have made in the area. With the agency it was around £700 for a mother and baby and £450-500 for teenagers. Normally with the council it’s about £400 for a mother and baby. I’ve only been with Leicestershire for a few months but now they are telling me that my pay might go down, which would mean a difference of about £350 a week. The amount carers earn when starting out with the council is around £136. That’s below minimum wage. It’s diabolical. You get more support with a private agency and out-of-hours help is more efficient but I want to remain in the area. Local dentists and schools are important for the kids and give them the stability they need. Councils can offer free school dinners and transport but they could save more money by cutting back on the amount they pay out to agencies. I’d like to stay with the council but I may end up moving back to an agency if the pay scales change. Jane, 40, transferred to Leicestershire county council from private agency Fostering Solutions after six years when the council offered to match the agency pay ‘Foster carers should be supported and paid a national, flat rate’ – Married couple John and Amanda All independent fostering agencies should be not-for-profit organisations. At the moment they charge excessive fees and make huge profits for their owners. We’ve been with the council for two years and have experience in emergency, respite and long-term fostering. Being a foster carer is all about the children. It’s about making them happy, safe, making sure they are medically well and part of a loving family. Whether a foster carer works for a local authority or an agency the problems are the same. They should be supported and we should have a national flat rate regardless of who you work for. I don’t think we necessarily need to put more money into fostering but we could be more efficient with our current resources. Provide a professional base and you’ll attract more people and the children will benefit the most. We should start with the children and end with the children. Everything else is neither here nor there.” John and his wife Amanda were with private agency Clifford House Fostering for three years where they earned £300-350 a week. When they heard it had been taken over by venture capital group Sovereign Capital, they joined Worcestershire county council. Here, a level one carer is paid around £100 per week and a level two carer £200. ‘Now I’m with an agency I get much better personal support’ – Claire, 60 I had short-term, emergency and out-of-hours foster placements but moved [from the council] because I didn’t feel like I was getting enough support. When I was with Hackney council the social workers changed quite a lot. I’d ring them and there wouldn’t be anyone there or they wouldn’t know who your kids are. Now I’m with an agency I get much better personal support. We have a social worker visiting every four weeks, there’s 24/7 help on the phone and the kids get to go on more trips. “Hackney paid £250-300 a week for a kid aged between 0-18, and with Nexus it’s £400. You might get paid more at an agency but you don’t get as much help with Christmas, birthdays and holidays. In Hackney they would pay around £150 for Christmas and birthdays but at the agency it’s only £40 and £10. Fostering is hard work but it’s the best job – just to see a small change in a kid is great. My birth children are amazing and I think fostering has played a big part in that. It’s a commitment and you need a big support network to help with the child in placement. With Nexus I feel like they listen and treat carers like partners. I’d never go back to a council.” Claire was a foster carer for Hackney council in east London for 10 years. She joined Nexus Fostering in 2011. ‘When we worked with local authorities there were some poor working practices’ - Sarah After I became pregnant with my youngest child we took a break from fostering. When we returned six years ago we decided it was time for an independent agency. At the moment we receive between £53-67 a day for the children in our care. The agency acts as another voice to speak up for the needs and wishes of the child as well as ensuring our well being as foster carers. When we worked with local authorities we experienced some poor working practices where there was no consideration for the children or their carers. Also the changeover of social workers with local authorities wasn’t good for the children. At least the agency is consistent. It is a real privilege to be able to care for children who cannot be at home for any reason. Being able to see children grow in every aspect of their development under your careful nurturing is a real gift. It however has a lot of challenges such as accessing the resources and support needed; working in a task oriented culture; and knowing that you are considered to be a fellow professional.” Sarah and her husband have over 30 years of experience as foster carers. They fostered with three local authorities in London before joining adoption and fostering charity, Tact six years ago. ‘When I was with the council, a lot of the support went’ - Stephen, 48 I decided to transfer to an agency, not just because of the money, although the cuts were making it increasingly difficult to provide a good standard of care for the child I look after. It was the whole package of care and support that was being cut. Fostering is not just a 24/7 job, you sacrifice your whole lifestyle. You never have a break from it. But we do it because we want to make a difference to a child’s life. I did a lot of research. I was really impressed that Foster Care Associates (FCA) focus on supporting, matching and keeping children in their placements. A lot of local authorities are so stretched that they just want the child placed as quickly as possible. I have already noticed a difference and feel much more supported. When I was with the council, a lot of the support went - I felt down by them, but at FCA I get a lot of phone and email support and there are regular events with other foster carers. I feel they care about me and the children I look after.” Stephen, 48 fostered with West Yorkshire council for over a decade. After the council made large cuts to the allowances paid for each child a week and only paid 50% fees for second and third children. He moved to Foster Care Associates, one of the biggest private sector fostering agencies in December. In addition to competitive fees and allowances, FCA pays a £500 a year loyalty bonus.

The toll of 197 in 2017 – which has risen fourfold since it was first compiled in 2002 – underscores the violence on the frontiers of a global economy driven by expansion and consumption. “The situation remains critical. Until communities are genuinely included in decisions around the use of their land and natural resources, those who speak out will continue to face harassment, imprisonment and the threat of murder,” said Ben Leather, senior campaigner for Global Witness. But there was a glimmer of hope that after four consecutive increases, the number of deaths has flattened off, amid growing global awareness of the crisis and a renewed push for multinational companies to take more responsibility and for governments to tackle impunity. Most of the killings occurred in remote forest areas of developing countries, particularly in Latin America where the abundance of resources is often in inverse proportion to the authority of the law or environmental regulation. Extractive industries were one of the deadliest drivers of violence, according to the figures, which were shared exclusively with the Guardian in an ongoing collaboration with Global Witness to name every victim. Mining conflicts accounted for 36 killings, several of them linked to booming global demand for construction materials. In India, three members of the Yadav family: Niranjan, Uday and Vimlesh, were murdered last May as they tried to prevent the extraction of sand from a riverbank by their village of Jatpura. In Turkey, a retired couple, Ali and Aysin Büyüknohutçu, were gunned down in their home after they won a legal battle to close a marble quarry that supplied blocks for upscale hotels and municipal monuments. The hunger for minerals was also blamed for turning the Andean nations into a “war zone” with high-profile conflicts between indigenous groups and the owners of Las Bambas copper mine in Peru and El Cerrejón coal mine in Colombia [see footnote]. Agribusiness was the biggest driver of violence as supermarket demand for soy, palm oil, sugarcane and beef provided a financial incentive for plantations and ranches to push deeper into indigenous territory and other communal land. With many of the tensions focussed in the Amazon, Brazil – with 46 killings – was once again the deadliest country for defenders. Relative to size, however, smaller Amazonian neighbours were more dangerous. Colombia suffered 32 deaths, largely due to an uptick of land conflicts and assassinations in the wake of the 2015 peace deal, which left a power vacuum in regions previously operated by Farc guerrillas. Among the most prominent victims was Efigenia Vásquez, a radio and video journalist from the Kokonuko community who was shot during a protest “to liberate Mother Earth”. Peru witnessed one the worst massacres of the year in September when six farmers were killed by a criminal gang who wanted to acquire their land cheaply and sell it at a hefty profit to palm oil businesses. Gangs and governments were largely responsible for the bloodshed in the second and fourth countries on the list: Mexico with 15 killings (a more than fivefold rise over the previous year), and the Philippines, which – with 41 deaths – was once again the most murderous country for defenders in Asia. A broader crackdown by the country’s president, Rodrigo Duterte, was a key factor. When his soldiers massacred eight Lumad in Lake Sebu on 3 December, the government claimed they died in a firefight with rebels, but fellow activists insisted they were killed for opposing a coal mine and coffee plantation on their ancestral land. In Africa, the greatest threat came from poachers and the illegal wildlife trade, particularly in the Democratic Republic of Congo where four rangers and a porter were ambushed and killed in July. But the highest profile victim last year of the poaching conflict was Wayne Lotter, an influential conservationist who was murdered in Tanzania after receiving death threats. Global Witness believe many more murders go unreported. Defenders are also being beaten, criminalised, threatened or harassed. In a recent example, Ecuadorean forest activist Patricia Gualinga reported last month that attackers had thrown rocks through her windows and yelled death threats at her. This is common. The EU-funded Environmental Justice Atlas has identified more than 2,335 cases of tension over water, territory, pollution or extractive industries, and researchers say the number and intensity are growing. Justice is rare. The assassins are often hired by businessmen or politicians and usually go unpunished. Defenders, who tend to be from poor or indigenous communities, are criminalised and targeted by police or corporate security guards. When they are killed, their families have little recourse to justice or media exposure. But there are patches of progress. Some countries saw falls, notably Honduras and Nicaragua, though activists remain in a vulnerable situation. Civil society groups and international institutions are also increasingly mobilising behind environmental rights. Last month, 116 organisations in the Philippines launched a petition declaring: “It is not a crime to defend the environment.” Campaigners for indigenous communities have taken their struggle to global climate talks and the United Nations. Some international institutions are willing to listen. Following criticism for having backed the Honduran hydro project linked to the murder of activist Berta Cáceres, the Dutch Development Bank (FMO) has broken ground by declaring the safety of human rights defenders to be a key factor in future investment decisions. “The time has come for more investors to step up and take measures which guarantee that their money isn’t fuelling attacks against activists,” said Leather. The UN special rapporteur on human rights and the environment, John Knox, urged governments to address the culture of impunity and said the media had an important role in boosting transparency. “Environmentalists have been at risk for many years, but the full extent of the global crisis has only become clear as a result of the work of Global Witness and the Guardian to identify every environmental defender killed because of their work,” Knox said. “As a result, it’s possible to see more clearly the underlying causes and risk factors, including the failures of governments to protect these defenders from threats and violence. I think that there are some signs that governments are starting to respond to the increasing international attention to these cases, but much more needs to be done.” • This article was amended on 27 February 2018. An earlier version referred to “the Andes” where “Andean nations” was meant. After publication, Cerrejón contacted the Guardian to say that the location of its mine is “in no way a war zone as described in the article”. The company added: “We would like to stress that there is no relationship at all between Cerrejon’s activities and the death of any activist, and that Cerrejón implements leading international social and human rights standards.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2018/feb/16/lets-move-to-chipping-campden-gloucestershire-tom-dyckhoff","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-16T16:30:51Z","webTitle":"Let’s move to Chipping Campden, Gloucestershire","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/feb/16/lets-move-to-chipping-campden-gloucestershire-tom-dyckhoff","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2018/feb/16/lets-move-to-chipping-campden-gloucestershire-tom-dyckhoff","fields":{"headline":"Let’s move to Chipping Campden, Gloucestershire","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"What’s going for it?

Air pollution causes about 40,000 early deaths a year in the UK – more than 9,000 in London – and the young are particularly vulnerable. The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, already sends alerts to train stations and bus stops when pollution levels reach dangerous levels, advising vulnerable groups including children and the elderly to take precautionary measures. Next week the system is to be extended to include schools, and GPs’ surgeries and care homes will be included “in the near future”. Khan said: “I want more Londoners to engage with air quality issues so I am sure the new guidance that I have published today will encourage people to learn more about the air they breathe and what they can do to improve it.” The scale of London’s air pollution crisis was laid bare last year with new figures showing that every person in the capital is breathing air that exceeds global guidelines for one of the most dangerous toxic particles. The findings, described as “sickening” by Khan, have serious health implications – especially for children – with both short- and long-term exposure to these particulates increasing the likelihood of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Health experts say young people exposed to these toxic pollutants are more likely to grow up with reduced lung function and to develop asthma. The decision to send alerts to schools comes as environment minister Thérèse Coffey is due in Brussels on Tuesday to explain to the European commission why the UK still breaches legal air pollution limits. Britain is one of the five member states to have received a “final warning” from the commission after persistently surpassing limits for nitrogen dioxide levels. Khan has written to the EU environment commissioner, Karmenu Vella, who will meet Coffey on Tuesday to set out his efforts to tackle air pollution and what the government needs to do. The government was back in the UK courts last week to defend their current air pollution plans which have previously been ruled so poor that they are illegal. A spokesman for the Department of Environment Food and Rural Affairs said air pollution “has improved significantly since 2010, but we recognise there is more to do, which is why we have put in place a £3.5bn plan to improve air quality and reduce harmful emissions.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2018/jan/29/elon-musk-sells-21m-of-flamethrowers-in-a-day-plus-extinguishers","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-29T17:15:09Z","webTitle":"Elon Musk sells $3.5m worth of flamethrowers in a day","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jan/29/elon-musk-sells-21m-of-flamethrowers-in-a-day-plus-extinguishers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/jan/29/elon-musk-sells-21m-of-flamethrowers-in-a-day-plus-extinguishers","fields":{"headline":"Elon Musk sells $3.5m worth of flamethrowers in a day","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Elon Musk, the multi-billionaire founder of electric car company Tesla and tunnelling company Boring, has sold $3.5m (£2.5m) worth of “boring” flamethrowers in less than 24 hours. The maverick businessman, who last week secured a pay deal that could see him collect $55bn, had pledged that if The Boring Company sold 50,000 baseball caps at $20 each he would start selling flamethrowers. The caps sold out, and Musk started selling $500 flamethrowers on Sunday, tweeting: “Guaranteed to liven up any party!” In a video post on Instagram, Musk said “don’t do this” and then proceeded to run towards the camera with the flamethrower alight. “Also, I want to be clear that a flamethrower is a super terrible idea. Definitely don’t buy one. Unless you like fun.” Within hours, customers had placed orders for 7,000 flamethrowers, which at $500 each works out at $3.5m. The company had 20,000 in stock. Musk joked on Twitter that rumours that he was “secretly creating a zombie apocalypse to generate demand for flamethrowers [were] completely false”. Musk did not respond to questions from the Guardian about the safety implications of selling flamethrowers to anyone over the web. On Twitter, he said the US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) decrees that “any flamethrower with a flame shorter than 10ft is A-ok. Our design is max fun for least danger. I’d be way more scared of a steak knife”. The Boring Company said fire extinguishers were “sold separately (for exorbitant amounts of money)”. “Buy an overpriced Boring Company fire extinguisher!

He was called to the bar in 1953 and was still working regularly within weeks of his death more than 60 years later. His defining characteristic was a gift for friendship which transcended all barriers. After winning the Lancashire seat of Accrington in the 1966 general election, Davidson began his long association with Fleet Street as the backbench libel lawyer on the old London Evening News. Later he was legal director of Associated Newspapers (1985–91) and after that for the Daily Mirror (1991–93). He was subsequently a legal consultant at Express Newspapers, and until he became ill in December was working for the listings magazine Time Out. His professional expertise covered issues of legal complexity in sport and politics, as well as publications, and he was a respected authority consulted by leading sporting figures and politicians. He had a contacts book that was the envy of the business and reflected his gregarious habits, his huge range of interests and his immense popularity. By 1983 he was shadow attorney general, but his promising political career was cut short at that year’s general election. His parliamentary constituency, redrawn with new boundaries as Hyndburn, became more of a marginal and, in what was in any case a difficult year for the Labour party, he lost the seat to the Conservative challenger, Ken Hargreaves, after six counts. The first count and three subsequent recounts on the night of the election had given Davidson a narrow majority, but after the ballot boxes were locked away overnight, two more recounts gave victory to the Conservative. The result was the last in the country to be announced and Davidson lost by 21 votes. He was born in Liverpool, raised in Southport and fought his first parliamentary elections in Blackpool South in 1955 and in Preston North in 1959. He was the second of three children, born to Abraham (Abe), who ran a carpet manufacturing business and Rose (nee Spieler). His father was born in Russia and came to the UK as a child. The family moved to Southport on the outbreak of the second world war, fortuitously as their previous family home was bombed shortly afterwards. Arthur joined the merchant navy towards the end of the war and celebrated VE Day in May 1945 in Times Square, New York, aged 18. Although born in 1926, he took two years off his age when he was 40, just after reaching Westminster. He had attended Liverpool college, and King George V school in Southport, and resumed his education after his wartime service, reading law at Trinity College, Cambridge. He was a lifelong sporting enthusiast, winning his Blue as a member of the Cambridge athletics team, and he was captain of athletics at Trinity. His later sports were rugby, skiing and tennis – the latter of which he continued playing into his 80s. He also developed a love of theatre and jazz as a student and had a keen interest in horse racing, with a knowledge of racing form which he deployed to considerable effect at the bookmakers. He was a lifelong supporter of Liverpool FC. He was picked for promotion early on at Westminster, as parliamentary private secretary to the solicitor general, Arthur Irvine (1968-70). When Harold Wilson returned to office as prime minister in 1974, he appointed Davidson parliamentary secretary to the law officers’ department, a frontbench job he held throughout that parliament. He took silk in 1978. Thereafter he remained on the frontbench as a defence spokesman (1980-81) and on legal affairs as shadow attorney general from 1981. In one notable parliamentary incident he moved an amendment to the armed forces bill which was intended to end the then criminality of homosexual acts by members of the services. The amendment was defeated by the Conservative government and it was later quietly pointed out that this was probably just as well; a mistaken wording in the amendment would have made homosexuality in the forces compulsory, rather than permissible. Davidson was a reforming, sensible member of the soft left in the parliamentary party, but managed to combine membership of the Tribune group with that of the more gradualist Fabian Society. He was also a member of the influential Society of Labour Lawyers, chaired the home affairs group within the parliamentary Labour party before he joined the government and chaired the House of Commons jazz club. He was a man who liked to be liked, and succeeded at it, but although he had a sizeable personal vote in his constituency, he failed sufficiently to contain the radical Militant left in Accrington, which weakened him politically. His life was also characterised by a chaotic personal life. When practising as a barrister in Manchester shortly after qualifying, he was married for two years to Honoria “Stevie” Nugent, and in 1983 he married Joan Ferguson, by whom he already had a son, Joel. He adopted Joan’s daughter, Moon, but became estranged from Joan more than 20 years ago. He is survived by Joel and Moon, by his grandchildren, Shoshanna and Esme, by his sister, Harriet, and his brother, John. • Arthur Davidson, lawyer and politician, born 7 November 1926, died 16 January 2018"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jan/31/as-a-1990s-teenager-the-world-gave-us-girl-power-and-pornification","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-31T06:01:00Z","webTitle":"The 1990s: ‘It was a decade in which women could offer reason: people still talk about the Scully effect’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jan/31/as-a-1990s-teenager-the-world-gave-us-girl-power-and-pornification","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jan/31/as-a-1990s-teenager-the-world-gave-us-girl-power-and-pornification","fields":{"headline":"‘As a 1990s teenager, the world gave us girl power and pornification’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"I began the 1990s doing something very specific at a disco on a highly anticipated end of primary school camp in Cornwall. Wearing leggings and an oversized, DayGlo T-shirt, I was singing Colour Me Badd. “Ooooooooh … I Wanna Sex You Up!” If a No 1 song by a boyband from Oklahoma, inappropriately riling prepubescent girls, doesn’t sound like an obvious feminist anthem, that’s because it wasn’t. What it was, though, was an early indication that attitudes towards gender and sexuality were changing. The 90s, and the third-wave feminism the decade has come to be remembered for, was a contradictory experience at the time. It was, on the one hand, all about girl power and sex positivity. It was “position of the fortnight” in More magazine – offering teenage girls line drawings that explained sexual positions in technical detail. It was Missy Elliott bossing hip-hop, TLC, Destiny’s Child and the Spice Girls, by whose time I was too cool to idolise women with silly names, but who delivered glossy girl power to my eight-year-old sister. On the other, it was the ultimate pornification of the female body in black hip-hop culture, in which I was – by the middle of the decade – heavily immersed. White beauty norms became aligned with Kate Moss and other pale, bony models – some embodying profoundly emaciated, heroin chic – and the acceleration of unhealthy body images. Girls growing up in the 90s had the luxury of taking feminism’s previous achievements for granted. My first experience of the workplace was “take your daughter to work day” in 1995 – a classic 90s invention – designed to encourage higher-quality work experience opportunities for girls. At the same time, our mothers, who had spent the 70s passionately immersed in second-wave feminism, arguing for equal career opportunities and pay, were often ambivalent about the fruits of their labour. My own mother, working full-time yet still carrying the main burden of domestic responsibility, had a sneaking suspicion that this was not a good deal. It was in response to this, perhaps, that the 90s were full of superhuman women – Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Charmed and Sabrina the Teenage Witch. Women could offer reason as well as magic. The X-Files was my defining TV experience of the decade – to this day, people recruiting women into Stem subjects talk about the “Scully effect”. These were all white characters, which was the norm in the 90s and well beyond. It was only much later I learned the third-wave feminism that came to define the decade was in fact coined by a woman of colour, Rebecca Walker, whose work helped create the space for Kimberlé Crenshaw’s concept of intersectionality to thrive. That I was aware of neither woman during the 90s shows how far the decade really was from embodying the values it helped create. •Afua Hirsch is a writer, broadcaster, barrister and human rights development worker"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/29/the-guardian-view-on-the-brexit-transition-wanted-a-labour-alternative","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-29T18:07:46Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on the Brexit transition: wanted – a Labour alternative | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/29/the-guardian-view-on-the-brexit-transition-wanted-a-labour-alternative","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/29/the-guardian-view-on-the-brexit-transition-wanted-a-labour-alternative","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on the Brexit transition: wanted – a Labour alternative","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"At its core, Brexit is a formal process of laws, treaties, timetables and deadlines. But this formal process is a bit like a medieval castle surrounded by a shanty town of often raucous informal pressures from politics, the media, interest groups and civil society. This week there is a classic illustration of the dangerous disconnection between these parallel worlds. In the formal part, the European Union on Monday issued its official guidelines for a transition period between Brexit in 2019 and the start of a negotiated future trading relationship. Meanwhile in the informal part, the Conservative party continued to be preoccupied by a stormy doctrinal argument about real and imagined threats from the formal process, all fired by the heady home brew of prejudice, ambition and self-interest. A direct challenge to Theresa May’s leadership is a real possibility amid all this chaos. It is the talk of the fleshpots outside the castle walls. The argument within the Tory party at Westminster is also increasingly visceral and acrimonious. At any moment it might spill out into a full-scale brawl. But the decisive event on Monday was not at Westminster. It was in Brussels, where the EU took two minutes to agree its directives for the negotiations about a post-Brexit transition period. The transition question is not as fraught as phase one of the Brexit talks, dealing with the so-called divorce issues (which was signed off in December), or as phase two, dealing with the future trading relationship (scheduled for completion in the autumn), is likely to be. But it is important nonetheless, for two big reasons: first because the transition period holds the key to the phase two talks that follow, and second because there are substantive issues at stake in the transition that have to be dealt with sensibly and not jeopardised. All the signs are that Britain is handling this latest part of the process as ineptly as it embarked on phase one. The experience of phase one was that what the EU wants is likely to be at the heart of the eventual deal. The UK failed to make clear what it wanted at the start, because it was incapable of doing so, since to do so would split the Tory party. As a result, it always made sense during phase one to refer to the directives for those talks issued by the EU in April 2017; these duly ended up as the bulk of the deal signed by Mrs May in December. Similarly, this week’s document on transition is likely to become the basic reference point for the conclusion of the stage that is about to begin. David Davis made a speech last week in Middlesbrough pressing for the UK to be consulted about new EU laws during this period. But the effort was too little, too late, and too unserious in the light of the government’s consistent failure to set out its Brexit goals. Michel Barnier had no difficulty dismissing the idea on Monday. A transition period is indispensable to lay the ground for the prosperous and peaceful relationship that Britain needs with the EU after Brexit. Even the government grasps this in principle. In practice, however, ministers are unable to translate that into anything sensible for British jobs and trade. Mrs May is increasingly focused simply on getting the UK out of the EU next year at the expense of the terms on which it happens; to her, Brexit really does now just mean Brexit, and little else. Hardline Brexiters seemed to go along with that until recently, at the expense of Britain’s best interests in the talks, of course, since they are not concerned about that. Now, though, their fear about a soft Brexit or even a reversal of Brexit – plus their sense that Mrs May cannot survive – is luring them into recklessness. Jacob Rees-Mogg’s and Sir Bill Cash’s complaints about Brexit “in name only” are designed to wreck the kind of transition period that would be good for the British economy and pave the way for a softer eventual landing. Mrs May is too weak to make the counter-argument; her next planned speech on Brexit seems to have bitten the dust. Only the chancellor, Philip Hammond, makes the case on the Tory side; yet even he is cautious. The situation is ready-made for Labour to articulate an alternative approach that speaks for Britain’s interests. That alternative has been too long absent; it has never been more needed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"books/2018/jan/31/somebody-i-used-to-know-wendy-mitchell-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-31T07:30:21Z","webTitle":"Somebody I Used to Know by Wendy Mitchell review – dementia from the inside","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jan/31/somebody-i-used-to-know-wendy-mitchell-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/jan/31/somebody-i-used-to-know-wendy-mitchell-review","fields":{"headline":"Somebody I Used to Know by Wendy Mitchell review – dementia from the inside","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Things begin, as so often, with a fall. A hard fall, while out running along the River Ouse in York, hard enough that Wendy Mitchell has to go to A&amp;E; hard enough that when she goes back later to find the flagstone that caused it, the blood from where her face hit the pavement serves as a bright marker. Yet there is no obvious hazard. Then, another day, another fall. And another. The year before, she had completed the three peaks challenge; now she finds she must give up running. Then, after a couple of unsafe incidents on the road, driving. Parts of herself crumbling, or, one day, when she looks up from her desk at work and finds she has no idea what she’s doing there, dropping so fast it’s like “ripping a plaster away”. When she finally gets an official diagnosis it’s as though she already knows: early-onset Alzheimer’s. She is 58. This revelatory book, written with the journalist Anna Wharton, is a recording of Mitchell’s disappearance, as it happens. She is clear that the onset of the disease signals, for her, an existential rupture. There was a self before, and now that self has ceased to exist. “You”, her current self calls her previous self. “I remember the frantic pace, the speed with which you tackled things” – fell-walking, DIY, especially after the father of her two daughters left. She used to earn a wage as a cleaner, then, when the girls were older, as an NHS receptionist, working to become an all-competent leader of a team rostering nursing shifts in a busy hospital. That previous self seems, understandably from this specific vantage point, almost superhuman. A different story begins to leak out, however: loneliness, industriously hidden sadness, a stroke from stress and overwork. But “memory was your thing”, also independence, resourcefulness, pluck. A fighting spirit. And these last, in fact, remain. Mitchell fights against everything about her disease, every step of the way, the very recording of its progress being one method (she keeps a blog, which provided the basis for the interviews that Wharton then used to stitch this account together). Writing and remembering to use her brain holds Alzheimer’s at bay for another hour, another week, another day. As, she believes, does her singleness: Mitchell is good on the double-edged sword of having dementia when one has a partner – about the guilt and the dependence, which, she thinks, hastens the progress of the disease. She rails against the system, by which she feels abandoned, first because “there is no follow-up after diagnosis. There is nothing they can do”; second because, when she tells her managers what is happening, expecting them to attempt flexibility, to trust her and work with her, they offer only early retirement. This is one of the baldest and thus weakest points in an otherwise textured book; I found it hard to believe that someone who worked in the NHS for 20 years could be so dismissive of it, wondering if something had been left out, or tweaked, for polemical effect. Much more interesting is her fierce alertness to others’ perceptions and preconceptions, understanding them because she herself once shared them: that dementia patients are very old, helpless, blank. Cancelled, in a way, as people. Like any progressive disease, dementia is a continuum, she tells once-friendly neighbours who cross the street to avoid her; it is also fitful – there are bad days, and good ones. And there is still a person in there, forgetful, yes, confused, often, but just as in need of validation and love and conversation and laughter as anyone else. She attacks the fear – which is of nightmares made real: words going missing in public meetings, being invisible. Whole familiar cities made alien. Sounds like gunshots ripping through her head. “I lost yesterday. I don’t know what happened to it.” This, a report from the other side, is one of the most valuable things about the book – a detailing of what the disease actually feels like, a demystification. She arms herself with practical ingenuities: dementia bingo; iPads pinging to remind her to take pills, to eat. A bright pink bike, not because she especially likes pink, but because it would be harder to forget. Novels become impossible to read, so she reaches for short stories and poems. Each time she congratulates herself for staying a step ahead, but at her worst moments she wonders: “Wasn’t I going to see the world? What happened to all the time I thought I had?” And who is “I”, anyway? Pre-dementia Wendy? Today Wendy, who is different from tomorrow Wendy? For the reader, there is also the ventriloquised, ghostwritten “I”, complicating matters further. But the “I” fights for others too, for people with dementia everywhere – travelling up and down the country to talk to conferences, to researchers. She fights for positive language, asking student nurses what words spring to mind when they hear the term “dementia”: “demented, senile, burden, sufferer, old age, living death”. What about, for instance, replacing the passive “suffering” with the active “living with”? – things might feel more possible, there might be at least an illusion of agency. She learns, quickly, the “harsh lessons” Alzheimer’s teaches: a conscious tomorrow may not exist; live, then, as well as possible, in today. It is striking how much of self, she discovers, is located in language. Speaking becomes difficult, but she can still write as fast as ever, WhatsApping, blogging, emailing, until one day that stutters too. It comes back, but there is no mistaking the existential vertigo: “I have become used to looking up in familiar surroundings and not knowing where I am, but this was something else. I was lost inside. Screaming to get out. It was terrifying.” Talk, then. Talk as much as possible, while it is still possible. Talk to loved ones, explain what needs to happen, about care, about resuscitation, about death. Make choices now to make theirs, already hard, a little easier later. Brave the mutual dance of fear and reassurance. But what she can least bear is losing the future she thought she and her daughters had together. And so she redoubles her efforts, writing herself notes and instructions that collect in drifts on the floor, on her cupboards, on her walls, fragments shored against the coming ruin.

It’s quite another to catch one, to actually haul an octopus out of the sea and try to convince yourself, as its tentacles wind around your arm, that you’ll be eating it for dinner, not the other way round. The Basque chef Nieves Barragán Mohacho, who has just opened a new restaurant in London called Sabor, has done plenty of the former. She can tell you in the finest detail how to select, prep, boil and serve – with olive oil, paprika and pinches of sea salt – these remarkable sea creatures. What she hasn’t done is catch an octopus – until this morning. We are in a boat off the Galician coastal town of O Grove, in north-west Spain, and a fisherman in yellow oilskins named Felix Piñeiro is lifting octopus pots out of the steel-grey waters. Everything around us – the laid-back peninsula town, its neighbouring islands – is obscured by heavy mist, focusing our view on the task at hand. The first two pots contain only crabs, though Nieves doesn’t seem disappointed. “Huge nécoras,” she says excitedly, using the Spanish word for velvet crabs, which are a delicacy in this part of the world. A few minutes later, a larger pot resembling a bucket is winched to the surface, water spouting through a hundred tiny holes. As Nieves opens the pot, her face becomes momentarily unreadable. She reaches down and, with some difficulty, hoists into the air an enormous octopus, burnt orange in colour, its white-suckered tentacles flailing about in all directions. “Unbelievable!” she cries, struggling to keep her grip on it. “I’ve never seen one this big.” She looks half-delighted, half-daunted as the tentacles twist up her sleeves. “Puta madre!” she laughs. “It’s pulling me down.” This experience – feeling awed and a bit overwhelmed by what comes out of the sea – may sound familiar to anyone who’s been to Galicia. This rugged region is an extremely beautiful place to visit. With more than 1,000km of Atlantic coastline at its disposal as well as countless bays and estuaries, or rías – where shellfish grow large and juicy in nutrient-rich waters – it’s also one of the most exciting seafood destinations on the planet. Octopus is the main focus of this trip. Nieves is researching local cooking methods for her new restaurant, where she plans to cook octopus Galician-style in large copper pots – but that doesn’t mean we’re ignoring all the other delights the region has to offer. We begin where most pilgrimages to Galicia end – in Santiago de Compostela, about 70km inland from O Grove. For the tens of thousands who each year walk the Camino de Santiago, the pilgrimage to the shrine of the apostle St James the Great, this elegant regional capital marks the final stop. They gather in the wide square next to the 1,000-year-old cathedral, which is said to house the saint’s remains, and lie flat on their backs contemplating their achievement. The cathedral in Santiago is also famous for its botafumeiro, an enormous brass censer that swings like a pendulum through the transept on certain days of the year trailing great clouds of incense. After a quick appreciation of the cathedral’s ornate interior we hurry on in search of lunch. We find it at Mercado de Abastos, the city’s central food market. Outside, local farmers are selling apples, pumpkins and cabbages bigger than basketballs. Under the colonnades at the seafood section, we hoot at our first sight of octopus, and then get distracted by the alien-looking percèbes, or goose barnacles, which are plucked from wave-battered rocks and cliffs along the Galician coast – a risky business for the percebeiros doing the plucking. Some of the best produce from these stalls ends up at Abastos 2.0, a tiny taberna on the edge of the market. We pause here for lunch before we head north. “People in Galicia are so friendly,” Nieves remarks as we sit out in the sun eating raw sea bass and drinking Estrella Galicia beer. As if to prove it, the restaurant’s co-owner Iago Pazos presents us with a large slab of empanada gallega (Galician pie, this one filled with tuna and red pepper) to tide us over until dinner. Our base for this trip is A Coruña, an hour to the north. It may not be the prettiest port city, its skyline a mishmash of late 20th-century architecture, but there are many good reasons to visit. For one, the Old Town is an excellent place in which to get lost, as we did on the first night, before winding up at a great little bar called La Bombilla to feast on Padrón peppers and Russian salad. This is just an appetiser for our dinner at Cervecería Estrella Galicia, where a spread of seafood dishes – including lobster, nécoras crabs and a magnificent John Dory – are matched with beers from the distillery. The city’s most arresting sight is the Tower of Hercules, a 55m Roman lighthouse situated on a promontory at the edge of town. Dating back to the second century AD, the lighthouse still functions today and you can climb it most of the way to the top. This, combined with the long walk back along the promenade, via Riazor beach, is an excellent way to work off a heavy lunch. The next day brings us to O Grove, though we haven’t come here just to catch octopus. Since Nieves first visited Galicia five years ago, she has been making an annual pilgrimage to eat at a restaurant in town called d’Berto. “He’s got the best seafood, full stop,” she says of the owner Berto Domínguez García, who does the sourcing while his sister Marisol runs the kitchen. “It’s one of my favourite restaurants.” After a long lunch at d’Berto, starting with oysters, clams and nécoras, moving on to palometo roja, an orange-red fish with gigantic eyes, and ending with a sublime torta de queso (cheesecake), it’s one of my favourites, too. Later, Berto takes us to the local fish market to watch the day’s catch being auctioned. Then it’s on to the Albamar winery in nearby Cambados, where we drink albariño, consume yet more seafood, and afterwards dance (or at least stagger along) to a local band playing traditional music on the gaita, a type of bagpipe which hints at the region’s Celtic roots. On the menu, incidentally, is the 5kg octopus that Nieves caught earlier in the day. Xurxo, whose family owns the winery, cooks it Galician-style in a large copper pot. Usually octopus is frozen before cooking, to tenderise the flesh; Xurxo softens this one up by whacking it 42 times against a granite headstone. I must confess to some queasiness at this point, having witnessed the poor thing being caught, killed, and now bashed about on a slab of rock. But my qualms are quickly forgotten when the octopus is served up with caramelised onions and potatoes. It’s a revelation. “The flavour is much fuller than frozen ones,” says Nieves. “It tastes more of the sea.” Not a bad thing for an octopus to taste like, all told. Particularly when the sea in question is the one crashing against the shores of Galicia.

Normally, Gummer fosters two children, but last autumn she felt she needed to reduce her caring responsibilities temporarily and just look after one child. “I was suffering with what I call empathetic exhaustion. I had had a couple of very difficult, short-term placements: youngsters who had had awful early years experiences – and the cumulative effect of constant care, understanding and therapeutic parenting wore me down.” “When you are living with children who have gone through some sort of trauma, as a foster carer you often end up holding some of that trauma for them, because you are trying to find a way to help – and empathising is an important part of that.” Gummer wants more support from social workers and has decided to move from the council to a private agency to get it. “Sheffield fostering service is not able to meet my support needs,” she explains. “I need some form of regular therapeutic support.” The small private agency she is due to transfer to offers one hour’s therapy per child per week, one hour’s therapy per week for her and one hour joint family support per week for the first 20 weeks of a placement. “That was the biggest pull for me,” she explains. In addition, Gummer says the small size of the agency means the social workers it employs should have more time to spend with the children. In contrast, she says the support from the council was inadequate. “I felt very frustrated by the poor quality of contact between the child and their social worker. I felt this left the child ‘unknown’ and without a voice.” Gummer is far from alone in believing that independent fostering agencies (IFAs) can better look after carers than local authorities. Last month’s report by the education select committee found that the government needed to do much more to support fostering families. Robert Halfon, chair of the education select committee, said: “Our inquiry showed it is clear that too many [foster carers] are not adequately supported, neither financially nor professionally, in the vital work that they do.” Rachel Harrison, lead officer for foster carers at the GMB trade union, says: “Agencies’ social workers have lesser workloads and so are better able to look after their foster carers. But the issue is that they end up costing councils a lot more money.” The Guardian has this week revealed that the growth of IFAs in England, many of which are run for profit by private equity investors, is pushing up the cost of placing children with families by hundreds of millions of pounds each year. The government’s imminent “stocktake” of foster care should provide the latest cost analysis. Sir Martin Narey’s 2016 review of residential care for the government found that in some areas, private sector agencies charge 92% more than the local authority spends on its own foster carers. His findings echo a 2014 report by consultancy Impower which found that each in-house foster placement typically cost councils £17,000 per year less than the average agency placement. Some IFAs often also offer “golden hellos” of up to £3,000 to encourage carers to leave their council.rom 2012-2016, the numbers of young people placed with IFA-registered foster carers rose by 5% to 17,410, compared to a 1% increase in those placed with local authority registered carers, to 34,395. Gummer will not get a golden hello, but she will earn more. Sheffield city council pays her £200 per week in fees and £180 per week allowances for each child under 16 – and £188 per week for over 16s. “Providing the quality of care young people deserve brings significant financial worries,” she says. “It’s difficult to afford a cinema trip or to go out for pizza. I’ve also just had to give up my gym membership.” She expects to be £150-£180 per week better off with the agency. “That means I can get my roof fixed – and maybe even get a new secondhand car as mine needs replacing.” Gummer is not the only one feeling the pinch. According to research by the Fostering Network charity, in 2014 80% of council-registered foster carers said the allowances they received met the full cost of looking after children; by 2016 just 42% did. And three-quarters of foster carers said the fees paid to them were poor or needed improving. Meanwhile, the bigger private sector agencies appear to be raking it in. Figures from Corporate Watch show that eight private sector foster care agencies made £41m in profits in 2014-15. “It’s using money that should be for the most vulnerable children in society,” says Sarah Anderson, chair of the foster care workers branch of the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain. Impower calculated that increasing the proportion of local authority-registered foster placements from the national average in 2014 of 67% to 85% would save councils £150m a year. Some local authorities are already fighting back. In Leeds, concerted action to attract, support and retain foster carers seems to be bearing fruit. Helen Hayden, lead member for children and families at Leeds city council, says foster carers are a valued part of the team. “We treat and view foster carers as professionals,” she says. Carers are allocated a dedicated fostering social worker – and comprehensive training is provided, alongside carer support groups, educational support for children in their care and therapeutic support. “As a result, we have very few breakdowns in placements,” says Hayden. All foster carers registered with the council and the children have free gym membership. The children also receive free swimming lessons at the city’s leisure centres. The council says fees and allowances are on a par with or better than at independent agencies. Foster carers receive £142-£246 per week in allowances per child on top of fees of up to £220 per child for the most skilled. And from April, foster carers will get a 1% increase in fees backdated to October. The strategy seems to be paying dividends. We have brought back 88 foster families from independent agencies since 2012,” says Hayden. Overall, the number of foster carers registered with the council is up 25% since 2010 – and no carers have transferred from the council’s service to an IFA in the past four years. The council estimates it costs on average £350 per week more to place a child through an IFA. “That’s £18,000 a year,” says Hayden. This means that by having more foster carers in-house, Leeds has saved at least £1.5m. In Peterborough, the council has outsourced its fostering service . Tact (The Adolescent and Children’s Trust), the UK’s largest fostering and adoption charity, was appointed in April to run all the council’s fostering and adoption services in a 10-year deal, worth £126m. Andy Elvin, chief executive of Tact, hopes to reduce the use of IFAs from 35-40% of placements to under 10%. Elvin says social workers will be better able to support foster carers because caseloads have been capped at 15. In addition, carers have access to a dedicated 24/7 out-of-hours support line, and Tact offers an interest-free loan facility. Back in Sheffield, monetary support like that could have helped Gummer stay with the council. She says her decision is a last resort. “I don’t want to leave the local authority: if the council could loan me the money to repair my house and provide me and the children with more support, then I’d stay.” A spokeswoman for Sheffield ciity council says: “Our foster carers do an incredible job for hundreds of children across Sheffield.are provided with a realistic and competitive weekly payment plus a holiday grant and additional money for special occasions. They also receive a mileage allowance and payments for activities.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/jan/29/arctic-monkeys-announce-first-live-dates-since-2014","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-29T15:21:39Z","webTitle":"Arctic Monkeys announce first live dates since 2014","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jan/29/arctic-monkeys-announce-first-live-dates-since-2014","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/jan/29/arctic-monkeys-announce-first-live-dates-since-2014","fields":{"headline":"Arctic Monkeys announce first live dates since 2014","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Arctic Monkeys have announced their first live dates since 2014. The Sheffield band will play a number of European and American festivals this summer. The sole UK appearance announced so far is a headline slot at Glasgow’s TRNSMT festival on 1 July. The four-piece start their run at Barcelona’s Primavera Soundon 2 June. Other European dates include the Netherlands’s Best Kept Secret (8 June) and Finland’s Flow (11 August). The group have announced one US appearance, at Firefly festival in Delaware (14–17 June). Arctic Monkeys are expected to release their sixth studio album later this year. They went on hiatus after headlining Reading festival in 2014, with frontman Alex Turner telling NME it was the “perfect place to leave things for a while”. In 2016, they teased work on a new album via a series of gnomic Instagram posts, and last September bassist Nick O’Malley confirmed that progress was underway for a planned 2018 release. The as-yet untitled album follows 2013’s AM, which reached No 1 in the UK charts and featured singles including Why’d You Only Call Me When You’re High? and the Grammy-nominated Do I Wanna Know? During the band’s break, Turner released Everything You’ve Come to Expect, the second album with his other band the Last Shadow Puppets. Drummer Matt Helders contributed to Iggy Pop’s 2016 album Post Pop Depression, which also featured Josh Homme of Queens of the Stone Age. The band’s debut, 2006’s Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not, was recently revealed to be the biggest-selling Mercury prize winner of all time."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"technology/shortcuts/2018/jan/29/have-you-signed-up-for-a-tracking-app-by-mistake","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-29T17:36:36Z","webTitle":"Have you signed up for a tracking app by mistake?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/shortcuts/2018/jan/29/have-you-signed-up-for-a-tracking-app-by-mistake","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/shortcuts/2018/jan/29/have-you-signed-up-for-a-tracking-app-by-mistake","fields":{"headline":"Have you signed up for a tracking app by mistake?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Fitness tracker Strava has come under fire for publishing the heatmaps (paths its users have logged when running or cycling) of military personnel.

Given that Bose was accused last year of collecting private information on the listening habits of users via its premium wireless headphones (which it denied), maybe I will steer clear. Geotagging Even if we are savvy – or bothered – enough to turn off our location settings, there are loopholes. For most of us, pictures are geotagged automatically – whenever we allow an app access to our camera roll, we are allowing it to find out where we were when those pictures were taken. More terrifyingly, Google developer Felix Krause warned last year that granting certain iOS apps access to our cameras enables them to silently turn on the camera and take photos or videos whenever the app is open. Looking for love Almost all dating apps collect location information; it is how they push through nearby potential matches. But there is a reason that Happn is commonly known as the creepiest among them. It shares your location with other users (via push notifications, telling you when you have, say, walked past a potential match) and keeps a record of all the times you have frequented the same Wetherspoons. Meanwhile, the company is able to build a highly sophisticated picture of your passions and pastimes. Live-location sharing Broadcasting our locations on social media has been “a thing” since “checking in” on Facebook became a means of flirtation. However, the sophistication of live-location sharing (through developments such as Snap Map and the location tools on Instagram Stories) means that our whereabouts are available not only to followers, but to anyone using the maps to discover others in the area. Google alerts Anyone on an Android operating system is most likely offering up a goldmine of information for Google to potentially cannibalise and sell on. GPS coordinates to nearby wifi networks, barometric pressure and even a guess at the phone-holder’s current activity are all picked up by Google Location History, which is used to power smart location services such as traffic updates.

Even those who see the need for action can be persuaded that the moment isn’t right. And since politics is an untidy business, there are always new reasons to wait. The scheming tree never yields a perfect fruit. Cornford’s Microcosmographia Academica was published in 1908 as a satire on faculty intrigues but it is relevant 110 years later. It explains why Theresa May is prime minister. She squandered the Tories’ parliamentary majority last June and then a week later bungled the response to the Grenfell Tower fire. She looked incompetent, callous and defeated. Plotters’ knives were unsheathed, but the time was not ripe. It was not ripe in October when she choked on her own conference relaunch, nor in November when she missed a deadline for reaching “sufficient progress” in Brexit talks. Even now, when cabinet unity has dissolved and backbenchers queue up to broadcast their irritation, May’s demoralised defenders prop her up with the same crutch: Brexit negotiations are entering a crucial phase; there are local elections in the spring; there is no plan for a smooth succession, and a rough one could destroy the party. There will come a day when fresh leadership is required, just not today. That argument is losing its purchase. The current outbreak of regicidal fever is distinct from previous bouts because it isn’t triggered by anything the prime minister has done. It is the effect of pent-up frustration at things undone. Hard Brexiters are annoyed that May won’t punish a chancellor who brazenly steers towards cosy alignment with the EU. Moderates wish she would stand up to the backbench hard nuts. All wish she had used her ministerial reshuffle to signal policy renaissance, although few can say what that means. Stagnation makes Tory MPs panic more than explosive crisis, because it can’t be blamed on misfortune or enemy action. It expresses the prime minister’s innate political character – unimaginative, defensive, closed, inarticulate. The troops rallied to their leader when she looked close to being broken by events. Then completion of Brexit’s first phase in December brought a degree of stability that has, paradoxically, diminished May. Her MPs realised that this was as good as she got, that they faced a long, grinding war of attrition. It is the malaise of the trenches, not the heat of battle, that has turned once loyal soldiers mutinous. This is not all about Brexit. Far from it. Yes, there is a sizeable Tory faction that won’t believe Britain is leaving the EU until May burns the treaty of Rome and scatters its ashes from the Queen Elizabeth tower. Their tone has become more menacing. But the greater change is a reluctance among mainstream MPs to serve as stabilisers when the fringe gets out of hand. The parliamentary Tory party is less fixated on Brexit than is commonly recognised. Some voted leave without it being their life’s purpose. Some mild Eurosceptics voted remain through economic pragmatism and loyalty to David Cameron. This inconspicuous blob of MPs takes the view that Brexit will get done one way or another. They are bored by the detail. They do not worship at Jacob Rees-Mogg’s Church of Immaculate Separation, but they do obey the secular spirit invoked by their constituents called JGOWI – “Just Get On With It.” They were easily persuaded in 2016 that May was the safe choice as leader. When she wobbled, they bought into the principle of unripe time. Now they are worried. They worry that the government has nothing to say about the NHS or schools. They worry that the Tories have been in power for eight years and there is still a deficit. They feel naked on the doorstep trying to explain what the government is for to people who weren’t interested in Europe before the referendum and still aren’t. An irony here is that May herself is one of those people. She didn’t go into politics to take Britain out of the EU. She believes that her time in office can be remembered for other things: housebuilding; education reforms to accelerate social mobility; an industrial strategy to rejuvenate economically laggard regions. The view from inside No 10 is that this agenda, May’s personal crusades, would be better understood if showboating ministers and monomaniac backbenchers didn’t keep causing distractions. The prime minister has no guiding instincts for Brexit, except as something she is duty-bound to do. Yet the need to get Brexit done is one of the few reasons Tory MPs have kept May in office. She does not see herself as a caretaker. They have no confidence in her to be anything else. Britain has a governing party that openly suspects its leader is not up to much and doesn’t expect her to get better, yet also apparently thinks she should be trusted with the most challenging task to face a prime minister for generations. At least for a little bit longer. How long? Maybe until it is done. This is how the principle of unripe time breaks down. Reasons not to take drastic action get more compelling at times of crisis – the risks are amplified. Yet the failure to act, the paralysis of political will, then becomes an exacerbating feature of the crisis. Is now the ideal moment for a change in Tory leadership? Of course not. Now is never the ideal moment, and then suddenly it’s too late. “Time,” Cornford warns his readers, “has a trick of going rotten before it is ripe.” • Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"society/2018/jan/29/how-to-end-speculation-and-squalor-in-housing","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-29T17:55:37Z","webTitle":"How to end speculation and squalor in housing | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jan/29/how-to-end-speculation-and-squalor-in-housing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/jan/29/how-to-end-speculation-and-squalor-in-housing","fields":{"headline":"How to end speculation and squalor in housing","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Ann Pettifor (Journal, 27 January) identifies several important strategies for solving London’s crisis of “unreal estate”, but omits one that is vital: developing regional economies. By the standards of most European nations, Britain’s economy is incredibly concentrated in a single conurbation. Today’s online technologies should make it possible for every business with a huge London office to have regional offices all over the country. There are plenty of provincial centres with large enough resident populations – let’s say of 250,000 people – to build a wider commuter belt around. Even counties remote from the other metropolitan areas have such population centres. Along the west coast mainline Milton Keynes and Stoke fill gaps. In the east Midlands most of the counties’ eponymous towns are now big cities. Along the south coast Sussex has Brighton, Hampshire and Dorset Southampton, and Devon and Cornwall Plymouth. Even the gap between London and Bristol now has Swindon. As well as reducing numbers of people moving permanently south and east it would address the absurdity of people commuting distances that would, again in the rest of Europe, be considered absurd. All in all it would make for better relations between different parts of Britain. Charles Gilman Mitcham, Surrey • Ann Pettifor is spot-on when she says that building more homes will not solve our housing crisis. The phenomenon of 3,000 unsold luxury units and a further 1,900 coming down the line, while rough sleeping in London has more than doubled in seven years, throws into stark relief the dysfunctional nature of the government’s housing policies. The City argues that rent control cannot be introduced as it would cause buy-to-let landlords to offload properties (accelerating the market collapse that has already started) and leaving recent first-time buyers with negative equity. Right-to-remain and buy-back at a re-evaluated sum from mortgagors would soften this impact. Local authorities could be empowered to buy in bulk the properties offloaded from the buy-to-let estate. Four out of 10 right–to-buy properties are now owned by private landlords. This combination would substantially re-establish the needed social-housing asset. We should learn from the German tradition of housing management in which rent control and secure renewable leases have dampened inflation, without deterring private investment in building to rent. Kate Macintosh Winchester, Hampshire • Robert Booth’s report (29 January) on the appalling conditions endured by thousands of private tenants, “so squalid they are likely to leave them needing medical attention”, is yet another indictment against a government claiming to care about the people it is meant to represent, and the “burning injustices” it pledged to remove. It is worth reminding readers that Conservative MPs two years ago voted against proposed new rules requiring private sector landlords “to ensure their properties were fit for human habitation”, with the then local government minister, Marcus Jones, claiming the proposal would result in “unnecessary regulation and cost to landlords” (Tories reject move to ensure rented homes fit for human habitation, 12 January 2016). To no one’s surprise, it later emerged that 72 of the MPs who voted against Labour’s amendment were themselves landlords. I trust the Labour candidates standing in those 72 constituencies in the next general election will let the voters know how their MPs voted. Booth’s report proves “rogue landlordism” is rife; successive governments have done too little to prevent tenants’ exploitation, with the inevitable result – the return of “Rachmanism”! Bernie Evans Liverpool • Your article might rather obviously be addressed by a simple solution. All rented and owner-occupied homes could be compulsory inspected yearly for safety issues, as all cars have been for decades. This need not be expensive: no significant damp penetration; provision of safe water; suitable toilet arrangements; no exposed/dangerous wiring; safe lighting levels; secured access. Those that fail would get three months for remedial action and reinspection. Cost could be low for imposed date/time visits, and doubled for bespoke times, owners to pay. Certification could be electronic as for cars. Owners could be surcharged for non-compliance, and landlords barred from letting. Council inspections could be allowed a small profit. Philip Home Newcastle upon Tyne • Welcome though the government’s support for legislation to ensure private rented properties are safe and that tenants can take legal action if necessary is, it will be essential that legal aid is available for both advice and representation. It’s also time for the protracted process involved in procuring selective licensing schemes to be made simpler and swifter. Jeremy Beecham Labour, House of Lords • May I add to Ann Pettifor’s clinical exposure of the failure of the UK housing market to provide truly affordable homes for all. In addition to the need to clamp down on national and international speculation in UK land, inevitably in short supply, there is a need to ensure minimum incomes are enough for healthy living after housing costs have been paid by renters or first-time buyers. “Affordable Rent is a rent of no more than 80 per cent of the local market rent”, according to the Department for Work and Pensions. In London that definition is a heartless and official oxymoron responsible for ever rising evictions and homelessness. It is high time for the many ivory towers of the UK housing market to be demolished rather than the council homes of my neighbours in Northumberland Park, Tottenham. They are due to be forcibly removed from their homes, built on public land, which will then enter the failing housing market. Their present homes are the only truly affordable homes in the UK. Rev Paul Nicolson Taxpayers Against Poverty • It is disappointing to note that your coverage of the Labour NEC intervention into Haringey council affairs (Labour intervenes in council housing plan dispute, 23 January) doesn’t allude to the reason for its action. It is the opposition Liberal Democrat group’s request for an extraordinary full council meeting that has brought the NEC into the fray. Community groups and others have been protesting about this scheme for the last 18 months, even triggering a judicial review in the high court, while Liberal Democrat councillors have been fighting hard to try to get a full council debate on this issue, which would allow all Haringey councillors to have a vote on the proposals. Tricky when it is a group of eight Lib Dem councillors facing 49 Labour councillors. It is the request by the Liberal Democrat group for an extraordinary full council meeting that has forced the hand of the local Haringey Labour councillors to go to their ruling body, asking for support if they choose to go against the party whip and vote against this unpopular joint venture. This is a demonstration of opposition in action and we call on all councillors who are opposed to the HDV to vote with our motion on 7 February.

Here they do much the same for the ballads and broadsides that arose from attempts to forge a northwest passage through Arctic waters, notably Lord Franklin’s doomed expedition of 1845. The crazed mindset that undertook such a mission, and the hardships endured on icebound sailing ships, are evoked through contemporary songbooks (some printed onboard for entertainment) and the odd hymn. The Kings are no conventional folk group, however. The booming baritone of Ben Nicholls (of the Seth Lakeman Band) is clearly “in the tradition”, but the space rock guitar of Richard Warren (ex-Spiritualized) and the jazzy shots of drummer Evan Jenkins (the Neil Cowley Trio) are not. The outcome, recorded in a Gravesend missionary church, is an album that shapeshifts from the solemnity of Reason’s Voyage to the shimmering dread of Song of Defeat and the gothic chill of The Reindeer and the Ox. Along the way comes Alouette (yup, that one), restored to the hypnotic charm of its Canuck composers, and conventional outings such as Song of the Sledge.

The contrast between his productivity of the 1950s, 60s and 70s, when he wrote barely a handful of works in each decade, and the generosity of his productivity in the final 30 years of his life – two dozen pieces written after his 100th birthday – is unprecedented. Birmingham Contemporary Music Group’s all-Carter celebration focused on that exuberant late flowering. Apart from a piece for solo harp, Bariolage from 1992, everything in the programme dated from his last decade, right up to his final work, a set of Epigrams for piano trio, completed just three months before he died. The concert also marked Mirga Gražinytė-Tyla’s debut with the ensemble, continuing its link with the music directors of its sibling, the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra, that began when Simon Rattle founded the group in 1987. Though Carter’s wonderfully fluent invention and sparky, confrontational instrumental writing was instantly identifiable in every bar, there is some unevenness among these late works. For all the brilliance of the performances, not all the pieces in the BCMG programme really qualified as top-drawer Carter - Two Controversies and a Conversation for piano, percussion and ensemble, for instance, seems strangely short-winded and inconsequential. Yet all the music here glittered and diverted, without wasting a note, whether in the ever-changing perspectives of the mini-harp concerto Mosaic – sounding wonderfully supple under Gražinytė-Tyla – or the darkly beautiful, slow song for violin and trombone with which the Double Trio begins. Pierre-Laurent Aimard was the pianist in the works that required one, as well as playing the dazzling solo pieces Two Thoughts About the Piano, one of which is the extraordinary Caténaires, a bounding single melodic line that never pauses for breath. He also joined violinist Alexandra Wood and cellist Ulrich Heinen in those final Epigrams, 12 tiny pieces that, appropriately enough, seem to distill Carter’s language down to its exquisite essence."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/jan/29/monuments-to-us-boston-musem-of-fine-arts","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-29T16:10:02Z","webTitle":"Monuments to Us: why art should be preserving unsung legacies","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jan/29/monuments-to-us-boston-musem-of-fine-arts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/jan/29/monuments-to-us-boston-musem-of-fine-arts","fields":{"headline":"Monuments to Us: why art should be preserving unsung legacies","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Last summer, a raft of Confederate monuments were torn down in America’s southern states. This year, a sculpture of the 19th-century gynecologist J Marion Sims – who experimented on enslaved black women without anaesthesia – will be removed from Central Park. Groups of activists have fought to have the sculpture removed. Sims “is a painful symbol of our nation’s troubling relationship with race,” said East Harlem city councilwoman Diana Ayala. But forget the monuments of famous names for a minute. What about local heroes, friends and neighbors? That’s the idea behind Monuments to Us, a group show which opened this weekend at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, where 10 artworks serve as monuments of personal history. “Whose stories are memorialized, and whose are erased?” asks the curator, Liz Munsell. “It gets complicated when some legacies come into question seen through a present-day lens.” Who should be remembered? “History only records major players, who are mostly white male figures, written into the official history books,” she says. “It’s a debate around the power of artists to make history; it introduces us to new ways of seeing humanity.” A monument-like artwork is more than just using a friend as a model or photographing a family member. There’s a story behind what each piece represents, whether it’s women, LGBTQ people, or immigrant or minority communities. “I was interested in ordinary people who are not superstars, celebrities or politicians,” says Munsell, “and how artists make portraits of people they find to be important.” Among the works in the exhibition is a painting of art historian Linda Nochlin and her daughter from 1973 by Alice Neel. It pays tribute to the feminist pioneer who wrote the groundbreaking essay Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?, which changed the game for female artists. There are several pieces by New York artist John Ahearn, who has created portraits of one neighborhood community in a series called the South Bronx Hall of Fame. “He cast people from the streets and invited anyone from the neighborhood to come pose for a portrait,” says Munsell. “It’s a lifelong project of casting people in the community, a neighborhood affair.” Yet Ahearn’s work came into question as a white artist – who was not from the Bronx – documenting its mostly black history. In 1993, he was called a “downtown” artist who was “living in a stripped-down sixth-floor slum apartment on one of the worst streets in New York City,” questioning whether he was exploiting the community. He created two versions of every portrait – one which went to the person, the other that went to his downtown gallery. Los Angeles photographer Catherine Opie also shows a portrait called Christopher Lee, taken from her collection of friends. “From drag queens and kings to punks, all of her subjects in this series have a gender deviance,” says Munsell. “It shows their daily realities because they don’t conform to gender binaries.” There’s also a work by London-based Argentinean artist Amalia Pica, who shows Now Speak!, a sculpture of a podium from 2011 which grants gallery-goers the chance to share their opinion. “Anyone can make any public statement they want,” says Munsell. “The only rule is ‘no hate speech.’ It challenges people to step up and speak their mind.” It isn’t always individuals who are honored: Donald Moffett’s 1992 artwork Facts, Which If True (Joe McCarthy) honors victims of the 1980s Aids epidemic. “It evokes individual resilience and paranoia, which ravaged the artist’s community,” says Munsell. “It’s a monument to friends who were dying of Aids in early 1990s.” While all of these monuments are made by artists, there are no commissions, and can be compared to an author dedicating a book to a loved one. “When an artist decides to make a portrait of someone close to them, they inscribe that person in history,” says Munsell. “They are working to amend and expand to include those who are dear to them.” While Confederate monuments and other historical monuments are being stripped down, new ones are going up. Yet these “other” monuments have always been around, and the Boston exhibition is a testament to that. “There should be a public conversation around every monument, but I also think that history needs to be reconciled,” says Munsell. “The damage done by the legacies these objects represent needs to be dealt with.” Monuments are mostly in public space, but isn’t the museum public space? “When we think art should live on hundreds of years into the future, it represents this sliver of time,” says Munsell. “Our art collection, in a way, is a monument.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"society/2018/jan/29/chelsea-fc-squalor-uk-illegal-housing-london","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-29T17:12:22Z","webTitle":"'I clean for Chelsea FC and live in squalor': inside illegal housing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jan/29/chelsea-fc-squalor-uk-illegal-housing-london","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/jan/29/chelsea-fc-squalor-uk-illegal-housing-london","fields":{"headline":"'I clean for Chelsea FC and live in squalor': inside illegal housing","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Freida Alves’ commute across London to clean at Chelsea football club’s stadium only takes an hour – but it might as well be a million miles away in terms of wealth, comfort and simple human decency. For years Alves has swept up after the fans at Stamford Bridge in Fulham. Her other duties, at the club’s state-of-the-art training base in Cobham, Surrey, have included laundering the players’ kits and cleaning the office of José Mourinho, the coach formerly in charge of a squad paid in excess of £1m a week by its billionaire owner, Roman Abramovich. Alves’ home, by contrast, is shocking in its squalor. She and her husband live in a single room in an illegal rooming house in Canning Town, east London, operated by a convicted rogue landlord. Their bed crawls with lice, a broken outside door lets in cold air constantly, there is no running water and just a filthy hot plate for cooking. They are not alone. Around a dozen low-paid workers live in this illegally converted solicitor’s office, paying £300 to £400 a month per room. The landlord and the company which owns the building have already been fined close to £30,000 for breaking housing regulations including over-occupancy, multiple fire safety breaches, mould and corrosion. But conditions which are unfit for human habitation persist. They are among more than 120,000 people in England and Wales estimated to be living in illegal houses of multiple occupation. More and more people are squeezing in together as high rents leave the poorest little choice but to rent shared properties. Exploitative landlords have also realised that local councils lack the resources or powers to stop them. Almost a third of houses of multiple occupation are now estimated by the government to be unlicensed - some 23,000 properties. Half of councils in England have served zero or just one enforcement notice under the Housing Act in the last year, according to information released under the Freedom of Information Act. The property on the Barking Road operated by a Ugandan bar owner, Lawrence Ssendege, is just one. There are no shared kitchen facilities and only one shared toilet and shower for the nine rooms in the complex, residents say. Frieda, a proud woman, refuses to use the filthy bathroom and instead goes across the road to the McDonald’s restaurant to wash and use the toilet. She is in a state of despair and holds her head in her hands almost constantly. “I cleaned for Mourinho, I put the players’ uniforms into washing machines and I was living here,” the cleaner told the Guardian, during an enforcement visit with officers from the London Borough of Newham and the London fire brigade. “I felt sad about that.” Her husband sifts rubbish by hand at a local recycling depot. He queues for 12-hour night shifts most evenings but there is not always work and he often returns to the room, unpaid. When Alves lifts the bed covers, black bugs scuttle across the sheets. The door to the fire escape is held shut with a piece of string and won’t close properly, so cold air flows in. A small electric heater fails to keep the cold at bay. Her room is filled with pots and pans and bags of rice, which she cooks on the filthy two ring hob. Residents come and go at all hours. Another resident said he has been there for a year and pays £300 to share with a room which has a small bathroom attached. He said that at one point, 20 people lived in the rooms. The illegal housing is accessed via a shabby door between a carpet shop and Ssendege’s restaurant, King’s Continental Cuisine. It was unlocked when the Guardian visited. A dark corridor leads to the shared ground floor bathroom which features a single toilet and a dirty shower. Worn stairs lead to the upper office floors which are subdivided into small rooms, sometimes with rough plasterboard partitions. Water leaks through the roof when it rains, soaking two storeys below, residents said. “People shouldn’t have to live like this,” said one. “I work hard to keep the roof over my head and I come home and it is like this. It is frustrating. I tried to find somewhere else but I can only afford £300. I would need to pay a £3,000 deposit and that is impossible.” A single room in a modern two-bedroom flat in the same area rents for over £860 a month. There are 25,000 households currently on the local authority’s housing waiting list. Other residents include a Portuguese recycling worker who shares a cramped room with another man and pays £300 a month. A warehouse worker from the Czech Republic said that last winter he lived for two and a half months with no electric light or heating in his room, which had been subdivided from his neighbour with roughly fixed plasterboard. He has a microwave but said: “I don’t cook, just takeaways.” Another resident works for Ssendege, 47, in his bar, kitchen and elsewhere in the building. Ssendege described him as a “porter” and said he pays him £100 to £150 a week. Last year Ssendege was fined £15,600 because of a lack of fire doors, holes in windows, electric hobs stationed in corridors, mould and corrosion. He was served with an enforcement notice by the London fire brigade for 10 failures including lack of fire alarm, lack of escape routes in the event of a blaze and inadequate measures to stop fire spreading between floors. He has since installed a fire alarm, but the fire brigade has said the building remains dangerous. The company that owns the building’s freehold is run by Kiritkumar Thakrar, a 63-year old British chartered surveyor from Edgware from whom Ssendege leases it. Thakrar’s company, Pambridge Properties Limited, was convicted two months ago of overcrowding and breaching fire safety conditions at this property and was fined £13,000. The company is registered to a car repair workshop in north London, which the current manager said Thakrar sold several years ago. Thakrar did not respond to a request for comment delivered to his semi-detached home in Edgware. The ownership of the building is ultimately held by a company in the secretive tax haven of Panama. Ssendege told the Guardian he wants to improve the property’s condition so it can be properly licensed but blamed the residents for the current condition. “The place used to be nice, but they don’t clean, they don’t do nothing,” he said. “They mess up the place completely. The doors don’t close because they damage them.” He claimed the residents do not pay rent because he wants them to leave so he can carry out works. This was denied by three of the residents the Guardian spoke to who said they did pay. He also said there was a shared kitchen in the building. When asked to show it to the Guardian he declined, citing the residents’ right to privacy. Two residents said there was no shared kitchen. Newham said it is running an “ongoing inquiry into the conditions inside the property and possible failures to license an HMO”.

Halfon, who sat in cabinet under David Cameron, suggested Theresa May could legislate for a public poll on NHS funding every 10 years to determine how much to increase spending on healthcare above inflation. His intervention comes as May faces growing calls from Conservatives to deal with the intense pressure on the NHS which is causing strain on beds, waiting times and ambulance services across the country. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has demanded an emergency budget to bail out the NHS as it suffers a winter crisis. Amid calls on the prime minister to consider radical solutions, Halfon said she could consider not just a new hypothecated tax to ringfence public spending on health and social care but give people the chance to decide how much more spending on the NHS there should be. He will set out his proposals in an article for the ConservativeHome website on Tuesday, arguing: “The guarantee would ensure that in a new 10-year plan for the NHS, spending would always go up in real terms – according to the needs of the population. “The public would then be able to decide how much they would increase funding beyond that real-terms rise. They would be given various options that would translate to, for example, however many extra nurses, doctors, treatments, or hospitals their spending would buy.” The MP for Harlow said he did not “believe for a moment that people would always vote for the lower option, given that, apart from the super rich, the vast majority of the population use the NHS”. “If the new NHS tax was hypothecated, they would understand what they were getting for their money,” he said. “Because the public would have a real decision-making role, it would decrease the complaints that the NHS was not getting the resources it needed.” He suggested such a mechanism was needed to challenge the argument that the Conservatives will always be behind Labour on the issue of the NHS – a case recently advanced to Tory MPs by May’s chief of staff, Gavin Barwell. Speaking separately on Monday, Nick Timothy, May’s former chief of staff, also gave his backing to a cash injection for the NHS. He told an event for the Resolution Foundation thinktank: “It feels increasingly clear that the country is tired of austerity and the public services are starting to feel the strain a little bit. “While the NHS needs reform, it also needs more money and I don’t think many people think the defence budget is sustainable. There’s quite a strong argument that fiscal policy needs to change.” Other prominent Conservative MPs to have suggested they could back higher taxes to pay for the NHS include Nick Boles, Jeremy Lefroy, Johnny Mercer, Sarah Wollaston and Dan Poulter."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jan/29/police-officer-rebuked-for-poppi-worthington-case-in-line-for-top-job","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-29T16:51:11Z","webTitle":"Police officer rebuked over Poppi Worthington case in line for top job","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jan/29/police-officer-rebuked-for-poppi-worthington-case-in-line-for-top-job","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jan/29/police-officer-rebuked-for-poppi-worthington-case-in-line-for-top-job","fields":{"headline":"Police officer rebuked over Poppi Worthington case in line for top job","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A senior police officer who was personally criticised for her handling of the Poppi Worthington case is set to be appointed as Cumbria’s chief constable. Calls mounted for a public inquiry into Cumbria police after Michelle Skeer, the deputy chief constable, was announced as the preferred candidate for the top job. Skeer was one of the Cumbria police officers criticised by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) over the force’s “unstructured and disorganised” investigation into the death of the 13-month-old in December 2012. A coroner ruled earlier this month that Poppi, “a fit and active, robust little girl”, suffocated after being sexually abused by her father, Paul Worthington. Worthington has been investigated several times over Poppi’s death but never charged and maintains his innocence. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) reviewed the evidence in 2016 and found there was “no realistic prospect” of a conviction after police failed to collect vital evidence. Cumbria’s police and crime commissioner, Peter McCall, announced on Monday that Skeer was the preferred candidate to become the force’s new chief constable following a “rigorous two-day selection process”. The move drew immediate criticism from John Woodcock, the MP for Barrow and Furness, who has fought for a public inquiry into the failed investigation into Poppi’s death. He said the announcement “gives fresh impetus to our calls for a public inquiry to restore confidence in the force”. In a report published in March last year, the IPCC criticised Skeer for failing to refer the case to the police watchdog or the force’s own misconduct department even though she was aware of possible conduct issues. The IPCC report said Skeer took more than a month to call a meeting to discuss scathing criticisms of the investigation into Poppi’s death made by a family court judge. The meeting only lasted 30 minutes, which “would not have been time to go through all the points raised in the judgment”, the watchdog said. The IPCC criticised Skeer for failing to alert the force’s professional standards department even though she “suspected there may be some conduct issues” arising from the bungled investigation. The watchdog went on to criticise Skeer for not referring the case to the IPCC. It said: “More than two months passed before the matter was even raised for the attention of the PSD [professional standards department] and even then it was as a result of contact with the IPCC rather than an internal decision.” The IPCC said it had not found any evidence to suggest that Skeer deliberately attempted to stop the matter coming to the attention of its investigators, but added that it was “reasonable to suggest that without IPCC intervention this matter may never have been referred to them”. Woodcock, who is the MP for Worthington’s constituency, said home secretary Amber Rudd should intervene and appoint someone independent if Skeer’s appointment was signed off by Cumbria’s police and crime commissioner."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/jan/29/turner-painting-export-bar-imposed-in-bid-to-keep-artwork-in-uk","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-29T15:56:42Z","webTitle":"Turner painting export bar imposed in bid to keep artwork in UK","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jan/29/turner-painting-export-bar-imposed-in-bid-to-keep-artwork-in-uk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/jan/29/turner-painting-export-bar-imposed-in-bid-to-keep-artwork-in-uk","fields":{"headline":"Turner painting export bar imposed in bid to keep artwork in UK","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A JMW Turner painting that was considered one of his finest to still be in private hands will leave the UK unless more than £18m can be found. The arts minister Michael Ellis has placed a temporary export bar on the painting Ehrenbreitstein, first exhibited at the Royal Academy of Arts in 1835 and which shows a magnificent ruined fortress perched on a cliff overlooking the Rhine near Koblenz, Germany. It was one of only six major Turner paintings owned privately and appeared at auction last April, selling to an overseas buyer. The temporary export bar allows time for a UK buyer to meet the asking price of £18,533,750, plus VAT of £306,750. Expert Lowell Libson, a member of the committee that advises the government, described it as “magnificent and beautifully preserved” and “one of Turner’s finest works of the period”. The committee made its recommendation on the grounds of the painting’s “outstanding significance” for the study of its status as a literary landscape and as a painting made primarily for engraving. The painting is based on material Turner collected when he visited the area in 1833 and is the only painting Turner produced of Ehrenbreitstein in oil. Ellis said said it was a painting that demonstrated Turner’s “extraordinary skill” depicting light, as well as the close relationship between painting and poetry. “I very much hope that it can remain in the UK, where it can be admired and appreciated by future generations for many years to come,” he added. The chances of such a large amount of money being raised are slim. In 2015-16, ministers imposed 21 temporary export bars on artworks, nine of which, worth £7m, were saved from going abroad."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"film/2018/jan/30/brave-rose-mcgowans-memoir-details-by-harvey-weinstein","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-30T00:01:03Z","webTitle":"Rose McGowan's memoir Brave details alleged rape by Harvey Weinstein","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jan/30/brave-rose-mcgowans-memoir-details-by-harvey-weinstein","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/jan/30/brave-rose-mcgowans-memoir-details-by-harvey-weinstein","fields":{"headline":"Rose McGowan's memoir Brave details alleged rape by Harvey Weinstein","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"After years of publicly accusing Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein of rape, the actor Rose McGowan has detailed the sexual assault she said occurred after their first meeting more than 20 years ago. In her memoir Brave, published on 30 January worldwide, McGowan recalled first seeing Weinstein, whom she refers to only as “the Monster”, at a screening of her film Going All the Way during the 1997 Sundance film festival. Then 23 years old, McGowan wrote in Brave that, after the screening, Weinstein allegedly summoned her to a meeting at a restaurant, which was later relocated to his hotel suite. McGowan described being shown to his room for what she believed would be a meeting to “plot out the grand arc of my career”. Instead, she alleged, after a half-hour discussion about her career, he held her down on the edge of a jacuzzi and raped her. Later he allegedly called her and described her as “a special friend”. “I felt so dirty. I had been so violated and I was sad to the core of my being. I kept thinking about how he’d been sitting behind me in the theater the night before it happened. Which made it – not my responsibility, exactly, but – like I had had a hand in tempting him,” she wrote. “Which made it even sicker and made me feel dirtier.” Describing Weinstein as looking like “a melted pineapple”, McGowan said that immediately after the rape, she attended a photo opportunity for Phantom, another Miramax film she was in, where she allegedly told a co-star what happened. The co-star, who has previously been identified by McGowan as Ben Affleck, reportedly said: “Goddamnit. I told him to stop doing that.” Affleck has never responded to this allegation. Many of Weinstein’s 80-odd accusers have alleged the disgraced media mogul asked them to visit him in various hotel rooms, where he’d either forcibly performed oral sex on them or demand it in turn. A spokesperson for Weinstein in the US told the Guardian: “Any allegations of non-consensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr Weinstein. Mr Weinstein has further confirmed that there were never any acts of retaliation against any women for refusing his advances.” “Mr Weinstein obviously can’t speak to anonymous allegations, but with respect to any women who have made allegations on the record, Mr Weinstein believes that all of these relationships were consensual.” Detailing her fight against “the machine, the manufacturers of myth, the gaslighters themselves, the sacred men of Hollywood”, McGowan detailed a troubled childhood while outlining her thoughts on misogyny in Hollywood and wider society. Beginning with her childhood growing up in the polygamous cult Children of God in Italy, the actor detailed her family’s escape to America after some leaders began advocating child abuse. After becoming a teenage runaway, enduring a three-year abusive relationship, and being sporadically homeless, McGowan said this background was instrumental in her decision to not press charges against Weinstein. “No work would land me back on the streets, and homelessness was a death sentence. I knew if I died I’d be remembered for revealing my rapist, but not for my achievements. I didn’t want his name next to mine on my obituary,” she wrote. Likening her career as an actor to being a sex worker, McGowan described her decision to shave her head as “a battle cry” against the pampering regime that she says once turned her into “the ultimate fantasy fuck toy by the Hollywood machine”. She wore the infamous “naked dress” to the 1998 MTV Awards as “a reclamation of my own body after my assault”, she claims and, at one point, described keeping fake blood and wounds on her face after filming episodes of the witchery drama Charmed to see how the public would react to a wounded woman. “Nobody asked to help me. Not once. They would just avoid eye contact and look down at the floor,” she wrote. In the book, she also detailed her relationship with the director Robert Rodriguez, who she claimed used his knowledge of Weinstein’s alleged assault to punish her, particularly in a scene in the film Planet Terror, in which a character played by Quentin Tarantino attempted to rape her. “I was in a backward world,” she wrote. “I was losing my grip on sanity.” Afterwards, in what McGowan intepreted as a cruel demonstration of power, Rodriguez sold the film to Miramax, Weinstein’s studio. In a statement to Vanity Fair, Rodriguez said the Weinsteins had priority on his next project at the time, and that the scene was “in every draft of the script since the first draft was issued to cast and crew [and] if there was any objection to the scene there was plenty of time to address it. It was never brought up as being an issue.” McGowan ends the book by calling for more women in producing and directing positions, and asks for the support of groups like Sag-Aftra to protect women and children, particularly the establishment of an anonymous tips line for victims of assault. This article was amended on 1 February 2018 to include the full name of the union Sag-Aftra."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"science/2018/jan/29/study-reveals-why-we-trust-some-strangers-and-not-others","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-29T20:00:00Z","webTitle":"Study reveals why we trust some strangers and not others","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/jan/29/study-reveals-why-we-trust-some-strangers-and-not-others","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2018/jan/29/study-reveals-why-we-trust-some-strangers-and-not-others","fields":{"headline":"Study reveals why we trust some strangers and not others","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"From getting into a taxi to asking a fellow train passenger to keep an eye on your luggage while buying a coffee, we’ve all put our trust in those we do not know. Now researchers have revealed that strangers are more likely to be trusted if they look like someone who has earned your trust before – and more likely to be distrusted if they resemble someone who has betrayed your faith in them. While previous research has shown how people can learn whether others are trustworthy over time, the team say it was unclear how an initial judgment is made about whether to trust or cooperate with someone. “What we wanted to figure out was what happens when you come across somebody for the first time,” said Dr Oriel FeldmanHall, co-author of the research and a social neuroscientist from Brown University. Writing in the journal PNAS, a team of researchers in the US reveal how they asked 29 participants to either keep $10 or invest all – or part – of it with one of three men they did not know but whose photographs they were shown. Over the course of 45 games, 15 for each photograph, participants discovered that while one of the three men frequently shared the profit from the investment, another only shared the money 60% of the time, while the third very rarely shared it at all. The team then carried out a second experiment in which participants were asked to pick a partner for a new game: either a player whose face they couldn’t see, or a player whose face they were shown in a photograph. While four were completely new faces, 54 photographs were images that had been tinkered with so the picture looked more or less like players from the previous game. Each photo was shown twice, and FeldmanHall says the team were careful to make sure they differed enough to be unrecognisable as the faces used in the first task. The results reveal that the more a possible player looked like the trusted individual from the previous game, the more likely participants were to select them as their partner for the next task, while an even stronger negative effect was found for those who resembled the untrustworthy man in the initial game. Just over 68% of participants turned down the pictured player if he bore any resemblance to the untrustworthy man. FeldmanHall noted the findings are similar to the seminal experiments in which Russian scientist Ivan Petrovich Pavlov’s dogs learned to associate the sound of a certain bell with food. “If Pavlov would ring a similar type of bell, the dog would also salivate – it would just salivate a little bit less,” said FeldmanHall. The team then carried out the same experiments with 28 new participants, while fMRI brain scanning took place. Among their findings, the team discovered that as the image of the potential candidate was tweaked to look more like the untrustworthy player of the initial game, activity in the amygdala – an area of the brain linked to processing threat – became stronger. Antonio Espín, a behavioural economist from Middlesex University, London, said the study’s implications could be wide-ranging. “Interestingly, since the main reason for facial similarity is shared genes, the study not only advances our understanding of why we trust or distrust specific strangers but also has broader implications, for example for ethnic or racial discrimination and in the evolutionary arena of partner selection.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jan/29/grenfell-fire-pensioner-heart-attack-bedsit","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-29T15:30:32Z","webTitle":"Grenfell fire: pensioner suffers heart attack while revisiting bedsit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jan/29/grenfell-fire-pensioner-heart-attack-bedsit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jan/29/grenfell-fire-pensioner-heart-attack-bedsit","fields":{"headline":"Grenfell fire: pensioner suffers heart attack while revisiting bedsit","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A pensioner who is still waiting to be rehoused after the Grenfell Tower fire has suffered a heart attack while revisiting the bedsit he can no longer live in. Winston Dowarris, 69, was woken on the night of the fire by bits of cladding and other debris blowing into his bedroom through an open window. His bedsit on Hurstway Walk is opposite Grenfell Tower and he witnessed people trapped inside their flats as the blaze swept the building. As the fire took hold, he spoke on the phone to a childhood friend who later died in the fire. Dowarris, who has skin cancer, is too traumatised by what he witnessed on the night of the fire to continue living there. While visiting the flat to collect his post Dowarris collapsed in pain. He managed to contact a friend, who called 999, and Dowarris was rushed to Hammersmith hospital, where he underwent an emergency angioplasty. He was discharged on Sunday evening although he does not have any stable accommodation. He is temporarily sleeping on a friend’s sofa. Dowarris has been suffering from panic attacks and flashbacks since the fire. He says he was overcome by a panic attack as he approached his block of flats and believes this is what caused his heart attack. Dowarris, who was born in Jamaica, has lived in the UK since he was six years old and worked as a painter and decorator. His daughter is six months pregnant and he is determined to stay alive to meet his grandchild. “Hurstway Walk is still my address but after collapsing and having a heart attack there, I will never return to live at that bedsit,” he said. “I lived in that bedsit for about six years. It was just one room and it was awful. My oncologist contacted the council and the tenant management organisation many times before the fire asking them to rehouse me and saying that the accommodation wasn’t suitable for a person suffering from cancer. But nothing was done to rehouse me. “I asked six times to be rehoused after the fire but still I was given no accommodation.” Dowarris hopes the council will finally do something about his accommodation now he is recovering from heart surgery. “They have taken so much from me but I’m not going to let them take my life away. My daughter is due to give birth in a few months’ time and I want to be around for that. The doctors who treated me for my heart attack said I need to rest now and minimise stress but how can I do that when I don’t have any proper place to live?” A spokesperson for Kensington and Chelsea council said: “We cannot comment on individual cases, but we have sought assurances from hospital staff and we will be referring this issue to the Care for Grenfell team. We understand the trauma that many people are experiencing as a result of the Grenfell tragedy, and we’re doing everything we can to ensure everyone affected has the help they need, including helping people find alternative accommodation away from the Lancaster West estate if they need it. A spokeswoman for Imperial College Healthcare NHS trust said: “All discharges at the trust will only take place if a patient is medically fit and it is safe to do so. Many other factors come into play, including ensuring patients have appropriate accommodation to go to and have follow-up care and support in place as needed.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global/2018/feb/03/actors-condemn-woody-allen-hadley-freeman","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-03T09:00:16Z","webTitle":"Actors are lining up to condemn Woody Allen.

Atwood’s crime was to sign a 2016 petition calling for due process in the case of a former University of British Columbia professor accused of sexual misconduct. “If the legal system is bypassed because it is seen as ineffectual, what will take its place?” Atwood wrote last week. “In times of extremes, extremists win. Their ideology becomes a religion, anyone who doesn’t puppet their views is seen as an apostate, a heretic or a traitor, and moderates in the middle are annihilated… The aim of ideology is to eliminate ambiguity.” Moderation is not cool now, politically or morally, and when it comes to responding to suggestions of sexual misconduct it is seen as fence-sitting, even enabling. Some have argued that following Atwood’s logic would lead to letting Harvey Weinstein and others like him off the hook – men who have been accused of sexual misconduct but not actually charged with anything (yet). But when I read Atwood’s piece I didn’t think of those recent cases. I thought of Woody Allen. The Allen saga has always had a shape-shifting quality. Back in 1992, shortly after it emerged that Allen was having an affair with Mia Farrow’s 20-year-old daughter, Farrow accused him of molesting their adopted seven-year-old daughter, Dylan. The public response to this mess has altered with the times. In the 90s people seemed weirded out more by Allen’s relationship with Soon-Yi, to whom he has now been married for more than 20 years, than by the suggestion he might have molested a child. But in 2014, as a new wave of feminism was cresting, Dylan and her brother Ronan made a push for their father to be held accountable for what they allege he did; and increasingly, people have listened. Last week Amazon Studios was said to be considering ending its relationship with him, while actors have been falling over themselves to create some distance from Allen, having apparently just heard about these 26-year-old allegations. This is understandable in the case of Timothée Chalamet, who wasn’t born until 1995, but more mystifying in the case of Colin Firth, who was all of 32 in 1992 and, presumably, able to read the newspapers. As I said, times change. Today, Allen’s name is so toxic that it feels almost transgressive to talk about him as an individual case and not lumped together with Roman Polanski, a child rapist, and Bill Cosby, currently awaiting re-trial for sexual assault. But Polanski was convicted and, in the case of Cosby, multiple allegations quickly followed the first. Allen may yet face criminal proceedings, but in the past 26 years the only new development has been the emergence of Moses Farrow, Dylan’s older brother, who has become increasingly vocal about the abuse he claims he suffered at the hands of his mother; he claims Farrow brainwashed her children about Allen. Dylan has dismissed her brother’s allegations as “irrelevant”. But why is one child’s claim of abuse irrelevant and another’s urgent? It’s worth re-establishing some truths about the original case, which is too complicated to fit within the black-and-white outlines some now draw around it. To say that Allen was never charged is not a defence of him, but it is a statement of fact. Two separate investigations, in 1992 and 1993, concluded that he had not abused Dylan. A state attorney subsequently said he had “probable cause” to prosecute; but during Farrow and Allen’s custody battle, Allen’s relationship with Dylan was described by a doctor as “not sexual” but “inappropriately intense, because it excluded everybody else”. The case is far from clear-cut. I get why people feel icky about Allen. Some of us were rolling our eyes at Manhattan, his film about a man’s relationship with a schoolgirl, before the leading lights of #MeToo were born. But this is not a case that should be tried by public opinion, and I find it extraordinary that people point to Allen’s relationship with Soon-Yi and his films as evidence for the prosecution, as if his fondness for pairing much younger women and older men is proof of paedophilia. Young women are not little girls. MeToo emerged because so many women have lost faith in the justice system. Too many victims have been silenced – but that is not the situation in Dylan Farrow’s case. Justice is not “Believe all women”, as I’ve seen many people claim; it is “Listen to all women”. And now that women are being listened to, we need to decide what to do with this long-awaited power. How do we handle ambiguity, and the right to a presumption of innocence? Condemnation needs to have real substance, or this much-needed movement risks becoming meaningless."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/30/nhs-crisis-jeremy-hunt","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-30T06:00:12Z","webTitle":"Here are six ways to save the NHS, Mr Hunt.

Trust me I’m a doctor","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Dear Jeremy, First of all, congratulations on still being in the job! At this rate, you should probably consider measuring up for curtains at No 10. Maybe you could reuse a few pairs from some of the A&amp;E departments you’re closing down? But I’m writing because I need a word. You know the sick, wheezing patient who has been under your care for the past five years – the NHS? You recently claimed there wasn’t a crisis despite thundering evidence to the contrary and you have pretended that cancelling a month of operations and outpatient clinics is a perfectly normal thing to do. But just ask anyone who works in a hospital, or has been to one recently (and I don’t mean a ministerial grand tour of freshly painted corridors and a quick peek at the one MRI scanner that isn’t knackered). Your patient is currently critically ill, bordering on terminal, and you are pursuing a dangerous course. I’m here to offer you a second opinion and, since I know you relish the brevity of Twitter, I’ve summarised my treatment plan in six easy-to-follow steps. 1 Stop blaming the patient The NHS is fit for purpose and it’s time to give up stoking the malicious rumour there is something ineluctably unsustainable about it. Of course it’s a different service from when it was established in the 1940s, but it was actually working perfectly well until … umm … about five years ago. It’s easy to blame an ageing population, but life expectancy has increased by only about the length of a Corrie omnibus since you took the reins. The much-blamed “expensive new drugs” were already in use then too. If you honestly don’t want to dismantle the service, kill off this lie. 2 Invest in doctors and nurses The NHS is all about the people who work there, beleaguered and exhausted as they may be. Having worked as an obstetrician in the NHS for seven years, I realise that it truly is a calling – nobody’s there to get rich – but that doesn’t mean staff should be expected to take a vow of poverty. In real terms, pay has fallen by more than 10% since 2010, when your mob took over. Thanks to the number of GPs decreasing year on year, we now boast one of the highest numbers of patients per doctor in the western world. Doctor Legg single-handedly patching up the entire borough of Walford in EastEnders has now become the reality of primary care. Those who remain behind are stressed and burned out, whizzing through patient appointments like they’re fast-forwarding through a disappointing drama. In these tiny snatches of patient-doctor contact, what’s going unseen or unsaid? It’s unreasonable, unsustainable and unsafe for patients. And for doctors too – there are record levels of stress-related leave, and the suicide rate among young medics is tragically increasing. In our hospitals, with morale 6ft deep and gaps in the rota turning every day into a nightmare, it’s no wonder half of junior doctors are parachuting out of the profession. Encourage new blood to join and existing talent to stay, and all-out crisis may be averted. Wait any longer and the damage will be irreversible. 3 Don’t be afraid to have grown-up discussions British people love the NHS. It’s not like any other publicly owned entity. We don’t love the Bank of England or Cardiff airport, but we love the NHS. It delivered us when we were born, fixed our broken arm on sports day, gave our nan chemo, treated the chlamydia we brought back from Kavos, and one day will zip us up in a bag. I promise you we’ll do whatever it takes to keep the NHS going. I think you will be surprised how much we are prepared to pay for it. Whether that’s in the form of income tax, death tax or some special NHS levy, we’ll do it. Just have the discussion. 4 Share the pain We get it, nobody wants to raise taxes and find themselves speeding towards a drubbing at the ballot box, so how about you establish a cross-party parliamentary body with responsibility for long-term NHS strategy and budgeting? You know, like an away day with people you never normally talk to at work but you might well bond with over a love of … well, life. That way the burden of “unpopular” decisions like raising taxes can be shared, rather than overturned or sidelined by flighty politicians who only care about being in power, or have half an eye on their lucrative non-executive role in a private healthcare firm. Not you, of course. I wouldn’t suggest that for a second. 5 Spend wisely You’re a big fan of pointing at so-called health tourism as a huge drain on the NHS. Tasty headline-grabber it may be, but it’s manifestly not a major problem – costing just 0.3% of the NHS budget. It’s dwarfed by colossal expenditure on criminally high PFI interest payments. Isn’t it time hospitals got out of their chokeholds and these debts were renegotiated – maybe do something clever or legal, or use your charm … oh never mind – so we can redirect these wasted billions towards actually saving lives? And saving lives doesn’t just mean spending money on hospitals and GP surgeries. Now that the shiny new plaque on your door also says “social care” maybe you could fling a few coins in that direction too. Hospitals are at or beyond full capacity because there is nowhere to discharge a huge proportion of our inpatients, following years of cuts. Huge cuts are also slated for public health spending – could you reconsider that? Prevention is better than cure, and if we educate people on the best ways to keep healthy and alive – not hoovering up polyunsaturated fats like they were oxygen, maybe – perhaps we could future-proof the NHS a bit better. 6 A private word We know you love a jumble sale, but try not to flog off too much more of the NHS to the nearest snake-tongued bidder with fistfuls of notes. Private entities should not be taking public cash to provide public services. Every penny that becomes profit for shareholders is a penny that should have been spent on the NHS. Easy, right? Listen to my advice and I predict a long and healthy life. I’ll see you for follow-up in six weeks.

Why, the sum of the numbers of the asteroids named after them of course. The question formed part of the puzzling quagmire that is the Royal Statistical Society’s Christmas quiz, an annual test of general knowledge, logic, and lateral thinking, full answers to which can be found below. “The 2017 RSS Christmas quiz was one of the toughest yet, so we were delighted to receive so many high-quality submissions,” said its quizmaster, Dr Tim Paulden. However, there was one clear winner: David Harris from Edinburgh, who submitted an “almost flawless set of answers” and receives a subscription to the society’s magazine, Significance. Solutions 1 …GO! [10 points] (a) All six are named “Aloysius”: Aloysius Snuffleupagus from Sesame Street, who is friends with Big Bird; Police Chief Aloysius from It’s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World; Aloysius, the teddy bear from Brideshead Revisited, who was modelled on John Betjeman’s teddy bear, Archibald Ormsby-Gore; Aloysius O’Hare from The Lorax, whose name evokes Chicago O’Hare; Aloysius the janitor from The Hudsucker Proxy; Aloysius Pig from Garfield and Friends/US Acres. (b) All six have the surname “Parker”: Eleanor Parker, known as “Woman of a Thousand Faces”; Ray Parker Jr, writer of the Ghostbusters theme; Dorothy Parker, a founding member of the Algonquin Round Table (also known as the Vicious Circle); Bonnie Parker of Bonnie and Clyde; Trey Parker, co-writer of The Book of Mormon and South Park and the voice of Balthazar in Despicable Me 3; Sarah Jessica Parker, regularly seen with Kim Cattrall, Kristin Davis, and Cynthia Nixon in Sex and the City. (c) In Thunderbirds, FAB 1 is a pink, six-wheeled car, FAB 2 is a yacht, and FAB 3 is a racehorse – all owned by the character Lady Penelope Creighton-Ward. The clue obtained by combining parts (a) and (b) is “Aloysius Parker”, who appears in the show as Lady Penelope’s butler and the driver of FAB 1. The question title (…GO!) alludes to the famous catchphrase: “Thunderbirds Are Go!” 2 POLYMERISATION [4 points] The polymer £5 note introduced in 2016 features the quote “I have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears and sweat” (initial letters IHNTOBBTTAS), while the new polymer £10 note features the quote “I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading!” (initial letters IDAATINELR). The polymer £20, scheduled for release in 2020, will feature the quote “Light is therefore colour” – so the answer is LITC. 3 ROCK LEGENDS [9 points] As hinted at by the question title, and the reference to “outlandish” arithmetic, this question concerns asteroids or minor planets (“rocks”) named after famous people (“legends”). The bizarre arithmetic in the question is correct when applied to the official numbers of these asteroids, according to the International Astronomical Union’s Minor Planet Center. (A searchable list can be found online at the Wikipedia page “List of minor planets named after people”.) In order, the sets of initials in the question refer to the following individuals (with the corresponding numbered asteroids indicated in brackets): William Shakespeare (2985 Shakespeare) + Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (3047 Goethe) = Alfred Bernhard Nobel (6032 Nobel) Albert Einstein (2001 Einstein) + Charles Robert Darwin (1991 Darwin) = Wilhelm Richard Wagner (3992 Wagner) Edmund Percival Hillary (3130 Hillary) + Hendrik Johannes Cruijff (14282 Cruijff) = Thomas Sean Connery (13070 Seanconnery) + Sigismund Schlomo Freud (4342 Freud) Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn (4511 Rembrandt) + Johannes Chrysostomus Wolfgangus Theophilus Mozart (1034 Mozartia) = Galileo Galilei (697 Galilea) + Tutankhamun (4848 Tutenchamun) Bilbo Baggins (2991 Bilbo) + Johannes Gensfleisch zur Laden zum Gutenberg (777 Gutemberga) = Norma Jeane Mortenson (3768 Monroe) Carl Edward Sagan (2709 Sagan) + Edwin Eugene Aldrin Jr (6470 Aldrin) = Louis Daniel Armstrong (9179 Satchmo) Thomas Alva Edison (742 Edison) + Christopher Columbus (327 Columbia) = Max Karl Ernst Ludwig Planck (1069 Planckia) Dmitri Ivanovich Mendeleev (2769 Mendeleev) + Christian Andreas Doppler (3905 Doppler) = Paul Cézanne (6674 Cézanne) The person represented by the question mark is Prof James Moriarty, the archenemy of Sherlock Holmes, since (3047 Goethe) + (2001 Einstein) = (5048 Moriarty). As several entrants highlighted, Prof Moriarty is a particularly appropriate choice here, as he authored the fictional book The Dynamics of an Asteroid. 4 CAN YOU DIG IT? [11 points] Each answer contains the name of a digit (“zero” through to “nine”, in order), split across two words: MansizeRooster (by Supergrass); Don’t Go Near The Water; The Lost World (the Arthur Conan Doyle novel where Prof Challenger first appeared); Gareth Rees; World Of Our Own (an anagram of “NOW FOR LOUD ROW”); Earl of Iveagh; Pope Pius IX; Everything’s Eventual (a collection of short stories by Stephen King, who ordered them using playing cards), Totleigh Towers (with the “Plum” in the clue being PG Wodehouse); and Hanin Elias (co-founder of Atari Teenage Riot, name-checked in the song Hot Topic by Le Tigre). A clue to the connection is provided by the question title, which contains the word “digit” split in the same fashion. 5. … JOE [5 points] (a) The three film titles are The Moderns (featuring Geneviève Bujold, Geraldine Chaplin, John Lone, Keith Carradine, Kevin J O’Connor, Linda Fiorentino and Wallace Shawn), The Meaning of Life” (Eric Idle, Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Michael Palin, Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones), and The Comedians (Alec Guinness, Elizabeth Taylor, Peter Ustinov and Richard Burton). The first title, The Moderns, appears within the last three words of question 5b, if case and spacing are ignored. The connection is that each of the three titles contains the name of a type of average (mode, mean, median) – which ties back to the question title via the phrase “Average Joe”. (b) Between 2008 and 2011, the character Mainframe from GI Joe (a second connection to the question title “… Joe”) was renamed Dataframe – a term that any modern statistician who uses statistical software will recognise. He would certainly feel at home in question 1, as his real name is Blaine L Parker. 6 INK-COGNITO [6 points] The left ink blotch obscures the number 395, while the right ink blotch obscures the numbers 86637 and 15913. Here is one approach to reach the answer. Consider firstly the top line, where all the numbers are visible. For each number N on the left-hand side, if we multiply together the four other numbers on the left-hand side, add one, and then divide by N, we obtain the corresponding number appearing on the right-hand side. To illustrate, for the first number (N=2) we find that (3 x 11 x 23 x 31 + 1)/2 = 11765; similarly, for the second number (N=3), we find that (2 x 11 x 23 x 31 + 1)/3 = 5229; and so on. For this pattern to hold for the second line as well, the left blotch must obscure the number 395, since (3 x 7 x 47 x 395 + 1)/2 = 194933. The numbers obscured by the right blotch can then be calculated as (2 x 7 x 47 x 395 + 1)/3 = 86637 and (2 x 3 x 47 x 395 + 1)/7 = 15913. The two sets of whole numbers given on the left – (2, 3, 11, 23, 31) and (2, 3, 7, 47, 395) – are very unusual, because the five right-hand side numbers generated by the above process are also whole numbers. These are, in fact, the only two sets of five whole numbers with this property (unless some of the numbers on the left or right are allowed to be equal to 1). Larger sets that follow the same pattern are also possible – for instance, (2, 3, 7, 47, 583, 1223) is such a six-number set. As several entrants noted, the reference to “Stefan” in the question text is a nod to Štefan Znám, who studied sets of numbers with this property. (For further information, search online for “Znám’s problem”.) 7 OD &amp; DS [8 points] A question of “odds &amp; ends” – in the first two quotes, only the odd-numbered letters of each word are visible, while in the final two quotes, only the two letters at the end of each word are visible. (The two words in the question title have been transformed similarly, with “odds” becoming “od”, and “ends” becoming “ds”.) All four of the quotes have a statistical flavour: “The best thing about being a statistician is that you get to play in everyone’s backyard.” [John Tukey] “Politicians use statistics in the same way that a drunk uses lamp-posts – for support rather than illumination.” [Andrew Lang] “Statistical thinking will one day be as necessary for efficient citizenship as the ability to read and write.” [Herbert George Wells] “Statisticians, like artists, have the bad habit of falling in love with their models.” [George EP Box] 8 OLIVE (_____GREEN) [8 points] The eight clues all refer to Santa’s reindeer – in order: Dasher (the nickname of Kevin Wheatley, an Australian recipient of the Victoria Cross); Dancer (a film by Steven Cantor about the Ukrainian dancer Sergei Polunin); Prancer (a reference to the Tartan Prancer in National Lampoon’s Vacation); Vixen (Rorie’s sweetheart in Mary Elizabeth Braddon’s 1879 novel, Vixen); Comet (the role played by dog actor Air Buddy in Full House – the term “boat” is poker slang for a full house); Cupid (Johnny Nash’s cover of the famous Sam Cooke song – the second line being “And let your arrow flow”); Donner (the character who falls downstairs in Tom Stoppard’s Artist Descending a Staircase, and is found by Martello and Beauchamp); and Blitzen (a miniaturised computer system designed for Nasa in the 1980s). Of course, the missing reindeer name is Rudolph, who shares his name with Alan Rudolph, the director of The Moderns from question 5a. Alan Rudolph is linked to question 1b via the film Mrs Parker and the Vicious Circle, which he directed. This film is centred on Dorothy Parker, and the cast includes Sarah Jessica Parker’s spouse, Matthew Broderick. The list of eight reindeer-based clues in the first part of this question omitted Rudolph, and could therefore be said to feature “all of the other reindeer” – a lyric from Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer that has famously been misheard by some listeners as “Olive, the other reindeer”. A misheard lyric such as this is known as a mondegreen – hence the cryptic question title, in which the letters “MONDE” have been omitted from “OLIVE (MONDEGREEN)”. 9 STRENGTH IN NUMBERS [12 points] (a) The table identifies, by their initials, musical artists or groups that have released UK-charting singles (S) or albums (A) whose titles are years in the 20th or 21st century – with the year being indicated by the first column. To qualify for inclusion, the title must be a four-digit number in the appropriate range (with no additional words or symbols) and must appear in the UK Official Charts archive (www.officialcharts.com/archive). In cases where the same title is shared by multiple artists or groups, all options are recorded in the table, separated by slashes. As many entrants noted, the question title cryptically hints at this theme – we are interested in musical “numbers” (both literally, and figuratively) with enough “strength” to register on the Official Charts. (Moreover, the title Strength in Numbers appears within the archive as a single and album by the band Music – appropriately enough.) The completed table contains the following items (which, strictly speaking, entrants should have represented as initials – eg NO for New Order): SINGLES (column S) – 1962 by Grass-Show; 1963 by New Order; 1973 by James Blunt; 1979 by Smashing Pumpkins; 1980 by Estelle; 1985 by Bowling For Soup; 1991 by Azealia Banks; 1998 by Binary Finary; 1999 by Binary Finary/Prince/Paradox (Featuring Devorah); 2000 by Binary Finary. ALBUMS (column A) – 1916 by Motörhead; 1965 by Afghan Whigs; 1977 by Ash/Jam; 1982 by Status Quo; 1984 by Eurythmics/Rick Wakeman/Van Halen; 1987 by Whitesnake; 1989 by Ryan Adams/Taylor Swift; 1992 by Game; 1999 by Cassius/Prince; 2001 by Dr Dre. The Jam album 1977 and the Whitesnake album 1987 in the above list were both released very recently (November 2017) – which served as the original inspiration for the question. Finally, the inclusion of the item marked with an asterisk (1982 by Status Quo) is debatable, as the title is rendered as “1+9+8+2” by some sources – but it is included in the table as it appears in the archive as 1982. (b) These decimal numbers respectively represent 7/11 by Beyoncé, 7/27 by Fifth Harmony, and 2√231 by Anticappella. (The symbol appearing before 231 is a square root sign.) All of these releases appear as singles or albums within the UK Official Charts archive. (c) The answer is 4x4=12 by deadmau5, a Canadian who wears a large mouse head as a mask during performances. This calculation is clearly wrong in our standard base 10 counting system, but it is correct in base 14 (where the number sixteen is written as “12”). Once again, this release appears in the albums section of the UK Official Charts archive. 10 BIZARRE TALES [7 points] Dropping one letter from each word (as indicated by “almost all”) and then anagramming gives the names of nine prominent scientists/engineers: EDISON, ARCHIMEDES, HOPPER, DESCARTES, CURIE, BOHR, HERTZ, DIRAC and THOMSON. The word that is left over (ie formed by the nine omitted letters) is INTESTINE; applying the same transformation (omitting a letter, and anagramming) produces EINSTEIN. The remaining letter, T, symbolises TESLA – another scientist. This final answer is hinted at by the question title, since TESLA is an anagram of TALES. 11 JUMPIN’ JIVES [6 points] Question 11 concerns authors who have book titles containing multiples of 11 – specifically, the first column of the table provides an encrypted version of the author’s first name, while the second column indicates which multiple of 11 is present. The encryption scheme being applied to the first column is the Atbash cipher, which simply turns the alphabet “upside-down” (ie A maps to Z, B maps to Y, and so on). The unencrypted names are therefore “Joseph”, “Tom”, “Dean”, “Frederic”, “Bill”, “Stephen” and “Laurie” respectively. Moving to the second column, if we regard the Greek letter “Xi” on each row as representing the number 11 (by analogy with the Roman numeral XI), and treat the number beforehand as a multiplier, we find that the second column is a cryptic representation of the values 22, 44, 77, 99, 451, 1001, 1408, and 1793 respectively. Combining these two columns of information, solvers should then have deduced that the seven first names refer respectively to Joseph Heller (Catch 22), Tom Rob Smith (Child 44), Dean Koontz (77 Shadow Street), Frédéric Beigbeder (99 Francs), Bill Willingham (1001 Nights of Snowfall), Stephen King (1408), and Laurie Halse Anderson (Fever 1793). The remaining number, 451, immediately suggests Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury, which means that the empty cell should read “Izb” – the Atbash encoding of “Ray”. The majority of entrants correctly noted that the popular Netflix series Stranger Things (which was highlighted in italics within the question text) features an alternate dimension called the Upside-Down – making the use of an “upside-down” cipher particularly appropriate. However, only a handful of entrants also spotted that the main character in Stranger Things is called Eleven – the number that links all the titles in the question. There is also one further connection hidden in the bizarre question title, JUMPIN’ JIVES – Eleven’s real name is Jane Ives (ie “J Ives”), and so the title is a hint that the question involves numbers that jump up in steps of “J Ives” (ie multiples of 11). For completeness, it is worth noting that Eleven also has an alternative name of Jane Hopper – which provides another connection to “jumping” – and that Stephen King’s short story 1408 appears in the collection Everything’s Eventual, which featured in question 4. However, neither of these observations were required to score full marks. 12 GUIDING AMERICA [7 points] (a) If we combine the standard US state / territory abbreviations corresponding to the capital cities named in the question, we obtain MA + LA + WI = MALAWI, a country in south-east Africa, and VI + CT + OR + IA = VICTORIA, which points to the Australian state, the Canadian city, or Victoria Falls and Lake Victoria (which are partially located, respectively, in Zambia and Tanzania – both adjacent to Malawi). For the final part, someone about to head down a CO + AL + MI + NE = COALMINE might obtain added peace of mind by bringing along a “Canary” (perhaps even Big Bird from question 1?) Even the most eagle-eyed of our entrants did not spot that the question title, “GUIDING AMERICA”, also follows the same pattern as MALAWI, VICTORIA and COALMINE, being composed of seven further US state / territory abbreviations (ignoring the space between the words): GU + ID + IN + GA + ME + RI + CA. This was the only available point in the quiz that went unclaimed by any entrant – so many congratulations if you spotted this link. (b) The “halfway” relationships stated in the question are satisfied by the three-letter abbreviations for the respective countries (ISO ALPHA-3), when considered letter by letter. For instance, GNQ (Equatorial Guinea) is halfway between AGO (Angola) and MUS (Mauritius), since the letter G is halfway between A and M, the letter N is halfway between G and U, and the letter Q is halfway between O and S. In the same way, NOR is halfway between SLV and IRN, FJI is halfway between ESP and GAB, and IRL is halfway between KOR and GUF. The required answer is therefore the country whose three-letter code lies halfway between SAU and USA, which is Tajikistan (TJK). 13. PRESENT PERFECT [7 points] The smallest possible number of moves required for Rudolph to deliver the presents and return to the North Pole is 30, and this can be achieved by the following route (and numerous others): D4 - E2 - G3 - F1 - E3 - G2 - G4 - F2 - E4 - D2 - B1 - A3 - C2 - C4 - B2 - D1 - D3 - B4 - A2 - A4 - A6 - A7 - C6 - C7 - D5 - E7 - G6 - G7 - F5 - D6 - D7 (This particularly elegant solution, which methodically visits the four quarters of the board in turn, was submitted by Maurice Cox, Alistair Forbes, Andy Knott, and Sam Knott.) A route with fewer than 30 moves is impossible, since Rudolph must visit an empty (non-present) square immediately before visiting A2 or G2, and also immediately after visiting A7 or G7. It is easy to see that these empty squares cannot overlap (i.e. the exit square from A7 or G7 cannot serve as the entry square for A2 or G2), which means that Rudolph must visit at least four empty squares along the route. Since he can only make at most one present delivery per move, and at least one additional move is required to return to the North Pole (D7), the minimum total number of moves is 25 + 1 + 4 = 30. This reasoning demonstrates that a 30-move solution, such as the one given above, must be “perfect” – i.e. no shorter route can possibly exist.

Can’t live with them, can’t stop obsessing about their snowsuits. Still rocking from the revelations elicited from Donald Trump by Piers Morgan on ITV at the weekend – that he has met Morgan before and definitely remembers him, that he is super successful in everything he does, and that he feels love for all people – we greet the week with a significant shift of the intersection point between politics and money. Rally Trump was trenchantly anti-globalisation; Victory Trump was savagely anti-elites. Campaigning in green ink and governing in poison pen, he never essayed that Clintonian Davos sheen, the smooth, luxurious world where billionaires were doing everybody else a favour and heads of state moved respectfully among them by invitation. Donald Trump was, reasonably enough given his bellicose protectionist rhetoric, viewed with fear and scorn by the globe’s high net worth individuals, his own net worth notwithstanding. That changed pretty easily: he gave a speech with the accent on transnational cooperation, ardently desirous of mutually beneficial deals, offering a full complement of sympatico ideas – tax cuts for the rich, deregulation, an end to environmental hooey – and went away Davos’s darling. British Conservatives are coagulating around the Boris Johnson view, that Trump should be cultivated any way he wishes, since our prosperity is more important than any of that values flim-flam. But perhaps more surprising is the ease with which the international financial elites have decided to weather the wall-building, Muslim-banning, white-supremacist, hyper-bordered politics that the US president represents. A cultivated, colour-blind internationalism always seemed so axiomatic to free-market fundamentalism. If people can’t move then only capital can move; if only capital can move, it’s not a free market. This, it transpired, was just an elegant thought experiment, a “what-if?” idea to be floated in side meetings and over dinners. If push came to shove, a very different worldview, of continent against continent, religion against religion or race against race was fine too, so long as the trade survived. It would be disingenuous to express real surprise – you don’t go to Davos for unwavering values and internal consistency. Yet it’s still interesting to watch their ideological fig leaves blow about in the gusts of political turbulence. Every year since the financial crash give or take a year or two talking about only that and their wholly innocent part in it, the Davos crowd have spent a lot of time talking about equality. The answers are generally found at the level of the individual – a bit more philanthropy from the rich, a bit more aspiration from the poor, chuck in some technological innovation (could we build an app to tell Bangladeshi fishermen where the fish have moved since the typhoon? Let’s get on it, folks! Iterate!) and the task is in hand. They are rarely confronted, internally, with the basic building blocks of equality: that before you embark on any programmes of micro-investment packages for shack entrepreneurs you have to consider whether wages are high enough for workers to feed themselves, and their families, and also pay rent. Where that isn’t the case, any conversation that isn’t about wages – and therefore isn’t about unionisation, outsourcing, shareholder value maximisation, the distribution of profit between capital and labour, the gap between CEO and average pay, and actually, more as a coda, higher rate tax (wouldn’t it be novel if earnings at the top weren’t so high that their taxation could have a determining effect on the economy at large?) – is diversionary. Even externally, protest against their deliberate and self-satisfied myopia is kept to a minimum, compared to, say, the crowds that once gathered outside meetings of the G8. To have a gathering surrounded by snow, only really accessible by helicopter, and liberated of the need for protection, is probably the most intelligent move the international elite have ever made. Fairly or unfairly, when you can only meet behind barbed wire and jauntily dressed Swiss policemen, it makes you look as if you’re up to no good. This year, however, Labour’s John McDonnell arrived, to put the attendants “on notice”. They couldn’t distribute upwards forever. People had begun to realise. His speech itself was blunt and sounded a bit like your uncle, unaccountably in a room with the leading lights of British football, complaining that the high wages and attendant ticket costs were pricing out the fans. You couldn’t disagree with his point, but the sheer incongruity of seeing him make it was nerve-shredding, as if they’d invited him in at the apotheosis of their triumph to laugh at afterwards, maybe throw some pies. Yet something lingered that should unsettle Davos man: the unstoppable egalitarian language is meeting immovable forces. Whether in the shape of Trump, busting his way into acceptance, racism and all, or McDonnell, insistently rejecting the trickle-down principles by which a belief in equality and a dizzying concentration of wealth can be held in equipoise, the foremost institutions of modern capitalism are being confronted with their own contradictions. The trajectory is shared with last week’s revelations about the Presidents Club that powerful men talked a great boardroom game about gender equality then met for an annual chuckle over it, surrounded by women they’d paid to dress as the instruments of their pleasure. This cannot have arrived as fresh news to any insiders; it is doubtful that it came as a huge surprise to anyone on the newspaper that broke the story. What it represents is not so much a discovery as the end of a code of silence around a hypocrisy so well known that it previously would have sounded naive to mention. In the immediate panic following the announcement of the emperors’ nakedness, they’re liable to take solace in the commentators who insist that, on the contrary, their clothes are quite visible, or a Trump figure, telling them clothes don’t matter. Nothing, from the grope-and-tell exposé to the arrival of a Marxist at the temple of the market, is the end of the story; but the power of the financiers’ narrative lay in a graceful aversion of our eyes, away from the gaps between what they said and what they did. We have lost our tact, and might thereby rediscover our power. • Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2018/jan/29/french-investigate-nutella-deal-brawls","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-29T14:57:08Z","webTitle":"French fraud officials investigate Nutella deal that sparked brawls","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/29/french-investigate-nutella-deal-brawls","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jan/29/french-investigate-nutella-deal-brawls","fields":{"headline":"French fraud officials investigate Nutella deal that sparked brawls","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The French authorities are to investigate whether a Nutella promotion that sparked brawls in supermarkets broke the country’s strict trading laws. France’s finance ministry said its fraud squad was launching an inquiry after the Intermarché chain offered a 70% discount on jars of the hazelnut and chocolate spread. The promotion, in which the price of a 950g jar dropped from €4.50 to €1.41 (£1.24), caused punches to be thrown and claims that customers behaved “like animals”, pushing and shoving to grab the cheap Nutella. Ministry consumer watchdogs will want to establish whether the promotion fell under the official January sales period, which allows for substantial discounts on products, or was a one-off offer on a single product, which could fall foul of “unfair competition” regulations. Stores in France are not permitted to sell food products at a loss or engage in what is deemed “product dumping”. Investigators will want to know how much Intermarché paid for the Nutella. Under the country’s strict consumer code, most shops can discount food during the official biannual sales periods only if they have bought the product more than a month before the sales begin and only if the discounted price is considered “fair”. The dates of the six-week-long winter and summer sales are fixed by regulation and also cover online stores, though certain shops in specific tourist or border areas are allowed to offer discounts outside these periods. Before the Nutella promotion, Stéphane Travert, the minister of agriculture and food, announced plans to limit discounts to a maximum 34% of the amount the store paid for a product. Travert also wants to put an end to the relatively recent introduction of buy-one-get-one-free offers, saying he wants to “give value back to products”. His proposals will be presented to the Assemblée Nationale on Wednesday. Last week’s three-day Nutella discount and the hysterical scenes it prompted caused astonishment around the world, and a wave of national soul-searching in France. Nutella’s manufacturer, the Italian group Ferrero, said it “deplored” the discount operation “and its consequences”. The Intermarché chain kept a low profile. The sociologist Gérard Mermet claimed brawling parents were justifying their behaviour because it was “for their children”; another sociologist Catherine Lejealle blamed the internet. Intermarché customers told Le Parisian unemployment, low wages and poverty were to blame."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/jan/29/hatchet-fiend-suffragette-celebrated-by-national-portrait-gallery-london-anne-hunt","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-29T15:52:20Z","webTitle":"'Hatchet fiend' suffragette celebrated by National Portrait Gallery in London","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jan/29/hatchet-fiend-suffragette-celebrated-by-national-portrait-gallery-london-anne-hunt","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/jan/29/hatchet-fiend-suffragette-celebrated-by-national-portrait-gallery-london-anne-hunt","fields":{"headline":"'Hatchet fiend' suffragette celebrated by National Portrait Gallery in London","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"She became known in newspapers as a “hatchet fiend”, “wild woman” and the “Fury with a chopper” after walking in to the National Portrait Gallery (NPG) with a hidden butcher’s cleaver and slashing a painting of Thomas Carlyle. More than a century later, the gallery is shining a light on the actions of the suffragette Anne Hunt in a display exploring how portraiture played its part in the campaign to get women the vote. It has put on display in its main galleries, for the first time in 20 years, the Millais portrait of Carlyle, which Hunt attacked in July 1914. In another room is a photograph of the damage along with other paintings and photographs that explore the wider suffrage movement. “We think it was selected at random,” said curator Rosie Broadley. “She was just waiting for the moment when the guard’s back was turned.” Hunt got in with a cleaver despite galleries being on heightened alert after a series of militant incidents in museums, including the slashing of the Rokeby Venus in the National Gallery by Mary Richardson in March 1914. Women were, at one point, banned from major museums. Special measures included women being instructed to leave their bags and muffs in the NPG cloakroom before entering. Hunt’s entry was even more surprising given the archival accounts of the incident. One guard said he recognised Hunt from the previous day and thought her American “from the closeness from which she then examined the pictures”. He therefore knew something was up because “no American would have paid the 6d entrance fee twice over”. Hunt managed to strike the portrait of Carlyle, one of the NPG’s founders, three times before people intervened. Broadley said: “The first person to stop her was another woman who was in the gallery copying portraits, which is fascinating as that was how women, ladies, were expected to interact with art.” The display also includes police surveillance photographs of militant women who gallery guards were warned to look out for. • Votes for Women! is in Room 33 of the National Portrait Gallery until 13 May.

The Hammers left-back apologised after being sent off during Saturday’s 2-0 FA Cup defeat to the League One side on Saturday. The FA’s website published an updated suspension list on Monday with Masuaku scheduled to be out of action until 10 March. He will therefore miss Tuesday’s Premier League game against Crystal Palace, then fixtures versus Brighton, Watford, Liverpool, Swansea and Burnley. The West Ham manager, David Moyes, offered no excuses for Masuaku’s conduct, calling the spit “despicable” and suggesting that the club would offer their own punishment, in addition to the FA suspension. Masuaku apologised via a statement on the West Ham official website on Sunday. “I want to say sorry for my actions on Saturday,” he said. “I let down my team-mates, the manager, coaches, board and the fans. “I am very sad because the manager and coaches have put a lot of faith in me but I will work very hard to try and win that back. It was in the heat of the moment and out of character for me. I know it was totally unacceptable and I will learn from the first red card of my career.” Masuaku’s suspension only adds to West Ham’s personnel crisis. Pedro Obiang suffered a knee injury during the game against Wigan, a game for which Moyes was already without nine first-team players.

The report says at least 89 women and 213 children were among the dead. The number of extrajudicial killings had tripled over the past two years, and Congolese armed forces were responsible for 64% of the total, the UN said. The findings will deepen international concern about the growing violence in the DRC, where there has been political and ethnic unrest and where militia groups have carried out attacks. On Sunday security forces shot dead at least six people and wounded dozens more as they fired teargas to disperse demonstrations organised by the Catholic church. The protest was the latest in a series since President Joseph Kabila refused to step down at the end of his mandate in December 2016. Scores of people have been killed and hundreds arrested in Kinshasa, the capital, and elsewhere during the crackdown. The exact number of detentions is unclear but may be as high as 600. The Catholic church has taken a leading role in recent months in organising and unifying opposition to Kabila’s continued rule. On New Year’s Eve, Congolese forces killed at least seven people in Kinshasa during a protest by Catholic activists. Cardinal Laurent Monsengwo, the head of the church in the DRC, on Tuesday condemned the crackdown on pro-democracy protesters. “How can you kill men, women, children, youths and old people all chanting religious songs, carrying Bibles, rosaries and crucifixes? Are we now living in an open prison?” Monsengwo asked. Across the country, the UN recorded a total of 6,497 human rights violations and abuses in 2017, a rise of more than 25% over 2016, which itself saw a 30% rise over 2015. The UN said the rise in arbitrary killings last year was mainly explained by instability in three provinces constituting the Kasai region, where at least 752 people were killed. The violence in Kasai erupted after a tribal chief known as the Kamwina Nsapu, who rebelled against Kabila’s government, was killed in August 2016. More than 3,000 people have died and 1.4 million have been displaced since then. The recent protests have raised diplomatic tensions between Kinshasa and Europe. The former colonial power, Belgium, and France, the UK, the US and Canada have condemned the recent killing of protesters. Under a deal mediated by the church between Kabila and his opponents, the president was to step down at the end of last year, paving the way for an election early this year. But he reneged and the poll has been repeatedly delayed. It is now scheduled for December."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/jan/25/woman-cameraman-snubbed-mudbound-rachel-morrison-nominated-oscar","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-25T18:18:54Z","webTitle":"'Ever heard of a woman cameraman?': why female cinematographers get overlooked","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jan/25/woman-cameraman-snubbed-mudbound-rachel-morrison-nominated-oscar","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/jan/25/woman-cameraman-snubbed-mudbound-rachel-morrison-nominated-oscar","fields":{"headline":"'Ever heard of a woman cameraman?': why female cinematographers get overlooked","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Rachel Morrison’s Academy Award nomination in the best cinematography category is a landmark for women in film. This shortlist has long been the toughest Oscar ceiling to crack, but now, for the first time since the awards began in 1929, a woman has been included. Morrison, who shot the overcast landscapes and intimate interiors of 1940s drama Mudbound for director Dee Rees, stands a good chance of winning, but women in her field may be forgiven for celebrating already. The American Society of Cinematographers (ASC), which counts Morrison as a member, was founded in 1919. It didn’t invite a woman to join until 1980, when it admitted Brianne Murphy, reportedly the first woman to work as a cinematographer on a major Hollywood studio film (Fatso, directed by Anne Bancroft). As of 2015, Deadline reported that just 4% of the ASC’s members were women, and last year, the society gave its president’s award to a woman for the first time. The recipient was Nancy Schreiber, the fourth woman to join the ASC, in 1995. She told one magazine: “I remember the first time that I walked into the ASC, I wasn’t even sure there was a ladies room!” Now she is part of the ASC’s Vision Committee, an initiative to promote greater diversity in cinematography. The cinematographer or director of photography (DP) is the director’s right hand on set. It’s a demanding job, combining artistry, advanced technical knowledge and team management, as the DP selects the camera, lens and lighting for each shot, and commands a crew of electricians and camera operators. A good cinematographer works closely with the director to achieve the desired visual effect in each scene. A great one imparts their own unique vision to the film. Evocatively, cinematographer John Alton described the trade in the title of his 1949 book, as “painting with light”. In the early, experimental days of cinema, there would be no distinction between director and cinematographer. Directors would turn the camera handle as they coached their actors. Things didn’t need to get much more complicated for the role to divide, though, and we know that some of the first camera operators were women, in an era when film-making was a case of everyone in the studio mucking in to get the job done. At the turn of the 20th century in Brighton, England, Laura Bayley operated the camera for her husband George Albert Smith. Georgette Méliès turned the handle in her father George’s studio in Paris in the early 1900s. As films became more complex, with studio lighting, camera movements and multiple setups, the role of camera operator became a full-fledged cinematography job. We know that women took on this role. One book names the first credited female DP as Italian Rosina Cianelli, who shared duties with her husband on Uma Transformista Original (1915), but there are earlier examples mentioned in US magazines. We also know that from the outset, female cinematographers were considered an outlandish sight. Women held many jobs in the silent film industry, but mostly the less visible roles such as writing and editing. Although, cinematography was barely two decades old magazines found the idea of a woman operating a camera to be at best a novelty, and at worst, freakish. “How many of you have ever heard of a woman camera man?” asked Picture Play in 1916. “That such a person exists will doubtless be a surprise to the majority of people in the film business, as well as those outside it.” The writer AJ Dixon pretended astonishment at finding former actor Grace Davison operating a camera on a Long Island film set, even achieving trick photography effects. “I concluded that something must have happened to the regular cameraman, and that they had been forced to substitute this girl at the last moment; and I began to picture static, out-of-focus, under and overexposed negative as the result.” After diligently examining Davison’s work, Dixon was eventually satisfied that she could handle the job (“The photography was as clear as a bell, and the detail was very sharp, and some of the effects were really beautiful”). Regardless, Davison returned to acting, and later set up her own production company. That piece was titled The Only Camera Woman, but actually Davison had colleagues and predecessors, all regularly described in much the same bewildered fashion. In 1914, Photoplay’s Katherine Symon found Francelia Billington operating a camera: “A brown-haired, gray-eyed, olive-skinned girl of remarkable grace and extreme prettiness standing back of one of the big cameras, turning a crank.” Billington described herself as a ”camera fiend” from childhood but conceded: “I suppose that it is still a novelty to see a girl more interested in a mechanical problem than in make-up.” Two years later, Photoplay published a picture of Margery Ordway on the set of William Desmond Taylor’s Her Father’s Son, captioning her in her working outfit of cap, blouse and trousers as “the New Fall Style in Camera ‘Men’. Meaning, the style you could fall for.” The text further explains that this isn’t a “masquerade getup” and that Ordway is a “regular, professional, licensed, union crank-turner” who has “gone in to camerawork as nonchalantly as other girls take up stenography, nursing, husband-stalking”. Striking as they were, female cinematographers seemed easily forgettable. Moving Picture Weekly heralded Dorothy Dunn with the words “Enter the camerawoman” in 1917, and as late as 1920, Photoplay labelled Louise Lowell “The First Camera-Maid” – both women shot newsreels professionally. These awkward phrases underline the fact that camera operator is one of the few jobs on a film set to be stuck with a gendered title: “cameraman” has persisted for as long as “script girl” and “best boy”. Despite Moving Picture Weekly gamely using “camerawoman” a few more times, the old form has stuck, meaning that a woman wielding a camera continues to be seen as the exception rather than the norm. Perhaps this image problem is why, while women such as Murphy and Schreiber, as well as many others including Sandi Sissel, Agnès Godard, Caroline Champetier and Nina Kellgren, have been working successfully as cinematographers for decades, it has taken so long for the Academy to take notice. If you find it hard to imagine a woman lifting a camera, perhaps you can’t imagine her lifting an Oscar, either. In the 21st century, however, more and more women are excelling in cinematography. Ellen Kuras, for example, has regularly collaborated with Spike Lee and Michel Gondry – she photographed such distinctively shot films as The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and Summer of Sam. Recent critical successes The Levelling (Nanu Segal), Hidden Figures (Mandy Walker), The Neon Demon (Natasha Braier), Fences and Molly’s Game (Charlotte Bruus Christensen) all had female cinematographers. In the US, female collective Cinematographers XX was founded as a way to make women in the field more visible. The names of experienced DPs are listed on a website with links to their work. In the UK, Illuminatrix works on the same principle, and there’s also the International Collective of Female Cinematographers, who “provide each other with community support and industry advocacy”. There’s no longer any excuse to argue that female cinematographers are hard to find. If Rachel Morrison does stand at the podium on Oscar night, hopefully that will create the new popular image of a female cinematographer. Holding an Oscar is always a good look."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2018/jan/25/tory-mps-considering-coup-against-may-as-frustration-builds","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-25T19:35:55Z","webTitle":"Tory MPs considering coup against May as frustration builds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jan/25/tory-mps-considering-coup-against-may-as-frustration-builds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jan/25/tory-mps-considering-coup-against-may-as-frustration-builds","fields":{"headline":"Tory MPs considering coup against May as frustration builds","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Conservative MPs are considering another attempt at ousting Theresa May if the local elections go badly, as disillusionment with her leadership bubbles up among backbenchers once again. A string of MPs have told the Guardian that criticism from Nick Boles, a former minister, of her “timidity and lack of ambition” has struck a chord within the parliamentary party, especially among those who believe she is falling short on domestic issues. May has already survived nascent coups against her leadership after her disastrous election result and again following a series of gaffes at the party conference. At the time it appeared there was little appetite to get rid of the prime minister before the UK leaves the EU in March 2019, but frustration with her lacklustre performance, botched reshuffle and shifting Brexit strategy has caused talk of deposing her to resurface. One former minister said the most dangerous time for the prime minister would be after the local election results in May if there is a wipeout of Conservative-held councils in London, with Barnet, Kensington and Chelsea, and Kingston all potential opposition targets. He also cited areas outside the capital such as Swindon and Amber Valley as potentially vulnerable to falling to Labour or no overall control. Another senior Conservative MP said he had supported May at the start of her premiership because of her promise to focus on social injustice but it was increasingly clear there was a “vacuum of ideas” at the heart of her government. He said the natural time for a challenge would be after the local elections, and concerns about the effect on Brexit talks were being overtaken by the urgency of getting a prime minister who would do better against Jeremy Corbyn. A leadership contest would be provoked if at least 15% of MPs – 48 of them – send a letter to the chair of the 1922 Committee expressing their lack of confidence in May, prompting a vote of the parliamentary party on her future. There have been reports in the Sun that Graham Brady, the leader of the 1922 Committee, is so worried about the growing numbers that he is asking MPs to think carefully before sending in their letters. Up to 40 MPs are thought to have submitted letters so far. One member of the 2015 Conservative intake said they knew of seven or eight others who had talked about sending letters to Brady without having done so yet, meaning it was possible the 48 figure could be reached. The MP said a series of disappointments in May had culminated in her reshuffle this month, which was seen as having mishandled the junior appointments. “She’s on very thin ice,” they said. “We had the election, then the conference; she bought herself some time with the budget and the Brexit deal, but the reshuffle has caused a new series of problems.” Newer Tory MPs were particularly annoyed at the distribution of junior ministerial posts in the reshuffle, they said, with some feeling the process was unfair. “It used to be that you’d know what sort of things you’d need to do to get promoted, but that doesn’t seem to be the case now. And it makes MPs more reckless – they start thinking: I’m not going to get anywhere with this PM so I might as well risk a change.” There is still a large rump of Conservative MPs who believe it would be a terrible time for the disruption of a leadership contest at a crucial time for negotiations with the EU. One Eurosceptic MP said the unrest was coming principally from those who do not prioritise Brexit and are mainly concerned with the threat to their seats from a resurgent Labour. “It is a small percentage of the parliamentary party who want a change of leadership,” he said. “The rest want to cling to nurse for fear of something worse.” He said many of the pro-Brexit wing of the party was worried about getting rid of May for fear of ending up with a remainer such as Amber Rudd in charge, and the pro-EU side was concerned about Boris Johnson taking the helm. However, some of the most hardline Brexit supporters are getting increasingly anxious that leaving May in charge will lead to an unacceptably soft Brexit. Some believe the vocal interventions from Johnson, the foreign secretary, on a dividend for the NHS and new Channel bridge link after leaving the EU are designed to position him as the true voice of Brexit in case a leadership challenge comes to pass any time soon. Challenged by Bloomberg about the growing complaints from within her party, May said she was still focused on the aims set out when she became prime minister, saying she wanted “a country that really works for everyone”. She said: “I think one of the challenges we have … is those people in our society who feel that globalisation has left them behind, that others have benefited, but not them.” But she failed to suggest any fresh solutions to that problem, beyond her industrial strategy and “skilling young people”, after 18 months in the job and almost eight years of Conservative rule."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/jan/25/universal-credit-benefits-scheme-iain-duncan-smith","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-25T16:35:24Z","webTitle":"Universal credit: what is it and what exactly is wrong with it?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jan/25/universal-credit-benefits-scheme-iain-duncan-smith","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/jan/25/universal-credit-benefits-scheme-iain-duncan-smith","fields":{"headline":"Universal credit: what is it and what exactly is wrong with it?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"What is universal credit? Universal credit is the supposed flagship reform of the benefits system, rolling together six so-called “legacy” benefits (including unemployment benefit, tax credits and housing benefit) into one benefit paid monthly to claimants. The aim, for which there was general support across the political divide, was to simplify the benefits system, make it more efficient and increase the incentives for people to work rather than stay on benefits. How long has it been around? The project was legislated for in 2011 under the auspices of its most vocal champion, the former secretary of state for work and pensions Iain Duncan Smith. The plan was to roll it out across the UK by 2017. However, a series of management failures, expensive IT blunders and design faults mean it has fallen at least five years behind schedule. Under the current schedule it will be fully implemented to about 7 million claimants by 2022-23, when it will account for around £63bn of spending. Does it work? Strangely, given that it has been around for so long in one form or another, it is still far too early to tell. Certainly the “customer” experience of universal credit for too many claimants (and other stakeholders, such as landlords) has been dismal. Critics argue that cuts to the benefit mean it is now less likely to incentivise jobless people to move into work, or to work more hours. Ministers claim evidence from early official trials shows universal credit claimants were more likely to get a job. However, the Office for Budgetary Responsibility (OBR) said there was still insufficient evidence to judge. Why is it so controversial? For all its theoretical benefits, in practice universal credit has been hugely problematic, generating what some fear are “poll tax” levels of unpopularity. While it began life intending to be more generous to most claimants, it is now, as a result of cuts, significantly less generous, leaving many claimants worse off when they move on to it than they were under legacy benefits. Added to that are design flaws and administrative glitches that put poorer claimants especially at heightened risk of hunger, debt and rent arrears, ill-health and homelessness. Food banks, for example, have reported that demand for charity food goes up significantly when universal credit is introduced into the local area. Hasn’t the government moved to address some of these flaws? Following massive pressure in the autumn from campaigners and many Conservative backbench MPs who were shocked by the hardship and destitution faced by many claimants, ministers introduced a number of changes, including shortening the built-in 42-day wait for a first payment to 35 days, making advance loans more readily available to claimants unable to wait long periods for financial assistance, and making the universal credit telephone helpline free. Critics say the changes don’t go far enough and have called for the rollout to be paused. What else is going wrong with universal credit? Plenty. Landlords (private, council and housing association) are worried about the level of rent arrears racked up by tenants on universal credit. Unchecked, this will lead to a spike in evictions and homelessness. Many private landlords say they will no longer rent to universal credit claimants because the risk of arrears is too high, and the bureaucracy involved in tackling arrears problems once they arise too soul-destroying. Housing associations have warned that the accumulated bad debts run up by tenants as a result of universal credit could affect their housebuilding plans. Claimants complain that universal credit is bafflingly complex, unreliable and difficult to manage, particularly if you are without internet access, and that universal credit staff are often poorly trained. So ironing out a few more technical glitches will fix it? Nope. Huge underlying problems remain. Multibillion-pound cuts to work allowances imposed by the former chancellor George Osborne have left it hollowed out. According to the Resolution Foundation thinktank, universal credit will leave about 2.5 million low-income working households more than £1,000 a year worse off. Reversing those cuts requires a political decision, not more technical fixes. Can we expect further changes to universal credit? The key policy question facing each of the four work and pensions secretaries (and myriad policy wonk round tables) since 2015 has been: do we scrap universal credit? So far, politicians have not wanted to pull the plug – the billions pumped into universal credit and the huge amount of political capital and credibility invested in it have been hugely persuasive. So is it too big to fail? The recently departed permanent secretary at the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), Robert Devereux, who oversaw universal credit between 2011 and 2018, suggested it was too well-established to reverse. Yet it has influential enemies, from the Treasury (which has always opposed the project) to the chair of the works and pensions select committee, Frank Field. The DWP has to present a renewed business case to the Treasury later this year. If it cannot prove universal credit is working or delivering savings (and the OBR suggests this is currently far from clear), this may be problematic. It may not sink universal credit, but more changes are likely. What might trigger further changes? The OBR assessment of universal credit this week pointed out that the project remained fundamentally volatile, not least because – without changes – relatively large numbers of claimants are likely to lose out as the system rolls out across the country. These include: working families claiming tax credits; disabled claimants who stand to lose disability premiums when they move from legacy benefits; and self-employed workers. All three groups have been affected negatively by budget changes that have subsequently been reversed after public outcry. The intention under universal credit to force up to a million low-paid workers to seek more hours or move to higher-paid jobs, under threat of financial sanctions (“in-work conditionality”), is another unexploded bomb. Big changes, however, will require substantial investment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2018/jan/27/car-insurance-premiums-rose-costs","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-27T08:41:08Z","webTitle":"Car insurance: could you be in for a nasty surprise?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/jan/27/car-insurance-premiums-rose-costs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2018/jan/27/car-insurance-premiums-rose-costs","fields":{"headline":"Car insurance: could you be in for a nasty surprise?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"When your car insurance renewal letter next lands on your doorstep, you could be in for a nasty shock. Costs have risen to a new high, according to the Association of British Insurers (ABI), which says average premiums now stand at £481, up 9% on the previous year. Meanwhile, the AA this week said that, according to its study of “shop-around prices”, premiums rose 2% during 2017 and now stand at an average of £666. The ABI said the figures it quotes, relate to the last three months of 2017. This was the eighth successive quarter in which premiums have risen. The AA is warning they look set to continue this year. The price disparity between the two reports is because the ABI looks at what people actually pay, while the AA compares the prices quoted, which, as an average, will often be higher. One thing is certain: most people will be paying more in 2018. The AA says young drivers (aged 17-22) continue to face the highest premiums – on average, £1,625. Young men still pay higher premiums than young women, reflecting differences in car choice, mileage and occupation, it says. The north-west is the costliest region to insure – average quoted car premiums are now £916. This is followed by Northern Ireland at £885, while London comes third at £833. Scotland is the cheapest place. Overall, the industry blames a series of rises in insurance premium tax – which now stands at 12% – plus government changes to the so-called “Ogden” discount rate which affects the amount of compensation insurers pay out following big crashes, though these have yet to come into force. The Ministry of Justice has also announced a series of reforms to whiplash-related claims in an attempt to reduce fraud. Rob Cummings, the ABI’s assistant director, says: “The rising cost of motor insurance shows no sign of abating. “Changes to how compensation payouts are calculated, insurance premium tax, more whiplash-style claims and rising repair bills, are all piling on the pressure for cash-strapped drivers. “The government must urgently bring forward relief for motorists. It is time cash-strapped motorists got a break.” He adds most insurers are currently making a loss on motor policies."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/26/weight-loss-surgery-transformed-my-life-bariatric-care","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-26T12:15:49Z","webTitle":"Weight loss surgery transformed my life.

Now I want to help others","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Faced with the prospect of spending the rest of my life feeling unhappy in my own skin, the idea of weight-loss surgery became more and more appealing. For over 20 years type 2 diabetes had drained my health and wellbeing. Despite endless diets and exercise regimes to deal with obesity, the weight always crept back – followed by depression. Unfortunately, the opportunity of a healthier, happier me through surgery came with the stigma that it’s an easy way out. But weight-loss surgery isn’t a quick fix: it requires a lifelong commitment to improving your health. I had a mini gastric bypass in March 2017. Waking up from the operation was daunting. The reality of the challenges ahead became very clear. The first days were uncomfortable and sometimes painful. However, I knew the months of recovery would be critical to making my operation a success. Initially, losing the desire for comfort foods, and changing my eating habits, was accompanied by a feeling of emotional disconnection. After surgery, the mind needs to adjust to physical changes in the body. As the journey began, I learned to make better food choices and carefully measure each portion of food I ate. I used to love puddings – especially Christmas pudding with custard. But I soon learned that foods I once enjoyed no longer agreed with my restructured stomach. What followed was a difficult process of trial and error, where the side effects could be quite explosive. At times I would find myself running frantically for the toilet before my body forcefully ejected what I had just eaten. Managing the effects of surgery becomes a daily preoccupation. But when you’ve overcome the mental struggle, the benefits are overwhelmingly positive. Seven months after my surgery I had lost nearly five stones; my life has really taken a turn in the right direction. When I look back, I wonder why I didn’t do it sooner. My decision wasn’t just about looking and feeling better: I chose to continue with life. I wanted to take back control of my health, and be free of diabetes – which, since my operation, has been in remission. I’m no longer depressed, and I’ve stopped taking medication. I feel like a dark cloud has lifted, and I’m glowing in the sun. Having more energy has motivated me to do something positive with my life. Supporting others in their journeys has helped me in my recovery. Patients in the UK have limited options and rely on social media, so it’s often down to individuals to figure out what’s right for them. That is why I created The Gastric Guru, to provide a reliable support network. Despite Britain’s obesity crisis and growing demand for weight-loss surgery, there is no equivalent of services such as Bariatric Pal or Obesity Coverage in the US, which involve bariatric specialists in patient support. Bariatric patients are often all too conscious of failing. People who have lived with obesity for most of their lives often see themselves as failures. For many surgery is a last hope. It’s so important to address post-operative issues such as portion control, nutritional guidance, exercise, support for eating habits, and food addiction – and help to avoid another type of addiction. However, long-term support is not something surgery providers offer with the package. This is where independently run care services can work in partnership with bariatric specialists, to help more patients make their surgery a lifelong success. • Aisha Walker is founder of The Gastric Guru, which supports patients through weight loss surgery"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2018/feb/02/novel-lost-for-400-years-sheds-light-on-spains-imperial-heights","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-02T10:43:19Z","webTitle":"After 400 years lost, 'cursed' novel of Spain's imperial age is finally published","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/02/novel-lost-for-400-years-sheds-light-on-spains-imperial-heights","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/feb/02/novel-lost-for-400-years-sheds-light-on-spains-imperial-heights","fields":{"headline":"After 400 years lost, 'cursed' novel of Spain's imperial age is finally published","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Four hundred years after it was written, a lost and supposedly cursed Golden Age novel chronicling the splendour, adventure and violence of Spain’s imperial zenith has been published for the first time. Historia del Huérfano, or The Orphan’s Story, charts the progress of a 14-year-old Spaniard who leaves Granada and heads to the Americas to seek his fortune. Its hero ricochets around the Spanish empire, from the high-society fiestas of Lima to the mephitic mines of Potosí, and goes on to witness Sir Francis Drake’s attack on Puerto Rico and the sacking of Cádiz. After romantic escapades and the odd shipwreck and run-in with pirates, the soldier-cum-missionary finally manages to embrace the calm of monastic life in the capital of viceregal Peru. “There’s an awful lot of travelling, but you do get a sense of what the viceroyalty of Peru was like from the inside and of the exchange of people and goods between Europe and America,” said Belinda Palacios, a Peruvian academic who spent two years editing the book back to life. The story was written between 1608 and 1615 by Martín de León y Cárdenas, a Spanish Augustinian friar born near Malaga in 1584 and who, like his eponymous hero, had travelled to Lima. It was set to appear in 1621 under the nom de plume of Andrés de León, but it never made it to the printing presses – perhaps because its author feared it might cause him problems as he embarked on an ecclesiastical career that would see him become an archbishop, and the president and captain-general of the viceroyalty of Sicily. A Spanish academic rediscovered the manuscript in the archives of the Hispanic Society of America in 1965. Previous attempts to publish The Orphan’s Story had come to nothing, giving rise to rumours that something malevolent lurked among its 328 pages. “When I started working on it, a lot of people told me that the book was cursed and that people who start working on it die,” Palacios said. “I laughed it off but I was a bit apprehensive at the same time. It’s taken a while because the people who have worked on it have died – one from a strange disease, one in a car accident and another of something else.” Palacios hopes the curse has been lifted after it was recently published by the José Antonio de Castro Foundation, which works to safeguard Spain’s literary heritage. She says the book’s blend of fiction, autobiography and historical documents – Martín de León used a letter from one of the generals who fought Drake in Puerto Rico – offers a richly detailed, contemporary portrait of the author’s world. “It also gives us a nuanced view of the story of the conquest. People always go on about the big evil Spaniards coming and what they did to the indigenous people, but when you read this, you see there was a spirit of adventure that drove people. It wasn’t ‘let’s go over there, crush the indians and rob them’. It was more like a big business, in which adventure and discovery played a part.” Beyond the descriptions of Lima’s poets, parties and bullfights, the text also affords glimpses of the slave labour that fuelled the celebrations and the empire itself. On a visit to the mercury mines at Huancavelica, the Orphan sees 800 indigenous workers toiling in a hot, humid, fetid place of “great dangers, risks, darknesses, hazards and caverns”. The mine is described as “scene from hell or from the mythical forges of Vulcan’s cyclopses”. Martín de León acknowledges the horrific realities of the mines and bemoans the corruption and chaos of Potosí, but he is very much a man of his time. Unlike his celebrated Dominican forerunner, Bartolomé de las Casas, he was no pioneering advocate of indigenous rights. “He recognises that the indigenous people are being mistreated and exploited and that life is hard for them,” Palacios said. “But what Martín de León is criticising isn’t the fact that the indigenous people are being exploited so white people don’t have to do the work, which is the modern take. He’s criticising the fact that the indigenous population is being exploited to the point of disappearance.” The treatment of the indigenous people was, for him, a short-sighted act of Spanish self-sabotage. “I get the feeling that he’s saying the system must change because we’re wiping out the local populations and that’s not going to be viable in the long term,” Palacios said. “Yes, there’s a criticism there, but we shouldn’t see him as another Bartolomé de Las Casas, fighting to defend the Indians. That’s not there in the text.” What she did find, however, were observations that still raise a smile centuries after Martín de León’s ink dried. She was amused by the narrator’s mockery of Italians for talking with their hands, and intrigued to read his complaints about the topical issue of judicial corruption in Peru. Palacios likens reading the book to travelling back in time: “It’s a window on the past through which you can glimpse moments,” she said. Despite the long months deciphering the friar’s handwriting, editing the book and correcting proofs, she says the project was painstaking but never dull. “It was fun. I was back in the viceroyalty.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/25/a-mistake-not-a-disaster-cameron-fondues-while-britain-burns","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-25T12:59:07Z","webTitle":"‘A mistake not a disaster’: Cameron fondues while Britain burns | Polly Toynbee","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/25/a-mistake-not-a-disaster-cameron-fondues-while-britain-burns","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/25/a-mistake-not-a-disaster-cameron-fondues-while-britain-burns","fields":{"headline":"‘A mistake not a disaster’: Cameron fondues while Britain burns","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Doesn’t he look well? Pink and chillaxed, David Cameron hanging out at Davos with the world’s leaders looks every bit as at ease as the day he said he wanted to become prime minister because “I think I’d be rather good at it”. His six years in the job suggest he was catastrophically wrong. But how unburdened he looks by the millstone of a legacy he left us, a country stricken by austerity and riven by Brexit. Falling behind in wealth and global influence, we are up to our neck in a quagmire of negotiations to save us from the damage inflicted by his careless, fruitless referendum. But footloose and carefree, he and George Osborne are hosting their annual Davos fondue party. Today the Brexit press is cock-a-hoop at what it (wrongly) claims is his recantation. Caught at Davos accidentally on mic, he said Brexit is “a mistake, not a disaster. It’s turned out less badly than we thought.” Ha! “Cameron’s epiphany!” shouts the Mail’s front page. “Congratulations, Dave. At last you’ve seen the light!” More inside: “At last Cameron talks sense. After Project Fear, he’s caught out making a confession … Cue joy in heaven over one sinner who repenteth.” The same elsewhere, with whoops from Brexiteers such as Gisela Stuart gloating that Cameron has “finally realised his claims of doom and gloom were baseless scaremongering”. Is it epiphany day for Dave? Does he recant his remoaning? It is important to look at exactly what he said, and why. He had been approached at a party by Lakshmi Mittal, the Indian steel tycoon, high in the Sunday Times Rich list. Mittal inquired tentatively: “Everyone is talking about Brexit?” What should an ex-prime minister reply to a prime investor in Britain? “Yes, we’re screwed. Get the hell out before we descend to Trump shithole country status.” Hardly. So he hedged diplomatically with: “It’s frustrating. As I keep saying, it’s a mistake, not a disaster. It’s turned out less badly than we thought. It’s still going to be difficult.” Not quite epiphany time. As Brexiteers mock, Project Fear did warn that hundreds of thousands of jobs would go, households would lose £4,300 each and share prices plummet. It hasn’t happened. But nor has Brexit, not even a hint of a route map, as embarrassingly exposed by David Davis’s non-evidence to the Brexit select committee on Wednesday. Meanwhile, in another part of the Davos woods, at a private KPMG breakfast, Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England was also caught unawares, unguardedly replying to a question from a business executive, according to the Times. What had Brexit done so far to the economy, and could he give a measure in “Brexit buses”? He said Brexit had already forfeited £10bn a year in growth, which equated, he quickly calculated, to some two-thirds of the £350m on the bus – or £200m every week in lost growth. That’s lower than Project Fear predictions – but Brexit hasn’t begun. The US and EU economy surge ahead, leaving us behind. As the KPMG chairman said after that breakfast, the “underperforming” UK is becoming “decoupled from the rest of the world”. Facts, you might think, speak for themselves: the pound against the euro is down to just 1.15. Jobs might be growing – but so many are low-paid. Real earnings fell for eight consecutive months, and are still 3% below 2008. We have fallen from top of the G7 for growth, to bottom. But the Brexiteers have their alternative facts, crowing about job growth and exports up, but above all, pointing at Project Fear’s as yet unrealised horrors. No wonder they triumph over Cameron’s remark about things turning out “less badly than we thought”. Never mind that Robert Chote, head of the Office for Budget Responsibility, in a New Statesman interview this week says leaving the single market and customs union will do more damage to the UK’s economy than any theoretical benefits of trade deal with other countries. Does any of this shift the Brexit debate more than an iota? Probably not yet. But our journey to an unknown destination hasn’t yet begun. In the end, it’s not forecasts but facts on the ground in people’s lived experience that will win this argument. But in the meantime, it’s good to know Cameron and Osborne are enjoying Davos. • Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"music/2018/jan/26/an-agent-of-chaos-fuelled-by-fire-stars-memories-of-mark-e-smith","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-26T07:00:39Z","webTitle":"'An agent of chaos, fuelled by fire': stars' memories of Mark E Smith","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jan/26/an-agent-of-chaos-fuelled-by-fire-stars-memories-of-mark-e-smith","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/jan/26/an-agent-of-chaos-fuelled-by-fire-stars-memories-of-mark-e-smith","fields":{"headline":"'An agent of chaos, fuelled by fire': stars' memories of Mark E Smith","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Brix Smith Start I feel so honoured to have worked with, and been a partner with, somebody so singularly talented and groundbreaking and free-thinking. He came at everything from multi-dimensions and odd angles, outside every box. Forget about pushing the envelope – there was no envelope. Mark had this theory that there were seven original people in the world and that everybody else is a slate of one of those seven. I have to say that Mark was absolutely one of those seven. Before we went onstage every night Mark would make us form a circle and walk anticlockwise. I think he really understood the manipulation of energy. He would do things like come on stage after we’d soundchecked for an hour, got all of our sounds perfect, and then twist up the knobs on everybody’s amplifiers, and pull out the microphone from the bass drum stand and mess everything up. It used to drive us bonkers. But he was creating chaos and creating energy, and you’d have to work that much harder to get everything back. That’s the same reason that he would sack so many people. I remember a time when he got rid of the drummer between the soundcheck and the show and pulled somebody up from the support band. It was traumatic, but in fact it was like pulling the rug out from under you – you have to get up and make it work. It made us better musicians and able to cope in all kinds of circumstances. When you work harder at something, when you have to grapple from different angles, it makes it more intense and more powerful. He shook up the snow globe every day of his life. Click here for a full interview with Brix Smith Start on Mark E Smith. Maxine Peake Every Friday in my mid-teens, I used to go to a psych and 60s R&amp;B night at a club in Manchester called the Brickhouse. I remember seeing Mark E Smith there on regular occasions propping up the bar. I never had the courage to go over and tell him how much I admired him; to approach him would take a lot of courage from the steeliest of nerves. Many years later, I went to see the Fall perform at the Cartoon Club in Croydon and I found myself in the tiny dressing room after the gig, face to face with Mr Smith. I was starstruck. Just as I was about to pluck up the courage to say something, Mark turned to Steve Trafford, his then bassist, and said: “What does that slapper want?” For a split-second my heart was broken, but then I thought, “Hey, at least he noticed me.” Marc Riley I first saw The Fall in 1977 at Rafters in Manchester and they were like nothing else on earth. But the singer? Strewth! He was raging, spitting fire! Incredible. So I trundled off and made a Fall T-shirt, which in a roundabout way landed me the job of playing bass in the band in May 1978. I was 16. I was a Bowie- and Lou Reed-fixated boy, but Mark introduced me to [Captain] Beefheart and [Frank] Zappa. For a few years, he really was like the older brother I never had. Mark was 21, but had many traits and thought processes that were more akin to those of a pensioner. I remember him once saying to me: “People don’t have their own smell any more. Everyone bathes too much.” He would often be scathing about the lack of principles and guts of the younger generation coming up behind him. He had this unique way of looking at the world, which, of course, was reflected in his words and sometimes his actions. My relationship with Mark went from fanboy to mate to nemesis, and I probably ended up little more than a mild annoyance. But he helped shape my life. More importantly, he concocted some of the greatest records ever made, sometimes taking me along for the ride, and for both those things I’ll always be grateful to him. It’s a cliche, but the world really will be is a less interesting place without him. Krishnan Guru-Murthy Mark wanted to be interviewed in the pub, with his wife, Elena. I figured the only way to do it was to drink with him, despite it being late morning. A couple of drinks before we started, a couple more during, and one after. For every one of mine he had an extra whisky chaser. We knew the whole thing would take a long time, and it did. He was razor sharp one moment and then would trail off into mumbling incoherence the next. But he was never difficult or morose, as we talked about everything from politics to poetry. He was no doubt flattered by my talk of going to watch him play Blackburn King George’s Hall as a schoolboy. He was charming, and seemed to be constantly amused by himself. I liked him a lot. Given his many lineups, he famously said: “If it’s me and yer granny on bongos, it’s the Fall” – I suppose it’s just granny on bongos now. Tim Burgess The first time I was aware of Mark E Smith was his voice coming out of a mate’s cheap speakers and you could almost feel the spit hitting you – it was on the Slates EP in 1982. It was like nothing I had ever heard. I went out to get myself a copy and soon found it was nothing like my mum and dad had ever heard either. From then, he was an ever-present in my life, at times in person, other times just his music; when necessary I would ask myself: “What would Mark E Smith do?” More of an existential question, as actual Mark E Smith would probably swear, hit an amp with a microphone and shout something about East Germany. He was a force of nature – generous and supportive but with an exterior designed to test you out. I was putting a line up together for a festival and I asked the Fall to play. He asked me to bring him the deposit in the form of a cheque – long after most people had stopped using them. As I walked up his path I could see it was strewn with coins, batteries, pens and suchlike. When he opened the door, I asked what had happened. “I was getting fan mail and keeping it behind the piano. Some of the parcels from China have fireworks in them and they went off.” I’ll miss him. Cate Le Bon I was playing guitar for White Fence, who are led by former Fall member Tim Presley, and he introduced us. When Mark came out to see us play in Manchester’s Soup Kitchen, we were met with the warmth of an old friend. He visibly adored Tim. When the time came to stop the drinking and get the band back in the van, Mark protested, but we really had to leave. When we got to the van, Tim was nowhere to be seen. When he finally returned, he told us that Mark had grabbed him, and said they were “going to another pub, come on”. Tim was also beaming. Like a good bad uncle, Mark had left him with a gift and some sterling advice: some yellow powder scrunched up in a piece of newspaper and the advice to not spend too much time in Wales, as they’ll kill and eat you – and that Welsh women were demons. Kevin Martin AKA the Bug About 30 years ago, I had realised London was unforgiving, hostile and you basically had to pay to play shows to zero audience, with zero industry support. It was one of only two times in my life when I was very seriously thinking of throwing in the towel and giving up on music for good. And then: “Sounds like Thunder not best track on tape, but would fit great on Cog-Sin comp. M.E.S.” A simple, short, shock of support when I least expected it and most needed it. I had sent Mark E Smith a terrible demo tape of my first band, GOD, in which he had heard something special, and I’m still grateful to this day. Mark epitomised idiosyncrasy, irreverence and independence, and is still a role model for me. In a time when mediocrity, conformity and safety rules the music industry worse than ever, Mark will be sorely missed. An agent of chaos, fuelled by fire. I miss this square peg genius already. Geoff Travis, founder, Rough Trade Records The Fall started as a collective: Una Baines, Martin Bramah, Tony Friel and Mark Smith, and others. This was important. Rough Trade were a collective, and though they were in Manchester and we were in west London we identified them as friends and felt kinship. It wasn’t just about Mark, although he emerged as their leader. Strong personalities tend to combust, but when they can collaborate the work is nearly always better. This wasn’t just a group of anonymous pickup musicians, but one of the greatest musical groups our shores has ever produced. I was flattered to have been asked to produce, along with Mayo Thompson, a series of peerless singles: Fiery Jack, How I Wrote Elastic Man and then, on my own, Totally Wired and the album Grotesque. I slept on the floor of Mark’s Prestwich flat and we would set off to the studio every day. Mark was someone you never forgot, not really on the same mental plane as us mere journeymen. It was impossible to know what he was thinking and he had some odd, arcane, almost crackpot notions. He deserves to be celebrated for his genius use of language and for devising a method of delivery that was completely singular. He was an inspiration in those early days – along with the other members of the Fall. Dione Newton, director of The Fall: The Wonderful and Frightening World of Mark E Smith Mark was a bit wary about us making a documentary about him, and we were wary about him after the stories we had heard. We met him in his local pub in Prestwich and he arrived with his wife, Elena. We sat with some drinks and Elena wanted to put the Olympic opening ceremony on because it was from Greece, and she was half-Greek. This meant switching Corrie off, which Elena did. The blokes in the pub were not happy and Mark growled at them not to turn it over. No one touched the TV. Interviews with Mark were an experience. For one of them, Mark arrived with a Lidl bag of cans and a bag of speed and told us the story of the Fall for four hours. He might stop mid-sentence and ask if I could get him a copy of last Tuesday’s episode of Doctors because his mate was in it; he was always asking if our producer Jane was cold and could he give her his coat. He called us the “harbingers of doom” because we did the last interview with John Peel, who died during the making of the documentary. The sound engineers didn’t know what had hit them that day: they asked if they could test the levels and Mark ranted: “You are more interested in your lunch from the organic shop in Maida Vale” and then continued to do the vocals, which consisted of his shoutings recorded on a Dictaphone or mic. The finished sessions sounded amazing. Our editor asked me to get Mark’s autograph. Mark ripped open the 12-inch single and scribbled “To Alex, lots of love,” no autograph, on the inside of the sleeve. That was very Mark E Smith. He did say he liked our film, but then slagged us off in his book, calling us yoga-loving students or something along those lines. It made us laugh anyway. Damon Gough AKA Badly Drawn Boy Someone opened my car door as I parked up in the centre of Manchester waiting to pick up a friend of mine, in 1997. This guy just got in the car assuming I was a taxi and asked me to take him to Stockport. I looked and it was Mark E Smith. I had a battered old Audi saloon at the time, so it looked like a hire car, in his defence. I explained, and gave him a lift around the corner for a taxi rank. He was obviously a few drinks down the line, he stumbled out the car and almost fell over. So I got him back in and said, where are you going, I’ll give you a lift. As we were driving I was listening to a compilation I’d made and there was a Beach Boys song he was raving about: where do you get this? And I said, well, it’s quite popular, and easy to get. So I said I’d give him the tape if you promise we do a song together some day. The next day, incidentally, I was cleaning out my car and found one of his dentures. I had a cassette full of ideas that I’d been making at home and I played them to him. We met up for a few pints and went back to his house in Prestwich – it was really empty with hardly any furniture and a really old piano that looked like it was recovered from a shipwreck. We did end up recording a song together. He was just dead nice to me – I could have been anybody, but he showed faith in me. He was a poet really, carrying around his lyrics written on scraps in a carrier bag, and he managed to organise people around him to make amazing music around his words. That’s what the Fall was. Liz Phair My college boyfriend introduced me to the Fall, and I fell in love with their music: that insistent, repeating synth and the fragile melodies. Mark E Smith’s vocal style blew me away. I had never imagined anyone manipulating the phrasing that way before and it seemed like he’d cracked a code, or opened up a new dimension of performance to me. The lyrics were especially satisfying to decipher if you listened closely, like great literature – yet also very street, and cynical. Blaine Harrison, Mystery Jets In 2012 I caught the first train up to Manchester to interview Mark for the NME. Our band Mystery Jets had name-checked him in Greatest Hits, a breakup song I’d written about dividing a shared record collection amid the ruins of a failed romance – the scratched-up copy of the Fall’s This Nation’s Saving Grace was most certainly mine. The train pulled in and we made our way through a drizzly gale – this was the Fall’s Manchester. It was only 10am but Mark had assured us his local free house, the New Oxford, would be an apt venue. He was somehow nothing like and exactly like how I had hoped he would be. We talked about Damo Suzuki selling Japanese cars to the Germans in Düsseldorf, rescuing bandmates from Texan sex cults, and the witch trials that had inspired the Fall’s debut album, over Sparta ales with whisky chasers. When I read him my lyrics to Greatest Hits he welled up a little and two minutes later pulled out his dentures and cackled spit across the room like a possessed loon. He had a mercurial wit and a filthy mouth, and although he terrified me, I relished every second spent in his company. There will never be another son of a bitch quite like Mark E Smith. Lottie, Goat Girl We supported the Fall at the 100 Club in London in July. I felt unworthy of being on the lineup. It’s rare that you get to play with your idols – Mark is probably the reason we’re playing in the first place. I first heard the Fall when I was 15, I couldn’t really believe that kind of music existed. The way he speaks so freely and purely, it’s a big inspiration for how I write my lyrics. His songs are built from simplistic riffs and heavy beats or drones, which is how we write – we try to keep that simplicity alive. I didn’t actually ever meet him, but I saw him play closeup. He wasn’t really on stage for a lot of it. He was singing from his dressing room at one point – he had a wireless microphone. You could tell that there was something wrong, but it didn’t change how he performed. It was the same energy he always had, like “I don’t give a fuck”. It’s even more special to see someone completely overpowering this illness that they have – performing no matter what. Jon More, Coldcut Me and my Coldcut partner, Matt, are fans of the Fall – we both felt Mark was the UK’s answer to Rakim, and asked Mark to guest on our debut album. Mark then called us and said he wanted to record something based on our track Telephone, and would we be up for producing it. Mark would pace around the studio turning the amps up and down, occasionally going over and randomly hitting the drummer’s cymbals, and chiding the players for not giving it 100%. He pushed the engineer to the edge by moving his carefully worked-out settings. There were echoes of James Brown in the way he conducted the band and pushed them to get what he wanted. When it came to recording the vocal, we had the idea to set up a circle of microphones in the recording booth, all with slightly different settings. Mark found a megaphone in the studio and proceeded to wander around using that instead. A magic shaman of words, and a man who could rock a jumper like no other."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/2018/jan/25/kevin-pietersen-england-cricket-one-day-coaching","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-25T22:00:28Z","webTitle":"Kevin Pietersen eager to join England one-day coaching setup","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jan/25/kevin-pietersen-england-cricket-one-day-coaching","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jan/25/kevin-pietersen-england-cricket-one-day-coaching","fields":{"headline":"Kevin Pietersen eager to join England one-day coaching setup","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Kevin Pietersen has signalled his desire to be involved in coaching the England cricket team on the eve of his final match for the Melbourne Stars in the Big Bash League. “Of course, it would be nice to have a connection,” Pietersen said when asked if he would like a role with this current England side. “I have an incredible amount to offer the game. It is wasted that English cricketers do not benefit.” “They still come to me and ask for help. That is happening and I love that. To be involved with this young, one-day set up would be nice. I would like some involvement because I love the way they play. It is so good.” As Pietersen, who ended his playing days on the English cricket scene last summer, sits in the dining area of the SCG during a break between commentary stints, mulling over what the future might hold, England are putting together a performance Eoin Morgan would rank as the best of his tenure to beat Australia and take an insurmountable 3-0 lead in the ODI series. Through blind coincidence and smatterings of inspiration, these England cricketers play in Pietersen’s image: attack blended with belligerent arrogance. This weekend, those same players might strike it rich in the Indian Premier League auction – an opportunity he bulldozed through to much derision. Their style is not lost on Pietersen, who scored 4,440 international runs, at an average of 40.73, in the 50-over format. And the 37-year-old wants a more direct influence on their cricket. Anti-establishment figure seeks rapprochement with the establishment? It is a sign of how far Pietersen and England’s regard of white-ball cricket has come that he wants the opportunity to be a part of what this team are trying to achieve. How he mends the many burned bridges at the ECB remains to be seen. That first reintegration did not exactly go according to plan. But there is a sincerity to Pietersen’s words and an admiration he has no urge to hide: “I just love the attacking nature. We have always had the players – it was the system. It is lovely they have a free rein to go out there and fail which is magnificent. Trevor Bayliss has had so much experience in the IPL and T20 cricket so he has seen failure and success.” Pietersen’s BBL finale will incorporate his passion for rhino welfare, with a dollar from each ticket going towards the Australian Rhino Project. He was injured for the English equivalent, when Surrey hosted Sussex last August and, after missing Wednesday’s match against the Sydney Sixers, has been working overtime to be fighting fit for the visit of the Hobart Hurricanes. By his own admission, retirement is simply preempting a body and mind that do not have the appetite for another lap of the Twenty20 circuit. “My body is starting to ache and I am really not enjoying the fielding side,” says Pietersen. “I have contracts in Dubai and South Africa, so I will look at those and see where I get to. I can’t see myself coming back here and wanting to play another season of Big Bash.” Even his detractors would not begrudge Pietersen a last chance to stroll out at the MCG. The seeds of a BBL career were sown during England’s shambolic 2013-14 Ashes tour, which prematurely ended his and a few other international careers. Australia welcomed him with open arms, first as the pantomime villain, then as their “Mr Every Night”. He calls the cricket for Channels Nine and rivals Ten, and even does a few adverts, too. Cricket Australia have done what the ECB could not: harness Pietersen’s light-hearted side. But his four-year expedition has been more than marketing. This season, Pietersen passed the thousand-run mark for the Melbourne Stars and will finish with an average of 35 and a strike rate over 130 per 100 balls. Out of the franchises he has turned out for, it is for the Stars that he has the most appearances. “They have been the most unbelievable franchise,” he says. His in-depth experience of both sides of the BBL also puts him in a good position to judge the ECB’s move to mimic the competition with their T20 rebrand in 2020. For him, free-to-air broadcasts hold the key. “If you have free to air then it is going to be a massive hit. We get 1.2m people watching BBL games on Ten every night. You are not going to get those numbers on satellite television. In 2005 it was monster. The problem is they do not have any proper heroes. Guys like Root, Stokes and Buttler should be big stars.” Would he like to be involved in some capacity – be it mentor, consultant or coach? “It is something I will definitely look at for sure.” As for Saturday, he will not be too emotional. After all, he says, he started out as an 18-year-old offie who could not hold a bat. “I am aware of how lucky I am to have played one Test match,” he reflects, having played 104 of them. “It will be a celebration. I have loved my career. I will not shed a tear over something that has been so cool.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"society/2018/jan/25/giving-teenagers-alcohol-may-increase-risk-of-drink-related-problems-study","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-25T20:00:26Z","webTitle":"Giving teenagers alcohol may increase risk of drink-related problems – study","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jan/25/giving-teenagers-alcohol-may-increase-risk-of-drink-related-problems-study","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/jan/25/giving-teenagers-alcohol-may-increase-risk-of-drink-related-problems-study","fields":{"headline":"Giving teenagers alcohol may increase risk of drink-related problems – study","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Parents who give alcohol to their teenagers could be increasing their offspring’s risk of binge drinking and other alcohol-related problems, research has revealed. The study found that compared with secondary-school aged children who had no access to alcohol, those who were given some by their parents more often admitted to later binge drinking, had symptoms of alcohol-use disorder and experienced alcohol-related harms – such as difficulty recalling events or getting into trouble. The authors conclude there is no evidence that parental supply of alcohol protects children from such experiences. “It is, unfortunately, well-intentioned, but not a good idea,” said Richard Mattick, professor of drug and alcohol studies at the University of New South Wales and a co-author of the research. “All you are doing is giving your permission to kids to drink.” Writing in The Lancet Public Health, Mattick and colleagues describe how they followed the behaviours of more than 1,900 parents and secondary-school aged children over the course of six years, from around the age of 12 until they reached sixth form. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the team found that experience of alcohol-related harms and binge drinking – where five or more drinks are consumed in one sitting – increased as the children grew older. . But while previous research from the team had suggested parental supply of alcohol did not increase risk of children binge-drinking, and resulted in a lower risk of drinking overall compared with those who obtained it from elsewhere, such as friends, the new study suggests that parental supply does not protect children from overindulging. Taking into account factors including children’s sex, age, and household income, children who had been given alcohol by parents alone had 2.58 times the odds of reporting binge-drinking in the following year, compared with those with no supply of alcohol; the odds of alcohol-related harm or symptoms of alcohol use disorder were also more than twice as high as for those with no supply. The odds were even higher for the children who got hold of alcohol from other sources, either in addition to or instead of parental supply, with these children also found to have higher chances of alcohol abuse or dependency symptoms than those who had no alcohol supply – although such questions were only asked of older teens. While 25% of teens around 18 years old who were given alcohol by their parents reported binge-drinking, the figure reached 62% for those obtaining alcohol from elsewhere and 81% for those receiving alcohol from parents and others. While the impact of the quantity of alcohol supplied by parents is yet to be published, the latest study reveals that even sips of alcohol given by parents double the odds of children receiving alcohol from other sources in the subsequent year, with the impact even greater if parents supplied whole drinks. The authors admit that the research has limitations, including that it relied on self-report, did not probe context of alcohol supply, and that it had a low proportion of participants who were socioeconomically disadvantaged. But they say its size, and the fact it looked at children into their late teens, meant it was better able to probe the impact of parental alcohol supply than the previous report. Mattick adds that the team has recently received funding to follow the teenagers to the age of 23. “The story isn’t fully told until we can determine whether this leads to the real harm, which is alcohol use disorders,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/jan/25/rory-mcilroy-pre-shot-routine-dubai-desert-classic","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-25T14:46:00Z","webTitle":"Jamie Donaldson leads Dubai Desert Classic after first-round 62","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jan/25/rory-mcilroy-pre-shot-routine-dubai-desert-classic","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jan/25/rory-mcilroy-pre-shot-routine-dubai-desert-classic","fields":{"headline":"Jamie Donaldson leads Dubai Desert Classic after first-round 62","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Not much has gone right for Jamie Donaldson since the 2014 moment that will most likely define his career. It was the Welshman who delivered the winning point for Europe in that Ryder Cup edition, a superb wedge shot into the 15th at Gleneagles proving the stuff of fairytale. Harsh reality was soon to kick in. Owing largely to injury problems that triggered an ominous downturn in form, Donaldson has recently found himself scraping around to retain European Tour status. How he justified that position in Dubai on Thursday, with back-to-back nines of 31 placing the 42-year-old at the head of proceedings at the Desert Classic. A Donaldson recovery from his current position of 292 in the world rankings may be imminent. Donaldson later admitted that the prospect of shooting golf’s magic number, 59, had been on his mind. “I knew what was on the cards out there,” he said. “I think I had five holes to go and started thinking about 59. But I mean, you can never be disappointed with 10-under, can you?” Rory McIlroy’s actions continue to speak louder than words. The Northern Irishman may publicly insist that victory is not essential before he takes another tilt at the career grand slam – at Augusta National in April – but McIlroy’s professional performance tells another story. His opening here included only 65 shots and, for the third time in five rounds, not a single scorecard blemish. There is a palpable sense that McIlroy is edging towards the tournament win that would boost his Masters claims and endorse dedicated off‑season work. Context was supplied by the 28‑year‑old’s sentiments after day one at the Emirates Club, with McIlroy bemoaning missed chances on the greens and “disappointing” iron play. “It was nice to get off to a good start,” McIlroy said. “That way you put yourself right in contention in the tournament straight away. That’s honestly one of my goals this year. I feel like I started off last year a little bit sort of 71, 70 instead of getting right into the thick of things from the start. So it’s been nice to start the last couple weeks this way.” Despite his frustration regarding missed birdie opportunities, McIlroy’s round did include 10 single putts. A newly introduced and deliberate pre‑shot routine when the four‑times major champion has putter in hand looks to be paying dividends. McIlroy has also reintroduced a policy of line-marking his ball to assist with alignment. “I’m going to be very disciplined with using the line on the ball,” he said. “It makes it easier for me to line up better and frees me up in terms of making a good stroke. I started using it a little bit in 2014. Actually I had my best ever putting round on the PGA Tour using the line, it was the first round at Memorial in 2014. It’s always been something I’ve been in and out of but I feel like I putt my best with it, so I want to be consistent with it now. “I’ve been very disciplined with it and stuck to the same routine and stuck to the same thing. I feel like I’m stroking it really well and every putt that I’m hitting looks like it has a chance.” McIlroy rightly acknowledged benign Thursday morning conditions that contributed to generally low scoring. David Horsey had charged into the lead courtesy of a 63 – a score later matched by Anthony Wall – before Donaldson’s heroics. Thomas Pieters, Chris Paisley, Lasse Jensen and Alexander Björk are alongside McIlroy at seven under par. Sergio García, the defending champion, opened with a 67. Ian Poulter shot a 68 but Danny Willett’s woes continued. The 2016 Masters champion, who has been beset by shoulder troubles recently, reached the turn in two under but was to finish with a seven and eight before signing for a 77."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/jan/25/worldwide-websites-money-uefa-football-trends","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-25T11:27:14Z","webTitle":"Worldwide websites and money, money, money: Uefa’s football trends   | Paul MacInnes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/25/worldwide-websites-money-uefa-football-trends","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jan/25/worldwide-websites-money-uefa-football-trends","fields":{"headline":"Worldwide websites and money, money, money: Uefa’s football trends","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The game ain’t what it used to be. Goalkeepers are wearing leggings, strikers are instagramming from private jets, defenders are trying to pass the ball, everything is in flux. To confirm the point, a group of wonks at Uefa published a report this past week analysing the trends in European football, from attendances to commercial revenues and transfer fees. Much of it made for interesting reading. Here are seven of the more striking observations that show how football is changing. The Championship hits the big leagues From even a cursory glance of Uefa’s Club Licensing Benchmarking Report what is striking is how much English football dominates the landscape. It is obvious in figures such as wage bills and transfer fees (English clubs pay more and spend more often) but also applies to stuff that has nothing to do with TV money, such as attendances. According to the report, not only are West Ham the seventh biggest club in Europe (averaging 56,972 spectators a match in 2016-17) but the Championship is the third biggest league. That’s according to aggregate attendance and, whereas it is seventh in average crowds at 20,084, that’s not far off the 20,963 of France’s Ligue 1. Arsenal: No 1 in Europe For ticket prices, that is. The Gunners boast an average “yield” per spectator of €97.8. Juventus, meanwhile, take less than half that, at €44.5, and Paris Saint-Germain just over a third. The figure was calculated by rolling together all types of ticketing and, once again, English clubs dominate the list. The average gate receipt per person in the Premier League in 2015-16 was €50.1. Prices in Italy and France were less than half that. Inequality is for football too We are used to reading about the super-rich getting richer. Well this applies to football as well. The benchmarking report makes reference to what it calls “the Global 12”, the biggest clubs in the world who are operating in a different stratosphere to the rest. This is apparent from the cumulative value of players on their books to the size of their internet following. But the clearest distinction between the biggest clubs and the rest is in money earned through sponsorship. While most clubs in Europe’s top divisions generate the majority of their revenue from TV, the very biggest make it from sponsorship. The top 12 clubs take 40% of all sponsorship revenue, an astonishing €2.4bn. There is an I in team The report spends a fair few pages looking at football’s digital footprint, and it is apparent that players can be bigger than clubs. Twelve footballers, for example, have more than 10m Twitter followers. Only five clubs had reached that milestone at the time the report was collated. Barcelona and Real Madrid are by far the most popular clubs on social media, but Cristiano Ronaldo is more popular than either. As clubs focus more of their commercial strategy on digital platforms, this will be a statistic to watch. Barcelona: mes que un club One further tidbit to come out of the digital numbers regards La Liga’s giants. When calculating the nationality of visitors to club websites, the report finds that seven of the top eight clubs have more visitors from abroad than from their own country. Barcelona boast the highest percentage in that list with 91% of their visitors coming from overseas. More specifically, Barça’s site gets 9.5% of its users from the United States, compared with 8.9% from Spain. Truly an international attraction. Everyone wants a Frenchman Transfer spending keeps going up with €5.6bn spent across Europe last summer, well over double the total five years previously (€2.3bn in 2012). The Premier League spent the most at €1.682bn, just about the same as Italy and France combined and streets ahead of Spain and Germany. Across the continent there were more high value (€15m-plus) transfers than ever before (96, up from 71 in 2016) and, with a total of 11, French players were the most common nationality in that list. Football’s enduring gold rush The introduction to the report makes it plain: “Few, if any, activities come close to matching the continuous 10% year-on-year growth in revenues that European club football has generated since the turn of the century.” The total revenue of clubs in Europe’s top divisions has tripled since 2000. In the financial year to 2016, 48 clubs made more than €100m. The richest are growing faster than the rest, yes, but 27 leagues across Europe reported growth of more than 10%. This is possible because, driven by television, the audience for football keeps growing. It shows no signs of stopping."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/25/davos-migration-airfare-business-class-tax","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-25T11:36:35Z","webTitle":"Hey Davos, how about a tax on business class airfares? | Felix Marquardt","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/25/davos-migration-airfare-business-class-tax","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/25/davos-migration-airfare-business-class-tax","fields":{"headline":"Hey Davos, how about a tax on business class airfares?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The elites have learned their lesson this year, we’re told. “Ahead of Davos”, the Washington Post headlined a report this week, “even the 1% worry about inequality”. That statement is actually unfair. Davos is one of the places where the rise of inequality has been recognised most candidly over the past few years. The thing is, worrying about inequality doesn’t stop people voting for Ukip, Trump or Brexit. Elites need to put their money where their mouth is and to go from being “committed to improving the state of the world” (the World Economic Forum’s tagline) to actually taking action to improve it. We need new ways to share the proceeds of globalisation more effectively with the people bearing the brunt of its negative effects. If we don’t, we might as well get used to the political ascent of people such as Donald Trump and Nigel Farage and the erosion of democracy they spearhead. Youthonomics, the thinktank I run, studies the nature of intergenerational inequalities. The single most potent means to reduce inequality we have identified happens to be the oldest and most widely used means of emancipation, empowerment, education and enlightenment out there: migration, the act of going from point A to point B in search of a better life. These days conversations about migration tend to be driven by self-described “realists” such as the journalist David Goodhart, author of The Road to Somewhere, which looks at the rise of identity politics and attempts to explain it. Proponents of Goodhart’s view would like to see migratory flows adjusted, stopped and sometimes even reversed. The others with the loudest say on migration meanwhile are often apologists, who by virtue of their privilege, don’t have to see or feel the negative effects of immigration up close. There is indeed something obscene about the self-righteousness of the privileged globalists one finds in Davos, about their lack of granular understanding of the local and their contempt for what binds people to their roots and culture. And it is true that a new divide has taken hold which is superseding the old split between haves and have-nots. I call it flys and fly-nots (tell me how often you fly and I will tell you who you are). But to go from analysis of this new divide to praise of the narrow-mindedness, poorer education and reactionary thinking to which it leads is misplaced. Goodhart confuses what he would like to see (the comeback of the nation state) with what is actually happening (Brexit and Trump as its swansong). Most importantly, he fails to see that while the condescending attitudes of liberal, cosmopolitan elites have played a huge role in the rise of populism across Europe and the US, the answer to the world’s most pressing problems will have to be transnational. And further, that one group of people is particularly predisposed to coming up with them. These are the people who are immersed in the local and have a vested interest in ensuring they properly integrate in their societies but who also have a degree of international perspective on the world. People who have international experience and consciousness of “the other” (because they are “it”) and a thorough understanding of the importance of cultivating one’s roots (because they are often preserving their own while simultaneously trying to grow new ones): migrants. But the harder question is: how do you reconcile people with migration when they blame migration for their economic and social problems? Of course, investing in education is key. The convenient division of migrants into two neatly defined categories – refugees, fleeing war, poverty, disease and other forms of tragedy who then come and steal our jobs on the one hand, and expats, privileged professionals who work for banks or large corporations in Singapore on the other – needs to be done away with. This Manichean view of migration does not properly account for the vast majority of migrants in the world, who fit neither description. Especially as migration is changing – as the world migration report illustrates. Over the past 20 years, the combined effects of the third industrial revolution and increasingly ubiquitous low-cost travel is leading an ever-growing number of people to embrace a new kind of nomadic lifestyle, profoundly modifying migratory patterns. Many young people, in particular, increasingly identify more strongly with the global realm than with the national one and are conscious that international mobility is their key to prosperity in the 21st century. But education is the long game; elites need to move now to show they are serious about fighting inequality and anti-immigration sentiment. And in a world increasingly divided into flys and fly-nots, what better way to do that than to tax those who fly the most and spend the most on airfares? The proceeds of that tax could be invested in economic development, infrastructure projects and schools in the areas that are most economically fragile and which therefore have become most hostile to immigration. Not practical, not realistic, not doable, you say? Actually, such a tax already exists. It has been levied on airline tickets in a number of countries including the UK, France and Brazil since 2002 and its recipient, the UN agency Unitaid, uses the money to finance the fight against Aids, tuberculosis and malaria. Instead of patronising leavers, Ukip and Trump voters, let’s levy an additional £5 on every business class ticket sold in the UK and use the proceeds to finance the economic development of the places most severely hit by the negative effects of globalisation. • Felix Marquardt is director of the thinktank Youthonomics and the author of The New Nomad, the Case for Migration"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"culture/2018/jan/25/the-20-greatest-oscar-snubs-ever-ranked","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-25T15:45:17Z","webTitle":"The 20 greatest Oscar snubs ever – Ranked!","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/jan/25/the-20-greatest-oscar-snubs-ever-ranked","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2018/jan/25/the-20-greatest-oscar-snubs-ever-ranked","fields":{"headline":"The 20 greatest Oscar snubs ever – Ranked!","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"1. Alfred Hitchcock And the Oscar goes to … the wrong film or person, most of the time. This we know. But for proof of the seemingly unbridgeable chasm between quality and the Academy Awards, try this: Alfred Hitchcock never got his mitts on a best director prize. He came within sniffing distance on five occasions. And while it would be unfair to cry foul over the award going in 1961 to Billy Wilder for The Apartment rather than Hitchcock for Psycho (they were both masters of the darkly bitter comedy, after all), it is harder to argue for the superiority of Leo McCarey, who won in 1945 for Going My Way, when Hitchcock was in contention for Lifeboat. He did eventually get a statuette for lifetime achievement but it might as well have had “too little, too late” engraved next to his name. Still, Hitchcock gave it the acceptance speech it deserved. “Thank you, very much indeed,” was all he said before leaving the stage. 2. Stanley Kubrick Another gobsmacking oversight. Ron Howard, Kevin Costner, Robert Redford and even Tom Hooper all have directing Oscars. But Stanley Kubrick? Nope. He was in the running four times and should have won for Barry Lyndon in 1976, except that was the year of One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest. Fear of flying would have precluded the UK-based Kubrick from attending, but that was no reason to give it instead to Carol Reed in 1969 (a great director, though Oliver! is no 2001: A Space Odyssey) and William Friedkin in 1972 (The French Connection over A Clockwork Orange? Did the voters all get a tolchock on the gulliver or what?) 3. Citizen Kane Orson Welles’s 1941 masterpiece is a contender not only for best picture of all time, but also greatest film never to win best picture. At least it was nominated, although it converted only one of its nine nods into an award (for best screenplay) and lost in the best picture category to John Ford’s family saga How Green Was My Valley. The film critic Pauline Kael reported that there were “hisses and loud boos” every time Welles or the film’s name was read out on the night, such was the stench of controversy surrounding it. 4. Myrna Loy The Thin Man comedies, which follow the sleuthing, smart-talking private eye Nick and his heiress wife Nora, remain one of the enduring delights of vintage Hollywood, but the Academy saw fit to nominate only one half of the double-act (William Powell) that made the series great. The splendid Myrna Loy had to wait until 1991, two years before her death, for – you guessed it – an honorary Oscar, the Academy’s equivalent of flowers grabbed from a petrol station forecourt on Valentine’s Day. 5. Charlie Chaplin Cold-shouldered by the Academy for most of his career, Chaplin got two honorary awards, one at the start of his career (in 1929) and another at the end (in 1972, for “the incalculable effect he has had in making motion pictures the art form of this century”), but nothing specifically for the great achievements – the towering comic masterpieces City Lights, Modern Times and The Great Dictator. A special last-minute booby prize came in the form of the Oscar in 1973 for the score he composed for his film Limelight (made in 1952 but not seen in the US for 20 years) – which was a bit like giving Harrison Ford a prize for his carpentry. 6. Taxi Driver Martin Scorsese has had a rum old time of it at the Oscars, forever losing out in the best picture category to vastly inferior films: Raging Bull was beaten by the facile psychotherapy drama Ordinary People, Goodfellas by the narcissistic western Dances With Wolves. The most egregious loss has to be his expressionistic character study Taxi Driver being pipped at the post by Rocky: not a terrible film by any means, but hardly in the same class. Typical that when a Scorsese movie was finally named best picture, it was The Departed, his bloated remake of Infernal Affairs. 7. La Grande Illusion Non-American films rarely see much glory in the best picture category – The Artist was able to win, for example, only because it didn’t contain any foreign language. But it might have been hoped that the deeply compassionate and timely anti-war sentiment of Jean Renoir’s La Grande Illusion might have overcome any resistance to the reading of subtitles. Alas, non. At the 1939 Oscars, Frank Capra’s You Can’t Take It With You took the doorstop instead. 8. Judy Garland It is incredible that the star of The Wizard of Oz, Meet Me in St Louis and A Star Is Born garlanded no Best Actress prizes from the Academy, although she was nominated for her gutsy, all-or-nothing performance in A Star Is Born opposite James Mason, and got an honorary juvenile award for all that frolicking on the Yellow Brick Road. 9. There Will Be Blood Like his latest film, Phantom Thread, Paul Thomas Anderson’s 2007 oil-rush drama was a very odd duck indeed: an epic with only two characters of note, and an ending that swaps the rest of the movie’s sweeping canvas for a petty dust-up in a bowing alley. Daniel Day-Lewis won best actor but the rest was all far too weird to take best picture, despite displaying a virtuosity and daring sorely missing from the safe-bet winner, the Coen brothers’ superficial No Country For Old Men. 10. Robert Mitchum Taciturn hardmen have a hard time getting awards since what they do is so undemonstrative, and not always visible to the naked eye. Lino Ventura and Jean Gabin never got Oscars. Lee Marvin and Jack Palance had to start monkeying around (Marvin in Cat Ballou, Palance in City Slickers) before they were rewarded. No wonder Robert Mitchum had a mantelpiece bare of prizes. As a big man specialising in minimalism, his talents were too subtle for the Oscars. 11. River Phoenix He died at 23, but Phoenix (older brother of Joaquin) crammed an extraordinary amount of dazzling work into his short acting career. A shame, then, that for his one Oscar-nominated performance – for best supporting actor as the wary, heartfelt son of 1960s activists still on the run from the FBI in Running On Empty – he lost to Kevin Kline in A Fish Called Wanda, the sort of dotty vaudeville turn (see also John Gielgud in Arthur) that can sometimes be the wild card in the supporting categories. 12. The Thin Red Line Some say Saving Private Ryan was the big loser on Oscar night in 1999. But no: it was The Thin Red Line, another second world war story, which marked the magisterial return of Terrence Malick after 20 years in the wilderness. Blame Harvey Weinstein’s notoriously aggressive, bullying Oscar campaign that secured the best picture prize for the insipid Shakespeare in Love. 13. Marilyn Monroe For sheer comic pizzazz, she should have been a shoo-in for Some Like It Hot, although she wasn’t nominated – for that or anything else. 14. Brokeback Mountain Its best picture hopes were crushed by Crash. (And not the Cronenberg one, more’s the pity.) 15. The Social Network David Fincher and Aaron Sorkin turned the story of Facebook into a gripping psychological thriller. The Academy preferred the fusty, stagy period piece The King’s Speech. 16. Bette Davis She won in 1936 for Dangerous and would have done so for her storming turn in Of Human Bondage a year earlier had she not broken her contract with Warner Bros to make it. “My failure to receive the award created a scandal that gave me more publicity than if I had won it,” she later said. 17. The English Patient Don’t feel sorry for this Oscar-laden melodrama. But the late Anthony Minghella himself reportedly felt that the achievement of his that should have been recognised – his marshalling of Michael Ondaatje’s mammoth novel into a coherent screenplay – was overlooked. 18. Amour Michael Haneke’s profound, upsetting masterpiece was beaten by the smug, second-rate Ben Affleck thriller Argo, which was sort-of-but-not-really based on real events. 19. Randa Haines Children of a Lesser God director Haines was excluded from the nominations while four of her colleagues were recognised. As tends to happen with female film-makers. 20. ET: The Extra-Terrestrial Even Richard Attenborough said ET should have won best picture. And he directed Gandhi – the film that beat it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/2018/jan/25/zak-hardaker-castleford-daryl-powell","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-25T13:50:13Z","webTitle":"Zak Hardaker could return to Castleford after cocaine ban, says Daryl Powell","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jan/25/zak-hardaker-castleford-daryl-powell","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jan/25/zak-hardaker-castleford-daryl-powell","fields":{"headline":"Zak Hardaker could return to Castleford after cocaine ban, says Daryl Powell","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The Castleford head coach, Daryl Powell, has admitted there is a possibility Zak Hardaker could return to the Super League club once he has served his ban following a failed drugs test. The England international was suspended by the Tigers in the days leading up to the Grand Final last October, with it later emerging that he had tested positive for cocaine following a Super 8s game against Leeds in September. The length of Hardaker’s suspension is yet to be determined by UK Anti-Doping, but it is likely he will face a ban of two years. Powell said the club could still welcome the 26-year-old back to the fold after that. “You never say never,” Powell said. “I sat down with Zak after it all happened and yes, there is potential for that, but it’d depend on him and what happens to him. We just have to wait and see on that.” Hardaker is understood to have taken a job away from rugby league with the club’s help while he awaits his suspension. “Zak is a good kid, he’s made a few too many mistakes but ultimately he’s a fantastic rugby league player and I think there could be [a future] for him,” Powell said. “The club has been fantastic for him and we’ll have to wait and see what the future holds.” Without Hardaker, Powell will switch the Samoan half-back Ben Roberts to full-back this season, which begins for Castleford at St Helens next Friday. Powell says it will be a challenge for Roberts to fill the void. “Zak was probably the fittest player in the competition last year,” Powell said. “Benny isn’t quite like that, and we’re tweaking a couple of things in terms of our game to suit that. Defensively he’ll have to work really hard because Zak was outstanding there.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/jan/28/mcmafia-recap-series-one-episode-six","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-28T22:00:30Z","webTitle":"McMafia recap – series one, episode six","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jan/28/mcmafia-recap-series-one-episode-six","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jan/28/mcmafia-recap-series-one-episode-six","fields":{"headline":"McMafia recap – series one, episode six","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"‘In this business, it’s easier to have no attachments’ – Antonio Mendez If there’s a theme to this week’s episode, it’s that of family, not merely as source of solace, trust, comfort, meaning and purpose in a cruel and dirty world, but as a source of vulnerability. Vadim at one point recalls the many torture victims he has witnessed over the years. Even as their fingernails were ripped out, they would cry out: do as you want to me, but please spare my family. It’s on that basis he proceeds in his operations against Alex, having discovered his involvement with Kleiman. That said, personal relationships are at a dismal ebb throughout this episode. At Alex’s place with Rebecca, a yellow bath of lamplight reflects the sallow, tense state of their relationship. She is frustrated at his lack of communication about his clearly dubious business affairs, including last week’s spectacular events, and not satisfied with his bland attempts to explain them away. She wants to know what’s really up. He coldly suggests they separate for a while, to her shock – but she does indeed move out. In fairness to Alex, this is out of a desire to protect her from Vadim, rather than any cooling off on his part, as shown when he stares wistfully at images of them in happier times. Alex is right to be worried about Vadim, whose instincts are permanently set to homicidal, but, as ever, his mellow consigliere Ilya advises caution. Similarly counselled by his lawyer, Vadim puts together a surveillance team that will carry out surveillance against Alex and his family. Aware that he needs to up his security, Alex contacts Joseph in Israel. It so happens Joseph want to enlist Alex as an ally in his efforts to help Lyudmilla, the romantic undercurrents of which are becoming increasingly evident, as she places a soft kiss on his lips for his efforts. Kleiman, though, who seems to have regained his composure after last week’s drama, is having none of it. In London, Joseph puts Alex in touch with a trusted security expert, and a team is assembled, who are all introduced to Alex’s family. They take it in their stride. “Whatever you do, I am on your side,” Dimitri assures his son. Rebecca moves into an apartment and, at the pool, befriends one Sylvie, who has a baby. They get along sweetly. This, you fear, will not turn out well. Masha, carrying Dimitri’s child, goes for a consultation at an abortion clinic. She tells Katya, however, that she wants to keep the baby. Meanwhile, she is still secretly seeing Dimitri. Katya breaks the news to Alex about the pregnancy and his father’s involvement, and we have never seen him so stricken. He is altogether cooler – indeed, Tony Blair in his oily approach to troubled waters springs to mind – when he and Katya meet Masha and offer to pay £20,000 a month for her to look after the baby as long as she disappears. She refuses. Vadim has decided to get to Alex via Benes – his daughter, Carolina, is his weakness. After his daughter is assaulted, Benes arranges a meeting in London with Alex. They meet at a Czech restaurant, where Benes lets slip a reference to the swimming pool at Rebecca’s apartment block – how could he know that? Alex never told him. Alarmed, he excuses himself and alerts Joseph before returning to the table. Soulful and a little drunk, Benes cannot help but guiltily reveal that Vadim’s people got to him via Carolina. “They could have tortured me for days, I would have revealed nothing – but my child …” Rebecca has invited over lovely Sylvie for wine and pasta as Sylvie’s nanny takes away her child. Rebecca intimates to Sylvie that she is pregnant. We’re still absorbing that when Sylvie holds a gun to her and, with ice-cold blood, shoots her in the belly. Yes, to no one’s surprise, she is a hired killer. Alex has dispatched Joseph to the apartment, however. He arrives in time to kill Sylvie, if not save Rebecca, who is critically injured. A distraught Alex arrives at the hospital. Additional notes Rebecca looks askance at Alex in the shop when he takes a shady business call and tries to disguise it. The giveaway? He says “goodbye” at the end of the call. This is TV drama. No one ever says “goodbye” at the end of a phone call. Benes tells Alex they are at the only Czech restaurant in London. A quick internet check suggests this is indeed the case – it’s in West Hampstead. Try the pork knuckles. The most blatant Godfather allusion to date this week, as Vadim, in a meeting, sees daughter Natasha in the hallway and has one of his men shut the double doors on her as she peers in, much as Michael Corleone so memorably does to Kay. With Rebecca’s attempted murder, the stakes are now desperately high for Alex. Will he capitulate to Vadim, like Benes, or make matters worse by responding hotheadedly? Is Kleiman really out of the picture? Everything is lined up to fall apart dramatically in the final two episodes. Can’t wait."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"careers/2018/feb/02/will-a-robot-recruiter-be-hiring-you-for-your-next-job","type":"article","sectionId":"careers","sectionName":"Guardian Careers","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-02T09:46:58Z","webTitle":"Will a robot recruiter be hiring you for your next job?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/careers/2018/feb/02/will-a-robot-recruiter-be-hiring-you-for-your-next-job","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/careers/2018/feb/02/will-a-robot-recruiter-be-hiring-you-for-your-next-job","fields":{"headline":"Will a robot recruiter be hiring you for your next job?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Artificial intelligence (AI) is creeping into every aspect of daily life. Computer algorithms keep our inboxes free of email spam, suggest which TV programmes we should watch and even drive some of our cars. Now, smart machines may play a role in deciding whether or not you get your next job. An increasing number of employers are using robot recruiters that can assess CVs, screen candidates and pair them with the right roles. The search for efficiency in the recruitment process has fuelled interest in AI. Finding employees with the correct mixture of skills, personality and motivation is difficult – even when the pool of candidates is large. “The benefits are huge,” says Eyal Grayevsky, CEO of Mya Systems, which has created an AI recruiter called Mya. “Companies have large databases of candidates they have acquired over the years, and they are receiving more CVs than ever before, now that the internet has made it easier to apply for jobs. Previously, recruiters were drowning in manual work, assessing applications. With AI, they can automate the repetitive tasks that slow them down.” One large retailer that used Mya to hire warehouse staff reported a 79% reduction in the time it took to fill each position, and a 144% increase in productivity per recruiter who used the technology. Job candidates, meanwhile, benefit by receiving a guaranteed response from Mya. “It’s a very human-like interaction,” Grayevsky says. Frida Polli, CEO of Pymetrics, which uses AI to pair people with suitable jobs, says robo-recruiters can also help employers become more diverse by removing some of the unconscious bias in the hiring process. “It can be more objective than a human – but if untested, AI will amplify whatever bias already exists because it is trained to find patterns and replicate them.” Some worry that the rise of the robots will displace the human recruiter, but Anna Seely, principal of talent strategy at Mercer, says: “The role of HR is evolving as a result of digital disruption. Rather than replacing humans, AI gives us access to much richer data to drive better decision making.” With fears growing that automation could eliminate some low-skilled jobs, hiring managers need to think about how to prepare employees to work alongside machines in the near future. “Skills such as purchasing and managing technology, analysing data and designing new products and services will be essential. HR will be a more powerful function going forward,” Seely says. How Mya works • The AI interviewer When a candidate applies for a job online, Mya introduces herself and initiates a dynamic, written conversation – similar to a text message format. • Real-time answers The bot asks the candidate a series of interview questions, such as: “What’s your pay range?”, “Can you handle the physical requirements of the job?”, “What is your shift availability?”. Mya can also answer questions about the job in real time. • Language assessment The AI uses natural language processing to pick up on conversational details. Based on the candidate’s answers, Mya assesses whether they are a good fit. The bot sends a scorecard and transcript to the employer. Cloud-based, Mya is designed to integrate into existing HR software. • The next stage If the candidate is a match, Mya will schedule an interview with a human hiring manager. If they are not, she will suggest other jobs that may be relevant to them."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/26/sad-news-fewer-teenagers-learning-drive-empowerment","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-26T08:00:40Z","webTitle":"Why it’s sad news that fewer teenagers are learning to drive | Radhika Sanghani","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/26/sad-news-fewer-teenagers-learning-drive-empowerment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/26/sad-news-fewer-teenagers-learning-drive-empowerment","fields":{"headline":"Why it’s sad news that fewer teenagers are learning to drive","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"I was desperate to drive long before I turned 17. Like many of my generation, born in the late 80s and early 90s, I’d grown up on a diet of films in which cars played an important role. Whether it was the famous ending of Thelma and Louise, Elle Woods zooming off to Harvard in Legally Blonde, or the final scene of Cruel Intentions, I knew that driving was the embodiment of freedom – especially when it came to my favourite heroines. My dream was to get in a car, hit the open road – which I always imagined to look like the American midwest rather than my local A41 – and feel the wind in my hair. I’d have the music on loud, I’d have nobody next to me in the passenger seat, and I’d be the star of the movie that was my life. I’ve now been driving for more than a decade, and I still get that tingling feeling of liberation and excitement every time I get behind the wheel. I feel exactly as I did the second I got into my driving instructors’ car, aged 17: free. The sad news is that the generation below me is missing out on this joy. A Department for Transport report has found that driving has declined dramatically over the past 20 years. While just under half of 17- to 20-year-olds had licences in 1992-4, that figure was 29% by 2014. And the number of 21- to 29-year-olds with licences also decreased, from 75% to 63%. Academics from the University of Oxford and UWE Bristol believe the reasons range from financial hardship and the cost of keeping a car, to the delayed adulthood on gen Y and Z, and, most worryingly of all, the rise of digital communication beginning to replace face-to-face interaction. It is understandable that learning to drive might not be top priority for a school-leaver facing £9,000-a-year university fees, but I think it’s a great shame. My friends and I followed the American tradition of getting part-time jobs at school to fund our third-hand cars. Learning to drive was a rite of passage, and, as young women, it was one of the most empowering things we could do. Instead of being reliant on parents, friends and public transport to get us around, we could do it ourselves. It gave us more agency over our lives: not only does being able to drive mean you can easily do an Ikea trip alone, or hire a car in a foreign country, it’s proof that you can take care of yourself. For me, there’s nothing more empowering than driving alone, especially with the knowledge that in Saudi Arabia, after decades of being banned from the wheel, women have only just been given the right to drive. Of course, the decline of driving is positive in one way. Air pollution is a huge problem in the UK and the environment will benefit from having less cars on the road. But there are ethical (and inexpensive) ways to drive. I have friends who sign up to schemes where they can occasionally hire a car without owning one, and others who created their own “scheme” by buying an eco-friendly car together and splitting costs. And I worry we lose something with a generational decline in rates of driving, with tech more important to younger generations than cars. I hope that they find an opportunity to get behind a wheel and have a taste of the freedom that only driving can bring. Or, at the very least, sit down and watch a female road trip film – be it Britney in Crossroads, or Thelma and Louise – to understand just how powerful the open road can be. • Radhika Sanghani is a freelance journalist and novelist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"technology/2018/feb/02/tell-us-about-the-first-time-you-used-wifi","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-02T12:46:38Z","webTitle":"Tell us about the first time you used wifi","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/feb/02/tell-us-about-the-first-time-you-used-wifi","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/feb/02/tell-us-about-the-first-time-you-used-wifi","fields":{"headline":"Tell us about the first time you used wifi","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"In 18 public parks across Cuba everyone has the opportunity to contact loved ones, explore social media, upload photos and find internet dates thanks to ETECSA – the only telephone company in the country – installing wifi routers in 2016.

Accounting firm Grant Thornton, for example, has gone to great lengths to diversify its workforce, including removing academic entry requirements for its entry-level trainee schemes. However, the most privileged people in society continue to claim the lion’s share of the best jobs, including in the legal, military, medical and journalism professions, according to the education charity Sutton Trust. For example, 82% of barristers in the UK went to Oxbridge. Even once they manage to land a job, those in minority groups face unique barriers to progression. “Many organisations focus on how to get more people from a more diverse range of backgrounds into their profession,” says Rachael Millar, head of work and skills policy for the Social Mobility Commission. “But there are cultural and behavioural hurdles that prevent people from getting on once they get in.” The commission’s research found a pay divide of nearly £7,000, on average, between people from poorer backgrounds and their privileged peers, with the gap highest in finance, at £13,713. At the BBC, for instance, 45% of the highest-paid stars went to an independent school. The commission says those from working-class backgrounds “may be less likely to ask for pay rises”, and may lack access to the networks that can help them gain promotion. So some employers are deploying strategies to improve progression and ensure equal pay. Grant Thornton assigns the 420 trainee recruits that join the accounting firm each year a manager, who provides guidance to help them advance. “Resources are available, and we need to ensure that everybody uses them, not just those from fee-paying schools who know how to make the system work for them,” says Malcolm Gomersall, diversity and inclusion lead at the firm. Collecting data to measure the impact of recruitment and retention policy is critical to improving social mobility in companies. KPMG was the first UK employer to publish detailed figures on the socioeconomic background of its staff. “We don’t stop at whether employees attended a private or state school; we look at whether they received free school meals, where their parents went to university and which professions they worked in,” says Melanie Richards, vice-chair of KPMG UK. As more employers recognise that building a more meritocratic workplace is not only the right thing to do, but can provide numerous benefits, such as addressing skills shortages, the social mobility gap may continue to close. “There’s no question: having people from a diverse range of backgrounds can produce better business results,” says Richards."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"football/2018/jan/25/moaning-about-an-inability-to-splurge-while-ignoring-eden-hazard","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-25T16:05:39Z","webTitle":"The Fiver | Moaning about an inability to splurge while ignoring Eden Hazard","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/25/moaning-about-an-inability-to-splurge-while-ignoring-eden-hazard","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jan/25/moaning-about-an-inability-to-splurge-while-ignoring-eden-hazard","fields":{"headline":"Moaning about an inability to splurge while ignoring Eden Hazard","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"ANTONI–OH Won’t somebody please, please, please, please think of Antonio Conte? Having seen his team knocked out of the Rumbelows Cup by an Arsenal side that has not been in crisis for 10 whole days (and won’t be again until 30 January at the earliest thanks to the FA Cup-induced crisis that preceded the most recent crisis prompted by defeat at the hands of Bournemouth), the Chelsea manager has taken up the Most Beleaguered Manager mantle in order to air his grievances over a Chelsea recruitment policy that has left him down to what ‘Arry Redknapp so memorably referred to as “the bare bones”. It is difficult not to empathise, of course. A club that has always lived within in its means, unlike those nouveau riche arrivistes up the road in Manchester or beyond in Paris, Chelsea have kept the Italian on a ridiculously tight rein since his arrival in that there big London, restricting his spending on new players to a little under £300m. Meanwhile, other more lavish spenders around Europe are blowing outlandish sums on your Neymars, your Mbappés, your Pogbas and your Coutinhos, so what’s po’ Conte to do? Repeatedly vent his spleen, it seems, by moaning about his inability to splurge on similarly gifted players while conveniently ignoring the fact that, in Eden Hazard, he already has one scampering around under his nose. “When there is an injury to one of your best players it is not simple, especially when on the bench the only substitute is Ross Barkley,” he grumbled in the wake of last night’s defeat, in an outburst that suggested he wasn’t too bothered about which of Barkley or his six other subs he offended the most. Conte went on to say that the new arrival “can improve a lot”, which seems a fair assessment of a former Everton midfielder who appears to have become so rusty after six months on the sidelines that it took him 10 minutes to unzip his tracksuit. While it is true that Roman Abramovich has tightened his purse strings and Chelsea no longer spend with the gay abandon of yore, many of the players they have spent big sums on have raised more questions than answers. Questions like “Danny Drinkwater?!?”, “What is Tiémoué Bakayoko for?” and “What the dickens have they done to Álvaro Morata?” Such conundrums render the self-pity of a manager a little hollow, not least when he has signed off on the loan of 26 players, many of whom couldn’t conceivably do a worse job than some of those still at the club Conte will almost certainly leave next summer if not before.

FIVER LETTERS “Surely the Leeds United committee of misguided middle management [Wednesday’s Fiver] who signed off on that new crest should have suspected something was wrong when the model used for it refused to show his face, and was even covering up the crest on his own jersey. Or were they just concerned at the cost of the intricate needle-work involved if the crest on the shirt of the man in their new crest required a smaller man wearing an even smaller crest, which in turn featured a tiny man, and so on … like when someone connects their camcorder to the telly and points it at the screen” – Declan Keane. “This newfangled Uefa Nations League [Wednesday’s Fiver] raises two vital questions in my mind.

You may recognise this opener as the start of a famous puzzle - whose origins date back to the 1940s - about three logicians who close their eyes and randomly take out a hat from the box and put it on. With their eyes open they must deduce the colour they are wearing based on the hats they can see on the others. Today’s puzzle is a new version with a witty twist: one of the logicians is colourblind! A box contains two red hats and three green hats. Azalea, Barnaby and Caleb close their eyes, take a hat from the box and put it on. When they open their eyes they can see each other’s hats but not their own. They do not know which hats are left in the box. We can assume that all the protagonists are perfect logicians who tell the truth. They know all the information in the above paragraph. In addition, one of them is colourblind. They all know who the colourblind person is. Azalea says: “I don’t know the colour of my hat.” Barnaby says: “I don’t know the colour of my hat.” Caleb says: “I don’t know the colour of my hat.” Azalea says: “I don’t know the colour of my hat.” Who is the colourblind person, and what colour is their hat? The puzzle was designed by the American puzzle enthusiast Jack Lance, and he thought it up because one of his friends on a puzzle forum is colourblind. I’ll post the solution at 5pm today. UPDATE: The solution can now be read here. Meanwhile, NO SPOILERS! Please talk about hats, or suggest other interesting variations of the classic puzzle.

Why is that so unusual?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"I remember my first medical school interview. It was February. It was freezing. It was my first time in London and I was a starry-eyed 17-year-old. I saw hordes of teenagers with pristinely ironed suits, slicked-back hair and polished black shoes who spoke with immaculate cut-glass English accents. I immediately felt out of place. Private school, with its emphasis on public speaking and smart appearance, prepares you for medical interviews. The ability to critically appraise, reason and logically construct an argument are soft skills that tend to be more developed in privately educated pupils. This means that more pupils from better schools, or with parents who have cultural and social capital, disproportionately get offered a place at medical school – despite the efforts of universities to level the playing field through various access schemes. Coming from a poor performing secondary school in an inner city area with 8% of pupils going into further education (the lowest rate in the country at the time), I was a far cry from the public schoolboy caricatures I encountered that day. The enormity of the class gap became more apparent during medical school. In my class of eight, I was the only one with any semblance of a regional accent. People came from only a few miles from my house but were a million miles from me socially. Whereas my classmates would often go back to their parents’ country house in the summer and take a skiing trip in the winter, I’d go back to my four siblings in a two-bedroomed terraced house in post-industrial Sheffield. The sheer gulf in worldly experience meant that we had very little in common. Last month, a hashtag gained some traction on Twitter. This time, it was doctors who were using #mypathtomedicine to show that not all of us have had the conventional well-to-do middle class upbringing typically associated with the profession. The sort of privileged upbringing that moulds the kind of well-spoken, privately educated, pinstriped-suit-wearing doctor we often come across. The hashtag soon garnered almost 2m impressions and many comments and retweets. There are some pertinent points to be made in all of this. That doctors come from a wide variety of socio-economic backgrounds, including some of the most disadvantaged like myself, should not come as a surprise to anyone. Indeed, it is medicine that is conventionally seen as an aspirational profession in many black and minority ethnic communities – and often a safe, albeit long and hard, way out of relative poverty. This was certainly an important factor in me becoming a doctor: I wanted to leave my surroundings and never return to a life of struggle. However, 70 years after the inception of the NHS, we still have to prove that access to medicine is a meritocracy – and that there are many of us who have “made it”. We still have to shout about overcoming our relative social handicap. Medicine, like any other public and emergency service, should have a wide-ranging demographic profile and be equally representative of all social classes in the UK. But it is not. The profession still has an air of privilege about it. A report published by the government’s social mobility commission last summer revealed that 61% of doctors came from a privately educated background. The same cannot be said of any other public service. No one can change their upbringing, but local authorities (LAs) can certainly do more to ensure that state school applicants to medicine are given all the support they need. Preparatory courses for interviews, entrance exams and life at medical school would not go amiss. LAs need to ensure that future doctors from poor-performing state schools are given classes in the life skills as well as the advanced communication skills that can help them achieve their full potential – and become the best possible doctors. At a time when the NHS is haemorrhaging doctors, staff morale is at an all-time low and the doctor-to-patient ratio is at its lowest in NHS history, it is time for medicine to appeal to a wider audience and demonstrate that not all doctors are pale, male and stale. • Dr Asif Munaf is a year 2 core medical trainee who works in Nottingham If you would like to contribute to our Blood, sweat and tears series about experiences in healthcare, read our guidelines and get in touch by emailing sarah.johnson@theguardian.com.

Few outside his inner circle expected him to get out of the first week. Nobody predicted he would even get out of the first round. But he came from a set down to beat the 2017 US Open finalist Kevin Anderson in just under four hours, then dispatched the often dangerous Denis Istomin (who put Novak Djokovic out at the same stage a year ago), expended more energy accounting for Nikoloz Basilashvili in five sets than he maybe should have, and again in four to defeat Andreas Seppi, before reaching the semi-finals with a quite splendid four-set win against the world No 3, Grigor Dimitrov. There he faced Marin Cilic. It was a challenge of a totally different kind, against a seasoned and gifted player who already has a major to his name and who in his own quarter-final had made the most of Rafael Nadal’s late-match hip injury, when he remained more focused than he sometimes has in the past in big matches. Eight years ago, when Cilic was as much a fledgling prospect as 23‑year‑old Edmund is now, he had respected observers reaching for superlatives as he roared through the card to the semi-finals for the first time. There he met an adversary who had already garnered the approval of his peers and the media, Andy Murray, who beat him in four sets. No doubt the wear and tear on body and mind took its toll in that four‑set match. Like Edmund, Cilic had been made to struggle in early matches, taking five sets to get the better of a then-motivated young Bernard Tomic, four sets to get past Stan Wawrinka, before the Swiss had properly come to realise how good he was, another five sets to beat the reigning US Open champion, Juan Martín del Potro, in the fourth round, before tuning up for Murray with five sets against the ever‑obdurate Andy Roddick. By the time he faced Scotland’s finest in the semi-final there was precious little left in the tank and Murray put him away in just over three hours, 3-6, 6-4, 6-4, 6-2. Many of the rallies in that match were long and painful; on Thursday evening, they were short and, for Edmund, similarly tough on his weary body – as Cilic remarked immediately afterwards. “I noticed in the third game of the third set when I broke him, he let a couple of balls go,” he said. “I was seeing he was a bit restricted and I tried to move him around. “He’s playing great tennis. But he played a couple of tough five-setters and a four-setter here, and definitely it left some scars on his body. But he has a bright future and we will see him around a lot.” Those were generous words from one of the Tour’s friendlier players. He might not have the profile or the charisma of those who dominate the headlines but Cilic has, to a large extent, delivered on the praise heaped on him in Melbourne in 2010 by the late Bud Collins, who reckoned he had the potential to be one of the game’s outstanding champions. It has not quite worked out like that but the Croatian has the power to destroy any opponent on his day. He did not rise to where he is in the rankings by accident. On Monday, regardless of the weekend’s results, he will sit at No 3, just behind Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer – not bad company to be keeping. For Edmund, this tournament has provided such a rush of encouragement that the disappointment will pass soon enough. He has been a realist all his short career and has by his side, in Fredrik Rosengren, one of the most astute and empathetic coaches in the sport. Fidde, as he is known, said before this match that Edmund’s strengths are not restricted to his powerful right arm and imposing serve – neither of which clicked properly against Cilic – but in his willingness to learn, which takes humility. “The most important thing he shows me is that he listens,” Rosengren said. “The worst thing for a coach is if you tell someone to prepare, and you stay in the corner and he says yes, but doesn’t do it. You want to see the changes.” Those changes have been manifest in every game, not so much in dramatic differences of style, but in the growing accumulation of knowledge and self-belief. Edmund has always thought deeply about his game but often has relied on his muscular ground strokes to dominate. He has likely learned more in six matches here about when to pull the trigger than in the previous couple of seasons. Rosengren, who spent most of the match in the player’s box, standing as if his feet were on fire, is a passionate counterpoint to his quiet and respectful charge. It has the potential to be a long and fruitful partnership – which is increasingly rare in tennis. After the finest of Edmund’s five wins – against Dimitrov in the quarter-finals – the grey-haired coach remarked: “I am the happiest guy because I am thinking about the future, not only this match. So my book when I am sitting there, is only for the future, not for this match.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"film/2018/jan/26/sexual-harassment-film-industry-producers-guild-of-america","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-26T06:00:38Z","webTitle":"Guidelines are a start, but sexual harassment in the film industry is not going away soon","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jan/26/sexual-harassment-film-industry-producers-guild-of-america","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/jan/26/sexual-harassment-film-industry-producers-guild-of-america","fields":{"headline":"Guidelines are a start, but sexual harassment in the film industry is not going away soon","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The #MeToo and #TimesUp movements have enabled women to speak up about sexual harassment and abuse, so it’s cheering to see the Producers Guild of America taking the situation seriously by publishing new guidelines to combat sexual harassment on film sets. Post-Harvey Weinstein, action, as opposed to just words, is needed in the industry. It’s a good sign that Wonder Woman 2, the sequel to the female-helmed blockbuster, has already signed up to the guidelines, and hopefully this will encourage other forthcoming productions to do the same. But, while it’s a step in the right direction, it may not effect much radical change. First, membership of the PGA is voluntary, so film producers can opt out of joining or leave the organisation if they aren’t keen on adhering to the new standards. Second, the guidelines are not legally constraining, so the 7,500 members of the PGA are bound only by “best practice” suggestions: their membership would not necessarily be threatened if they did not integrate them into their productions. Sexual harassment may be considered discrimination, in legal terms, but without a legal requirement to put the PGA guidelines into practice, it is possible that many producers may not bother. Even with new guidelines, there may be no effect on set. When I worked in the film industry, I recall many posters on the walls of production offices highlighting rules about sexual harassment and saying it should be reported. These were routinely ignored. An example of this, and I’m sure other crew members have similar stories, occurred one day after filming had ended. I entered the office I worked in to find porn playing on the TV. To loud sound effects, there was a closeup of a woman’s anus being penetrated. I felt so humiliated and upset all I could do was walk out. A few minutes later, a young guy who was also a runner came to find me. He apologised profusely for what I had witnessed, but he was too scared to say anything in front of our all-male superiors for fear of losing his job. On another occasion, when I asked if I could report sexual harassment after a crew member grabbed my buttocks, I was told: “You’d probably win some money in court, but you’ll never work in the industry again.” Working in that sexist, sexually charged environment every day, it was obvious that if you challenged this type of behaviour someone else would be hired to replace you. Careers in the industry are precarious and often based on nepotism and an old-boys network. People are so fearful of recrimination for challenging sexual harassment, it’s unsurprising that they stay silent. I’m hopeful that the PGA’s guidelines change things. The suggestion that every production should have at least two individuals of different genders to whom cast and crew can talk if they’ve been subject to or witnessed harassment, is great. Knowing there were trusted people I could have approached to make a complaint would have made all the difference to me when I worked in the industry. If this becomes the rule, it could have a big impact, helping victims and improving the work environment. It’s arguable that sexual harassment has been able to thrive in the film industry due to a huge gender imbalance. It’s overwhelmingly dominated by men, and sexism is rife. It’s also worth noting that the majority of film crews in the US and UK are white, and, similarly, racism often goes unchallenged. This really is the crux of the issue and the PGA addresses this by saying: “[An] inclusive workplace helps protect against all forms of discrimination. We will see even more progress once boardrooms and corporations – as well as production offices and sets – are balanced with gender and racially diverse leaders who will hire inclusive teams as a matter of standard practice.” If the industry becomes more inclusive, then hopefully there won’t be a need for many more #MeToo experiences in the future. The PGA guidelines may not create an immediate end to sexual harassment, but they are a positive step in the right direction for enabling this change to happen."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"society/2018/jan/25/tracey-crouch-john-humphrys-bbc-today-carrie-gracie","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-25T17:54:11Z","webTitle":"Tory minister declines John Humphrys interview over pay comments","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jan/25/tracey-crouch-john-humphrys-bbc-today-carrie-gracie","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/jan/25/tracey-crouch-john-humphrys-bbc-today-carrie-gracie","fields":{"headline":"Tory minister declines John Humphrys interview over pay comments","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A Conservative minister refused to be interviewed on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme after John Humphrys made light of a colleague’s fight for equal pay, it can be revealed. The Guardian understands that the stand taken by Tracey Crouch has been followed by a number of other female MPs, who are using informal parliamentary networks to encourage a potential boycott. They are angry that the flagship radio show’s presenter has failed to apologise for a leaked conversation with the BBC’s North American editor, Jon Sopel. In the recording, Humphrys joked about Carrie Gracie’s warnings over the gender pay gap at the BBC, telling his male colleague: “Oh dear God. She’s actually suggested that you should lose money – you know that don’t you?” Crouch, who would not comment when contacted by the Guardian, told friends that a similar conversation between two male ministers would have resulted in demands for an apology or the prospect of losing their job. It is understood that Crouch, a minister in the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, turned down a bid from the Today programme as part of a wider media round on her new role tackling loneliness. Her decision led the editor of the programme to raise the issue with Downing Street, which blamed logistics, according to insiders. Another female politician who was asked to appear on Today told producers that she would consider the bid but wanted to express her annoyance about Humphrys’ comments. “When they told me it would be him interviewing me, I just laughed,” said the MP, who refused to go on. She then shared her story with colleagues who decided to follow suit. One guest who appeared on Today claimed a figure at the radio programme said it was struggling to attract senior women. Sources at the BBC rejected the claim, pointing to recent interviews with the international development secretary, Penny Mordaunt, and Labour’s Yvette Cooper and Rosena Allin-Khan. They also said that while they could not comment on individual staff matters the management at the BBC were “deeply unimpressed” by the recording. However, a number of MPs offered Crouch their backing. Stella Creasy said politicians wanted to “show solidarity” with the women in the BBC, because of Humphrys and the general response to Gracie’s decision to resign. Creasy, who was furious that the BBC blocked journalists who had tweeted their support for Gracie from presenting on-air segments about the pay row, was one of 72 MPs writing to the culture secretary, Matthew Hancock, to warn of a “chilling effect”. “We remain concerned about how the BBC is handling equal pay and handling staff speaking out so decided to show solidarity to get them to take it seriously,” she said. “It’s the responsibility of every staff member to take these issues seriously and it doesn’t appear at the moment that John Humphrys is on the same page.” The Tory former cabinet minister Nicky Morgan said Crouch’s decision would make her “think twice” about being interviewed by Humphrys. Instead of apologising, Humphrys defended the “jocular exchange”, insisting that he was “totally in support of equal pay for equal work”. He insisted that a female producer thought it was funny, and admitted he was “mildly” annoyed it had been leaked. The presenter, who was initially revealed to be earning between £600,000 and £649,000, has offered to take three voluntary pay cuts amid the controversy over pay. His salary will now drop to between £250,000 and £300,000. But Labour’s Alison McGovern and Jess Phillips stressed that his comments in what he thought was a private conversation were a concern. “You spend your life in politics as a woman paranoid that the men don’t want you to be there, and when you hear the comments ... it dawns on you that perhaps some of them actually don’t,” said McGovern. Phillips said: “I think Tracey is right. He should be made to explain himself. His attitude speaks exactly of the kind of stuff we are up against, and that is the idea that we are nagging. The tone is sexist – and that’s what we have to put up with.” She admitted that if the Today programme asked her on to speak about certain subjects she would ask for an alternative presenter. “It is not because I can’t stand up to him,” Phillips said. “I just don’t want to get into a row about gender-based violence, rowing belittles the issue.” Regarding the leaked recording, Phillips called for a “bit of mea culpa from an organisation I love”. Crouch has clashed with the veteran broadcaster before when he asked the sports minister about a “very low-cut” new Manchester United kit for the women’s team. She hit back: “Manchester United have got a new strip for their women supporters, not for their footballers, because unfortunately Manchester United do not have a women’s football team ... ” A spokeswoman for the culture department admitted that Crouch had not managed to fit in the Today programme in the media round, but said: “Tracey Crouch spoke to a number of broadcasters, including the BBC, on her role leading the government’s new loneliness strategy.” A BBC statement described Humphrys’ comments as “ill-advised” and said he regretted them. It added: “The BBC is committed to getting its pay structures right and, as we have said, we are conducting a comprehensive analysis of presenter pay.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2018/jan/25/customers-urged-not-to-switch-supply-after-future-energy-collapse","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-25T12:11:07Z","webTitle":"Customers urged not to switch supply after Future Energy collapse","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/jan/25/customers-urged-not-to-switch-supply-after-future-energy-collapse","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2018/jan/25/customers-urged-not-to-switch-supply-after-future-energy-collapse","fields":{"headline":"Customers urged not to switch supply after Future Energy collapse","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The 10,000 customers of Future Energy are being urged not to switch their energy company after the small supplier went bust, amid fears that other players may collapse as energy prices rise. The closure of Future Energy follows warnings by the boss of Co-Op Energy that volatility in wholesale prices could cause more suppliers to cease trading. The Co-Op took on 160,000 customers from another supplier, GB Energy, when it went bust in late 2016. The cost of such “last resort” measures is spread across all energy consumers, regardless of their supplier, with the Co-Op successfully claiming £14m in compensation. The energy regulator Ofgem and consumer groups said the 10,000 customers of Future Energy, which focused mostly on households in the north-east and Yorkshire, would continue to be supplied with electricity and gas. Customers were advised to take a meter reading, not switch supplier and wait to be contacted by a new supplier who would take over. “If you are a customer of Future Energy there is no need to worry as we will make sure your energy supplies are secure and your credit balance is protected,” said Rob Salter-Church, a senior partner at Ofgem. Despite the dominance of the big six energy companies, which hold about 80% of the market, the number of suppliers has exploded in recent years. There are now about 60 suppliers, but the financial health of some of the new entrants has been questioned and Ofgem is considering whether to impose financial stress tests before awarding new firms a supply licence. Earlier this month, Brighter World Energy, a small supplier pledging to help communities in Africa and believed to have several hundred customers, also closed its doors. The customers were switched to public energy firm Robin Hood Energy, which is run by Nottingham city council. Future Energy’s site offered no apology to customers, simply saying it had ceased to trade. Ofgem confirmed it is in the process of choosing a new supplier for the 10,000 households affected and it is likely to be announced early next week."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/jan/25/david-adjaye-black-history-museum-wins-design-of-the-year-nmaahc","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-25T22:25:29Z","webTitle":"'Already iconic': David Adjaye's black history museum wins design of the year","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jan/25/david-adjaye-black-history-museum-wins-design-of-the-year-nmaahc","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/jan/25/david-adjaye-black-history-museum-wins-design-of-the-year-nmaahc","fields":{"headline":"'Already iconic': David Adjaye's black history museum wins design of the year","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Standing proudly on the Mall in Washington DC, looking like a shimmering bronze pagoda, the National Museum of African American History and Culture has been named design of the year 2017. It is only the second time in the award’s 10-year history that a building has taken the title, following on from Zaha Hadid’s 2014 win for the Heydar Aliev centre in Azerbaijan – a decision that sparked protest over allegations of forced evictions and human rights abuses. This year’s winner – the work of four practices though often credited to Britain’s Sir David Adjaye, as he was the creative force behind its genesis – stands as a gleaming temple of abuses of a different kind. The museum’s emotionally charged basement charts the horrific treatment suffered by African Americans over the centuries, with leg irons, whipping posts and slave auction blocks graphically spotlit, as visitors are taken through the history of the struggle for racial equality, rising to the sunnier upper levels of funk, soul, hip-hop and contemporary art. Arguably the most celebrated black architect in the world, British-Ghanaian Adjaye was knighted last year and listed in Time magazine’s list of 100 most influential people. For the DC building he brought his trademark approach of drawing on African motifs, with a form inspired by the headpieces of Yoruba sculpture from west Africa, and the filigree metal cladding referring to the decorative ironwork found on houses in Charleston and New Orleans, made by slave craftsmen. While it is impossible to fit the story of an entire people into a 29,000 sq metre building, the $540m complex does well. The NMAAHC won for more than just its design, though. As David Rowan, chair of the judging panel at London’s Design Museum, puts it: “Not only is this a striking and already iconic structure at the heart of America’s capital, it’s the realisation of an entire century of planning, rejection, political opposition and finally collaborative execution.” The building is in fact the product of a 100-year campaign for a “National Negro Memorial”. Continually blocked by Congress, the final form of the project makes a bold addition to America’s front lawn, joining a long line of white stone monuments that mainly celebrate the achievements of white men, and were frequently built using black labour. The four firms behind the museum are headed by architects of predominantly African American heritage, a rarity in what is a white-dominated profession. Phil Freelon was the lead architect, with project leader Zena Howard responsible for the interior from the ground floor up. The practice of the late J Max Bond, a pioneer among black architects, handled the interiors below ground, while SmithGroup masterminded the envelope and foundations. The museum is a striking sight, changing its character as you move around it, shimmering like a golden crown in some lights, glowering as a menacing brown ziggurat in others. Although defiantly “other”, it makes conscious nods to its context: the angle of the three tiers is the same as the tip of the neighbouring Washington Monument, while arrow-slit windows are sliced into its facade to line up with other key memorials. It generally holds together but, as you navigate the sprawling interior, it sometimes feels like a case of too many cooks. The gaps where the respective contracts don’t quite meet are tangible, from the cumbersome steel structure holding up the facade, to the expanses of grey plasterboard walls and suspended ceiling tiles. Meanwhile, the impact of specially framed vistas to nearby monuments is lessened by clunky fixings. Is it the best thing designed in 2017? Probably not. The inclusion of architecture in the Beazley designs of the year is questionable in the first place, given that the judges don’t actually visit the buildings on the shortlist, but make their decision based on photographs and models. By contrast, entries in the other categories – fashion, graphics, transport, digital – can mostly be experienced at full scale. Other winners include a new process of “rapid liquid printing” from the MIT lab, a super-fast form of 3D printing designed for large-scale products; and the Scewo stair-climbing wheelchair, which topped the transport category. The product award went to an ink made from air pollution, the graphics section celebrated an issue of the New York Times magazine, and the fashion prize went to the Nike Pro hijab, “designed to change the face of sport for Muslim women”, even though Muslim women have been wearing hijabs to do sports for years.

With the Queen Elizabeth Hall currently closed for renovation, the celebration took place in the Festival Hall, and the Sinfonietta itself, a core of 18 players, was boosted to symphonic size for half the programme by alumni from the London Sinfonietta Academy. Three conductors were involved too. David Atherton, who co-founded the orchestra with Nicholas Snowman, and conducted that very first programme of Tavener and Stravinsky in 1968, took charge of the first half of this concert with The Message, a feisty introductory flourish for clarinet and trumpet by another Sinfonietta veteran Harrison Birtwistle, followed by two 20th-century classics, Stravinsky’s Octet and Ligeti’s Chamber Concerto, which the Sinfonietta introduced to Britain in 1970. The performance of the Stravinsky was gorgeously detailed and characterful but some of Ligeti’s dazzling textural conceits did go astray in the expanse of the RFH. Yet the Chamber Concerto’s intricate clockworks did make a revealing link with the piece by the one-time Ligeti pupil Hans Abrahamsen that received its London premiere in the second half of the concert. The CBSO gave the first British performance of Left, Alone, Abrahamsen’s concerto for piano left hand, in 2016; with George Benjamin conducting, the soloist here was Tamara Stefanovich, fearlessly attacking a solo part that ranges right across the keyboard as it threads its way through the buzzing, chirping mass of orchestral textures. The whole of the second half of the concert was made up of premieres, though only the Abrahamsen was truly memorable. Perhaps packing a meaningful cross-section of half a century’s music-making into a single concert was always going to be a challenge, but neither of the pieces specially commissioned for the occasion, Deborah Pritchard’s River Above, for solo saxophone (delivered with wonderful suppleness by Simon Haram) and Samantha Fernando’s ensemble piece Formations, lived up to its billing. Neither did the final composite celebration, Encore!, a series of variations on a Purcell hornpipe, with major contributions from 14 composers, and a finale involving 10 more; John Woolrich had artfully stitched the whole thing together, while Vladimir Jurowski attempted to give it coherence from the podium. • Available to hear on BBC iPlayer until 25 February"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/blog/2018/jan/25/chelsea-antonio-conte-carabao-cup-arsenal-arsene-wenger","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-25T10:10:55Z","webTitle":"Chelsea are drifting and the Conte era looks to be in its end game","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/jan/25/chelsea-antonio-conte-carabao-cup-arsenal-arsene-wenger","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2018/jan/25/chelsea-antonio-conte-carabao-cup-arsenal-arsene-wenger","fields":{"headline":"Chelsea are drifting and the Conte era looks to be in its end game","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Antonio Conte’s reign at Chelsea, or at least the meaningful part of it, began with a half-time switch to a back three at the Emirates, and it feels a lot like it has ended with the same. The Champions League could yet save a drifting season – memories of that win away against Atlético have not entirely faded – but it was the feel of Wednesday night that was so damning. When, after all, was the last time anybody was out-tacticked by Arsène Wenger? It was at half-time in the 3-0 defeat away to Arsenal last season that Conte switched to the back three that would lead to a run of 13 successive league wins and ultimately the title. On Wednesday Arsenal had been largely outplayed in the first half but dropping Mohamed Elneny deeper to become a third centre-back helped clog the pastures in which Eden Hazard had been frolicking. Chelsea, bafflingly, had no solution. Arsenal were lucky with both goals they scored but while they were little more than dogged, there is at least a sense of new life breathing through the club once again. They have been there before of course, three times a season or so over the past decade without anything really coming of it but the relief that the Alexis Sánchez saga is finally over is almost palpable. Wenger has been so rejuvenated he is not merely changing formation mid-game but has taken to devising funky corner routines. A new padded coat and a reckless haircut could come at any moment. But a League Cup here or a League Cup there will not significantly alter the Wenger legacy, however nice it may be for him to complete the set of domestic English trophies. The far bigger issue is Chelsea. Crisis is a word devalued by overuse in modern football and rarely means more than the thing we are talking about this week but then many basic aspects of football have seen their values change over time: winning, for instance, and trophies. The difficulty in which Chelsea find themselves is a very modern one. Before Wednesday’s defeat they were unbeaten in 12 games. They have lost only two of their past 21. They are still in Europe and the FA Cup and they are third in the Premier League. At almost any previous point in football history, that would represent an extremely promising season but not now, not in the era of the super clubs, when most of the league is there to be trampled on and the restriction of success to a tiny elite means the slightest slip can appear catastrophic. Chelsea looked physically jaded at the Emirates. It can have come as no great surprise that what was possible last season with no European football has proved impossible to replicate with a similarly sized squad (in that sense, at least, José Mourinho is right to claim some credit for Conte’s success). Conte has warned of the thinness of his squad since last summer, culminating in his comment this week that Chelsea can no longer compete financially with the Manchester clubs. Few will have much sympathy given it was Chelsea, with the accession of Roman Abramovich in 2003, who dragged English football into its new financial age and so torpedoed Arsenal’s vision of a golden supremacy rooted on the riches of a new stadium (modern English football, in that sense, began with Wayne Bridge’s 87th-minute winner at Highbury in the Champions League quarter-final in 2004). But the result of their policy of retrenchment, at least until somebody remembered how well Edin Dzeko had played against them this season, was a recruitment strategy apparently based on a decade-old list predicting English Stars of the Future: Danny Drinkwater, Ross Barkley, Andy Carroll, Peter Crouch … Chelsea 2018, the team England’s Euro 2012 squad could have been. There was a time when a major part of football management was working out ways to reinvigorate talent that had not quite developed or had gone off the boil. That was a significant part of the genius of Brian Clough and Bob Paisley. It may even be the case that football would be a better place if that was still a relevant skill but it feels a curiously quaint approach at the top end of the modern game. And that contributes to the other troubling aspect of Chelsea’s performance on Wednesday: their mental weariness. Yes, the hamstring injury sustained by Willian in the first half hampered them. Yes, their options were reduced by injuries to Cesc Fàbregas and Álvaro Morata, and by Pedro’s slump in form. But still, it was startling how becalmed they were once the initial plan of giving the ball to Hazard stopped working. Perhaps the arrivals of Dzeko and Emerson Palmieri will jolt them back into life but the performance against Arsenal was that of a team who had already begun a long slow drift to the end of the season and the inevitable departure of their manager."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"music/2018/jan/26/why-pop-stars-get-in-bed-with-the-fifty-shades-franchise","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-26T12:59:40Z","webTitle":"Why pop stars want to get in bed with the Fifty Shades franchise","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jan/26/why-pop-stars-get-in-bed-with-the-fifty-shades-franchise","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/jan/26/why-pop-stars-get-in-bed-with-the-fifty-shades-franchise","fields":{"headline":"Why pop stars get in bed with the Fifty Shades franchise","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"EL James has a lot to answer for. Since her mega-selling Fifty Shades erotic novel series started in 2011, James has given the world a seedy fascination with low-level bondage that has since become an empire, even inspiring a raft of parodies (Fifty Shames of Earl Grey by, erm, “Fanny Merkin”), and more thinkpieces than you could crack a whip at. And, via its two (and soon to be three) hugely successful soundtracks (arriving in tandem with the blockbuster film adaptations), it has also become the default franchise for artists looking to “go adult” and add a sense of risk to their brand. While 2015’s Fifty Shades of Grey soundtrack sold 2.2m copies worldwide (and was one of the Top 10 albums of 2015), its career boost for artists such as the Weeknd and Ellie Goulding proved there was real power behind its presence. For the Weeknd, his brand of sexually explicit tunes had yet to be fully embraced by the mainstream, but found their perfect match in Fifty Shades’ soft BDSM (with Earned It). Goulding, meanwhile, scored her first real solo worldwide hit with Love Me Like You Do, from the soundtrack. Both were nominated for Grammys that following year, and both peaked at No 3 on the Billboard Hot 100. “I think the team that assembled the soundtrack for the first Fifty Shades of Grey film treaded carefully with their picks, assembling an assortment of artists both on the cusp of mainstream and already planted firmly in it,” says Steven J Horowitz, senior editor at Billboard. “After Fifty Shades of Grey proved it could launch careers even further into the stratosphere, Fifty Shades Darker became the soundtrack that artists should be on if they wanted to expand their audience.” Both Taylor Swift and Zayn jumped onboard for the 2017 soundtrack with the sultry I Don’t Wanna Live Forever, new sonic territory for Swift especially. That song arguably laid the foundations for last year’s Reputation album. The Fifty Shades Freed soundtrack arrives just in time for Valentine’s Day, with newer acts such as Hailee Steinfeld hoping to benefit from its repositioning Midas touch with songs that reflect the brand’s M&amp;S approach to S&amp;M. Even Jamie Dornan, perhaps with an eye on Ryan Gosling’s actor-turned-singer crown, tries his hand at crooning with Maybe I’m Amazed. Perhaps Fifty Shades’s biggest benefactor, however, is Rita Ora who, having cameoed in both films (she reprises her role as Mia Grey in Freed), has been given the album’s lead single in the shape of For You featuring Liam Payne. With Ora’s only US hit a cameo on Iggy Azalea’s Black Widow, this could be the single that takes her, if not to the Weeknd’s level, then somewhere approaching shampoo enthusiast Ellie Goulding’s."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"technology/askjack/2018/jan/25/what-can-i-do-to-protect-my-pc-from-meltdown-spectre-flaws","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-25T12:09:47Z","webTitle":"What can I do to protect my PC from the Meltdown and Spectre flaws?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2018/jan/25/what-can-i-do-to-protect-my-pc-from-meltdown-spectre-flaws","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/askjack/2018/jan/25/what-can-i-do-to-protect-my-pc-from-meltdown-spectre-flaws","fields":{"headline":"What can I do to protect my PC from the Meltdown and Spectre flaws?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"My Microsoft Surface Book is protected against the Meltdown and Spectre security flaws, but my Sony Vaio Pro remains vulnerable to Spectre. Both laptops run Windows 10 and have been updated via Windows Update. The Surface Book’s BIOS has also been updated by Microsoft, but there is no BIOS update for the Vaio – and, I suspect, for millions of other machines. What is the risk of continuing to run the Vaio with this known critical vulnerability? Is there another way to mitigate it? Or, in the end, do thousands of people have to dump otherwise good machines and buy new ones? John Piatt It’s too soon to say. Bear in mind that, so far, there are no known exploits for these vulnerabilities, so the current level of risk is low. Companies will try to defend against threats as and when they appear. In the short term, we’ll just have to see how well that goes. In the long run, millions of PCs and other devices will have to be replaced. That would be true even if the Spectre and Meltdown vulnerabilities had not been discovered. The difference is that some may have to be replaced sooner rather than later. Intel says it has “issued firmware updates for 90 percent of Intel CPUs introduced in the past five years, but we have more work to do”. We don’t know if it will go further back than that, but the biggest threat is to old PCs that probably aren’t worth very much. Over time, I expect the strategy will develop roughly as follows: First, update your operating systems, browsers and other vulnerable software to defend against potential threats. Second, if necessary, update your PC’s firmware (BIOS or UEFI etc). There is no desperate hurry. In fact, this week Intel told suppliers to “stop deployment of current versions [of fixes], as they may introduce higher than expected reboots and other unpredictable system behavior”. Third, replace the processor, if you can. In many cases, this could also mean replacing the motherboard. Whether it’s worth it depends on the residual value of the machine. Fourth, the solution of last resort: replace the device. By the time we get to that stage, the software options should be clearer. You might still get away with using older versions of Windows if you’re careful when browsing using one tab per process (see below), and only downloading trusted code. If not, it may be possible to make some PCs secure enough by installing Linux (which you can run on the fly from a DVD or USB thumbdrive) or ChromeOS or CloudReady or whatever. Otherwise, people will still be able to use insecure devices offline or on local networks. For example, you could use your Vaio Pro 13 for word processing, accounts, and playing videos, music and games, among other things. Even today, you don’t have to do everything online. What’s the problem? The Meltdown and Spectre vulnerabilities arise from the way most modern processors work, using speculative “out of order” execution of instructions. As such, they affect some but not all processors from Intel, AMD, ARM, IBM and others. Intel seems to be worst affected, and it has published a list of vulnerable chips online. The vulnerabilities enable attackers to steal information from memory that is being used by other programs, or by the operating system, but not to launch malware attacks. A typical scenario could involve code from one web page collecting information, such as passwords, from another browser tab. Other attacks may be developed later. There are actually three vulnerabilities. The first, “bounds check bypass” (CVE-2017-5753), requires a firmware update or for any vulnerable programs to be recompiled. The second, “branch target injection” (CVE-2017-5715) AKA Spectre, can be fixed via a firmware update. However, it can be mitigated by software changes, and Google has proposed a novel mitigation called Retpoline. The third, “rogue data cache load” (CVE-2017-5754) AKA Meltdown, can be mitigated by patching the operating system. The Google Security Blog has a good description of the flaws. It says the second variant, Spectre, “is difficult to use, but has great potential power as it crosses arbitrary protection domains”. You should be able to use your Sony Vaio until Spectre-based attacks appear, and by that time, there may be better software mitigations to reduce the risk. Are you vulnerable? If you are not sure if your PC is vulnerable, you can run software to check. You used GRC’s InSpectre, which seems to work well. Ashampoo offers an alternative Spectre Meltdown CPU Checker, which is also for Microsoft Windows. Note that Microsoft did not patch some PCs because they were running anti-virus software that makes “unsupported calls into Windows kernel memory”, which can cause blue-screen crashes. If your PC has not been protected, try updating your anti-virus software. If that doesn’t work, turn off your third-party AV software and turn on Windows Defender until your PC is patched. In general, older processors appear to be more vulnerable than recent ones, and they are more likely to suffer a performance hit. In my case, with a new PC running Windows 10 on an Intel Core i5-8400, fixes appeared quickly and before-and-after benchmarks show no loss of performance. There are web pages that will tell you if popular smartphones are vulnerable or will receive updates, such as riCompro’s Smartphone Security Check. (This is not a tester.) Apple is updating Macs, iPhones, iPads and Apple TVs so make sure you install the latest patches. Browser risks You’re most likely to be attacked via your web browser, and browser suppliers are already updating their software. It’s now particularly important to keep your browsers up to date. You can reduce the risk by using “site isolation” in the Chrome browser. As Google explains: “Site Isolation offers a second line of defense to make such attacks less likely to succeed. It ensures that pages from different websites are always put into different processes, each running in a sandbox that limits what the process is allowed to do.” To enable it, type (or paste) chrome://flags/#enable-site-per-process into the address bar and click Enable. This should work in other Chromium-based browsers such as Opera and Vivaldi. If Chrome is already eating all your PC’s resources, site isolation will make things worse. You will probably have to manage with fewer tabs. A partial solution is to isolate only a few risky sites, but this involves starting Chrome from a command line (--isolate-origins=https://risky1.com, https://risky2.com etc). Spectre exploits also require very precise timing, so Mozilla has temporarily reduced the precision of Firefox’s timers to make attacks harder. Restricted access to high-precision timers is one of the mitigations that helps to protect Android smartphones, though users should check for other fixes as they appear. Life goes on... Initial reports of Meltdown and Spectre made them sound apocalyptic, but the bugs were secretly disclosed to suppliers in June, and patching is now well under way. Today, it looks as though careful users of reasonably recent PCs don’t have too much to worry about… pending the appearance of some devastating Spectre malware. If all your software and firmware is patched, if you only download trusted code, and you avoid clicking malware links in emails etc, then you should be able to continue as normal. If your PC has been orphaned by its manufacturer, or is more than five years old, keep an eye open for Spectre exploits that can’t be mitigated by other software. You should anticipate replacing these machines with fast, new PCs, but you should have been doing that anyway. Have you got a question?

A bid of £57m will trigger the defender’s release clause and ping him on his way. Bilbao are so certain he’ll depart that they have already drawn up a shortlist of potential defensive replacements, with Arsenal’s free-scoring Nacho Monreal among them. City’s move for Laporte comes after they apparently gave up on the overly-expensive Jonny Evans, which is inconvenient because West Bromwich Albion have just identified his replacement in the shape of the 29-year-old Zamalek and Egypt centre-back Ali Gabr, whom they can loan for an impressively precise fee of £438,000 and then buy in the summer for an additional £1.1m. Still, they could convince Arsenal to buy Evans instead, which could give them enough money to not only buy Gabr but also a shiny new striker, with Watford’s Troy Deeney and Newcastle’s Aleksandar Mitrovic the names in the frame. Their need for attacking reinforcements could become desperate should Salomón Rondón also head for the Hawthorns exit, with Liverpool and Everton both considering a bid for the £15m-rated Venezuelan. On the subject of release clauses and potential Manchester City purchases, as we were not all that long ago, Jean Michaël Seri of Nice has one set at £35m and it could be triggered any minute now, though Manchester United are also keen to bring the midfielder to England. Should United, winners of the Mancunian rivals’ last transfer tussle, come second in this chase they might move instead for Real Madrid’s Mateo Kovacic. Monaco will have to pay £2.6m – double their original offer – for the pleasure of Islam Slimani’s company for the remainder of the season, according to the Mail. The striker would apparently prefer to remain in England, but no team here is prepared to meet his £20m asking price. Newcastle could be tempted, but at the moment they’re a bit busy buying Feyenoord’s Nicolai Jørgensen, for “in the region of £16m”, instead. The next stop on Lazar Markovic’s footballing odyssey could be in Russia, with Lokomotiv Moskow having decided that they and the Liverpool winger should share more than just initials: a loan deal for the 23-year-old is apparently on the cards. Daniel Sturridge is still expected to head to Italy, with Internazionale coming for him just as soon as they complete a deal for Paris St-Germain’s Javier Pastore (Pastore, for language fans out there, is Italian for shepherd). Chelsea’s Baba Rahman will meanwhile spend the rest of the campaign at Schalke, having turned down Inter and Everton in favour of a return to Germany. Middlesbrough want to sign the Bradford striker Charlie Wyke, author of 12 goals in 24 league starts this season, who is valued at £5m – a frustratingly large sum for Boro given that Wyke was born in Middlesbrough, joined their academy at the age of seven, was their player for 15 years and was released for nothing three years ago. And Brighton’s £6m bid for Aden Flint has been rejected by Bristol City. Finally, the Sun has done a hard-hitting expose of the cars driven by the players of Yeovil, Manchester United’s FA Cup opponents, revealing that the entire team’s motors – which include a VW Polo worth £4,450, a creaky Alfa Romeo worth £2,000 and a £5,900 Seat Ibiza – have a combined value of less than Alexis Sánchez’s £150,000 Bentley Continental."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"music/2018/jan/25/rapper-nelly-accused-of-sexual-assault-by-two-further-women","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-25T14:40:18Z","webTitle":"Rapper Nelly accused of sexual assault by two further women","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jan/25/rapper-nelly-accused-of-sexual-assault-by-two-further-women","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/jan/25/rapper-nelly-accused-of-sexual-assault-by-two-further-women","fields":{"headline":"Rapper Nelly accused of sexual assault by two further women","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The US rapper Nelly has been accused of two further sexual assaults, amid a lawsuit against him following an alleged attack on his tour bus last year, which he denies. The alleged tour bus assault was reported by college student Monique Greene in Auburn, Washington, in October 2017, and Nelly was later arrested. The criminal case against him collapsed after Greene declined to co-operate with the investigation, but she later decided to file a lawsuit against him after Nelly accused her of fabricating the story. In a new filing from Greene’s legal team, two further women – both under the condition of anonymity – have accused Nelly of sexual assault. One of the alleged incidents took place in Southend-on-Sea, Essex, after Nelly played a concert at the Cliffs Pavilion in December 2017. The woman claims he masturbated in front of her and forced her to perform oral sex. The other complainant is an American woman who claimed Nelly assaulted her at an afterparty following a concert at London’s Koko – she alleges he groped her despite her fending off his advances. The lawsuit suggests the attacks show a “pattern of conduct” where Nelly “preyed upon his selected female fans”. Nelly has yet to respond to the new accusations, following requests to his representatives from the Guardian. But he has denied the initial assault, describing it as “false and defaming” and stating: “I am completely innocent.” After the collapse of the criminal case, his lawyer Scott Rosenblum said the subsequent lawsuit was “motivated by greed”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"books/2018/feb/02/strange-order-of-things-antonio-damasio-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-02T09:00:25Z","webTitle":"The Strange Order of Things by Antonio Damasio review – why feelings are the unstoppable force\r\n","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/feb/02/strange-order-of-things-antonio-damasio-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/feb/02/strange-order-of-things-antonio-damasio-review","fields":{"headline":"The Strange Order of Things by Antonio Damasio review – why feelings are the unstoppable force\r\n","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Nietzsche would have given four cheers for this intricately argued book, which is at once scientifically rigorous and humanely accommodating, and, so far as this reviewer can judge, revolutionary. Antonio Damasio, a professor of neuroscience, psychology and philosophy, sets out to investigate “why and how we emote, feel, use feelings to construct our selves … and how brains interact with the body to support such functions”. We are not floating seraphim, he reminds us, but bodies that think – and all the better for it. From Plato onwards, western philosophy has favoured mind over “mere” body, so that by the time we get to Descartes, the human has become hardly more than a brain stuck atop a stick, like a child’s hobbyhorse. This is the conception of humanness that Damasio wishes to dismantle. For him, as for Nietzsche, what the body feels is every bit as significant as what the mind thinks, and further, both functions are inextricably intertwined. Indeed, from the very start, among the earliest primitive life forms, affect – “the world of emotions and feelings” – was the force that drove unstoppably towards the flowering of human consciousness and the creation of cultures, Damasio insists. The idea on which he bases his book is, he tells us, simple: “Feelings have not been given the credit they deserve as motives, monitors, and negotiators of human cultural endeavours.” In claiming simplicity, it is possible the author is being a mite disingenuous. The tone in which he sets out his argument is so carefully judged, so stylistically calm and scientifically collected, that most readers will be lulled into nodding agreement. Yet a moment’s thought will tell us that we conduct our lives largely in contradiction of his premise, and for the most part deal with each other, and even with ourselves, as if we were pure spirit accidentally and inconveniently shackled to half a hundredweight or so of forked flesh. “Feelings, and more generally affect of any sort and strength,” Damasio writes, “are the unrecognised presences at the cultural conference table.” According to him, the conference began among the bacteria, which – who? – even in their “unminded existence … assume what can only be called a sort of ‘moral attitude’”. In support of his claim, he adduces the various ways in which bacteria behave that bear a striking resemblance to human social organisation. The implication is, then, that “the human unconscious literally goes back to early life-forms, deeper and further than Freud or Jung ever dreamed of”. Damasio’s argument is that we are directly descended not only from the apes, but from the earliest wrigglers at the bottom of the primordial rock pool. The keyword throughout the book is homeostasis, of which he offers a number of definitions, the clearest of which is the earliest, and which he favours enough to set it in italics: homeostasis is the force – the word seems justified – that ensures that “life is regulated within a range that is not just compatible with survival but also conducive to flourishing, to a projection of life into the future of an organism or a species”. Damasio, whose books include The Feeling of What Happens and Self Comes to Mind, is a scientist but also a convinced, one might say a crusading, humanist. He wants us to recognise the richness of life in all its aspects, good or bad; but he is no sentimentalist. The human condition is one of struggle and assertion and the will to prevail: “Life comes equipped with a precise mandate: resist and project life into the future, no matter what.” Here again the shadow, or the radiance, of Nietzsche’s thinking falls across the page. Also called to the table is Spinoza – on whom Damasio has written at length – and his emphasis on conatus, the essential force by which all things strive to persevere, and which had for Spinoza the same significance that homeostasis has for Damasio. There are echoes here too of William James, that most endearing of philosophers, as when Damasio pauses for a brief, Jamesian consideration of the anomalous fact that for all the hi-tech sophistication of modern life, we still cling to the primitive pleasure and reassurance of the domestic fireplace. And James would have been delighted by Damasio’s “everydayness”, his readiness to acknowledge the fundamental underpinnings of even our highest endeavours, for instance when he remarks in wonderment: “It is intriguing to think that the enteric nervous system” – that is, the gut – “might well have been the very first brain.” But Damasio, while ever ready to salute his predecessors and peers, is wholly his own man, and The Strange Order of Things is a fresh and daring effort to identify the true spring and source of human being – of the being, in fact, of all living things – namely feeling. As he beautifully puts it, “The sick patient, the abandoned lover, the wounded warrior, and the troubadour in love were able to feel.” The truth of this is simple and profound; how else may we be said to live, except by feeling?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2018/jan/30/time-to-end-the-auditing-merry-go-round","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-30T18:54:22Z","webTitle":"Time to end the auditing merry-go-round","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2018/jan/30/time-to-end-the-auditing-merry-go-round","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2018/jan/30/time-to-end-the-auditing-merry-go-round","fields":{"headline":"Time to end the auditing merry-go-round","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"How did BT react when “improper practices” and “financial irregularities” were discovered in its Italian division last year? It did what you’d expect: it dumped its auditor, PwC, and hired a new outfit. But that new firm was KPMG, which was remarkable in its own way. KPMG was already under investigation by the Financial Reporting Council for its work at Rolls-Royce following a bribery scandal at the engine maker. Now, of course, KPMG’s auditing of Carillion is also under the microscope. While it is possible that KPMG may be found blameless in both instances (just as PwC could be at BT, another on the FRC’s long list of investigations), the merry-go-round of appointments perfectly illustrates the lack of diversity at the top end of the auditing market. It’s always the same names. There are only four big internationally recognised firms – the others are Deloitte and EY – and, between them, they are auditors to 97% of FTSE 350 companies. Conservatively minded boards rarely dare to look outside the “big four” and, for practical purposes, their choice may be even more limited. Firms employed to do lucrative non-audit work are offside as a potential auditor. So it can become a pick of Firm A or Firm B. The position looks to be a cosy stitch-up, as outsiders have been saying for years, and now even Stephen Haddrill almost agrees. He is chief executive of the FRC – a body, note, that is itself often accused of being too close to the big four. Haddrill told parliament’s Carillion inquiry on Tuesday that the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) should investigate the accounting and auditing market. He’s right. The last time the competition bodies looked they came up with only modest tickles. Compulsory re-tendering of audit engagements after 10 years has made the merry-go-round whirl at greater speed, but that’s all. The dominance of the big four remains, along with the strong sense that an oligopoly breeds complacency and lack of scepticism. Break up the auditors? Make it easier, somehow, for the lower-league players to climb the ladder? Whatever the solution, the CMA needs to take Haddrill’s hint and do a proper job. An international oligopoly of four, which has existed since Arthur Andersen killed itself at Enron in 2001, is bad enough. If the next scandal proves fatal to somebody, we’d have an oligopoly of three, which would be outrageous. RBS has defended the indefensible Ross McEwan, chief executive of Royal Bank of Scotland, looks ridiculous. For roughly two years, he has resisted publication of the regulator’s so-called “skilled person’s report” into the bank’s bad treatment of small and medium-sized business customers. Now RBS has performed a stunning U-turn. The bank “no longer thinks it is useful to have an argument” with the Financial Conduct Authority, explained chairman Sir Howard Davies. The bank is prepared to see the document published, even though it disagrees with some of its findings. Why the change of heart? Presumably because RBS has looked evasive every time MPs have asked awkward questions. McEwan himself was obliged to admit on Tuesday that a claim he made in 2014 was not true. He had said the “vast majority” of businesses that entered RBS’ Global Restructuring Group had been turned around, but his definition of a turnaround included insolvency. Meanwhile, Promontory – the firm that wrote the report for FCA – has turned the screw. Its boss, Tony Boorman, painted RBS as obstructive and defensive. McEwan, in resisting publication, found himself defending the indefensible. The version of the report that appears at the end of this process will probably be heavily redacted or edited – the FCA still has to respect the legal rights of individuals named in the report. But McEwan’s previous intransigence is bizarre. He didn’t have to play hard. He made a very bad call."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/feb/02/struggle-make-lasting-relationships-desperately-want-settle-down","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-02T12:57:18Z","webTitle":"I struggle to make lasting relationships, but desperately want to settle down","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/feb/02/struggle-make-lasting-relationships-desperately-want-settle-down","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/feb/02/struggle-make-lasting-relationships-desperately-want-settle-down","fields":{"headline":"I struggle to make lasting relationships, but desperately want to settle down","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"I am 34 and have been single for four years.

As the Observer pointed out, its authors, the “prank art collective” Fat Les, “persuaded, among others, a lot of xenophobic, racist Little England football supporters to celebrate an item of Indian cuisine as a quintessential expression of Englishness”. This is despite Goa having been a former Portuguese colony and one of the few parts of India that never saw British rule. Yet the vindaloo with which most Brits are most familiar – the hottest rung on the generic korma, tikka masala, madras ladder – bears little resemblance to the aromatic, pickle-sour original. Dan Toombs, author of The Curry Guy, dubs them “eight-pint vindaloos”, after the amount of lager needed to finish one. As chef Vivek Singh observes, though vindaloo is probably one of the best- known Indian dishes, “it’s also one of the most misunderstood”. Thought to be a corruption of the Portuguese carne de vinha d’alhos, or meat cooked in wine vinegar and garlic, an authentic, tangy vindaloo tingles the tongue with pepper, clove and other spices, rather than the one-dimensional heat of chilli powder. So unless you’ve got a Goan specialist nearby, if you want to try the real thing, your best bet is to make it at home. The meat The Portuguese have long been big on pig, making vindaloo one of the few Indian curries that’s traditionally made with pork, though Lizzie Collingham notes in her fascinating historical survey, Curry: A Biography, that the British liked it better with duck – “and so do I”. Madhur Jaffrey also uses duck, noting that these “paddle freely in the thousands of flooded rice fields”, and that using poultry allows Muslims and meat-eating Hindus to enjoy it, too. Rick Stein makes his with shin of beef, “because it matches the beef in India, which can be pretty tough” (as well as relatively hard to come by, being a sacred beast to the country’s Hindu majority), while chef Cyrus Todiwala sticks with a mix of pork belly and shoulder, and Singh to pork leg, with a little of the bone left in for flavour. Collingham’s duck breast and the pork leg prove the least popular among testers – principally, I think, because of their relative leanness, which makes them prone to dryness after a lengthy bath in vinegar. Richer or better-marbled meats, such as Jaffrey’s duck leg or Stein’s shin, work a lot better, though I’m going to stay traditional and go for pork shoulder, which has enough marbling to remain juicy without the belly’s large chunks of fat, which even a sauce as tangy as this can’t quite cut through. If you must use chicken, go for thigh; lamb lovers will be well served by shoulder. Many recipes call for the meat to be marinated overnight, but the high vinegar content of the marinade makes this a risky business: the acetic acid can begin to “cook” the proteins in much the same way as citrus does in a ceviche, thereby rendering it tough. A few hours should do the job in the flavour department. The masala Whether or not you use it to marinate the meat before cooking, every curry begins with a masala, or spice mix – and in this instance chilli is not the principal ingredient. Though they all use slightly different combinations and amounts, all the recipes I try contain an array of what we might think of as sweet spices – cinnamon, cloves and cardamom – plus a hefty hit of black pepper, and the earthy, nutty flavours of cumin, coriander and turmeric. Chilli powder is generally added for colour, rather than heat, with Jaffrey recommending “bright red paprika” and Stein and Todiwala specifying Kashmiri chilli powder, sold under that name by Indian brands and remarkable for its brick-like hue. According to one Goan of my acquaintance, vindaloo is defined by its “beautiful, deep-red masala”, so be liberal with the mild chilli for maximum authenticity. Jaffrey and Collingham also use mustard seeds, which win points both for their pleasing texture and the little pops of bitter warmth they release. The vinegar Though the Portuguese would have originally used wine vinegar (or, some speculate, simply wine that had soured on the long voyage over), the dish was quickly adapted to the local palm vinegar, made from coconut toddy. Collingham notes that if you can get hold of it, “it will add a particularly Goan flavour” to the dish. I manage to source some coconut vinegar, probably made from coconut water, in an Indian grocers (many Oriental stockists may carry a Filipino brand), but as I’m reliably informed, “it’s really hard to find the legit stuff outside the state of Goa, let alone abroad”, I wouldn’t worry too much about hunting a bottle down. Singh uses a mixture of white and malt vinegar, and Stein white-wine vinegar, but the best substitute I find is Jaffrey’s cider vinegar, which has similar sweet notes to the coconut variety. Todiwala, Stein and Collingham also add tamarind liquid, which is fruitier and less sharp than vinegar, and gives the dish a more rounded, less mouth-puckeringly acidic sour quality. I’m with Stein when he says that ready-made tamarind liquids seem to lack the punch of freshly soaked stuff; it’s not hard to prepare, after all. The vegetables Todiwala describes the dish as “a sort of meaty pickle, rich and intense in flavour”, which may explain the extraordinary number of onions in his recipe – but, in fact, their sweetness works brilliantly with the tangy vinegar and rich, slightly fatty meat. Much as I dislike chopping the things, it’s worthwhile labour here, especially if you can find the sweeter Indian pink onion; otherwise, yellow ones will work fine. Liberal amounts of garlic and ginger add to the chutney-like effect: rather than crushing them to a paste, however, slice them into thin rounds and strips as Singh suggests, so they don’t get lost in the whole. Not everyone uses tomatoes, though their sweet and sour flavour seems a perfect fit, and they add a welcome touch of freshness, as do the green chillies most recipes stick in. If you like your curries hot, then feel free to mince them, but I prefer to add them whole, for a milder effect – remember to warn fellow diners about them, unless a younger sibling is coming round for dinner, in which case tell them they’re green peppers. Jaffrey, Collingham and Todiwala’s recipes all call for curry leaves, a highly aromatic herb that’s particularly popular in south India. They’re hard to come by here if you don’t have an Indian specialist nearby, though you may find them in larger supermarkets – if you do, snap them up, because they freeze pretty well, and will lend your dish a bright herbaceous flavour. Finishing touches Todiwala is of the belief that a vindaloo should be “sweet from the palm sugar, sour from the vinegar, and hot” – so don’t be shy to temper the sourness with a good spoonful of jaggery or soft brown sugar if you can’t find any. Season to taste and serve with something plain: basmati, pillowy flatbreads or, Jaffrey’s favourite, boiled potatoes and bitter greens. Lager strictly optional. The perfect vindaloo Prep 15-20 min Cook 2 hrs Serves 4-6 75ml cider vinegar 700g pork shoulder, cut into 3cm chunks 4 tbsp ghee, neutral or coconut oil 500g onions, finely sliced (about 4 medium onions) 60g tamarind pulp 10 garlic cloves, finely sliced 5cm thick length of ginger, cut into slim matchsticks 4 ripe tomatoes, diced 2-4 small green chillies 10 curry leaves (optional) 1 tbsp jaggery or soft brown sugar 1 tsp salt 1 tsp black mustard seeds For the masala 2 tbsp Kashmiri chilli powder or paprika Seeds of 8 cardamom pods 1 tsp black peppercorns 8 cloves 1 tsp cumin seeds ½ tsp coriander seeds ½ tsp turmeric 5cm cinnamon stick Grind together all the ingredients for the masala, then stir in the vinegar. Rub into the pork and leave to sit for three to four hours. Heat the oil in a wide, lidded pan over a medium-low flame, and fry the onions until soft and golden. Meanwhile, soak the tamarind pulp in 120ml of hot water for 15 minutes, then gently rub any remaining pulp from the seeds and strain off the liquid, discarding the solids. Stir the garlic and ginger into the onions and cook, stirring, for another five minutes, then add the tomatoes, chillies and curry leaves, if using, and cook until the tomatoes start to break down. Add the pork and marinade to the pan and turn the heat up to medium high. Stir well, add the jaggery, salt and mustard seeds, followed by the tamarind liquid. Bring to a simmer, cover tightly, turn the heat right down and cook gently for an hour. Partially remove the lid and cook for another 30 minutes, until the meat is very tender and the sauce has thickened. • Vindaloo, vindaloo: why does this Goan curry have such an iconic place in British culture, and where did the classic curry house version come from if not Goa?

As did the scent that filled the flat with a kind of “husky wellbeing”, even though I felt far from it. You have to marvel at the transformation of baked potatoes, and with so little effort: from cool hardness to edible, a chewy jacket and soft insides. Every time baked potatoes are cut open with a puff of steam, a discussion takes place in our house: that of olive oil versus butter, as if we were defending our own garden. My partner Vincenzo is for olive oil, the deep-green elixir that we buy from a Sicilian friend called Pina in tin cans the size of a toddler, our biggest expense and kitchen fuel. I am not saying he is wrong. I am right, though, in believing that, when it comes to a baked potato, a slice of butter mashed into the already buttery flesh is best. Salt and pepper on top. I can measure my life in baked potatoes and still eat them in exactly the way I did as a child, the ritualistic mashing and scooping motion, the extra butter slid into the empty skin, the final pinch to close it, like a taco. Recovering appetites are cautious and specific, and the following day it is potatoes again: patate al latte e burro, a northern-Italian dish in which three dependable ingredients work some magic together in a sort of stove-top dauphinoise. There is something tender about the whole process here: the purity of colour, the nurturing associations, the way the milk is assimilated by the other ingredients like a kid gulping a glassful (although I was never that kid). Milk rounds the edges of whatever it is cooking, be that rice, pasta, fish or potatoes, leaving just enough creamy sauce to feel like a luxury. Always on the lookout for similarities, I appreciate the way both English and Italian recipes pair nutmeg with such dishes, its simultaneously spiced and fresh flavour cutting through the lactic sensibleness like a naughty joke. The porcini are my addition. The recipe: soak 20g dried porcini in 150ml warm water for 20 minutes, then drain, saving the liquid. Peel 800g potatoes – ideally more waxy than floury, not too large and evenly sized – then slice into 5mm-thick rounds. Peel and cut two sweet white onions or a bunch of spring onions. In a deep frying pan over a medium flame, warm three tablespoons of olive oil, add the onion and a tiny pinch of salt, stir and cook for a few minutes. Cover the onion with a layer of potatoes, then the porcini, then another layer of potatoes. Sprinkle with salt, black pepper and nutmeg, then cover with whole milk and some of the porcini soaking liquid and bring to a steady simmer for 15 minutes. Dot with 40g butter in nuggets, then lower the heat and cook until the potatoes are tender and bathed in a creamy sauce; keep an eye because, towards the end, that sauce evaporates with disconcerting speed. Scatter with chopped parsley, and not just for colour: its bright, grassy flavour is welcome, too. Let the pan sit for a few minutes before serving with a crisp salad or smoked fish, grilled bacon or a fried egg, or both: a combination that proves – to steal a line from food writer Niki Segnit – you don’t need to be an oligarch to eat like a king."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"film/2018/feb/02/sleepcinemahotel-apichatpong-weerasethakul-film-sleep-dream","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-02T11:30:49Z","webTitle":"Ghosts in the machine: a night at the 'hotel' where films become dreams","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/feb/02/sleepcinemahotel-apichatpong-weerasethakul-film-sleep-dream","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/feb/02/sleepcinemahotel-apichatpong-weerasethakul-film-sleep-dream","fields":{"headline":"Ghosts in the machine: a night at the 'hotel' where films become dreams","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"It’s late at night. I’m not sure exactly when, because my phone has been off for hours and I’ve long since lost track of time. From my perch, I can see a giant circular screen which seems to be floating in midair like a mesmerising moon. Dreamy images flit across its surface and cast a faint glow into the darkness, which is permeated with sounds of breaking waves and gently creaking wood. I could be on a ship, sailing across the sea. Or, perhaps, back in my mother’s womb, viewing the outside world via a mysterious portal. Where I actually am is in a large hall inside the Beurs-World Trade Center in Rotterdam. For this year’s Rotterdam film festival, the space has been converted into the Sleepcinemahotel, an installation-cum-guest house conceived by Thai film-maker and multimedia artist Apichatpong Weerasethakul. In films such as Tropical Malady, Syndromes and a Century and Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives (which won the Palme d’Or at the 2010 Cannes film festival), Weerasethakul blurs the distinction between sleep and wakefulness, reality and dream. This tendency culminates in his most recent feature, Cemetery of Splendour, whose characters, stricken by a sleeping sickness, roam a dreamed reality that provides respite from the oppression of their waking present. The sedate rhythms and transporting images lend themselves quite naturally to nodding off. Contrary to what one might expect, though, this is not something he discourages. Weerasethakul has extolled the synergy between sleeping and film-watching in numerous interviews, arguing that it is a means of entering into a deeper conversation with the images on the screen; he even organised a giant film-watching sleepover at Tate Modern in 2016. Guests at the Sleepcinemahotel are invited to test out his theory. The hotel consists of a scaffolding construction with seven platforms at different heights, each with a bed and a night stand. Netting is wrapped around the rooms’ cubic frames and canvas curtains can be pulled down to act as walls. Within view of the beds, a large round screen hangs from the ceiling at the end of the hall. On to it is projected a 120-hour stream of documentary clips from the archives of the EYE Film Institute in Amsterdam and the Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision in Hilversum. The images are accompanied by a soothing soundtrack of waves and ships’ creaking. Featuring recurring motifs – water, boats, nature, animals and people sleeping – the strikingly beautiful footage provides glimpses of life from across the last century. A regatta gives way to a young girl sleeping in bed as her dog keeps watch; a family of ducklings jump off a log into a stream; flowers bloom in closeup. Each clip lasts only a few seconds. Without a story to follow, a time frame to abide by, or even the need to stay awake, the hotel’s guests are offered a 20-hour window between check-in and check-out to immerse themselves in the pure pleasure of uninhibited contemplation. And what happened? As tiredness set in, I found my mind began to travel freely, propelled in myriad directions by images that were no longer even consciously registered. I departed on one reverie after the other, regularly dozing off and then coming back again. It made for the gentlest of hallucinatory trips and when I eventually fell asleep for the last time, I slept like a log.

Bob Kerslake, who ran the civil service from 2012 to 2015 and is now a crossbench peer, warned that Steve Baker’s comments would damage the morale of officials already operating in challenging circumstances. “Civil servants are serving the government of the day and they need the support of that government,” he told the Guardian, warning that the minister’s comments were part of a “wider narrative from Brexiters” to paint senior government officials such as Olly Robbins and Jeremy Heywood as secret remainers. Dave Penman, the general secretary of the FDA union representing senior civil servants, asked how Baker could retain Theresa May’s confidence after the comments. “His remarks today not only insult the dedicated professionals working in his department and across the civil service, but they epitomise the current state of affairs in government,” he said. The revelations led to fiercely opposing views in the Tory party, from soft Brexit advocates who demanded publication to Brexiters who criticised the civil servants who produced the cross-government analysis led by the Cabinet Office. One minister, Dr Phillip Lee, tweeted that Brexit must be evidence led. He said that if the “figures turn out to be anywhere near right, there would be a serious question over whether a government could legitimately lead a country along a path that the evidence and rational consideration indicate would be damaging”. Baker made the comments to MPs after being summoned to explain a leaked analysis drawn up by government officials that suggests Britain would be worse off after Brexit under a wide range of potential scenarios. As well as claiming that economic forecasts by officials were “always wrong”, he said the work was incomplete and that its publication during EU negotiations would damage the national interest. But now Labour will attempt to force the government to publish the full version of the study by using the same ancient procedure that forced David Davis to release information about the potential impact of Brexit on different sectors of the economy. Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, said: “Ministers cannot keep sidelining parliament to hide the deep divisions within their own party.” The party could win a vote on the issue on Wednesday after 47 MPs – including the Conservatives Ken Clarke, Anna Soubry and Antoinette Sandbach – signed a letter demanding the “secret study” be released. Responding to an urgent question from Starmer about the controversy, Baker said that “significant further work” was required before the analysis would be complete. In fact, he questioned the worth of such forecasts, slamming the use of Treasury forecasts during the referendum as “Project Fear” and saying the public deserved a House of Commons that displayed a “healthy scepticism about economic forecasting”. Asked by the Tory MP and leave campaigner William Wragg if he could name a single civil service forecast “leaked or otherwise” that had been proved accurate, the minister responded: “No, I’m not able to name an accurate forecast, and I think they are always wrong and wrong for good reasons. My longstanding views on the flaws in the epistemology of the social sciences and consequences for econometrics are long set out.” Baker also responded to another Brexiter colleague, Peter Bone, who said people had still voted to leave the EU despite dire warnings. “I look forward to the day when we continue to prove economists wrong when they make horror story predictions,” he said. Asked if long-term forecasts were as useful as horoscopes, Baker replied that the question reminded him of the “great economist Galbraith who said, if I recall correctly, that the only purpose of economic forecasting was to make astrology look respectable.” The minister argued that the most recent leaked papers, obtained by BuzzFeed, were a preliminary attempt by the government to improve on the flawed analysis produced during the referendum, to test ideas, and to design a framework for future predictions. “At this early stage it only considers off-the-shelf trade arrangements. We have been clear that is not what we are seeking in the negotiations,” he said, stressing that the officials had not looked into the government’s desired outcome of the “most ambitious relationship possible”. He said the civil service analysis “does not yet take account of the opportunities of leaving the EU”. However, Baker did defend officials when faced by claims from his Conservative colleague Philip Davies, that the study had been drawn up by “London-centric remoaners” in the civil service who were “regurgitating dodgy figures” in a bid to reverse the referendum result. “I am very proud of the officials with whom I work, but it is the intention of our current analysis to improve what came before and we recognise there were flaws,” said Baker – who highlighted Bank of England forecasts from August 2016 that said exports, business investment, housing investment and employment would slump, when in fact the opposite had happened. Lord Kerslake said that everyone accepted that forecasting was difficult and “only as good as the assumptions you make” but argued that Baker had attacked officials with his comments. “If you comment on a leaked report then you are duty bound to publish it and let others scrutinise it,” added the peer. Asked about the FDA’s concerns the prime minister’s spokesman sought to stress the value of civil service efforts. “Broadly speaking, ministers commission work from the civil service and then rightly evaluate it. This was draft work, that had only started to be presented, and there had been questions raised and suggestions made. That’s the essence of what political oversight is,” the spokesman said. Such forecasts were “made with all the evidence available at the time”, he added. It came as George Bridges, a Conservative peer and former Brexit minister, launched a scathing attack on the government for failing to decide which Brexit model to go for. He said the country needed to know the answer to “simple questions” about the future relationship and “keeping every option open is no longer an option”. Without a decision, he said he feared the implementation period was “a gangplank into thin air” and the final deal would be full of “meaningless waffle”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2018/feb/06/georgia-trekking-caucasus-walking-tusheti-horse-riding-russia","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-06T06:30:15Z","webTitle":"Georgian splendour: trekking in the Caucasus","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/feb/06/georgia-trekking-caucasus-walking-tusheti-horse-riding-russia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2018/feb/06/georgia-trekking-caucasus-walking-tusheti-horse-riding-russia","fields":{"headline":"Georgian splendour: trekking in the Caucasus","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Hardly anyone makes it here. That’s because, after leaving the Tblisi road, it’s a lengthy drive on an unmade single track that twists so sharply and rises so quickly that 68km takes five hours. But if you can stomach the journey, the Tusheti region of Georgia, up in its remotest corner bordering the Russian regions of Chechnya and Dagestan, is worth it. It’s a pristine paradise of pine-covered mountains, deep valleys and mysterious towers. For our few days there, time stood still. When we were planning the trip, a guide told us: your money is no use here and in a way she was right. There are no shops. No hotels. No tarmac roads. No mains electricity. No taxis, and no bars. Just a few villages linked by footpaths and horse tracks. One other snag, or advantage, depending on your point of view: winter comes early and it makes the road impassable between October and May. So for eight months of the year, only about 20 people stay in these mountains. Then in the short summer, over 2,500 Tush return to raise sheep, make cheese, ride horses, and, increasingly, host tourists. We walked for two days and rode horses on the third, from one tiny village to the next, through forests of Colchis pine, steep slopes of blue scabious, salvia and dog rose. Some tracks are marked, others not so much – though a visitor centre in the biggest village, Omalo, provides maps. It was August and I’d joined three female friends from three countries for this trip. We were picked up from the capital, Tbilisi, in a four-wheel drive Toyota by the informative Roman, who had arranged the route, full-board in immaculate village guesthouses, and a guide, Lasha. The four of us walk together every year and had never had a guide before, but we didn’t regret it – and not just because Roman and Lasha were so helpful. There are still wolves and bears in Tusheti. They were unlikely to bother us, but they do menace the vast flocks of sheep brought up from the plains in May. The sheepdogs don’t distinguish between packs of wolves and groups of walkers. By lunchtime of our first day, Lasha had adopted a couple from Heidelberg who had been terrorised by three growling beasts. Lasha armed himself with stones and we felt safer. On our first evening, we stayed in the village of Diklo, and walked to within a kilometre of Dagestan. As we paused by a monument, a border guard appeared, and politely asked us to write our names and nationalities in a notebook. Russian soldiers were just a few metres away, and nobody wants an unintentional border incursion to spark anything. The 2008 Russo-Georgian war left 850 dead. Dogs and armed men notwithstanding, Tusheti is a peaceful place. There were hot showers and phone chargers and a basic menu of homemade bread, cheese and whatever else comes up from the valleys. We ate well: raw cucumbers, boiled eggs, spicy aubergine casserole, khinkali dumplings, lukewarm beer and herbal tea. The hiking was sweaty work on hot August days but we were never more than an hour from a fresh mountain spring, or an isolated shepherd’s hut. The high point of our visit was when we took plucky little local horses on a four-hour trek from Upper Omalo to Oreti lake, a magical green pool at just over 3,000 metres. From there we gazed out towards Chechnya. There was no sign of human habitation at all, just peaks. The only sound was the excited calls of bee-eaters, and the clink of our mounts grazing. We felt on top of the world, utterly alone. Later we paddled in the lake and were just wondering whether Lasha would be mortified if we stripped off to our underwear to swim, when half a dozen young Czechs turned up with their ponies and their guide. And bikinis. Lasha scarcely blinked. The spell of splendid isolation was broken. Tusheti will be closed for the winter now. Almost all of the villagers head back down to their homes in the plains where they live and work. Last year, a group of cross-country skiers apparently made their way there midwinter but otherwise, Tusheti is off limits until the snow melts in the spring. We’d love to go back, there are some villages we didn’t reach. And everyone said the flowers in June are the most beautiful in Georgia. • Tushetiland Travel offers a three-day Tusheti trekking tour from $185-$270pp, including transfers from Tblisi, all meals, guides and accommodation, and a six day-tour from $395-$535 Browse The Guardian’s selection of horse riding holidays on the Guardian Holidays website"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/feb/17/alys-fowler-edible-pot-marigold-calendula","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-17T11:00:55Z","webTitle":"How to grow marigolds | Alys Fowler","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/feb/17/alys-fowler-edible-pot-marigold-calendula","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/feb/17/alys-fowler-edible-pot-marigold-calendula","fields":{"headline":"How to grow marigolds","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"On one of those winter days when the sky bleeds into the ground, a lone pot marigold – wilted by past snow, but not yet dead – took one last shot at life and decided to flower on my allotment. Calendula officinalis is so easy to please that you merely have to scatter seeds on a little bare earth. Once established in your garden, the flowers will appear year after year. Then, when they are the last thing you are thinking about on a grey winter’s day, those searing orange blooms will take your breath away with their everyday, ordinary kind of beauty. The scientific name, Calendula, hints at this February blooming, deriving from the word calendar and referring to the year-round flowering. The common name, pot marigold, comes from the tradition of putting flowers or petals into soup. The very young leaves are also edible and are rich in vitamins and minerals. Tea made from the petals is an effective mouthwash for sore throats. The flowers have long been used as a dye, mostly for cheese, but they work equally well with cauliflower. In the event that you want radioactive cauliflower cheese, put the petals in the sauce or, for a slightly more lurid effect, into the pot when you parboil the veg. Apparently, you can also use the flowers to make fair hair more golden, although my experience with cauliflower cheese suggests neon orange may be the result. They are also an excellent salve for the skin. Calendula ointment is easy to make: choose your fat (olive, almond or avocado oil are good), pick lots of petals, then cover them in oil, so there is at least an inch over them. They will expand as they take up the oil. Shake well, leave somewhere warm (but out of direct sunlight) for four to six weeks, then strain out the petals. Use for everything from dry lips to cracked hands. Of course, marigolds also make very good cut flowers. It is too early to sow seeds now – for that, you will have to wait till the end of March. But you can get ordering. ‘Flashback Mix’ comes in every hue of orange imaginable, with darker undersides, so when it closes at the end of the day you get a “flash back”. ‘Neon’ is semi-double, with burgundy buds that open into bright orange. ‘Indian Prince’ is deep orange, with crimson backs and a crimson centre – very handsome. ‘Art Shades’ comes in tasteful pastel hues and ‘Radio’ is neon orange, with fluted petals. C. officinalis is particularly good for attracting pollinators, but double varieties will have less nectar, so make sure you scatter some straight species into your mix."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/31/cafe-blighty-protesters-community-colonialism","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-31T10:20:52Z","webTitle":"Activists stormed my Blighty cafe.

But we’re about community, not colonialism","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"On Saturday, our humble community cafe, Blighty, was targeted by protesters; you may have read about it in the news. Those who occupied the cafe claim that we are celebrating colonialism, something that I would strongly refute. I’m obviously disappointed that my business could have offended people in such a way, and equally saddened to hear that the protesters may have been subsequently harassed online. We could do with some restraint from all sides in what appears to have become a needlessly fraught debate. The students are well within their rights to disagree with the theme of our business, and I’d be happy to invite them in to discuss those issues sometime soon. Some background: I opened Blighty Cafe in 2013 and its sister charity, Blighty Arts in 2014. Together they have served the community of Finsbury Park, north London, for five years. We are not simply somewhere to pick up some avocado toast and a skinny flat white (although you’re more than welcome to) – we are a hub for creativity, entrepreneurship and, most importantly, charity. Upstairs at Blighty we have a workspace full of interesting businesses and local people. We hold yoga, life drawing and comedy events. We are more than just a “themed cafe” as has been reported. We provide offices for entrepreneurs, creatives and small businesses. All the profits raised are then given as microfinance or “good faith” loans to some of the poorest people in society who want to start their own business. We’ve helped nearly 200 women in rural India start their own business, with all loans paid forward to the next person who needs assistance. We also provide desks and services at cost to young entrepreneurs in the UK who need help getting started, with plans to extend our microfinance loans to the would-be self-employed among the UK’s homeless population. This isn’t just another trendy coffee shop. We have created a community that is rare to find in this city, and is special to Blighty and everyone who visits and works here. Our wonderful staff all live locally and are diverse in their nationalities, opinions, beliefs and customs. The protesters have suggested we are supporting colonialism, or any past wrongdoing of Winston Churchill. It’s an accusation that is both wrong and upsetting for everyone involved with Blighty. Yes, we are celebrating Britain, and we are celebrating Britain’s relationship with the world – especially with the other Commonwealth countries. But the means by which that Commonwealth came about need not be a part of that celebration. We reflect on both the good and the bad of Britain’s past. Like it or not, Britain is still strongly connected with places in which we perpetrated horrible wrongs, it would only exacerbate that if we were to turn our backs on those relationship. Our full English might be called The Winston – but that hardly makes us celebrators of colonialism. Churchill was, after all, named top when the BBC chose the 100 greatest Britons. He may not be an uncontroversial figure, I’m sure his wrongs are numerous, but we cannot erase him from our history. We take our duty as a responsible business seriously. The Winston uses meat from Godfreys, our local Highbury butcher. We source our coffee beans directly from Commonwealth countries, and have self-financed two microfinance programmes in Rwanda and India, lending money to women who need small business loans. I went to Rwanda last year with my co-worker. Two other members of the team went to India the year before. We are real people trying to do real good in the world. Yes, we are proud of our Britishness. We like Britain, its icons, its self-deprecating humour and we recognise all of its faults. That means we will not shy away from our imperfect history and will continue to work hard to ensure Blighty remains a positive source for good in the world – celebrating people, nations and humanity in all its wonderful forms. We are a multicultural, progressive modern-day Blighty – much as I hope this country can become. • Chris Evans is the founder of Blighty Cafe in London"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"society/2018/feb/05/crimes-of-attention-stalkers-killers-jihadists-longing","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-05T06:00:12Z","webTitle":"Look at me: why attention-seeking is the defining need of our times","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/feb/05/crimes-of-attention-stalkers-killers-jihadists-longing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/feb/05/crimes-of-attention-stalkers-killers-jihadists-longing","fields":{"headline":"Look at me: why attention-seeking is the defining need of our times","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"There is a famous Jewish mother joke. You’ve heard it before. Question: How many Jewish mothers does it take to change a lightbulb? Answer: “Ah no, I’ll just sit in the dark. Don’t worry about me.” It’s funny, at least the first time, because people do behave like this. “Hey, over here!” they shout. “Ignore me! Ignore me!” Everyone needs attention, like we need to eat. This is not controversial, nor is it hard to understand. But the idea must be slippery, because it will not stick. If we could keep in mind that people need attention, it would change the way we see almost everything they do, from art to crime, from romance to terrorism. And we must. Facebook alone harvests and sells the attention of 1.4 billion people every day. That’s about a fifth of the world. This alarms some people, and it is a big change. But we can’t know what to make of it until we understand what people need attention for. Attention is other people thinking about you, and if there were ever humans who didn’t need it, they are now extinct. “Attention is one of the most valuable resources in existence for social animals,” says Dr Geoff MacDonald, a psychologist at the University of Toronto with an interest in human connection. “It was literally a matter of life and death. The people who didn’t feel good around others, or didn’t feel bad when they were separated from others, wouldn’t have the motivation to do the things that are required to pass their genes down the generations.” Specifically, people have been shown to need a type of attention that psychologists call belonging. Abraham Maslow put belonging into his famous hierarchy of needs in 1943. In 1995, Roy Baumeister and Mark Leary concluded in their paper The Need to Belong that the available research did indeed show that everyone has a “strong desire to form and maintain interpersonal attachments”. In particular, they identified that belonging means getting positive attention from people who know you well. This isn’t hard to understand either. Someone who thinks well of you is more likely to cooperate with you. Or even mate with you, if you’re lucky. But their opinion only really counts if they’ve spent a lot of time with you, because that makes their idea of who you are more accurate, and only accurate approval is secure. “If you feel like you’re accepted for false reasons then that’s bound to create anxiety,” MacDonald says. People who feel they don’t belong suffer terribly, and experience health problems comparable to smoking or obesity. They are the 18% of British adults who reported always (4%) or often (14%) feeling lonely, in a study published last year by the British Red Cross and Co-op. There are more lonely people in Britain than live in London. The problem is now obvious enough for the government to appoint a so-called “minister of loneliness”, Tracey Crouch. The word loneliness is a good description of the feeling, but not its cause, which in reality has little to do with being alone. According to the report, just 22% of people who live alone feel lonely always or often, not much more than the 18% national average. Among 16-to-24-year-olds, on the other hand, the proportion is 32%. This shouldn’t be surprising. “Generally, loneliness seems to be a matter more of a lack of intimate connections than of a lack of social contact,” Baumeister and Leary wrote. Lonely people lack attention that is positive and accurate, in short. So why don’t they ask for more? Because attention can be harvested only from the minds of other people, and high-quality attention won’t come by force. “In anthropological terms, it’s a gift economy,” says Dr Amy Pollard of the Mental Health Foundation (MHF), a charity that campaigns on loneliness. “You’re creating bonds of reciprocity, which is where the belonging comes from.” This means you only have as much high-quality attention as people want to give you. And asking for more – attention-seeking – is a signal that, in your case, they don’t want to give much. This isn’t fair. Nor is it reliable. (People can misjudge you.) But the idea that lonely people don’t deserve attention comes to us instinctively, as when we see an empty restaurant with a busy one next door. Some lonely people themselves conclude that they aren’t worthy of attention, and withdraw from the world still further. Others search for a feeling of belonging, not always in the best way. Seek positive attention too openly and you get called “narcissist”. Seek attention from your family with great displays of wanting to be ignored, and they’ll put you in a Jewish mother joke. There are many ways of asking without asking, if we are prepared to notice. Why, for instance, is it taboo to suggest that people who self-harm, or have anorexia, might want attention? Is that not a source of pain worth taking seriously? One way to seek attention is to do something that gets lots of it – art, politics, crime, journalism maybe – but that seems to have another purpose. The purpose matters. Otherwise you risk the special scorn reserved for people who are “famous for being famous”. When Jamie Jewitt entered Love Island on ITV2 last July, he was depressed. A successful model based in New York, he had returned to Essex to live with his parents, then did nothing for years. His family all but forced him to join the show, aged 27, in the hope that it would shake him from his torpor. In modelling, Jewitt explains over coffee, Instagram is non-negotiable. “You wouldn’t get work,” he says, “if you didn’t get a following.” In practice, this is quite easy for a model to do: just feed the public appetite for carefully posed and manipulated “snapshots”. Over time Jewitt gathered 13,000 followers. He enjoyed their compliments and exchanged messages with some. It was almost friendship. “You tell yourself you’re getting the real thing,” he says, “but it’s so hard to tell the difference.” He found he’d switch between bursts of activity and guilty silences. “I felt like a hypocrite, like a sellout. It was a big part of why I got unhappy. You feel isolated, but you don’t know why.” When arriving on Love Island, all contestants must surrender their phones. Inside, there are no TVs, no iPads, no contact at all with the outside. “You have to talk to people,” Jewitt says. “Get to know them, make friends.” What we never saw on Love Island were the hours upon hours of intense conversation. “On mine and Camilla [Thurlow]’s dates, all we’d talk about was books,” Jewitt recalls, “and none of that made it! People don’t want to hear that crap, do they?” It’s funny that it took a reality show to make Jewitt live authentically again. “After two days I would wake up in the morning feeling so relieved,” he says. “It was unbelievable. A fresh start. The sad thing was I could have done it at any point on the outside.” Today he and Thurlow are still together, and the islanders remain close friends. Now Jewitt has 801,000 Instagram followers, and mostly promotes good causes. These posts aren’t popular. “When I post about the things I care about, I lose close to a thousand followers,” he says. So far he has lost around 20,000 since his peak after Love Island, and has come to take a strange pleasure in the process. “I wouldn’t want it any other way,” he says, “because I want the people who follow me to know who I am, and like who I am. I’m trying to depict a more real version of myself.” Social media is bewitching because there’s time to lie, not like in real life. The opportunity for positive attention is enormous, but accuracy is the price. “When you present a curated version of yourself to the world, any approval that you get is not for your full and whole self,” MacDonald says. As Jewitt found out, this corrodes your feeling of belonging. We don’t know yet whether social media makes people lonely. Even if it does, we should remember that it is also useful to keep real friendships going. But an MHF survey last month found that 30% of young Scots say social media makes them feel isolated. The 2015 Pisa schools report showed a dramatic fall across the developed world since 2012 in the number of children who would say that “I make friends easily at school”. By a small margin, those who use the internet the most were also most likely (17%) to say that they felt lonely – although we don’t know which was causing which, if either. We also don’t know how much of their time online was spent on social media. Even if offline time is good for you, it can be stressful, which might make people hide behind their screens. “I always say to my students,” MacDonald says, “‘If only in real life we had a backspace button.’ But no. Once you say something, it’s out there. You don’t get that kind of control.” Until recently, in other words, most of us were simply too socially clumsy to avoid being ourselves. For some people, usually those who had a hard time growing up, this stress can be unbearable. A fixed belief that you aren’t worth liking creates a loneliness and craving for attention that they struggle to satisfy. If desperate enough, they may even force other people to notice them, preferring to be hated than ignored. These people are unhappy, and can be dangerous. They commit crimes of attention. Broadly speaking, there are two types of stalker. “One is the intimacy-seeking stalker,” says Dr Brian Spitzberg, a leading authority on stalking behaviour at San Diego State University. “They are trying to get back to a person who has rejected them in some way.” Often these people used to be in a relationship with their victim, the end of which they cannot accept. “They are enveloped by the sense that this is the right person for them. They feel injured and rejected … but underlying that is a desire for the attention they think they deserve.” The other type he calls “public figure stalkers”, who usually do not know their victim personally, but pester them in order to achieve a goal of some kind. “There is something they want done that they perceive public figures aren’t doing,” Spitzberg says. “Some of them simply want someone in an authoritative position to pay attention to their voice.” Loneliness is common among stalkers. (One of them narrates my novel, for which this article is in part a bid for attention.) However, attention is not often considered to be their motive. What a stalker wants seems obvious: to be part of their victim’s life. Their behaviour is irrational; it only makes the victim reject them even more, but the stalker either insists that the woman (about three-quarters of the time) will change her mind, or persists in a spirit of revenge. And he does become part of the victim’s life, of course. A big part. After a firm rejection, the approach most experts recommend is to ignore the stalker. They work on the basis, as Spitzberg puts it, that “any kind of attention is still attention”. With this in mind, stalking behaviour seems half-rational in someone who is desperate for a feeling of belonging. Certainly most stalkers are not mentally ill in a way that a psychiatrist would recognise. According to Spitzberg, only 30-50% of all stalkings that become criminal cases can be traced to some kind of diagnosable disorder. Among intimacy-seeking stalkers, it’s even less. “Most intimacy-seeking stalking is something that almost anyone is capable of,” Spitzberg says, “if they meet the wrong person under the wrong circumstances.” Sadly, some people feel not just ignored by their ex, but ostracised by the whole world. For them, life with almost no attention is sheer torture. A recent workplace study in Canada found that ostracism was worse than the negative attention of being bullied. The work of Professor Kip Williams at Purdue University in Indiana shows how ostracism causes pain, and can lead to antisocial behaviour. Another Mark Leary study shows it is a key factor in school shootings. Like stalking, this is a crime that seems utterly irrational. Usually it suffices to say that the killer was angry, perhaps just insane. They are always lonely. Spree killers are fond of leaving documents that explain their feelings. Seung-Hui Cho (Virginia Tech, 2007) claimed he was bullied, which baffled those who knew him. Elliot Rodger (Isla Vista, 2014): “I felt depressed because I wanted sex yet I felt unworthy of it”. Often a grotesque spirit of belonging exists between them. Vester Flanagan (Moneta, 2015) was a fan of Cho (“That’s my boy, right there”). Matti Junahi Saari (Kauhajoki, 2008) and Pekka-Eric Auvinen (Jokela High School, 2007) swapped videos on YouTube. Auvinen quoted the manifesto of “the martyrs Dylan [Klebold] and Eric [Harris]” (Columbine, 1999), who also inspired Todd Cameron-Smith (Alberta, 1999), Adam Lanza (Sandy Hook, 2012) and everyone else. Needless to say, if they hadn’t killed anyone, we would have paid less attention to their feelings. There was a time when spree killing almost did not exist. Guns existed. So did bombs and knives and vans. So did violent and disturbed people. Indeed the world is now generally less violent than it used to be. Yet spree killings grow more frequent. A study at the Harvard School of Public Health found that mass shootings in the US in which at least four people died occurred, on average, once every 200 days between 1982 and 2011. Then once every 64 days between 2011 and 2014. Eighteen of the 30 deadliest mass shootings in the US since 1949 have occurred in the past 10 years, including all of the worst five. What else can we call these but crimes of attention, made possible by new media? Filmed on camcorders, then on phones. Seen live around the world. Stored on Wikipedia and YouTube for posterity. Where would you have found a copy of a killer’s manifesto in 1990, let alone a video? The truth is that if you want the world’s attention badly enough, you can have it tomorrow. It is easy. Before the internet, it was not. Jihadists love to leave speeches too, but theirs claim grander motives. Their killing sprees, they say, are part of a plan to reach paradise and bring about the triumph of their beliefs. Yet many of them hardly live with the piety they die for. Shehzad Tanweer, one of the London tube bombers, had a secret girlfriend. Amedy Coulibaly, who attacked the kosher supermarket in Paris, kept paedophile material on his computer. According to Demos interviews with 62 former jihadists in 2010, they “had a simpler, shallower conception of Islam than [nonviolent] radicals”. Does it seem likely that they were forced into violence by their devotion to scripture? Or is it more plausible that their violence, which obsesses the world, feeds a craving for attention that they clothe in phoney zealotry? It is hard to imagine crimes of attention disappearing, but admitting that’s what they are should help. Perhaps then we’ll stop rewarding criminal behaviour with so much of the attention that it seeks. There are other simple solutions to our attention crisis. Ideas like the Big Lunch, or the MHF’s “Tea and Talk” events may improve access to high-quality attention by helping people get to know each other better. Eventually the moment may come when we are officially urged to get a minimum dose of offline conversation every week, like exercise or our five-a-day.

Republican and security sources in Belfast confirmed on Tuesday that a 72-year-old man detained by police officers working on Operation Kenova was Freddie Scappaticci. Accused of being the IRA’s chief spycatcher, the Belfast man is accused of being a double agent who was working for the security forces while overseeing the murder of informers within the republican movement. A spokesperson for Operation Kenova said the 72-year-old was arrested at “an undisclosed location” and would be interviewed by its investigation team. Police are understood to have raided the house of Scappaticci’s estranged wife in Belfast at the same time as he was taken in elsewhere. “No further details of the place of arrest or where he is being held will be released due to security reasons.” The spokesperson refused to confirm or deny that the man in custody was Scappaticci, a veteran Belfast republican who has been living in hiding since it was alleged he worked as a British spy for 25 years. Scappaticci was outed as the British agent known as Stakeknife in 2003, following an investigation by journalists in Northern Ireland. He appeared briefly at a press conference at his solicitor’s offices, to deny the claim, and then vanished, probably into a witness protection scheme in Britain. He is said to have appeared briefly at his 98-year-old father’s funeral in west Belfast last year. People who said they saw him described him as looking fit and relaxed. Operation Kenova is seeking out alleged victims of the double agent, including members of the IRA who were questioned, tortured and interrogated by the secret unit inside the Provisionals allegedly led by Scappaticci. Led by the former counter-terrorism detective John Boutcher, the chief constable of Bedfordshire, the independent police operation has a budget of £30m. Sources in Belfast said they were told he was being questioned specifically about the murder of a loyalist in the city during the 1980s. However, they said they believed he would face further questions over his alleged role in running the IRA’s internal security unit known as the “nutting squad”, which tracked down alleged informers in the organisation’s ranks, interrogated, tortured and, in most cases, killed those accused of betrayal. The “Stakeknife” scandal is centred on the allegation that while Britain’s key spy was working covertly for the security forces he was heading a terrorist unit that committed murders. Scappaticci is allegedly being linked directly to 18 murders of IRA members accused of being informers, with his unit responsible for 30 deaths overall. A number of families of IRA members shot dead as informers have made separate complaints to Northern Ireland’s police ombudsman, claiming that Scappaticci’s handlers in the security forces failed to use their agent to prevent the murders. Many of the families claim their loved ones were “sacrificed” by the security forces to keep Scappaticci at the head of the IRA’s counterintelligence unit, from where he could provide the state with valuable information. A number of families from the loyalist side of the divide in Northern Ireland have spoken to Operation Kenova alleging that the spy played a central role in plots to kill their loved ones during the Troubles. One British Army general described “Stakeknife” as “our jewel in the crown” among agents operating inside the IRA."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}
