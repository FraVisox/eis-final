She holds them firmly against her face, obscuring its upper half and casting her mouth and chin in shadow. Instead of her eyes looking back at you, a pair of glistening dark lenses protrude from her skull like the huge eyes of an inscrutable insect. It is a disconcertingly modern alienation device. Instead of being gazed at, this woman gazes: the more you look at the frills of her black and pink clothes, the more she scrutinises you. Is it a feminist statement, a conceptualist joke? This masterpiece, drawn in 1869, is at the very least a confession of the artist’s unease with his own voyeurism. The tension it reveals – between the urge to look and the fear of being looked at – is a clue to the art of Degas, an enigma who hides himself in cold ecstasies of colour. In 1971, close to the end of his life, Picasso etched a filthy series of satirical portraits of Degas visiting a brothel, just to look. He portrays Degas as an obsessive voyeur. This was not a slander: Degas did create a series of voyeuristic studies of a Paris brothel in the 1870s and Picasso collected them. This exhibition reveals how close to the knuckle Picasso was. It culminates in a superbly sensual and entrancingly strange display of the uninhibited nudes Degas created late in his career. Sir William Burrell was not quite as singleminded a collector of Degas as Picasso – nor, sadly, did he own any of the great impressionist’s brothel scenes – but the Glasgow shipping magnate had a very good eye for the rich variety of media Degas uses and the uncanny intensity of his vision. This free exhibition sensitively mixes treasures by Degas from the Burrell Collection in Glasgow, currently closed for refurbishment, with some of the National Gallery’s choicest examples. The result is a ravishing, revealing window on Degas’s inner world. Art critics used to talk about Degas as if he was sexless. This self-proclaimed celibate, who according to his contemporary Manet was “incapable of loving a woman”, has been bowdlerised and sentimentalised so that we can think of his depictions of ballet dancers as an artistic safe space. Think again. This exhibition puts his ballet dancers next to his nudes and the comparison is unsettling. What was the difference, for Degas, in watching dance rehearsals and visiting a brothel? In both cases he was just looking, but in neither case was that voyeurism innocent. In his 1898 pastel Dancers on a Bench, he observes as performers adjust their shoes and take a rest: as one of them leans forward to hold her ankle, he coolly contemplates her cleavage. In After the Bath, a sketch in charcoal and pastel from the Burrell, he uses a fantastically chunky style to render a woman’s wet hair and naked back. The chance to directly compare the carnality with which Degas depicts women having their hair brushed, or drying themselves after a bath, and the physical energy of his dancers reveals what a complex and tantalising visionary he really is. There is nothing timid or repressed about his art, but there is something transcendent and mystical in it. Degas distills so much into the experience of looking that it becomes at once erotic and sublime, a kind of religious rapture. The bodies he draws can escape gender entirely. The National Gallery’s own After the Bath, Woman Drying Herself is based on a drawing of a male nude by Michelangelo. As she bends forward to towel her shoulder, we look at the line of her spine dividing her fleshy back. This is derived from one of Michelangelo’s most homoerotic designs – and this exhibition shows it is far from the only Degas to do so. Flanking it are two equally sculptural studies of gender-ambiguous backs from the Burrell. Woman in a Tub looks back to Michelangelo’s Crouching Boy and forward to Francis Bacon. Its nude is both male and female, athletic and frail. Huge buttocks loom out of a green bathtub that looks like a bronze dish, set against a hellish, erotic red, as if this were a wall painting from Pompeii. Degas looks and looks until he sees the essence of the human condition. What begins as voyeurism ends up seeing into the depths of what it is to be alive. Drawn in Colour: Degas from the Burrell is at the National Gallery, London, from 20 September to 7 May."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/sep/19/people-just-do-nothing-every-episode-is-more-hilarious-and-more-harrowing","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-19T10:04:45Z","webTitle":"People Just Do Nothing: every episode is more hilarious, and more harrowing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/sep/19/people-just-do-nothing-every-episode-is-more-hilarious-and-more-harrowing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/sep/19/people-just-do-nothing-every-episode-is-more-hilarious-and-more-harrowing","fields":{"headline":"People Just Do Nothing: every episode is more hilarious, and more harrowing","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Grindah’s not looking too great. Kurupt FM’s head honcho is crashing with pal Steves after his breakup from fiancee Miche, gurning and unkempt as he flits between making threatening phone calls to a rival radio station and bingeing on drugs. He stammers as he orders his friends to move Kurupt FM’s equipment into a storage unit, panicked and paranoid. “It’s good to have someone to do drugs with,” says Steves of his friend’s decline. “A lot of people get weirded out by me and leave, but he’s got nowhere to go”. Ten minutes into its latest series, and People Just Do Nothing looks more like a Channel 5 doc on the dangers of spice than a Bafta-winning mockumentary. Now on its fourth run, PJDN has long been praised for its portrayal of life in West London suburbia, a place that – as many a resident past or present will attest – often feels a million miles from the buzz of the city. And, parallel to the central plot of Beats, Grindah and co’s unstarry existence as small-time garage MCs, the show’s cast have become stars in their own right, playing festivals in the UK and abroad, with a takeover of London’s Roundhouse planned for next month. It’s perhaps surprising, then, that series four has seen the show delve ever further into sadcom territory – popularised by the likes of Master of None, Bojack Horseman and Fleabag – as it increasingly examines the difficulties its protagonists face rather than playing up their ineptitude for lols. Following a tearjerking season three finale where Steves’ nan died, we’ve seen Miche and Grindah’s breakup and subsequent, underwhelming reconciliation (“Nothing screams class like a lasagne,” declares Grindah as he tries to trick her into thinking he’s changed for good); Miche fill a void by turning her daughter Angel into a child star, morphing a school play audition into an episode of the X Factor; Steves convince himself that his nan’s spirit lives on in Beats and Roche’s baby; and Chabuddy G slide into poverty and homelessness. Chabuddy’s fall is the most tragic of all, the all-seeing mockumentary camera following the serial entrepreneur as he beavers away in the stockroom of a high street electrical shop where he is known, in a case of awkward cultural assimilation, as “Charlie” – before retiring to his van. There was always a heartbreaking edge to Chabuddy’s existence (this is a man whose mail order bride robbed him blind before fleeing with her “brother”) but we had never seen him truly lose it all, living in a Renault Trafic with a bucket for a toilet. More than ever, PJDN is a show about people chasing the dream of “making it” and instead falling flat on their faces. But it is always loving rather than condescending in showing working-class ambition and the pursuit of fame, something this series has only made clearer. As we reach the finale, there’s an ominous mood in the air – one which in previous seasons may well have already been undercut by banter or bathos. Grindah has overcome his temptation to cheat on Miche with a stripper during his bachelor party to a soundtrack of Ginuwine’s Pony, while Miche has had her heavily stage-managed hen do overruled by drunk pals. The pair ended episode five describing quite different versions of their future together (Miche: big house, more kids; Grindah: we’ll cross that bridge when we come to it), and, unsurprisingly, the final episode meshes moments of hilarity and sadness, as Grindah prioritises Kurupt’s first daytime rave over their wedding. There’s another crisis, too, for the already put-upon Steves, who has been bankrolling the station with his inheritance cash. Thankfully, even as we watch its much-loved protagonists sink to new lows, PJDN continues to soar right to the end. People Just Do Nothing is on BBC3 now."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"stage/2017/sep/18/micky-flanagan-and-another-fing-tour-o2","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-18T16:00:29Z","webTitle":"The fing about Micky Flanagan: irresistible rise of a minted everyman","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/sep/18/micky-flanagan-and-another-fing-tour-o2","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2017/sep/18/micky-flanagan-and-another-fing-tour-o2","fields":{"headline":"The fing about Micky Flanagan: irresistible rise of a minted everyman","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"I’m not sure whether to review Micky Flanagan’s comedy or weigh it. The biggest-selling comedian of 2016 is doing 12 nights at the O2 Arena. He is the country’s most popular comic and, by some measures, its most popular entertainer full stop. At one point in tonight’s show, random cheering breaks out at the back of the O2 auditorium and Flanagan jokes that Michael McIntyre or Peter Kay must have set up a rival gig in the crowd. When you can joke, from a position of strength, that the best-loved comedians of this millennium are busking to pockets of your audience – well, you’re a long way from Billingsgate fish market, where the young Micky once plied the family trade. Class identity, of course, is part of Flanagan’s gargantuan draw. Not because he’s an uncomplicatedly old-school, working-class comic, which isn’t – or hasn’t always been – the case. As his earlier shows documented, Flanagan is something of a class chameleon, an ex-window cleaner turned university graduate, an Eastender now resident in East Dulwich, as apt to be found dissecting his new-found middle class habits as peddling the traditional values with which he grew up. That’s slightly less the case with his new show An’ Another Fing, which – as its title suggests – lays on the cockney shtick pretty fick. But Flanagan on stage is always more than a cheeky-chappy caricature. Yes, there’s plenty of nostalgia here for the meat-and-potatoes verities of his youth, but it never curdles – as, in the hands of other comics, it can do – into neophobia. He jokes frequently about modernity – new men, their grooming and preening; millennials and their earnestness. But it’s poking fun, not mockery; Flanagan never implies that his generation (or class) got things any more right than the ones that followed. This good-naturedness, this absence of anxiety or meanness of spirit, is surely key to Flanagan’s wide appeal. Exhibit A: how he deals with the issue that besets any successful comic who bases their act on unpretentious Everyman appeal. “I’m fucking loaded!,” he says by way of an opener: “Shocking, it is!” I’ve seen other standups hamstrung by the difficulty of staying relatable while experiencing life-changing fame and fortune. Not so Flanagan, who defuses it with chutzpah and infectious self-irony. “For the next couple of hours, you’ve got to imagine I’m just like you” – pause for a laugh – “but with money”. He makes it easy: the personality he presents on stage – well-meaning but workshy; shoots his mouth off, but a bit of a softy – is one with which many will readily identify. There are celebrity anecdotes here but (unlike, say, in John Bishop’s recent Edinburgh shows) not the remotest sense that Flanagan has gone native among the great and good. Soon enough, we’re back with Flanagan in the family home, where his dog plots to usurp his wife from the marital bed and Micky screws up the courage to announce he’s taking a year off work. That sabbatical supplies what passes for the show’s subject, as our host disappears off the professional radar for 12 months. We’re led to expect eye-catching stories from the front line of idleness. But what we get isn’t much different from what we’re used to, as Flanagan haunts local boozers, watches too much daytime TV and goes on holiday with his ageing dad. That latter anecdote, which closes the show, is a cracker, as fiftysomething Flanagan feels irresistible again (posing by the pool, dreaming himself Poldark) in the company of fellow Saga holidaymakers. “Look at him using the stairs,” he imagines the ladies drooling: “Sexy bastard!” Back in the real world, Flanagan’s love life is altogether less dashing, as he pitches up at the newsagent to buy his wife a “forgot-to-get-a-card card” and fantasises about a morning after with Mary Berry. Research for his recent Sky show supplies failsafe material, meanwhile, on “pegging” – the new sexual frontier, apparently, for vengeful women and their nervous partners. Only occasionally does this drift into cliche or generalisation, as with the gag about women loving gift cards, or the deployment of hummus and quinoa as middle-class identifiers. More often, it feels as if Flanagan has weeded out lazy thinking, just as – with a routine decrying all those TV shows that make (poor) people look “thick” – he condemns it in others. I won’t pretend to you that this is adventurous comedy. But Flanagan is smart, generous spirited, at ease with his own ridiculousness and purveys a democratic brand of humour the vast popularity of which it’s impossible to begrudge. • On UK tour until 5 November."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"money/2017/sep/18/how-bad-is-a-credit-record-default-for-mortgage-application","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-18T10:18:59Z","webTitle":"How bad is a credit record default for a mortgage application?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/sep/18/how-bad-is-a-credit-record-default-for-mortgage-application","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2017/sep/18/how-bad-is-a-credit-record-default-for-mortgage-application","fields":{"headline":"How bad is a credit record default for a mortgage application?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Q My partner and I want to buy our first home. We started the process of looking into this last year, thinking that it would be relatively straightforward once we had our deposit saved. We both have good jobs and assumed we had no debt. I then did a check of my credit file and realised O2 had slapped a default on it for £10 owed at the end of a contract. I have disputed this endlessly but it is unwilling to remove it, as it sent a text to my phone informing me of the debt – a phone which I no longer have. Anyway, I paid the debt collection company which O2 used. The default is marked settled on 8 June this year. We are hoping to move sometime after summer next year. Do you think we have any chance of a joint mortgage with this default being so recent? I don’t want to risk tarnishing our credit files further. Do you think it would be better going for a cheaper property in only my partner’s name? EG A Yes, I do think you have a chance of getting a joint mortgage after next summer, so I don’t think it is necessary to go for a cheaper property in your partner’s sole name. You are right in thinking that defaults on a credit file, which stay on it for six years, are one of the most common reasons for mainstream high-street lenders to refuse mortgage applications as they generally prefer to lend to people with squeaky clean credit records. However, there are an increasing number of lenders which are happy to approve mortgage applicants with all sorts of defaults on their files. You are also right in thinking that the longer a default has been on your credit record the lower the impact it will have on your ability to obtain a mortgage. Lenders are most interested in your recent credit activity, so if you have a default, even if it was registered in the past couple of years, you should be able to find a mortgage. It is worth stressing that it is the date the default was registered that matters to lenders and not the date you paid it off. It is also worth noting that the type of default is important too. If you have defaulted on a mortgage or other secured loan you are likely to be turned down whenever the default was registered. However, a default on unsecured debt such as a credit card or mobile phone contract is less worrying to lenders. Some lenders ignore mobile phone defaults altogether. The problem is knowing which lenders will be willing to lend to you, so it would be a good idea to use a mortgage adviser which specialises in default mortgages. Applying for multiple mortgages because you keep being turned down can have a detrimental effect on your credit record, because each time you apply for a mortgage (or other credit) it is recorded in your report. Lots of applications over a short period of time make you look high risk to many lenders. Another thing you can do is to ask the credit reference agency to let you add a 200-word “notice of correction” to your credit file explaining why you think the information shouldn’t be there or how it came about – ie, how you never got the text warning you about the default and so were unable to settle the debt before the date the default was registered."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"society/2017/sep/18/have-you-been-unable-to-shop-due-to-poor-accessibility","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-18T10:41:23Z","webTitle":"Have you been unable to shop due to poor accessibility?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/sep/18/have-you-been-unable-to-shop-due-to-poor-accessibility","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/sep/18/have-you-been-unable-to-shop-due-to-poor-accessibility","fields":{"headline":"Have you been unable to shop due to poor accessibility?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Britain’s 11.9 million disabled people represent a potentially large untapped consumer market with a perceived spending power of £80bn, yet many clothes shops are completely inaccessible.

The big picture Days before Theresa May’s major Brexit speech in Florence, her foreign secretary grabbed all the headlines, setting out in a 4,200-word screed the “glorious” future that awaits Britain as it “succeeds mightily” in its great post-Brexit enterprise. The article did not go down a storm. Aside from whatever jockeying inside the Tory party it signals (the home secretary accused him of “backseat driving”), Boris Johnson’s article contained multiple contradictions, misrepresentations and simplifications about Brexit. The Guardian called it “a masterpiece of doublespeak and smarm”, its promises on the deal Britain is likely to secure “palpably false” and the foreign secretary’s whole vision of post-Brexit Britain founded on a “ludicrous fantasy”. The Financial Times (paywall) said it was a “naked, self-serving powerplay” that was “at best facile, at worst dishonest”. (The Telegraph, which published it, hailed it as “at last, a positive and bold vision” for Britain after the EU.) Much of the criticism focused on Johnson’s revival – and spirited defence – of the widely disproved claim that the UK would have £350m a week extra available for public spending after Brexit, described as a “clear misuse of official statistics” by Sir David Norgrove, the head of the national statistics watchdog. But what he had to say about Britain’s past and future relations with the EU was if anything even more misleading. Johnson says Brexit presents “obvious opportunities” (although he names none) to fix Britain’s economic problems, improve its schools and infrastructure, solve its housing crisis, become a research and high-tech giant – none of which EU membership has ever prevented. “Taking back control” in these areas is meaningless, because none was ever given away. Twice, in infrastructure and productivity, he compares Britain unfavourably with France and Germany, both EU members who were oddly unconstrained by the “gigantic and ever-tightening cat’s cradle of red tape” he complains of. Johnson also managed to promise that “our system of standards will remain absolutely flush with the EU’s”, while simultaneously pledging that after Brexit, the UK will take the lead on global deregulation. So: broad-brush brio, precious little reality. Scariest, though, was the extension of Johnson’s familiar Brussels-scapegoating to those who believe in the EU – notably the “young people with the 12 stars lipsticked on their faces … with genuinely split allegiances”. That was nasty, and dangerous. The view from Europe The foreign secretary’s intervention has only reinforced the impression on the continent that Britain still does not know what kind of Brexit it wants and is, for the time being, engaged in a destructive argument with itself. Like the prime minister, Johnson believes – or so his article said – that Brexit must mean leaving the single market, customs union and jurisdiction of European court of justice. He also seemed to accept the need for a financial settlement with the EU. He had nothing to say, however, on the necessity of a transition period – and he clearly rejected the notion of paying for access to the single market after March 2019. He is backed in that by other Brexit hardliners such as John Redwood. Unfortunately, the government in recent weeks had seemed to be coming round to the Treasury view that the best option is a multi-year transition period during which much – including Britain’s EU budget payments – would remain more or less the same while the terms of a longer-term relationship is worked out. May’s Florence speech was supposed to explain all that. But following Johnson’s intervention, who would forgive the EU27 fearing the prime minister’s version of Britain’s preferred Brexit script may not be the final edit? Frustrated EU politicians made their feelings plain. Gianni Pitella, the leader of the socialist bloc in the European parliament, said Johnson was “embarrassing his country once again, jeopardising the Brexit negotiations and insulting the intelligence of the British people”. He added: This appears to be yet another twist in the internal warfare within the Conservative party. It does the UK no credit and no service in the wider world. I fear the British government is heading towards the Brexit rocks. Meanwhile, back in Westminster Westminster is again emptying out, soon after the return from the summer break. But while some MPs are heading to the seaside, this is definitely not a holiday – it’s party conference time. During a three-week recess the Lib Dems, Labour and Conservatives are gathering, respectively, in Bournemouth, Brighton and Manchester, to hobnob with activists and shape future policies. The Lib Dems are, as is traditional, going first, and as ever with the party, much of the talk at their conference is going to be about Brexit. Since an underwhelming election for the party, which saw their tally of MPs nudge up from nine to 12, the largely Brexit-focused Tim Farron has been replaced by the veteran Vince Cable. He is seeking to present the Lib Dems as a more general voice of centrist, middle-of-the-road good sense in a chaotic world. In a round of interviews before his leader’s speech he insisted he could become PM. “You’ve got the governing party, the Conservatives, more or less in open civil war. You’ve got the Labour party in suppressed civil war. You’ve got extreme polarisation – hard right on one side, hard left on the other,” he told the BBC. Brexit is, however, still centre stage, and Cable is sticking to the promise of a new referendum. However, he is presenting it as something new: a “first referendum on the facts, once we know the outcome of the referendum”. Will voters appreciate the distinction? Who knows. But as ever with the Lib Dems on Brexit, at least their message is consistent. You should also know: Oliver Robbins, the UK’s most senior Brexit official, moves to new role as Theresa May’s EU adviser after a year in his job amid reports of tensions with the Brexit secretary, David Davis, prompting calls of Brexit “chaos”. British expats face pensions cliff-edge after Brexit. Fellow cabinet member and leave campaigner Michael Gove backs Boris Johnson over controversial £350m a week claim. Home Office “hostile environment” approach turns life upside down of Japanese woman married to Polish national and living lawfully in UK. Welsh first minister says belief in hard Brexit is like religious fundamentalism. UK exporters have “hoarded” gains from fall in sterling, ONS says. Wetherspoon’s pro-Brexit boss Tim Martin hits out at “unelected oligarchs” and says EU leaders should “take a wise-up pill” on Brexit. HMRC chief Jon Thompson warns post-Brexit border and tax checks could cost up to £800m and take seven years to implement. John Lewis profits halve as chairman warns over Brexit uncertainty. Read these: In the Observer, Philip Inman writes that even German carmakers will not save Britain from a hard Brexit – because in the EU as in the UK, politics now trumps economics: David Davis falls into the camp that still believes economics will overtake politics in the final straight, allowing his team to extract the kind of business-friendly deal, with an extended transition period, that the CBI is calling for. But why does he think that German business leaders will put trade with the UK above the cohesion of the remaining 27 countries, which serves their purpose much more than keeping borders open with the UK? Clamping down on free movement wouldn’t fit, either, with [French president Emmanuel Macron’s] attempts to deepen the structures of the EU and make it function more as one country, or at least create a eurozone that becomes more of a unitary entity. The UK’s plan to quit the EU, with cherries picked and borders blocked, is peripheral to this debate. Prepare for a clean Brexit. And in the Guardian, Rafael Behr says the prime minister is insensitive to the plight of the 2.9 million EU citizens in the UK and explains – movingly – why that is a problem: Brexiters see the issue in bureaucratic terms – moving people between legal rubrics. Most will not see it in terms of identity because they don’t see an EU passport as a credible vehicle for any emotional sense of belonging. If they did, they would have voted remain. Anyone from a migrant background will appreciate that there is no easy separation of official status and belonging. Even those who, like me, were born in the UK to immigrant parents, and have had British passports from birth, carry a sense of the permission that was once granted. EU free movement conferred a right to relocate. And, whether Brexiters like it or not, that implied a right to belong in perpetuity. So it is not a technical adjustment, this decision to downgrade the status of people who took jobs, married, had children, all on the basis of their old status. Leaving the European Union will negate a right that millions of people exercised as the foundation for their lives in this country. Any claim that they cannot be wounded by it is absurd. It cuts deeper than many leavers realise.

Throughout the five year history of this steampunk stealth adventure series, this eponymous deity, the Outsider, has been at the centre of everything – dealing in regicide, revenge and all the juicy stuff in between. He’s an omnipotent force who watches and intervenes from the void – a mysterious place between worlds – giving mortals like Billie Lurk, our new protagonist, spectral powers. In Dishonored 2, protagonists Corvo Attano and Emily Kaldwin each had their own unique abilities to reflect their personality, gifted by the Outsider himself. This time, Billie has a newly imbued quadruplet of magical skills that suit hers – similar in function to what you’ve played before but with subtle interesting twists. Displace allows Lurk to place a ghostly marker so she can instantly teleport out of danger, or to get to hard-to-reach spots; Semblance allows you to literally steal the face of an unconscious guard or civilian, using it to walk around concealed under a guise for a temporary period; and Foresight freezes time, allowing freeform disembodied perusal of your surroundings to mark guards and targets to keep track of them on your HUD. Finally, and most amusingly, you can listen to rats. The swarms of rodents offer up interesting titbits of information on the wider world and your current mission in eerie high pitched voices, and it plays directly into Lurk’s backstory as a street urchin. Death of the Outsider also introduces a major gameplay refinement that makes your powers recharge over time, rather than require potions to power up. This removes the frustrating need to scavenge for resources, which detracted from the empowerment in the previous two games. Lurk’s sudden promotion to leading lady is extremely welcome – she’s always been one of the more intriguing personalities in an already interesting cast, and her journey from life on the grimy streets to being one of the most skilled assassins in the isles is one that deserves a spotlight, even in a story that’s referential rather than original. Death of the Outsider also includes Billie getting back her arm – an appendage she spent Dishonored 2 without – and learning more about the Outsider himself as you find a viable route to killing him. The five-mission adventure begins with an extraction. The most infamous hired killer of them all, the legendary Daud, has been captured and is being tortured to subdue his incredible void powers. You have to rescue him and, in true Dishonored fashion, it’s very much up to you how you do so. A year since Dishonored 2 launched, it takes this single introductory mission to get back into the mindset of how best to play a game like this – complex options lay everywhere for you to exploit and explore. Even the habit of looking up for multiple routes around each level takes a while to sink back in. Few games offer such systemic freedom, both in their environmental layouts and in terms of open-ended objectives, and it’s best played at a slow pace to soak in the multitude of different avenues of completion. The next four missions make up a mostly great but inconsistent campaign. The third – a hazy dusklight bank heist – is the clear standout, and one of the most memorable set-pieces in the entire series. Options lay open from the get go, but it’s when you finally crack into the bank itself that things get interesting. You can put staff and guards to sleep while you pursue a particular route of completion, making the mission incredibly tense and exciting thanks to incredible sound design, the presence of clockwork sentinels unaffected by sleeping gas and the ability to wake individuals up if you accidentally nudge them while you’re manoeuvring. Despite the odd dip elsewhere in the game, there’s largely enough freedom for you to enjoy spending time in developer Arkane’s beautifully detailed worlds, which its environment team revel in, creating grand interiors and dimly lit streets that ooze with an inimitable saturated style. Open hub levels make a return, too, meaning you get moments of respite before a proper mission, in which you can indulge in purchasing goods and upgrades from a nearby black market dealer – or you could break in and steal all the wares for yourself. Here you can also find the new additional optional contracts. These are essentially extra objectives that lie off the critical path, or parameters for completion for which you can earn extra coin. The bank heist mission challenges you to get in and out with the prize without harming a human being, for example, which at first seems like a standard ghost run, but soon proves challenging when you try to manipulate the bank’s ultra sophisticated Jindosh-designed mobile vault without alerting anyone. To have yet more moving parts in a mission could’ve been overwhelming in practice, but Arkane makes smart use of its objective markers to always allow you to hide things you’re not interested in. It also avoids overwhelming players by streamlining certain parts of the experience. That means the removal of any meaningful progression of Billie’s powers, which fits a shorter story but does lead to a sense of stagnation by the final level. Perhaps the most questionable omission is the Chaos system. This is essentially a moral compass that, in previous games, follows you depending on the choices you make and changes the outcome of certain events and even transforms entire levels. While its removal makes more sense if you considered Lurk’s already established moral sensibilities, it definitely reduces the player experience. In the end – and, according to the creators this is definitely the series’ coda – Death of the Outsider successfully sees out one of its most intriguing lead characters and one of its most powerful villains in a worthwhile adventure. Across six or so hours, this standalone indulgence doesn’t add much truly new, instead relying on tweaks of its existing formula . But it delivers strong missions and an excuse to continue skulking around this fabulous and hugely atmospheric world.

The 43-year-old writer who won the 2016 Hugo award (the Oscars of the sci-fi world) for best novella doesn’t look like much of a geek. Yes, she wears oversized glasses, but Okorafor’s specs are trendy, royal-blue Cat-Eyes, not wiry aviators. And, crucially, she happens to be a black woman. The Nigerian-American’s success has been applauded as a victory by a community that has long cheered her on from the margins. So when she tweeted on 11 August that she was working on her first project with the comic publisher Marvel, fans were thrilled. (“A Marvel story. Written by a Nigerian woman. Set in Lagos. Superhero’s name: NGOZI. What a time to be alive,” wrote one fan on Twitter) And with a novel, Who Fears Death, to be adapted for TV by HBO (George RR Martin is its executive producer) Okorafor is about to go from the solitary geek reference-point for young African women to everybody’s favourite new sci-fi writer. Okorafor is not the only black woman beating a path in the sometimes hostile and isolating world of science fiction. NK Jemisin, who won the Hugo award for best novel two years in a row, was called an “educated but ignorant savage” by the US far-right activist Theodore Beale, who has long railed against the increasingly diverse sci-fi community. Octavia E Butler, probably the best known black female sci-fi writer, has said that she found herself alienated from the characters in the books she read. Okorafor admits to not having read much sci-fi growing up, but, like Butler, struggled to identify with protagonists when she did. “It just seemed like a very sterile, white male world,” she says. “I would migrate towards characters who were alien, or animals.” Today, though, marginalised black girls and young women with a love for manga, gaming, or robotics, can find each other online. Facebook communities include Black Girl Nerds – which has 126,000 followers – and its offshoot, Black Girl Geeks, which has more than 38,000 followers on Twitter. Black female geeks are also being celebrated on screen: the film Hidden Figures – about the African American mathematicians who played a vital role in the space race – was one of the biggest films at the box office in 2016. Asked how she feels about being called a geek, Okorafor gets animated, but then, as she did on the TED stage, she defies expectations: “For a long time, I refused to call myself a geek or a nerd because I was also an athlete,” she says. “I was always the first kid picked for teams.” She reminisces happily for several minutes about playing dodgeball and semi-pro tennis, and jokes about her phenomenal upper-body strength: “My mum used to throw the javelin. I’ve got her arms. I can do one-handed pull-ups,” she says with a hint of pride. Raised in the southern suburbs of Chicago, where she and her sisters would be called names and chased by skinheads, Okorafor grew up feeling like an outsider. She has, however, turned that perspective to her advantage, envisaging characters and settings who sharply contrast from their mainstream portrayal; Who Fears Death, for example, is set in a post-apocalyptic Sudan and mixes fantasy with magical realism. Although she may have been too athletic in her youth to fit the geek mould, Okorafor now finds comfort in the variety within the geek community. At San Diego Comic-Con this year with her daughter, she marvelled at the array of people in cosplay costumes. “We were like: ‘This is awesome. Everyone is just being what they are.’ I like the diversity – there are so many different types of strange.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/sep/18/clearly-jacob-rees-mogg-hasnt-quite-got-the-hang-of-christianity","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-18T13:39:06Z","webTitle":"Clearly, Jacob Rees-Mogg hasn’t quite got the hang of Christianity","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/18/clearly-jacob-rees-mogg-hasnt-quite-got-the-hang-of-christianity","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/18/clearly-jacob-rees-mogg-hasnt-quite-got-the-hang-of-christianity","fields":{"headline":"Clearly, Jacob Rees-Mogg hasn’t quite got the hang of Christianity","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"I turned on the telly last week and caught the last few minutes of Question Time, but foolishly didn’t turn it straight off away. Why not? I know it always annoys me, and this time it was more annoying than ever, because up reared the dreaded subject of Jacob Rees-Mogg and whether religion has a place in politics. And the responses were outstandingly weedy: there is “virtue in honesty. At least he has spoken his truth”, from Will Self; Rees-Mogg holds his views “honestly and sincerely” from the work and pensions secretary David Gauke; “he is actually being honest as a politician” from the audience. I thought we all knew that he hadn’t quite got the hang of Christianity/Catholicism, or what Jesus was aiming for. If only the discussion could have been a little more robust, instead of mimsying around religious views, as usual. And, perhaps because Rees-Mogg is a toff and able to drone in fluent Latin, the respectful tone and forelock-touching made things even more sickening. So I shan’t be surprised if some similar creature with ancient, rigid views soon becomes prime minister, because I bet that secretly, deep in our hearts, loads of us long to know our place and stay in it with strict rules and regulations so that we don’t have to be bothered with choice and can just do as the Rees-Moggs and religions tell us: get up, wash, eat, pray, wear and do this and that, before/after doing whatever, don’t eat/drive, carry money, work or speak on this or that day. Do not marry or mingle with a person from this or that class, caste, country, belief. We can have our days, weeks and whole lives planned out and pretend there is some sort of order and justice in the world. It’s so much easier than investigating, making your own mind up, or arguing day in, day out. “You’re lucky,” says Fielding. “A few hundred years ago you would have been beheaded for not believing in this stuff.

Chris Geoghegan – the father of 34-year-old Victoria Geoghegan who led the secret campaign that aimed to stir up racial tension in South Africa – has resigned as a non-executive director of Rentokil Initial where he was senior independent director and chair of the remuneration committee. The 63-year-old, a former top executive at defence company BAE Systems, was responsible for introducing the wealthy and controversial Gupta family to Bell Pottinger in January 2016. He received a monthly fee from the agency for his services. Following the meeting Bell Pottinger took on a £100,000-a-month contract to work for Gupta-owned Oakbay Capital, led by Victoria Geoghegan, which resulted in the PR and social media campaign focusing on “economic apartheid” and “white monopoly capital” in South Africa. The resignation of Geoghegan, who had only been at Rentokil since June last year, was announced by the company in a two-sentence statement on Monday. Geoghegan, who was on the board of BAE Systems from 2000 to 2007 and worked as joint chief operating officer, has held a string of senior executive roles at Airbus and BAE since starting in the aerospace industry in the 1970s. In July, Victoria Geoghegan was fired from Bell Pottinger at the same time as it made a U-turn, offering an “unequivocal and absolute apology” for an “inappropriate and offensive” social media campaign. The PR agency had initially maintained it was the victim of a smear campaign involving “totally false and damaging accusations”. On Friday, the fallout of the scandal spread to the South African arm of KPMG, which audits companies owned by the Guptas, with the chief executive, chairman and a string of top executives resigning. The resignations followed an investigation by KPMG International which said that while it did not find any evidence of “illegal behaviour or corruption” at the firm, it did find “work that fell considerably short of KPMG’s standards”. KPMG donated the equivalent of 40m South African rand (£2.2m) – the fees earned from Gupta company work from 2002 – to not-for-profit groups working in education and the anti-corruption sector. KPMG International’s report also investigated the firm’s work for the South African Revenue Service (SARS). KPMG offered to pay back the 23m South African rand (£1.28m) fee for its work, or donate the same amount to charity. On Monday, Tom Moyane, commissioner of SARS, said that the body is to launch legal proceedings against KPMG over reputational damage caused by releasing details of the confidential report it produced for the tax agency. Moyane said that KPMG will be reported to Malusi Gigaba, South Africa’s finance minister, with a view to blacklisting the company for its “unethical” and “unlawful” behaviour. Earlier this month, Bell Pottinger was expelled from the UK PR trade body for at least five years, and was subsequently put into administration as a client exodus left it unable to pay debts."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2017/sep/18/how-well-do-you-know-samuel-johnsons-dictionary-quiz","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-18T10:26:48Z","webTitle":"How well do you know Samuel Johnson's dictionary? – quiz","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/sep/18/how-well-do-you-know-samuel-johnsons-dictionary-quiz","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/sep/18/how-well-do-you-know-samuel-johnsons-dictionary-quiz","fields":{"headline":"How well do you know Samuel Johnson's dictionary? – quiz","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"crosswords/crossword-blog/2017/sep/18/crossword-blog-american-puzzles-a-word-to-the-sceptical","type":"article","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-18T13:39:32Z","webTitle":"Crossword blog: American puzzles – a word to the sceptical","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2017/sep/18/crossword-blog-american-puzzles-a-word-to-the-sceptical","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2017/sep/18/crossword-blog-american-puzzles-a-word-to-the-sceptical","fields":{"headline":"Crossword blog: American puzzles – a word to the sceptical","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Hello, sceptic. What makes you think I’m a sceptic? Well, you enjoy British crosswords, but you never look at American puzzles. On the contrary! Since your feature on American cryptics, I look at the Nation every so often, and … I’m not talking about American cryptics. I’m talking about regular American puzzles. Oh, those. Well, of course I don’t solve them. Just like I don’t do wordsearches, or spot the differences. You think that because they’re not cryptic, they’re simple. They are simple. And they are simple because they have those grids that look like an “Arrow Words” in a Children’s Bumper Fun Puzzle collection, with hardly any black squares. All that extra crossing means they have to use proper nouns, which is something to be avoided where possible. I’ll grant you that there are a ton of proper nouns in American puzzles – and that they can include unfamiliar confectionery brands, Midwest towns and TV stars. And who wants to be made to feel ignorant about things that simply don’t matter? Even when it’s not a little general-knowledge quiz, the clues … well, they’re just definitions, like a not-so-quick quick. At least in the UK we don’t put setters’ names on concise crosswords. But they’re not just definitions. Do you like Rufus’s puzzles? I love them. Then you’ll love the best of the US puzzles. They are brimming with cryptic definitions, usually terse and sly. ‘Starts a set’ (6); ‘Tubes in a studio’ (9); ‘Play group’ (4). And when they’re not allusive, they’re often alliterative. That sounds acceptable to my sceptical ears. But I just can’t imagine enjoying a crossword where the answers aren’t words that you find defined in a dictionary. That’s because you’re a construct, created by me, and I am phrasing your objections speciously. So I should just … embrace all those abbreviations, suffixes and fragments? Yes! Some of my favourite clues are for three-letter compass directions, or Roman numerals. Such as ‘XLV x IX’ (3). I will! And since you’re putting words in my mouth, I now see things differently. If you will, embracing all of these pieces of language – from Latin tags to carnival slang – is of a piece with the age when the crossword was born. In 1913, you could see Duchamp’s bicycle wheel on a stool, or Picasso’s fragmented guitar; words, too, were drifting from their appointed roles. Artificial languages were sprouting and linguistic worlds colliding. The crossword – and especially the American crossword – is that extraordinary century’s tug-of-war between order and chaos, re-nosed as a game. That’s a compelling view. Not too flowery? I wouldn’t put it quite that way myself. But that irreverence is there in the themes as well: try this LA Times puzzle (8 Sept) where, in six down entries, the word EIGHT is replaced by an O above another O. I shall! American themes can be gentle and unconcealed on a Monday, ranging through to, say, Friday’s Wall Street Journal competition, which is like a mini-Listener, with its own microculture. Right you are, Alan. Like all straw-man ciphers, I’ve found that my arguments are bested by yours. All I can really do now is ask for some advice on how to get cracking. Happy to help. You probably know that the New York Times is the ‘crossword of record’. Before you subscribe to that, you might want to try the ad-supported LA Times and Wall Street Journal, and indie setters including Brendan Emmett Quigley and Will Nediger. And what do I need to remember? There are no letter counts by the clues, so think about multi-word answers and abbreviations, which are usually indicated by an abbrev. in the clue itself. Titles should help with themes. And get used to entering ALOE and SMEE. Thank you. Having served my rhetorical purpose, I suppose I may as well disappear with what might be clues as a ‘Pong preceder’. Not quite yet. I also need to advise you to download software that works with Across Lite files, especially as the squares of American puzzles might contain multiple letters. One setter has even used video in clues. [Ping!] Reader recommendations of American non-cryptic puzzles are welcome.

In his 4,200-word essay on the “glorious” future awaiting Britain after Brexit “succeeds mightily”, the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, wrote: Once we have settled our accounts, we will take back control of roughly £350m a week. It would be a fine thing, as a lot of us have said, if a lot of that money went on the NHS. The comment references, but does not directly repeat, the controversial claims by Vote Leave before the referendum that Britain “sends £350m a week to Brussels” and that after Brexit, the government would be able to “fund our NHS instead”. The claims were largely disproved before the June 2016 vote, with organisations including the independent fact-checkers FullFacts, the BBC and the Guardian all pointing out that the first was simply wrong, and the second highly misleading. What was wrong with the original claims? The claim that Britain “sends the EU £350m a week” is wrong because: The rebate negotiated by Margaret Thatcher is removed before anything is paid to Brussels. In 2014, this meant Britain actually “sent” £276m a week to Brussels; in 2016, the figure was £252m. Slightly less than half that sum – the money that Britain does send to the EU – either comes back to the UK to be spent mainly on agriculture, regional aid, research and community projects, or gets counted towards the country’s international aid target. Regardless of how much the UK “saves” by leaving the EU, the claim that a future government would be able to spend it on the NHS is highly misleading because: It assumes the government would choose to spend on the NHS the money it currently gets back from the EU (£115m a week in 2014), thus cutting funding for agriculture, regional development and research by that amount. It assumes the UK economy will not be adversely affected by Brexit, which many economists doubt. But is what Johnson is saying now different? The foreign secretary did not repeat the error of saying Britain “sends” £350m a week to Brussels. But he did say that after Britain leaves the EU it would “take back control” of roughly that sum, and he suggested “a lot of it” could go on the NHS. This is why Sir David Norgrove accused Johnson of “a clear misuse of official statistics” in choosing to “repeat the figure of £350m per week, in connection with the amount that might be available for extra public spending”. The foreign secretary has since described the response from the head of the statistics watchdog as “a wilful distortion of the text of my article”. To say he had suggested £350m a week “might be available for extra public spending” was “a complete misrepresentation” of what he said, Johnson claimed. His supporters may feel Johnson is justified in his complaint. But his detractors – especially given the number of times he appeared in front of the Vote Leave bus with the £350m claim on it – may feel that at best he is pushing his luck. Did he say anything else? Johnson made a false claim in his letter to Norgrove. He wrote that the UK’s rebate “only forms part of the EU’s financing arrangement with the agreement of all the other member states. We do not control it ourselves.” This is not true. The complex mechanism for calculating Britain’s rebate, the amount of which varies each year, was agreed by all member states and can only be changed with the agreement of all those states – including, while it is a member, Britain. The rebate is also money that never leaves Britain, and the EU has no say over how it is spent. In that sense, at least, Britain certainly “controls it”. Why has Johnson brought this all up again? It seems unlikely that the foreign secretary does not know the difference between a gross and a net sum, nor understand the wider objections to the £350m figure and the claims surrounding it. His allies say Johnson has been bruised by claims he misled the public during the campaign. But it is clear that the figure, dishonest as it was, proved effective in securing the Brexit vote. Reviving it now serves two purposes: with the government leaning towards continuing substantial payments to the EU as part of a transition process (something Johnson opposes), it focuses public attention on the question of how much the UK “sends” to Brussels; and with Johnson reportedly feeling left out of the Brexit debate, it gets everyone talking about him."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/sep/18/we-need-to-make-democracy-work-in-the-fight-to-save-the-planet","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-18T10:16:25Z","webTitle":"We need to make democracy work in the fight to save the planet | AC Grayling","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/sep/18/we-need-to-make-democracy-work-in-the-fight-to-save-the-planet","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/sep/18/we-need-to-make-democracy-work-in-the-fight-to-save-the-planet","fields":{"headline":"We need to make democracy work in the fight to save the planet","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Although individual action to protect the environment – consuming less, recycling more, reducing one’s carbon footprint – might be a contribution if enough people did it, the battle to minimise human-induced climate change has to be a worldwide endeavour among cooperating states. The outcome of the 2015 UN Climate Change Conference was one of the most optimistic and encouraging steps hitherto achieved in that battle – that is, until Donald Trump said he intended to withdraw the US, the biggest climate polluter in history, from the agreement. The Paris agreement and President Trump’s decision illustrate the two ends of the spectrum of effort and concern. Our planet cannot be protected from a warming atmosphere – with melting ice caps, rising sea levels, droughts, floods, famines and migrations of desperate populations – without vigorous joint effort by the world’s states. It is thought that climate catastrophes caused turmoil in the past – perhaps at the beginning of the fourth millennium BCE, and in the early 12th century BCE, when entire civilisations in the Mediterranean and Near East collapsed in rapid succession into centuries of dark ages. Only this time – today, in our present world, with a global population of over seven billion that is growing ever faster – any such catastrophe will be many orders of magnitude greater. That is the situation that makes concerted international effort imperative. At the other end of the spectrum, President Trump’s announcement illustrates the fragility of international cooperation. It takes just one large rogue elephant in the herd to negate the endeavour. Any one of the US, China, India and the EU could undermine the sacrifice and determination demanded by the Paris agreement. It is a desperately sad move by any one large polluting economy if it refuses to cooperate. Such a decision condemns – actually condemns, not merely threatens to condemn – hundreds of millions of people to suffering, and almost certainly the whole planet to new dark ages. Democracy is, as has been well said, the least bad of a lot of bad systems. But it pays a high price for the noble ideal of locating political authority in the consent of the people. Tyrants can make and act on quick decisions. Democracies debate and disagree, and move slowly. Tyrannies are efficient to the point of mercilessness. Democracies are inefficient to the point of ineffectiveness at times. The very nature of the political process in democracies means that leaders are reluctant to burden the populace with restrictions and sacrifices, lest they are voted out of office. But saving the planet requires restrictions and sacrifices. Leaders are reluctant to burden business with extra costs on emissions and other good environmental practices, lest they damage the economy, and again in consequence lose office. Tyrants have no such anxieties: they worry only about the assassin or eventual rebellion. Democracy, accordingly, is not a natural ally of the tough measures required to combat climate change. And yet populations of democracies will be the first to punish their political leaders when the disastrous effects of climate change start hitting home. What is required for democracies to become fully engaged in the fight to save the planet is that their citizens should be informed and thoughtful, and willing participants in the required sacrifices. Given the realities, say cynics, is not this a vain hope? Efforts to inform are manifold, but they are undermined by deniers and sceptics, among them Mr Trump. Efforts to encourage thoughtfulness and sacrifice among the people meet with the age-old reluctance on the part of too many people to attempt either. Short-termism, self-interest, lack of real understanding, a head-in-the-sand attitude and several kinds of laziness and self-indulgence make us humans our own worst enemies: and in a democracy we all feel entitled to be all these things as a right. There is nothing new in this. Plato, two and a half millennia ago, criticised democracy precisely because of this. But this is now a major life-threatening dilemma for our time. Driving home the dangers The international order is effectively an anarchy if any of its members – sovereign states – refuse to play ball with the rest, or refuse to adhere to agreements previously made. What is the sanction against, say, the US if indeed it does withdraw from the Paris agreement? The international order is itself a loose form of democracy, and suffers the same deficits. This fact illustrates where the nub of the problem lies: a lack of a sense of binding obligation to act for the benefit of others. Short-termism and self-interest are endemic weaknesses both of democracies and those who live in them. And these are precisely the things that have already wrought so much damage to the world’s climate, and threaten the people of the world with ever-increasing danger. Human survival is of course not the only, though it is the most obvious, point at issue in the climate emergency we are facing. Peace, stability, human rights, the welfare of children – these will all collapse before the survival issue becomes the only one left. Now, not one of us should or would, I hope, seek to overturn democracy. But every one of us should, I hope, bend our thoughts vigorously to the problem of how to make the saving of our planet consistent with democracy. For surely, democracy and survival do not have to be in conflict. There have to be ways in which democracies can be full, compassionate, sensible partners with each other – indeed with everyone, no matter what the political system – in rescuing the planet from the peril that our historical self-indulgence and exploitation have already placed it in. To ensure that the aims of the Paris agreement are met, there therefore has to be another effort alongside the drive for far greater sustainability in industrial-commercial activity. This is an overwhelming, unceasing drive to educate and re-educate every single individual on the planet about climate change. The real and imminent dangers to lives and societies have to be driven home. People have themselves to become the goads driving politicians and governments to act. If the world’s people can be mobilised, then the short-termism and self-interest of the political classes in democracies will be addressed. Measures will be taken that people can understand are genuinely in their own real interests, as well as the interests of their fellows in the human story around the world. Many are cynical about the potential of education to achieve anything like what is required here. Time and again, dreamers and idealists have launched themselves into education to better the world. But in the face of how things are in both national and international politics, other than climate-induced civilisational collapse itself, education is the only thing that has a hope of changing minds. It is all we have. But with massive effort we can make a difference, and perhaps enough of one to save our lives. We have to teach ourselves into freedom from this danger: nothing less can or will do. • AC Grayling is master of the New College of the Humanities, London, and its professor of philosophy.

In a statement from concert promoters Live Nation, the pop singer is said to be “devastated” over the decision, made under the advice of doctors. “Lady Gaga is suffering from severe physical pain that has impacted her ability to perform,” the statement reads. “She remains under the care of expert medical professionals who recommended the postponement earlier today.” The concerts, including five UK dates in London, Birmingham and Manchester, will be rescheduled in “early 2018”. Lady Gaga suffers from fibromyalgia, a chronic pain condition; the statement says she is going to use the coming weeks “to heal from this and past traumas that still affect her daily life, and result in severe physical pain in her body”. Last week she wrote on her Instagram that her condition was “not simply hip pain or wear and tear from the road”. Her battle to manage the condition forms part of a new documentary, Gaga: Five Foot Two, which launches globally on Netflix on 22 September."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2017/sep/18/football-transfer-rumours-barcelona-to-turn-their-attention-to-sadio-mane","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-18T08:08:13Z","webTitle":"Football transfer rumours: Barcelona to turn their attention to Sadio Mané?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/sep/18/football-transfer-rumours-barcelona-to-turn-their-attention-to-sadio-mane","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/sep/18/football-transfer-rumours-barcelona-to-turn-their-attention-to-sadio-mane","fields":{"headline":"Football transfer rumours: Barcelona to turn their attention to Sadio Mané?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Not content with causing Liverpool fans no end of summer torment with their relentless but ultimately unsuccessful pursuit of Philippe Coutinho, Barcelona are ready to put them through the wringer again by courting Sadio Mané in the coming months. Real Madrid and Juventus are also reported to be interested in the speedy Senegalese forward, who is currently sidelined through suspension on the back of that red card he received for accidentally booting Manchester City goalkeeper Ederson in the head. Losing Mané would be a nightmarish scenario for Liverpool, who conspicuously failed to fire on all cylinders when he was away playing in last season’s Africa Cup of Nations. It may have been no coincidence that they could only draw with Burnley over the weekend as he sat out the first game of his three-match ban. Time will tell. Michael Carrick isn’t getting any younger and with his current deal at Old Trafford set to expire next June, Manchester United are eyeing up potential replacements. United scouts are understood to have killed two birds with one stone last week, running the rule over Atlético Madrid’s Saúl Ñíguez and his Roma counterpart Radja Nainggolan when the sides met in the Champions League last week. Having upset his employers at Bayern Munich by complaining about their lack of ambition in the transfer market, Robert Lewandowski took time out after Saturday’s shellacking of Mainz to not really address his apparent obsession with joining Real Madrid. “I don’t have to comment every time on every bit of nonsense, whether it means something or not, and I don’t have to say something about this bullshit,” said the potty-mouthed striker, who seemed in chirpy form after netting a double to take his tally for the season in all competitions to nine goals in seven appearances. Sensing that Lewandowski may have dressed in Lederhosen, raised a stein of pils and posed with his team-mates at Oktoberfest for the last time, Manchester United and Chelsea are both interested in bringing him to the Premier League. Tottenham quite like the look of Barcelona midfielder André Gomes, who endured a difficult first season at Camp Nou and has yet to endear himself to the supporters who call it home. Despite his failure to impress, Barcelona are believed to have turned down several offers of more than £30m for a player who scored only three goals and provided one assist while becoming an object of derision for Barça supporters, who made him a scapegoat for last season’s failures. Having failed to sign Ross Barkley in the summer, Spurs may now turn their attention to the 24-year-old from Grijó. Paris Saint-Germain goalkeeper Alphonse Areola could be off to Crystal Palace or Newcastle United in January, while Leicester winger Demarai Gray will be going nowhere once his employers push a lucrative, improved £50,000-per-week contract under his nose and hand him a pen later this week. Meanwhile, at the Etihad, Kevin De Bruyne is also expected to ink a new and improved £200,000-per-week contract to tie him to Manchester City and dissuade other clubs from trying to turn his head in the next transfer window."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"books/2017/oct/20/jimmy-barnes-michelle-de-kretser-and-benjamin-law-on-their-october-reading","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-19T17:00:31Z","webTitle":"Jimmy Barnes, Michelle de Kretser and Benjamin Law on their October reading","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/oct/20/jimmy-barnes-michelle-de-kretser-and-benjamin-law-on-their-october-reading","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/oct/20/jimmy-barnes-michelle-de-kretser-and-benjamin-law-on-their-october-reading","fields":{"headline":"Jimmy Barnes, Michelle de Kretser and Benjamin Law on their October reading","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Jane Harper Force of Nature Macmillan Australia Your book in your own words: Five city women enter the bushland on a corporate teambuilding retreat; several days later, only four come out. Federal police agent Aaron Falk is particularly keen to uncover the fate of the missing woman, who had helped him in an investigation into the company the women work for. But as he delves into the disappearance, he is forced to unpick conflicting tales of suspicion, violence and fractured loyalties. Readers who are familiar with my first novel, The Dry, will see some themes and characters explored further, but Force of Nature can easily be read as a standalone novel. What you were reading when you wrote it: The Good People by Hannah Kent. Kent’s sense of place and deep understanding of her characters is something I try to absorb. The next Australian book you’ll read: See What I Have Done by Sarah Schmidt. A novel based around the real-life Lizzie Borden’s 1892 axe murders is an interesting hook. I’m keen to see what Schmidt does with the story and the ways she uses the facts to build a fresh narrative. Peter Greste The First Casualty Viking Your book in your own words: Prison gives you time to think. And the more I thought about what had happened to us – a bunch of journalists convicted of terrorism charges in Egypt – the more I realised that we were sitting at the extreme end of what has been happening around the world since the “war on terror” began in 2001. In wars of the past, over tangible things like land or ethnicity, journalists have been witnesses rather than participants in the conflict. But in a war over ideas – in this case between western liberalism and militant Islam – the place where those ideas are transmitted becomes a part of the battlefield. The First Casualty is the story of our struggle for freedom, but also, more broadly, the story of how press freedom itself has been a victim – the first casualty – of the wider struggle. What you were reading when you wrote it: I was reading Tim Winton’s extraordinary book Breath while I wrote The First Casualty. It was such a powerful evocation of people and place that I felt inspired by it, but also intimidated by Tim’s genius. The next Australian book you’ll read: It’ll be Peter Carey’s new novel, A Long Way from Home. One of my favourite novels of all time is Bliss and Carey’s writing is always original – something that is far too rare these days. Cass Moriarty Parting Words UQP Your book in your own words: Parting Words explores the secrets and silences in families. In his will, in one last act of atonement, Daniel Whittaker has left unusual instructions for his three adult children: before his estate can be distributed, they must hand-deliver letters to people from his past. How well do the siblings really know their father? What will they discover from strangers about their own family? As details of their father’s life are revealed, including the aftermath of war and the terrible psychological effects of guilt, the children piece together a complex portrait of their father and struggle to accept a reinterpretation of the man they thought they knew. It’s a story of a fractured family, each person coming to terms with their own life choices. Amid regret, hurt and betrayal, how do we seek the hopeful possibilities of forgiveness and redemption? What you were reading when you wrote it: Marilynne Robinson’s trio of interconnected novels (Gilead, Home and Lila) were inspiring to my idea of family – the fallibility of parents, the vulnerability of children and the notion of innocence – and showed me how the prisms of memory, childhood experience and intergenerational trauma change the way we view the world. The next Australian book you’ll read: After the magic of The Eye of the Sheep, I’m looking forward to Sofie Laguna’s novel The Choke. She has a unique ability to capture the voice of a child and to develop a character that is complex and insightful while retaining the wonder and naivety of the young. Judy Nunn Sanctuary William Heinemann Your book in your own words: My novel, Sanctuary, tells of nine refugees, one a small child, who are fleeing from war-torn countries in the Middle East. These people are of differing nationalities, cultures and religions. Each has their own story and they are strangers to one another when they board a boat in Indonesia. However, when the vessel founders in a storm and they are the only survivors making it ashore to a remote island, they are forced to bond in order to survive. The island is deserted, but there are huts and water tanks, fishing tackle and supplies, even overgrown vegetable patches – everything necessary to sustain life. Unbeknown to them they’re only 40km from the coast of Australia. No one knows they’re there, but what will happen when they’re discovered? What you were reading when you wrote it: I don’t read other people’s fiction when I’m writing a novel, but I certainly read books that will further my research. The most affecting one I read during the writing of Sanctuary was The Morning They Came for Us: Dispatches from Syria by Janine de Giovanni. The next Australian book you’ll read: As soon as I can get a hold of it, as it’s not yet been published: In the Garden of the Fugitives by Ceridwen Dovey. I’m particularly keen to read it simply because I so enjoyed Only the Animals – she has such a lovely style. Vanessa Berry Mirror Sydney Giramondo Your book in your own words: Mirror Sydney charts an alternative Sydney by paying attention to its details and traces. My background is in writing memoir, but with this book I decided to turn my focus on memory outwards and to give expression to some of the memories of the city itself. I’m drawn to the anachronistic, unusual, little-noticed and hidden parts of the city. Mirror Sydney documents these elements and their connections to stories of past, present and future. The essays reveal suburban mysteries and unlikely landmarks, places abandoned, stubbornly persisting or hidden in plain sight. My writing often includes visual elements, in this case hand-drawn maps that accompany the essays. Together they form a guide to looking under the surface of the city, and preserve some of the vanishing places and details that are disappearing as Sydney changes and redevelops. Although it’s a book about Sydney, more generally it is about being attentive to urban environments and the complex networks of stories that exist within them. What you were reading when you wrote it: Virginia Woolf’s Street Haunting, in her essay collection The Death of the Moth, was a touchstone for me. In it she writes of an evening walk in London and how the details of the present interweave with memory and imagination. Although it describes an experience long past, it has a beautiful immediacy. The next Australian book you’ll read: Darlinghurst Funeral Rites by Mark Mordue, a collection of autobiographical poems about the post-punk music scene in inner-city Sydney in the 1980s. I’m enthusiastic to read this, as it’s an era I am interested in, and I love stories of subcultures and how they reimagine and reshape urban space. Sarah Krasnostein The Trauma Cleaner Text Your book in your own words: The Trauma Cleaner is a true story about the life and work of an extraordinary Australian woman named Sandra Pankhurst. Adopted as a baby boy into an abusive family in Melbourne in the 1950s, Sandra has lived many lives: husband and father, drag queen, sex worker, funeral director, trophy wife, business owner and – for the past 20 years – trauma cleaner. In addition to crime scenes, a trauma cleaner works with the living: people whose insuperable pain or illness has left them living in squalor. I observed Sandra work with these people, applying the lessons she’s learned the hard way about resilience and compassion. By the time Sandra finally felt sufficiently safe in society to share her story, she could no longer remember significant parts of it. Repeat episodes of trauma had robbed her of memory. But the opposite of trauma is not the absence of trauma; the opposite of trauma is order – everything in its place. So, in researching this book, I had the privilege of doing for Sandra what she does for others; I hope it was a trauma clean for her. What you were reading when you wrote it: One of the books I returned to in my research was The Scarlet Mile: A Social History of Prostitution in Kalgoorlie, 1894–2004 by Elaine McKewon. Wonderfully written, it contains a trove of rich factual detail that helped me bring to life Sandra’s experience of working in the brothels of Hay Street. The next Australian book you’ll read: I can’t wait to read See What I Have Done by Sarah Schmidt about the case of Lizzie Borden. History, the questions of causation and consequence inherent in criminal violence, and the strange human energy that lies in “the dark velvet” – how could I not want to read this? Jimmy Barnes Working Class Man Harper Collins Your book in your own words: Working Class Man is my second memoir and is a continuation of my story from where Working Class Boy left off. The book is really an attempt at explaining the impact of my childhood on myself and the ones I loved as an adult. In a lot of ways, this book is more what people would have been expecting from me first time round. It talks about the incredible highs – and believe me, I do mean highs – that I have reached in the world of rock’n’roll and the despicable lows that I came crashing down to. In this book I’ve tried not to use my childhood as an excuse for my behaviour but more look at the effects of growing up in poverty with alcoholism, violence and abuse, and how these conditions can affect the choices you make even when everything seems to be going your way. It is written in three parts. Part one follows my years with one of the best bands I’ve ever played with, Cold Chisel. We grew up together, travelling from one end of Australia to the other and everywhere in between. Along the way, we made some great music. In part two, I write about my struggles leaving that band and trying to build a career and life of my own, all the while running from my past. In the third part I can run no further and turn to face my demons. Ultimately, it’s a story of survival and, more importantly, a story about love. What you were reading when you wrote it: I was reading history books at the time I started writing this book, so they really didn’t influence what I was writing about except that maybe I was looking back. One of the books I was reading was The Scottish Enlightenment by Arthur Herman. The next Australian book you’ll read: I have two lined up, both written by friends of mine: Tex by Tex Perkins and Stuart Coupe, and Detours by Tim Rogers. Benjamin Law and Jenny Phang (his mum) Law School The Lifted Brow Your book in your own words (Benjamin): Six years ago, The Lifted Brow asked whether Mum and I would be keen on co-writing sex and relationships advice columns together – kind of like Dan Savage meets Amy Sedaris’ Sedaratives. We thought it was just a funny lark, but cut to six years later (and a lot of questions about masturbation, yeast infections, polyamory and general sexual batshittery), we’ve got enough for a hardcover book, accompanied with full-colour illustrations. It’s happily, awkwardly bizarre when I tell people about what we’ve made, but I grew up obsessed with sex (my family even called me Dr Sex growing up) and as a mother of five kids, Mum’s always been really frank about it. What you were reading when you wrote it: Oh I’ve always loved advice columns by Dan Savage (who makes a guest appearance as a fellow advice-giver in our book) and Cheryl Strayed. But really, this is less inspired by other writers and more inspired by the kinds of conversations my family has always had: urinary tract infections, vaginal discharge and our ongoing fascinating with DICKS (I have three sisters). The next Australian book you’ll read: Antony Dapiran is a Hong Kong-based Australian journalist who’s written a new Penguin classic on Hong Kong pro-democracy protests, which I’ve just started. As a Hong Kong Chinese-Australian guy myself, I’m feel invested in what’s going on there. Also really pumped for Brodie Lancaster’s memoir and essay collection, No Way, Okay Fine, and Omar Musa’s book of poetry. Michelle de Kretser The Life to Come Allen &amp; Unwin Your book in your own words: Taking place in Sydney, Sri Lanka and Paris, The Life to Come follows a loosely linked group of characters. It explores our flawed perceptions of other people and the way our understanding of the world shifts over time and according to changes in context. Like all my books, The Life To Come considers the relationship between individuals and their moments in history. It also examines the stories we tell and don’t tell about ourselves and our societies. It’s a character-driven novel in five separate sections that can be read completely independently of each other but that add up to more than their parts. I think it will make people laugh. I hope it will make them think. And I think it might make them cry. What you were reading when you wrote it: One of the books I was really impressed by was Another Life by the Soviet writer Yury Trifonov. It’s a wonderful novella set in midcentury Soviet Russia. The characters and their world are brilliantly rendered in the way that Russian novelists seem able to do almost effortlessly. It encouraged me to keep faith with character-based narrative. I took heart from reading it. The next Australian book you’ll read: I am going to read The Red Pearl, a collection of stories by Beth Yahp, which is her return to fiction after 25 years. I think she is a writer who takes risks formally and she’s interested in the intersection of the self and the political, as I am. Her writing is surprising and profound and I’m looking forward to discovering her all over again with this new book."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/sep/18/coalitions-media-package-to-benefit-selected-unis-but-doubts-over-funds-future","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-18T08:16:12Z","webTitle":"Coalition's media package to benefit 'selected' unis but doubts over fund's future","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/sep/18/coalitions-media-package-to-benefit-selected-unis-but-doubts-over-funds-future","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/sep/18/coalitions-media-package-to-benefit-selected-unis-but-doubts-over-funds-future","fields":{"headline":"Coalition's media package to benefit 'selected' unis but doubts over fund's future","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Selected universities will be able to benefit from the government’s $60m media innovation fund but there is no guarantee of the fund’s future beyond its slated three years. Details on the fund, which was established in exchange for Nick Xenophon’s support for the Turnbull government’s media changes, including scrapping the two-out-of-three ownership rule, have been scant, with equipment, scholarships and cadetships making up the package’s skeleton. But it is still to be fleshed out, with a spokeswoman for the communications minister, Mitch Fifield, confirming the $60.4m over three years will be in addition to the Australian Communications and Media Authority budget – but the government is yet to confirm where the money will come from. “Selected universities” will work in partnership with the government to award the regional journalism scholarships, which will make up about $2.4m of the total package. Fifield’s department will handle the cadetships, worth $8m, with the help of a to-be-established advisory committee, while ACMA will administer the $50m regional and small publishers innovation fund, with the help of an advisory committee. That fund is limited to small media companies with a turnover between $300,000 and $30m and will be capped at $1m per publisher. It cannot be used to employ journalists and excludes a list of companies, including Guardian Australia, due to restrictions on publishers with foreign parent companies. Xenophon said he aimed for the fund to be as “fair and wide reaching as possible” and would be talking to eligible publishers about how it could work in the near future. The hows and whens of how companies and universities can apply for a slice of the $60m is due to be released in the coming months. Labor is already looking into the future and wants to know what will happen in three years time when the fund agreement expires. “The future of public interest journalism inquiry shows that Nick Xenophon barely knows what problem he is trying to solve, let alone what the solution is,” the shadow communications minister, Michelle Rowland, said. “The danger is that, in three years, all we may have is a number of unemployed cadets and some obsolete equipment, with even higher concentration in what is already one of the most concentrated media markets in the world. “The Turnbull government barely admits it – they only talk in euphemisms about ‘dance partners’ – but the whole point of repealing the two out of three rule is to let dominant companies consolidate and cut costs. “This spells job losses, fewer journalists, less diversity in our news media voices and a disincentive to smaller players entering the market.” But that doesn’t mean Labor will commit to keeping the fund going beyond its stated lifespan. “Proposals of this nature need to be modelled, costed and impacts assessed before Labor would consider their merit,” Rowlands said. Administering the fund will form part of the incoming ACMA chair Nerida O’Loughlin’s job, who Fifield announced would serve a five-year-term. Richard Bean, who had been filling the chair since February last year, has been wished “the very best in his future endeavours” by the minister and was thanked for “successfully [leading] the ACMA through a sustained period of change”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/live/2017/sep/18/world-stock-markets-record-highs-eurozone-inflation-mark-carney-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-18T17:09:29Z","webTitle":"Carney warns fall in migrant workers could push up wages and inflation - as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/sep/18/world-stock-markets-record-highs-eurozone-inflation-mark-carney-business-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2017/sep/18/world-stock-markets-record-highs-eurozone-inflation-mark-carney-business-live","fields":{"headline":"Carney warns fall in migrant workers could push up wages and inflation - as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Stock markets have begun the week on a positive note, as investors shrugged off any lingering worries about geopolitical tensions and central bank actions. They seemed reassured that there were no further developments in the North Korea situation over the weekend, presumably on the basis that no news is good news. And despite the recent hints from the Bank of England that a UK rate rise could come as soon as November, new comments from Bank governor Mark Carney that any increases were likely to be gradual and limited saw the pound come of its recent highs. This in turn helped lift the FTSE 100, given that a weaker pound benefits exporters. European markets were also caught up in the optimism, while on on Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite all hit new record highs ahead of the latest Federal Reserve meeting. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 37.81 points or 0.52% at 7253.28 Germany’s Dax rose 0.32% to 12,559.39 France’s Cac climbed 0.3% to 5229.32 Italy’s FTSE MIB was 0.61% better at 22,364.74 Spain’s Ibex ended up 0.2% at 10,338.4 But in Greece, the Athens market fell 1.99% to 760.79 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 0.34% at 22,344 having earlier hit a new peak of 22,355. On that note, it’s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we’ll be back tomorrow. A sharp fall in migrant workers coming to Britain as a consequence of Brexit could push up wages and cause a spike in inflation in the short term, according to Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, writes my colleague Richard Partington. Setting out his view on inflation days after the Bank’s rate setting panel indicated it could raise the cost of borrowing for the first time in a decade, the governor said the rapid deceleration of migrant labour could lead to shortages for employers, pushing up wage growth and inflation in the short term. However, in the long-term, higher levels of immigration do not have an impact on wages or inflation, he said. In a speech in Washington, he said: “Abrupt decreases in migration could result in shortages in some sectors that have become reliant on migrant labour, and contribute more materially to inflationary pressures.” In the longer-term, “Brexit could therefore ultimately have only a modest impact on prices in general equilibrium.” Carney also warned that a fall in immigration in the wake of Brexit could push up wages and inflation: Abrupt decreases in migration could result in shortages in some sectors that have become reliant on migrant labour, and contribute more materially to inflationary pressures. In addition, the ease with which UK employers have been able to source labour from abroad and move operations offshore as a result of globalisation may have weighed on wage growth – though the size of such contestability effects is difficult to judge. Brexit is likely to push up inflation, Bank of England governor Mark Carney has said, as he repeated his view that interest rates were likely to rise in the coming months. But in his 2017 IMF Michel Camdessus Central Banking Lecture in Washington, he suggested rises would be limited, and he warned of risks to the UK economy. These comments have seen the pound slip back further against the dollar. Down 0.26% earlier, sterling has now fallen 0.54% against the dollar to $1.3518. Against the euro the pound is down 0.65% at €1.1302. Carney said: Any prospective increases in Bank Rate would be expected to be at a gradual pace and to a limited extent, and to be consistent with monetary policy continuing to provide substantial support to the economy. There remain considerable risks to the UK outlook, which include the response of households, businesses and financial markets to developments related to the process of EU withdrawal. The MPC will respond to these developments as they occur insofar as they affect the behaviour of households and businesses, and the outlook for inflation. On Brexit, Reuters reports: Carney, making a speech at the International Monetary Fund’s headquarters in Washington, said the process of globalisation that has led to deeper integration in the world economy in recent decades had pushed down price growth. But Brexit represented the opposite for Britain, at least in the short term, as less openness to foreign markets and workers was likely to push up inflation and reduce productivity, he said. “On balance, the de-integration effects of Brexit can be expected to ... be inflationary,” he said. “At present, the main question concerns the extent to which this adjustment has been brought forward.” ...In his speech on Monday, Carney also said Britain was unlikely to immediately offset any weakening of trade ties with its EU partners by striking new trade agreements with other countries. “But Brexit is an example of ‘reculer pour mieux sauter,’” Carney said, using a French expression which means stepping back in order to jump better Bank of England governor Mark Carney is set to give the 2017 Michel Camdessus Central Banking Lecture, and it can be viewed live here now. US markets continue to fly higher: The pound has slipped back against the dollar after last week’s rises in the wake of suggestions of a UK interest rate rise in November. Part of this is due to an uptick in the dollar ahead of this week’s US Federal Reserve meeting, and part to new concerns over Brexit. Sterling is currently 0.26% lower at $1.3556. Paresh Davdra, chief executive of RationalFX, said: The pound has moved lower against its peers ...following its surge on Friday. The pound remained strong over the weekend, still buoyed by investor anticipation of an interest rate rise later this year, but has cooled off as traders turn their attention to Prime Minister Theresa May’s speech on Europe, this Friday. Despite slipping against the dollar this morning, sterling is still much stronger than the weak levels seen in recent weeks. The pound may have also been weighed down slightly by the renewed political controversy over the ‘Britain will have £350m a week more to spend outside the EU’ claim from Foreign secretary Boris Johnson over the weekend. In the months since the election, political disunity has made traders cautious, therefore any suggestion of dissent within the government could slow the gains the pound could make off of the prospect of a rate rise. With the Prime Minister in Canada to discuss trade deals, analysts will be looking at more political drivers for the pound this week, in addition to data releases. With investors turning their attention to supposedly riskier assets such as shares, there have been some falls among the traditional havens. Gold fell to a two and a half week low of $1311 an ounce while among equities, there are also falls in defensive stocks like tobacco - Imperial Brands is down 2% - and water companies. Records are indeed being broken on Wall Street in early trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has climbed to a new peak of 22,332, up more than 0.22%, while the S&amp;P 500 is up 0.13% to a new high of 2,503. Easing tensions over North Korea are playing a part, while investors are awaiting the latest Federal Reserve meeting on Wednesday. European markets are holding on to their gains ahead of Wall Street opening shortly. The FTSE 100 is currently up 0.3%, while Germany’s Dax is 0.25% better and France’s Cac has climbed 0.16%. In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is forecast to open around 40 points higher. Over in Washington, IMF managing director Christine Lagarde is promising a new crackdown on corruption. Channelling Captain Renault in Casablanca, Lagarde is telling a Brookings Institution event that no-one should be shocked to learn that some public officials accept bribes, and that some companies are keen to offer them. Citing the “Panama Papers” revelations, Lagarde says the IMF can and will do more to tackle corruption. She warns: As we assist our members in fighting public corruption, we also are committed to looking at transnational private actors who influence public officials. Private actors may help generate corruption through direct means such as bribery, but they also can facilitate corruption through indirect means, such as money laundering and tax evasion. The recent example of the “Panama Papers” highlights the importance of these facilitators, and underscores the pernicious way corruption can quietly spread across borders. Increased transparency and accountability can help reduce corruption, Lagarde, adds, along with strengthening legal institutions to tackle wrongdoers.... The oddest story of the day is that tens of thousands of euros have been found the toilet at a Geneva branch of UBS. The discovery, a few months ago, has baffled Swiss prosecutors - especially as more euros were discovered clogging the pipes of near by restaurants too. Bloomberg has more details. The stock markets are increasingly being driven by greed this week, says CNN: That’s based on a series of metrics, including market volatility and demand for ‘put options’ (a right to sell at a certain price, which would be profitable if shares fell). The US stock market is expected to hit new highs when trading begins in two hours time. The S&amp;P 500 index is called up 0.2%, extending Friday’s rally, as anxiety over conflict in the Korean peninsula abates. Charalambos Pissouros, senior analyst at IronFX, says: “....as long as the situation does not escalate into military conflict, market participants may continue to place less and less emphasis on North Korean developments.” A reminder of how the markets have rallied strongly over the last 18 months..... British arms manufacturer BAE has jumped to the top of the FTSE 100 leaderboard this morning, after announcing a big sale to Qatar. BAE is selling 24 Eurofighter Typhoons to Qatar, in a deal which analysts reckon is worth over £1bn. Defence secretary Sir Michael Fallon says its a significant move: “This is an important moment in our defence relationship and the basis for even closer defence co-operation between our two countries.” It’s also an important moment in Qatar’s relationship with its neighbours. Three months ago, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Egypt all cut off diplomatic relations, accusing Doha of promoting terrorism. These Middle Eastern tensions could be good for business, as David Madden of CMC Markets explains: Last month, Goldman Sachs added the stock to its conviction buy list, citing Saudi Arabian contracts as the reason behind the move, and now they are selling to Qatar too. Here’s a chart showing how the MSCI All Country World Index hit a new record high this morning. The ACWI tracks 2,400 stocks in 47 countries, so gives a gauge of equity valuations around the globe. As you can see, it has more than doubled since 2009, when the financial crisis triggered a global recession. So what’s behind the recovery, and can it last? Here’s a few thoughts 1) Easy Money. Central banks fired up their electronic money printing presses when the crisis broke, creating hundreds of billions of new euros, dollars and pounds to buy assets and support the economy. The idea was to make encourage commercial banks to lend, and buy riskier assets, but these asset purchase schemes ended up driving bond and share prices to record levels. The European Central Bank (which started later) is still expanding its balance sheet, while the Bank of England isn’t close to unwinding QE. America’s Federal Reserve is further along the path to ending easy money, having started raising interest rates. That’s why Wednesday’s Fed meeting is so important, as it will signal how quickly or slowly it will proceed along this path. Rebecca O’Keeffe, head of investment at Interactive Investor, says: “Central banks have underpinned equity market valuations since the financial crisis, with excess liquidity and low interest rates both providing the stimulus and the foundations for higher valuations. What global central banks and in particular the Federal Reserve does next is therefore hugely important for investors. 2) Eurozone crisis fades from memory. Although Greece’s economy is still struggling, the prospect of European monetary union fracturing has receded over the last two years. S&amp;P’s decision to upgrade Portugal back to investment grade highlights how the eurozone economy, if not exactly booming, is looking much healthier. 3) China hasn’t suffered a hard landing (yet). Economists have been warning for years that China’s economy is riddled with bad debt, and that its shadow banking sector is going to implode. Beijing, though, seems to be succeeding in curbing the worst excesses without hurting growth. 4) Global economy is still growing. Despite shocks such as Donald Trump’s presidency, and the Brexit vote, the world economy is still managing steady if unspectacular growth. The IMF predicts that global gross domestic product would rise by 3.5% this year, and by 3.6%. That should support corporate profits, and thus share prices (which ought to reflect a company’s earnings potential). 5) Geopolitical worries recede. Markets have notoriously short memories, so the recent dialling down of rhetoric between North Korea and @RealDonaldTrump is also helping to nudge shares higher. Yesterday. US secretary of state Rex Tillerson said American hopes that a “peaceful pressure” campaign will succeed in denuclearizing North Korea. That sort of diplomatic jaw-jaw tends to reassure investors.... So, 10 years after the financial crisis, what should we worry about? BIS, the organisation for central bankers, gave us a clue last night. It warned that global growth could stumble once interest rates start to rise. This is the ‘punch bowl’ worry - that the markets are intoxicated on cheap credit, and will slump onto the carpet when it’s taken away. BIS’s Claudio Borio fears that the world could be caught in a debt trap, saying: Debt service ratios are only so low because interest rates have been falling so much. There is a certain circularity in all this that points to the risk of a debt trap: the protracted decline in interest rates to unusually low levels, regardless of the strength of the underlying economy, creates the conditions that complicate their subsequent return to more normal levels. Just in: Prices across the eurozone rose by 1.5% per year last month, up from 1.3% in July, stats body Eurostat says. That confirms the ‘flash’ reading from two weeks ago, and means inflation is still below the ECB’s goal of close to, but below, 2%. Energy prices rose by 4%, while services costs picked by by 1.6% and food prices gained 1.4%. That ripping noise you can hear is HSBC tearing up its sterling forecasts. The bank has ditched its forecast that the pound would have hit $1.20 by the end of 2017, and languished there through 2018. Now it believes sterling will cling onto today’s $1.35, and only slide slightly next year. Quite a change, triggered by last week’s signals from the Bank of England that interest rates could rise in November. Meanwhile, the pound is slipping back from Friday’s one-year high. Sterling is down almost half a cent at $1.354, having surged last week when the Bank of England dropped several clanging hints that interest rates are going up soon. Traders are looking to prime minister Theresa May’s upcoming Europe speech on Friday, for signs that the UK is heading towards a hard or soft Brexit. They’re also watching the unfolding row between Boris Johnson and the UK’s statistics offices, after the foreign secretary reheated the idea that Britain will have £350m to spend on the NHS every week after Brexit. The markets are also benefitting from optimism that Portugal is putting the eurozone debt crisis behind it. Portugal’s bond prices have hit a one-year high this morning, after credit rating agency Standard &amp; Poor’s upgraded the country back to investment grade. Lisbon’s stock market has surged by 1.8%. Britain’s FTSE 100 is also clawing back some of last week’s losses (triggered by the stronger pound). It’s up 31 points at 7246, having hit a five-month low on Friday. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says: Having been battered in the wake of last week’s sterling super surge, the FTSE is using a quiet Monday morning to claw back some of its losses. Precious metals producers Randgold and Fresnillo are the biggest fallers, down around 1%, as traders move into riskier assets. European stock markets have joined the rally, sending the Stoxx 600 index up to a six-week high. Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, agrees that investors are focused on Wednesday’s Federal Reserve meeting. Upbeat U.S. inflation data was not enough to move markets’ expectations of an interest rate hike in December. The odds for an interest rate hike by the end of year stands at 56%, according to CME’s FedWatch; whether this is about to change on Wednesday, relies on the Fed dot plot and Chair Janet Yellen’s speech. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. World stock markets have hit a new alltime high this morning, as traders regain their appetite for risky assets. The City is relieved that we’ve not seen any fresh missile tests from North Korea in recent days, taking the risk of nuclear war off traders’ minds. Investors are also preparing for a crucial US central bank meeting on Wednesday. The Federal Reserve is expected to leave interest rates unchanged, and give more guidance on how it will unwind its massive bond-purchase programme. Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services says some Fed policymakers, such as Lael Brainard, may signal that US interest rates will only rise modestly. Markets anticipate that the Fed will keep rates unchanged (with a December rate hike now seen as 50/50), but announce that it will commence balance sheet reduction at a pace of $10bn per month in Q4. The statement will doubtless keep the option of a December rate hike clearly on the table, but markets will as ever hone in on the ‘dot plot’, with many expecting the likes of Brainard to perhaps adjust their trajectory lower Anything that keep the era of easy money alive is good for share prices. So, the MSCI’s All Country World Index has nudged a new peak of 485.82 this morning, as traders pile back into equities. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets reckons the markets may be getting ‘desensitised’ to the North Korean issue. Short of shots being fired, these tensions are likely to have fairly short term and short lived effects, which helps explain the positive start to the week for Asia shares this morning which in turn is likely to lead to a positive start to this week’s European trading session. Indeed, stock markets in Asia are at their highest level in a decade today. South Korea’s Kospi closed at a six-week high, led by tech shares, and Thailand is also rallying. European stock markets are following suit, gaining around 0.5% at the start of trading: Traders will also we watching out for updated eurozone inflation figures, and a speech from Bank of England governor Mark Carney this afternoon. Here’s the agenda: 10am BST: The final eurozone inflation reading for August. They’re expected to confirm that prices rose by 1.5% last month, up from 1.3% in July, but still below the European Central Bank’s target of just below 2%. 4pm BST: Bank of England governor Mark Carney delivers the 2017 Michel Camdessus Central Banking Lecture in Washington DC. Investors will be looking for any fresh clues about future UK interest rate rises, but Carney may address an issue with more global appeal...."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/sep/19/they-are-victims-the-indonesians-jailed-in-australia-and-their-five-year-legal-battle","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-18T18:01:12Z","webTitle":"'They are victims': the Indonesian minors jailed in Australia and their five-year legal battle","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/sep/19/they-are-victims-the-indonesians-jailed-in-australia-and-their-five-year-legal-battle","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/sep/19/they-are-victims-the-indonesians-jailed-in-australia-and-their-five-year-legal-battle","fields":{"headline":"'They are victims': the Indonesian minors jailed in Australia and their five-year legal battle","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"For Indonesian lawyer Lisa Hiariej, taking on the Australian government has been a bit like waiting for Godot. It is almost five years since she decided to take legal action on behalf of 115 Indonesians she alleges were wrongly incarcerated as minors in adult prisons and detention centres across Australia. In that time, not once has a government representative showed up to meet her about the case. At first, Hiariej says, she sought compensation through mediation but, after repeated summons were denied, and a FoI request rejected, she decided to take the government to court, suing it for $103m in a class action lodged in Indonesia. Somewhat improbably, the central Jakarta district court agreed to hear the case but at each hearing since February “the Australians” have failed to show. In May, a letter detailing the “doctrine of sovereign immunity” was delivered in court before Hiariej arrived. Drafted by a Jakarta law firm, the letter suggested the Australian government agencies being sued again had no intention of appearing. The case comes to court again on Tuesday. “September 19 is the last call for the Australians,” Hiariej told the Guardian from a Jakarta cafe. “But even if they don’t come the trial will continue, with or without them.” Hiariej argues her clients were minors and were lured into working as crew on boats ferrying asylum seekers to Australia. Once arrested by Australian authorities, she says, they were subject to controversial and since discredited x-ray tests that incorrectly determined they were adults. At the time Australia adhered to a policy that members of people-smuggling crews found to be minors should be returned home. Instead, Hiariej says, her clients were detained for between six months and almost three years, 34 in adult jails and 81 in detention centres. The youngest, she says, having chased down all their birth certificates, was only 14. Hiariej is suing four government agencies for compensation – the Australian federal police, the Department of Immigration and Border Protection, the commonwealth director of public prosecutions and the attorney general’s department. The Australian foreign affairs department said in a statement it respected the Indonesian judicial system but did not recognise the court’s jurisdiction in the matter and would make no further comment: “In accordance with established legal principles, Australia has advised the court that as a sovereign state, its agencies are not subject to the jurisdiction of the court.” Hiariej says her clients should not be treated as people-smugglers. “They are victims, not criminals,” she says. “OK, they broke the law against people-smuggling. Yes, but they didn’t know what they were doing. They are uneducated, you know, some can read, some can’t. They are really super poor. Why didn’t Australia just let them go?” Hiariej argues that her clients, mostly from parts of Indonesia’s underdeveloped east, such as West Timor and its surrounds, were tricked into working for people-smuggling syndicates, told they would be ferrying tourists or transporting goods and sometimes offered the equivalent of six months’ pay. Faisal Arysad, now 25, was 15 when he accepted an offer of Rp15 million, more than half a year’s pay, to ferry “tourists” from his home town of Kupang to Java. Intercepted en route, he was taken to a detention centre in Darwin, where an x-ray test showed he was an adult. “They [the authorities] said, ‘If you are really underage, where are your documents to prove it? You can say anything you like but we need proof.’” Arysad was then transferred to Arthur Gorrie jail in Brisbane. “I was scared,” he says, “I cried for a week straight. I just wanted to go home. I woke up every morning and cried.” In the nine months that Arysad was detained, his lawyer had travelled to Kupang to obtain his birth certificate. When it was shown to the court and his true age was revealed, Arysad was told he was going home. Days before she is due back in court, Hiariej reels off other details of the case in rapid fire, appearing at once exhausted and energised by a recent ruling she believes could have strong bearing on her claims. In late July the court of appeal in Western Australia ruled that charges against Indonesian national Ali Jasmin constituted a “miscarriage of justice” and the x-ray tests used to determine his age and subsequent incarceration were “inappropriate, inaccurate and misleading”. It is now believed Jasmin was only 13 when he was picked up by the Australian navy on an asylum seeker boat in 2009. After pleading guilty to charges of people-smuggling, he spent almost three years in Perth’s maximum security Hakea prison. Jasmin is not her client but Hiariej believes that, if a court can deem his treatment unjust, the same x-rays tests that led to her clients’ detention should be viewed in the same light. Hiariej was born in Indonesia but is a permanent resident in Australia. It was a 2012 visit to one of her clients at Sydney’s Silverwater jail that led her into this uncertain legal battle. Working with an Australian law firm, she was representing an Indonesian man charged with people-smuggling who claimed that an Indonesian minor, Muhammad Rasid, had been wrongfully detained in the same jail. She met Rasid and four others soon afterwards at Villawood detention centre, where they had been transferred while they waited for their flights home to be arranged. “It was their idea to bring it to the court,” she says. “They found out that they were not in the wrong, that they were under age and that is why they were going home.” Hiariej agreed to help and from there her new clients rallied, contacting all the other Indonesians they believed had been wrongly detained. Before she knew it, her client list had ballooned from five to 115. Working pro bono, Hiariej says she has poured $100,000 of her savings into the case because she believes in their fight. Many have been traumatised by being held alongside convicted murderers, paedophiles and drug dealers, she says. One minor, she says, was particularly terrified after sharing a cell in Blacktown jail with a man who had murdered his whole family. “He was in that same room and he couldn’t sleep,” she says. “He was just thinking, ‘Oh my god, maybe he will kill me.’ That was very stressful for him.” Another allegedly returned home only to find his family had already performed his burial rites. Because he had been gone so long, they believed he had died at sea. If Hiariej wins the case, the $1.3m in compensation will be divided up. Even a relatively small amount for each client will go a long way in Indonesia, providing much-needed financial help for them to finish school or start a small business. “I just want justice for them,” she says. “If I don’t fight for them, who will?” • On 20 September 2017 this article was amended to correct the amount sought by the class action."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/sep/19/leeds-burnley-chris-wood","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-19T09:00:13Z","webTitle":"Leeds looking forward to cup reunion with Burnley’s Chris Wood","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/sep/19/leeds-burnley-chris-wood","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/sep/19/leeds-burnley-chris-wood","fields":{"headline":"Leeds looking forward to cup reunion with Burnley’s Chris Wood","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"With Romelu Lukaku scoring against Everton and Wayne Rooney receiving a generous ovation from fans of Manchester United, this week has already seen two top-flight strikers make notable returns to their former clubs and it promises to bring a third, as Burnley’s Chris Wood prepares to face Leeds United, the club he left 29 days ago, in the Carabao Cup on Tuesday night. It is a little over three months since Wood was named Leeds’s player of the year. In all he scored 30 goals last season, earning a reputation as one of the most feared forwards outside the Premier League and a summer move for a fee of around £15m. By then he had played a minor part in the Yorkshire side’s success this season as well, appearing in their first three league matches and contributing a goal and an assist in the 3-2 win over Bolton Wanderers on the opening day. Leeds went on to maintain their unbeaten start until Saturday, when they lost 1-0 at Millwall, but remain top of the Championship, if only on goal difference. Thomas Christiansen, the Leeds manager, said “perhaps there will be some changes” to his side for the cup tie and the same is surely true of Burnley. Sean Dyche made eight when they beat Blackburn Rovers 2-0 in the second round, when Wood came on as a substitute in the first half. “If he plays and I see him I will say hello to him, like other players,” said Christiansen of the striker. “He’s started well in his team. If he plays we know which type of player he is, and he knows our team.” Whether Wood is picked or not there is a strong chance of Leeds fans recognising some of their opponents. Another member of the team who narrowly missed out on the play-offs last season, the left-back Charlie Taylor, moved to Turf Moor on a free transfer in the summer, while the striker Sam Vokes played eight league games for the club in 2009 during a period on loan from Wolverhampton Wanderers. “That’s football, players come and go,” said the Leeds winger Stuart Dallas when asked about the potential reunions. “It will be good to come up against them and I’m sure that will give us extra motivation, as it will do for them as well. I’m sure they’ll be looking to get one over on us. But we’ve got to show them that, though they’ve gone to the Premier League, maybe they’ve made the wrong choice.” Leeds’s success this season is particularly impressive given how heavily they relied on their departed striker in the last campaign. Wood’s 27 league goals constituted 44.26% of Leeds’s total, considerably more than any other player in the division. His goals won a total of 23 points, again by some margin the most in the league. Christiansen has criticised the tactics employed by Garry Monk last season for being unhealthily over-reliant on their New Zealand forward. Notably while last season only eight Leeds players scored more than once in the league, just eight games into this campaign five have already achieved that feat. “We were disappointed he left but there’s more to life than Chris Wood,” Dallas said. “I don’t mean that in a bad way but the players we’ve brought in are more than capable of doing what he did last year. Everybody’s looking in the right direction. When he left, that was it. When you leave, you’re nothing to us.Woody was a big player for us last year but with him going new lads have come in. this year we’re getting goals from all over the place. Last season we depended a lot on Woody and he carried us a bit in games. This season everybody’s chipping in and that can only be a good thing.” In analysing Manchester United’s 4-0 win over Everton on Sunday, in which Rooney and Lukaku featured, Danny Murphy spoke about the difficulty of facing former sides, asserting that “to go back to your old club is very tough, mentally”. It is a challenge that Wood must be getting used to. At 25 he already has nine former employers, five of whom were in the Championship last season. He has, for example, a goal and an assist in three games against Ipswich since his loan spell there in 2015; four goals in seven games against Birmingham City since he played there in the 2011-12 season, and five in as many games against Bristol City since his time there ended in May 2012. Nor is facing Leeds going to be a novelty: he has already played against them six times, for five different clubs, scoring once, though never before with close friends and former team-mates in their ranks. “I don’t need to explain how good Woody is, he showed that last year,” Dallas said. “First and foremost he’s a good lad. He was good to have about the place and he’s still a good friend but when we step over the line, whether he’s playing or not, we’re enemies for a night.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"media/2017/sep/19/stonkingly-good-finds-increasingly-rare-says-antiques-roadshow-veteran","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-18T23:01:01Z","webTitle":"'Stonkingly good' finds increasingly rare, says Antiques Roadshow veteran","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/sep/19/stonkingly-good-finds-increasingly-rare-says-antiques-roadshow-veteran","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2017/sep/19/stonkingly-good-finds-increasingly-rare-says-antiques-roadshow-veteran","fields":{"headline":"'Stonkingly good' finds increasingly rare, says Antiques Roadshow veteran","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The dream of every Antiques Roadshow fan is to be that lucky person who dusts off an object from the attic that turns out to be worth hundreds of thousands of pounds – or more. However, these moments of TV gold are likely to become even rarer, according to one of the show’s veteran experts. David Battie, a ceramics specialist who appeared on the first episode of the show in 1978, admitted it was getting more difficult to unearth treasures, given how long the show had been running. “There are definitely fewer really stonkingly good objects on the Roadshow, which is inevitable, given we’ve been going for 40 years, sucking them in like a vacuum cleaner,” he told Radio Times magazine. Over the years there have been some memorable moments such as the vase a woman bought at a car boot sale for £1 that turned out to be worth £30,000 and a vase used as a goalpost that ended up selling for £668,000. A forthcoming episode in the new series will feature one of the most significant finds in the show’s history. During filming in June, jewellery expert Geoffrey Munn valued an intricate Fabergé ornament at about £1m. Despite being on the show since the beginning, it was not until 2010 that Battie made a big discovery when a man brought in a large Chinese bronze vase. He dated it to the Yuan dynasty. At more than 700 years old, it was the oldest bronze to be featured on the Antiques Roadshow. He said while extremely rare objects such as that were getting more difficult to unearth, they were still out there. “We’re lucky in that in this country that we have more antiques per square foot than anywhere in the world, so I think we have a way to go yet,” he said. Asked about other memorable moments from his near 40 years on the show, he said a woman once left him a coffee can and saucer from her full service that was dated from about 1800. “She’d left it to me in her will, saying that because I was so kind and enthusiastic, she’d like me to have a piece when she died. It sits on a shelf in my bedroom and is one of my very favourite things,” Battie said. In the interview, he also discussed his admiration for the show’s presenter, BBC newsreader Fiona Bruce. “I think Fiona is wonderful,” Battie said. “Early in her tenure I wrote her a doggerel love poem in the style of the poets I liked, from Edward Lear to Dylan Thomas. She was probably horrified.” Battie trained as a graphic designer at art school before working for Reader’s Digest magazine for three years. He joined Sotheby’s auction house in 1965 and was later appointed a director of the company. He retired in 1999 and as well as appearing on the Antiques Roadshow he lectures and writes."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/sep/18/ana-carrasco-first-woman-motorcycle-champion","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-18T17:00:49Z","webTitle":"Ana Carrasco becomes first woman to win solo championship motorcycle race","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/sep/18/ana-carrasco-first-woman-motorcycle-champion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/sep/18/ana-carrasco-first-woman-motorcycle-champion","fields":{"headline":"Ana Carrasco becomes first woman to win solo championship motorcycle race","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Ana Carrasco became the first woman to win an individual world championship motorcycle race on Sunday in Portugal. The 20-year-old Spaniard, riding a Kawasaki Ninja 300, found a draft on the final stretch to overtake Yamaha riders Alfonoso Coppola (by 0.053sec) and Marc García (0.062) in round 10 of the FIM Supersport 300 World Championship. The dramatic end to the 11-lap race at the Autodromo Internacional do Algarve lifted Carrasco to seventh in the overall standings with two races to go. Coppola moved top of the table with the runner-up finish with García dropping to second. Carrasco, who started riding motorcycles when she was three, debuted in international competition as a 16-year-old on the Moto3 circuit in 2013, when she became the first woman to score points in a world championship race since Katja Poensgen in 2001. She joined the European Moto2 series in 2016, before moving to World Supersport 300, a lower-tier series formed this season to provide opportunities for promising riders. “I am very happy about this result,” Carrasco told World SBK. “I want to share it with all my team.

My father’s phone call telling me the news remains the most shocking moment of my life. Colleagues brought me tissues and queued up to tell me they were sorry. I took the tissues, but I couldn’t really talk. Later, I met a friend for a drink. We had a bottle of wine and a bowl of chips. Nobody tells you what to do when your sibling dies. I was 36. My sister was 41. My sister just collapsed and died. It felt surreal. It still feels surreal. It’s 17 years since she died. Two years later, my father died. My mother died just before Christmas last year. I have a well-practised strategy for grief. Just shove it right out of your head. It was working pretty well until, two weeks ago, I picked up a memoir called Small Pieces by the poet and author Joanne Limburg. By the end of it, I was in pieces, a howling wreck on a sofa, feeling that something had been unleashed that I could not put back. Limburg was 38 when her uncle phoned to tell her that her brother, Julian, who was two years younger, had killed himself. “He said: ‘I think you’d better sit down,’” she tells me at her house in Cambridge. “‘I’ve got some terrible news.’” She puts down her mug and sighs. “I’m feeling physically sick, saying it again. When I put the phone down, and phoned my husband, Chris, I was just walking up and down, saying ‘this is ridiculous, this is ridiculous’. It undermined reality, somehow. It makes no sense and never will.” “There’s before and there’s after,” writes Limburg in the book, “before and after my brother’s suicide”, the “point of fracture in my world”. What he did “sent out cracks in all directions – all the way through the family story, past and future”. Before her brother’s suicide, there was her father’s death. After, there was her mother’s death. If that sounds grim, it can’t be helped. Small Pieces is beautiful, incredibly moving and, at times, extremely funny. When I finished it, I knew I had to meet its author. I don’t know all that many people who have lost three members of their immediate family. It can feel like a slightly embarrassing pile-up of grief. There are many moments of embarrassment in Limburg’s book. There’s the moment when, having flown across the Atlantic to console Julian’s widow and daughter, they are politely asked to leave. There’s the small talk with the neighbours and friends who are asked to look after them, “a marathon coffee morning with just the occasional break here and there for a bout of hysterical grief”. There’s the colleague of Julian’s who uses the wake as an opportunity to boast about his own writing. Limburg grimaces when I bring this up. “Someone,” she says, “once tried to do business with my cousin at her mother’s funeral. Nobody,” she adds, “knows what to do.” And that’s without all the practical stuff: the food, the flowers, the ashes. When I went to pick up the sandwiches for my sister’s wake, M&amp;S had lost the order. I had to beg them to find some because I couldn’t tell my mother. “Those things are such a shock, aren’t they?” says Limburg. “I talk in the book after my mum’s death about the difficulty I had getting her body released so we could have it buried before Jewish new year.” Limburg’s Judaism is central to the book, the faith of her forebears and her family. The book has the subtitle A Book of Lamentations, and is punctuated with questions about Jewish theology in a sometimes ironic juxtaposition of the horrors of life and the supposed goodness of God. Limburg stopped going to synagogue after a traumatic miscarriage, but her Judaism, she says, just won’t go away. “It became clear to me as I was writing, how tangled up my mother and my brother and my community and my childhood are with Judaism. I thought, well, I could try to extricate it, or I could acknowledge that it runs all the way through. Intellectually, I don’t believe in God, but I feel that God is still there for me, as a kind of metaphor.” Another parallel, I tell her. I was brought up as a practising Anglican, but ditched church for Camus and Sartre when I was 13. At 14, I went to a youth club, to meet boys. Unfortunately, it was attached to a Baptist church and I became an evangelical Christian. I lost my faith, dramatically, when I was 26, but I’m still moved by the poetry of the Bible and the beauty of church music and hymns. “Religion,” says Limburg, “gives me this lovely stock of images and metaphors. You can use them to express feelings. The fact that they’re common cultural property means that you’re not alone. That,” she adds, “is a huge consolation.” But the main consolation, it’s clear, is writing. Limburg has published four poetry collections, a historical novel and a memoir about her obsessive-compulsive disorder, The Woman Who Thought Too Much. At the start of Small Pieces, she quotes some scribbled notes, taken on the plane to her brother’s wake, which are, she says, “a clear indication” that she would break the vow she had made not to make “creative capital” out of her brother’s death. It’s a vow she just couldn’t keep. Writing, she says in a letter to the rabbi she met just after Julian’s death, “is how I process my grief”. It started, she explains, with poems she could not stop, and then with a PhD. “I was looking,” she says, “at grief and complicated grief, and sibling relationship, and trauma.” It was only after her mother died that she felt set free to write it. Because it’s still only months since my mother died, her descriptions of her mother’s last days in hospital nearly finished me off. “There are just a few memoirs by bereaved siblings,” Limburg says, “and even fewer by siblings bereaved by suicide. Quite often the other person was the difficult one.” That was certainly true in my family. Although my sister did not kill herself, she did have schizophrenia and a troubled life. “But,” says Limburg, “I was the fuck-up. Ultimately, I got a diagnosis of Asperger’s and I was aware that my brother had grown up with this sibling that wasn’t quite right. I had guilt because I felt my brother was a more useful person than me, and as if our family was a balloon debate, and I was the one who should have jumped.” I gasp. I want to cry. But Limburg gives a wry smile. She is, she says, learning to live with her guilt. And humour, it’s clear from the book, is one of the things that has got her through. “There’s a phrase,” she says, “‘the situation is hopeless, but not serious’. That’s how I see life, and all these things that are just dreadful. If you don’t laugh at them, you would curl up in a heap and wail.” Yes, you would, and sometimes you do. Mostly, I don’t. Since my mother died, I haven’t looked at photos or read any of her letters. The time will come to do these things, but I can’t do them now. I still find it a struggle with my sister and my father, and that was a long time ago. At least with a parent, the death is in the right order. “Yes,” says Limburg, “it’s in the correct order. But my brother and I will never be reconciled to it, because it absolutely shouldn’t have happened.” I think that’s realistic. I think that’s right. People talk about “closure”, as if death is a court case that can be dismissed. So what is the best you can aim at? Limburg takes a sip of her coffee and sighs. “Living with,” she says. “I see it as: you shoulder your burden and you carry on.” In the UK, the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123.

The defeat by Pakistan in the Champions Trophy semi-finals was such a shock but it doesn’t seem to have done any medium-term damage. Jonny Bairstow gets a lovely reception from his team-mates as he walks off; there seems to be a huge amount of goodwill towards him. So, England lead 1-0 with four to play and the West Indies will need to play in the qualifying tournament for the 2019 World Cup. The next match is on Thursday at Trent Bridge. See you then! 30.5 overs: England 210-3 (Bairstow 100, Stokes 23) Ben Stokes finishing the match in style, lifting Nurse for six to end on 23 not out from 10 balls. Bairstow crunches Nurse through extra cover for three to reach his maiden hundred! It’s been a high-class innings, and he celebrates with a vigorous punch of the air. All the England team are on their feet applauding, including Jason Roy. Jonny be very, very good these days, and he has a great chance to establish himself at the top of the order. 30th over: England 199-3 (Bairstow 97, Stokes 15) Bairstow slices Williams through backward point for four before taking a slow single - there haven’t been many of those in his innings - to move to 96. Another single off the penultimate delivery of the over leaves him three away. Stokes then crashes the last ball down the ground for six! 29th over: England 186-3 (Bairstow 91, Stokes 8) Bairstow works Nurse for a single to move into the nineties. Another single takes him to within nine runs of a maiden ODI century, six years since that memorable cameo on debut against India. 28th over: England 183-3 (Bairstow 89, Stokes 7) Ben Stokes edges his first ball wide of the solitary slip for a single and then, off the final delivery, chips a slower, low full toss just over the head of Williams for four. England need 22 to win. Eoin Morgan’s poor form continues. He pushed indecisively at a back-of-length delivery from Williams, unsure whether to defend or glide, and ended up thin-edging through to the keeper Shai Hope. 27th over: England 174-2 (Bairstow 88, Morgan 10) Nurse returns to the attack and beats Bairstow with a quicker one. He has been the pick of the West Indies bowlers by a fair way. 26th over: England 172-2 (Bairstow 86, Morgan 8) Bairstow cuffs Williams through extra cover for three, which makes this his highest ODI score. He could barely have wished for a more successful or comfortable start to his extended residence at the top of the order. I forgot to plug this earlier, by the way - a fresh bit of spicy Beef. 25th over: England 165-2 (Bairstow 82, Morgan 6) “Root’s accumulation reminds me of the story of a cricketer who sold his soul to the devil so as to have a steady professional career as a batsman,” says John Starbuck. “Not wanting to draw undue attention, he is guaranteed a 50 but no more each time, so he usually gets out in the mid-40s. After a long county career, he is selected for England, but ends up as one of the last two against Australia needing a very few runs. Everything he tries to do to get no 11 to score fails, so after being on 50 for a long time, he finally scores the winning run. He never scores a run again in any form of the game and all because Lucifer doesn’t understand the concept of the leg-bye.” That sounds like the concept for a choose-your-own-adventure book by Vic Marks. 24th over: England 159-2 (Bairstow 82, Morgan 1) The new batsman is Eoin Morgan. He’s scored 12 runs in his last seven innings, all in T20 cricket. In an unlikely development, we have a wicket. Root, cramped for room by a shortish delivery by the new bowler Williams, pings it down onto the stumps. 23rd over: England 152-1 (Bairstow 79, Root 52) Root pulls Taylor for two to reach a 49-ball half-century full of unobtrusive class. He is now also the leading runscorer since the last World Cup. England have 19 overs to score 53 runs; they are going to thrash West Indies. 22nd over: England 146-1 (Bairstow 79, Root 46) Too short from Bishoo, and Root cracks a pull through wide mid-on for four. This is a poor over from Bishoo, with Bairstow slapping consecutive short balls to the boundary. Fifteen from the over! In an unrelated development, has anyone read the Chris Lewis book? Any good? 21st over: England 131-1 (Bairstow 71, Root 39) A miserable short ball from the returning Taylor is slapped over cover for four by Bairstow. That brings up a 98-ball hundred partnership, the video of which should be used as a coaching aid. The running in particular has been close to perfect. 20th over: England 126-1 (Bairstow 67, Root 38) Bairstow rocks back to pull Bishoo down the ground for four and steers thje next ball to the third-man boundary for good measure. His highest ODI score to date is that feelgood, series-winning 83 not out against New Zealand in 2015. He’ll kick himself, perhaps literally, if he doesn’t get a maiden ODI ton tonight. 19th over: England 114-1 (Bairstow 57, Root 36) Joe Root’s career average (in all positions, not just No3) is creeping towards 50. Only Jonathan Trott has a better record for England. It’ll never happen, and I don’t blame him one bit for keeping his thoughts to himself, but I would love to hear an honest, detailed explanation from Root about why he’s so reluctant to bat at No3 in the Test team. It’s a fascinating subject. 18th over: England 108-1 (Bairstow 56, Root 31) I suspect that Bairstow and Root’s intelligence and ability have made batting look much easier against the spinners than is actually the case, because the ball is turning a fair bit now. The moment I type that, Bairstow misses a monstrous heave at a big legspinner from Bishoo and survives a stumping referral. 17th over: England 106-1 (Bairstow 55, Root 30) On Sky, Mike Atherton is talking about how nice it is for Joe Root to take a break from the captaincy when he’s in the ODI side. Ian Ward: “When you’re captain of England, how much of your energy goes into looking after other people and all the other things that go with the job?” Mike Atherton: “You don’t realise how much until it’s almost too late, when you’re so wasted in terms of your energy and tiredness that it hits you all at once.” That, I hope you’ll agree, is a lovely insight into the strains of captaining England. 16th over: England 99-1 (Bairstow 51, Root 29) Bairstow works Bishoo to the third-man boundary to reach an accomplished, mature half-century from 52 balls. Well played indeed. “I don’t think there is enough cricket,” sniffs Ian Copestake. “An aggressive all-year-round strategy should be pursued so we are not in thrall to the Premiership. Put a roof on Lord’s an all.” 15th over: England 94-1 (Bairstow 47, Root 28) Nurse is starting to get some fairly sharp turn, though England are so far ahead of the game that it’s unlikely to make much difference. 14th over: England 92-1 (Bairstow 46, Root 27) Bishoo continues. Root reaches a long way outside off to belt a sweep between midwicket and mid-on for four. That was a great shot. This looks so easy for England. “Interesting that you mention Root being forever 21,” says Adam Roberts. “I was considering the other day how the older I get, the less perspective I have on the length of a sportsman’s career. So until recently I still thought of Rooney as the SFN (Spud Faced Nipper) and Justin Rose had just turned pro. And what a shock to see footage from 2012 of new Test players Bairstow and Roach. It’s the sporting equivalent of policemen looking younger.” Indeed. It also increases the admiration for people who successfully manage young sportsmen past their 60th and even 70th birthday. 13th over: England 84-1 (Bairstow 43, Root 22) An excellent over from Nurse, who troubles Bairstow with a biggish offspinner and then beats him on the outside with a quicker one. “Occasionball boundary?” says John Starbuck, highlighting the typo in the 11th over. “That’s quite good and worth using again, but it does indicate you are hosting the spirit of James Joyce.” I’ve definitely had worse typos. One in particular, at 5am during the 2009-10 tour of Bangladesh, still haunts my dreams. Why did Shakib have to play the cut shot? 12th over: England 82-1 (Bairstow 42, Root 21) Devendra Bishoo comes into the attack, or rather the defence. There’s no sense that a wicket is imminent, never mind the nine they need to win this match. The fifty partnership comes up from 44 deliveries. Most of those runs have been scampered rather than biffed; it’s been a performance of low-key excellence. “It will be interesting to see how the next generation of spinners get on,” says John Starbuck. “It’s long been a truism that a wrist spinner will get you more wickets, but also that they’ll cost more runs. If you aim to get control over batsmen rather than attack them, the choice is simple and down to (the captain’s) team temperament.” Are you saying we should start a nationwide search for the new John Emburey? 11th over: England 76-1 (Bairstow 37, Root 20) England are killing West Indies softly, with single after single after single and just the occasionball boundary - like that from Root, reverse swept friskily off the bowling of Nurse. 10th over: England 69-1 (Bairstow 36, Root 14) Six singles from Williams’ second over. This has been a clinic in running between the wickets from Bairstow and Root. Nothing wrong with their dot-ball ratios! We should call them the milkmen. 9th over: England 63-1 (Bairstow 33, Root 11) The offspinner Ashley Nurse’s second ball is lashed through the covers for four by Bairstow, who is batting really well. Roy provided a short, sharp shock at the top of the order; Bairstow has the look of somebody who wants to bat 40 overs and make 140. 8th over: England 56-1 (Bairstow 26, Root 10) Kesrick Williams replaces Jason Holder. He was impressive in the T20 on Saturday, though he’s currently nursing an ODI bowling average of 138. Make that 147 after an expensive first over that includes a tickle to the fine-leg boundary from Bairstow. 7th over: England 47-1 (Bairstow 19, Root 9) Jonny Bairstow is 28 next week. When did that happen? He does look ready to go to the next level, certainly as a Test batsman and maybe in ODIs too. Meanwhile Joe Root, who will forever be 21 years old, pulls Taylor just over the head of short fine leg for four. England are cruising and need 158 from 35 overs. 6th over: England 38-1 (Bairstow 15, Root 4) Root survives a dodgy drop-and-run, with the bowler Holder’s throw missing the stumps at the non-striker’s end. Root and Bairstow are generally brilliant between the wickets, so it’s no surprise that there’s a single from every delivery in that over. “Would Rashid have been picked if it had been a hotter summer like, say, 1976?” asks Matthew Doherty. I don’t think so, no. They picked Dawson and Crane as well as Moeen, so I think it’s fair to assume his Test career is over. 5th over: England 32-1 (Bairstow 12, Root 1) The new batsman is Joe Root. He may not want to bat No3 in Tests but in ODIs the role fits him like a bespoke glove. In the history of the game, only the astonishing Virat Kohli has a higher average among those who have played at least 20 innings at No3. There are some serious names on this list. Hales goes, slapping a short ball from Taylor to backward point. He looked in spectacular touch, racing to 19 from 14 balls, and will be pretty disappointed to get out like that. 4th over: England 27-0 (Bairstow 12, Hales 15) Bairstow drags Holder over wide mid-on for four, one hand coming off the bat in the process. England have picked up where they left off before that numbing semi-final defeat to Pakistan in the Champions Trophy. The future is less secure, though. Before the Pakistan game they had two shots at glory, the Champions Trophy and the 2019 World Cup. Not anymore. Next time, there’ll be no next time. 3rd over: England 21-0 (Bairstow 7, Hales 14) A short ball from Taylor is monstered over midwicket for a one-bounce four by Hales. A big series here will probably get him on the Ashes tour - whether it should is another matter - and he looks in glorious touch. “Re Rashid at Lord’s, I think England were worried about Moeen going round the park (as he does from time to time) and then Rashid doing the same thing in the very first innings of the series (a prolonged Slatering),” says Gary Naylor. “637-2 is scarring that lasts. Leaving Rashid out may have been unfair, but it wasn’t irrational.” That’s an interesting theory, supported by the absence of the ever-steady Woakes. That said, they had six bowlers so that gave them more freedom. I guess we’ll never know, and I can’t see him playing Test cricket again. Things have moved on since July. Life moves pretty fast, even in sports that take five days per match. 2nd over: England 15-0 (Bairstow 7, Hales 8) There will be plenty of scrutiny on Jonny Bairstow, England’s newish ODI opener. He certainly has the game to succeed, though he isn’t yet as naturally explosive as Roy. You’d expect him to get a decent run now. He gets his first boundary today with a businesslike slap through the covers off Jason Holder. 1st over: England 9-0 (Bairstow 1, Hales 8) Alex Hales makes a pretty slow start, using up one dot ball before clouting Jerome Taylor over the leg side for four. The next ball is clipped through midwicket for four more, aided by a comedy misfield from Mohammed. He picked the ball up on the run just inside the boundary, tried to throw it behind him - and then watched it go straight over the rope. The players are back out on the field. England need 205 from 42 overs. Let us flay. “On the Adil Rashid subject,” begins James Thompson. “Whenever you watch Sky and they discuss him, they say that Joe Root will have been around him and there must be something that he didn’t like which is why he hasn’t been picked this summer. Surely Root doesn’t have that kind of influence on the selectors?” I think he does, particularly for what was his first match as captain. Gary Ballance was certainly a Root pick. There are obvious reservations about Rashid as a Test player. I just think he did more than enough in the winter to get another chance. Morgan has captained him beautifully in white-ball cricket; he’s never had the same faith in the Test team. “That’s one weird picture,” says Andrew Benton. Look, we all have to do a byline picture, it’s just the way newspaper wor- oh, I see. “Is Stokes wearing a big skin-coloured gauntlet that extends halfway up his forearm? And what’s he doing to Woakes’ belly?” So, England need 205 to win in 42 overs. File under should. See you in a wee while for their run-chase. 42nd over: West Indies 204-9 (Holder 41, Williams 0) Holder chips the last ball of the innings lazily down the ground for two to complete a fine last over for the West Indies - 15 from it. Holder top scores with a useful 41 not out. Stokes bowled him two beamers earlier in the over, both of which slipped out of the hand. Only the pitiful will make anything of it. Stokes actually had one of his better ODIs with the ball before that last over, and finishes with three for 43. After two accidental beamers in a chaotic last over from Stokes, Jerome Taylor hits a slower ball straight up in the air to give Jos Buttler a simple catch. There’s one ball remaining in the innings. 41st over: West Indies 189-8 (Holder 29, Taylor 1) Holder cuffed Willey down the ground before the dismissal of Bishoo, only the third boundary in the last ten overs. Willey ends with figures of 6-0-39-1. Bishoo tries to ramp Willey, misses, and loses both his wicket and a soupçon of dignity. Eight balls remain in the innings. 40th over: West Indies 181-7 (Holder 23, Bishoo 4) An excellent over of death bowling from Stokes includes wide yorkers, slower balls ... everything we wish he’d bowled to Carlos Brathwaite, basically. Three runs from the over. “To be fair, Rob…” says Gary Naylor, pasting the text commentary of Dawson’s dismissal of Hashim Amla. Yes that was a jaffa. This isn’t about Dawson so much as Rashid, who did enough in the winter to merit a crack as the No1 spinner, never mind No2. 39th over: West Indies 178-7 (Holder 22, Bishoo 3) Liam Plunkett returns to the attack, and a flurry of ones and twos take West Indies past their score of 176 for nine in the T20 game on Saturday. 38th over: West Indies 169-7 (Holder 16, Bishoo 1) Holder snicks Stokes for four. Good stuff from Nasser Hussain on Sky; he suggests West Indies have had a block-or-thwack approach to this innings and then backs it up with a statgasm: their dot-ball percentage today is 60, which is huge. 37th over: West Indies 161-7 (Holder 10, Bishoo 0) Rashid ends his spell with fine figures of 9-0-31-2. Why oh why oh flipping effing why didn’t England pick him ahead of Liam Dawson for that Lord’s Test against South Africa? Another one for the excellent Rashid. Nurse goes inside out over extra cover but doesn’t get enough on it and Root takes a good running catch on the boundary. 36th over: West Indies 159-6 (Holder 8, Nurse 1) Ben Stokes returns to the attack. His first spell was superb and his second starts prrrrretty well with just a single from the over. West Indies are going nowhere. Not even sure they’re doing it fast. They have six overs to do something about it. 35th over: West Indies 158-6 (Holder 7, Nurse 1) Adil Rashid has taken 68 wickets since the 2015 World Cup, more than anyone else in the world. How great, by the way, that three of the top four on that list are legspinners. There is no prospect of a 69th wicket for Rashid in that over, with West Indies taking no risks whatsoever. 34th over: West Indies 155-6 (Holder 5, Nurse 0) Holder edges Woakes wide of slip for four. “Over the next two years you have to accept that a turnover rate of about half would be, if not expected, at least a figure to plan for,” says John Starbuck. “Injuries and form obviously play a part but the trick lies, as usual, in spotting the new talent and how they perform under pressure. The actual placings in batting order or bowling unit can be disregarded for now. If I were a betting man (which I’m not) I’d look at how the younger county players at Test grounds are panning out. Unfair, but Test status does seem to be a factor.” Next you’ll be telling me the 2005 Ashes team never played together again. Yes, you are right – sport’s what happens while you’re busy picking a team for 12 months’ time. West Indies are going quietly. Powell tries to work Woakes to leg and inadvertently loops the ball towards mid-on, where Willey takes a comfortable running catch. 33rd over: West Indies 150-5 (Powell 23, Holder 0) Terrific stuff from Rashid. We’ll probably die wondering about his Test career; there is some consolation in the fact that he is bowling better than ever in white-ball cricket. England have an even tighter grip on the game now. Mohammed slog sweeps Rashid towards deep midwicket, where Hales takes a simple catch. Actually it almost slipped out of his Hales’ hands, which would have been mildly embarrassing. But it didn’t, so what’s your point? Another wicket for Rashid, who has become one of England’s most important players in this format. 32nd over: West Indies 149-4 (Mohammed 18, Powell 22) I wonder how many of this England XI will be in the World Cup squad in two years’ time. David Willey is probably under the most threat, though an in-form Willey has the lovely ability to take early wickets. Liam Plunkett will be 34, though I’m sure you’ll concur that he’s a splendid specimen of masculinity. While I’m busy worrying about 2019, Woakes hurries through an over that costs just two. England have a grip on this game at the moment. 31st over: West Indies 147-4 (Mohammed 17, Powell 22) Adil Rashid replaces Liam Plunkett, and Jason Mohammed says hello with a vigorous slap over midwicket for six. They need a few more such blows after those ponderous innings by Shai Hope and particularly Marlon Samuels. 30th over: West Indies 138-4 (Mohammed 9, Powell 21). There is a bowling change, but it’s broadly like for like, Woakes for Stokes. It yields a single to Mohammed before Powell edges for four through the vacant slip region. Jimmy Anderson, in his commentary box debut, points out that Powell’s strike rate is way better against seamers than spinners, but he’s not faced any yet. A wide from a bouncer and a sharper, more accurate short ball round off the over. Right, that’s my stint done. Rob Smyth will now take you by the hand and guide you gently through the rest of the action. Stay with him. 29th over: West Indies 132-4 (Mohammed 8, Powell 17). Mohammed drives Plunkett square on the offside for one before Powell unfurls an exquisite straight drive for SIX, all timing and technique. The best of the day. Three quick singles follow. Time for the spinners again? 28th over: West Indies 123-4 (Mohammed 6, Powell 10). Drop! Mohammed pulls Stokes round the corner – it’s high and reachable for Chris Woakes but he’s slow to make his ground and spills it after getting his fingertips to it low down. And then, finally, a boundary, Powell’s high on-drive having enough momentum to trickle to the ropes when it lands. Another over-cooked bouncer is punished with a wide signal before a hastily scurried two rounds off a much better over for the tourists. 27th over: West Indies 113-4 (Mohammed 4, Powell 3). Mohammed straight drives Plunkett for one, but the boundaries continue to be elusive. Plunkett then concedes a wide with a bouncer so high it’s at least twice Powell’s height as it passes over him. He duly gets off the mark with another of those lofty on-drives that gets stuck in the outfield, bringing two. Another couple of singles follow. England’s Test wicketkeeper, earlier: 26th over: West Indies 107-4 (Mohammed 2, Powell 0). Stokes’s offside strategy misfires with a fairly blatant wide at Samuels, and it’s followed by what initially looks to be one down the legside – but Stokes appeals for a catch behind. Morgan opts for a review, and it pays off. Not a wide, but a wicket, ultra-edge confirms. Samuels is a goner. England are on top now. Wide or wicket? Stokes slants one down legside, which Samuels looks to have glanced to the keeper. Umpire Robinson initially calls wide, but England review, and Stokes is vindicated - there was contact, and he’s snared Samuels! 25th over: West Indies 106-3 (Samuels 17, Mohammed 2). Plunkett sends down four straight dot balls at Mohammed, then takes a bit of a tumble on the edge of the wicket - not sure you can pin that on the state of the surface – before Mohammed nudges through the covers for one. Samuels rounds off the over with an upper cut to third man, but he still can’t find the boundary. He has 17 from 44 balls. 24th over: West Indies 104-3 (Samuels 16, Mohammed 1). Hope’s promising innings comes to an end when he connects cleanly to pull a back of a length Stokes ball but sends it into Jonny Bairstow’s hands. He took it well, leaping and taking expertly. The pressure pays off. Mohammed is off the mark with a push on the offside. Stokes gets the wicket he deserves, Hope pulling cleanly to deep square leg where Jonny Bairstow takes a fine catch. 23rd over: West Indies 103-2 (S Hope 35, Samuels 16). Hope cuts Plunkett square for a single to bring up a low-key but nonetheless useful 50 partnership. Plunkett also opts, wisely, to bang it in at Samuels and beats him with two consecutive short sharp’uns. And the batsman can’t work away the fuller ones either, and looks a little frustrated. 22nd over: West Indies 102-2 (S Hope 34, Samuels 16). A Stokes outthinks Hope with a wide slower ball out of the back of the hand that Hope hacks at and misses, a foible he repeats next ball before adding a rather more elegant clipped single. Another slower ball bamboozles Samuels before Stokes digs one in at his bat handle. An excellent over. And that’s drinks. 21st over: West Indies 101-2 (S Hope 33, Samuels 16). A change of ends for Plunkett, who replaces Rashid at the Jimmy Anderson end. It’s a more controlled and accurate over than those he sent down at the other end, though a crack past mid-on brings Samuels a single to take West Indies into three figures. Another leg-bye follows. Though England have reined West Indies back in after their earlier excesses, this stand’s beginning to look more and more useful. At the halfway stage in the innings, this one’s still delicately poised. 20th over: West Indies 98-2 (S Hope 32, Samuels 15). And here it is: Stokes is into the attack, Hope cutting his first ball square for a single to put his old mucker Marlon on strike. Stokes greets him with a slightly shorter ball that is worked easily down to third man for one. Hope adds one more to enable the pouting and glaring to resume as Samuels steps out of the way to halt Strokes in his delivery stride. The response is a bouncer that Samuels evades easily enough and it’s followed by a nice full slower ball that the batsman misses completely. 19th over: West Indies 94-2 (S Hope 30, Samuels 14). Rashid continues, conceding three consecutive singles before two low full tosses yield dot balls thanks to smart fielding at mid-on. Dropped catch aside, England have looked pretty focused in the field so far today. 18th over: West Indies 91-2 (S Hope 28, Samuels 13). Samuels nudges Plunkett off his legs for one as the ‘middle-overs meander’ vibe continues. Well at least until Hope produces another confidently executed pull shot for four. What an accomplished cricketer this man now looks, in all forms. Plunkett’s bowling at pace but not quite got his lengths right yet. Here’s that Root catch from earlier by the way: 17th over: West Indies 85-2 (S Hope 23, Samuels 13). Samuels drives Rashid through extra cover for two before the bowler appeals excitedly for a leg-before after a wrong’un strikes the advancing Samuels on the pad, but it’s almost certainly outside the line in the opinion of everyone else. Nonetheless, Rashid is bowling really well here. A wicket might be nice though. 16th over: West Indies 82-2 (S Hope 23, Samuels 10). Sooner or later one of these bowling changes will grant us a glimpse of Stokes v Samuels won’t it? Maybe but not yet. Plunkett’s the new bowler at the Statham End, and Hope cracks his first ball away nicely for a single. A bit of sloppiness in the field from Stokes brings another before Hope connects beautifully to send a perfectly timed pull-shot to the long-on boundary for four. West Indies’ most productive over in a while. 15th over: West Indies 74-2 (S Hope 17, Samuels 8). A glimpse of Bad Adil as he sends a full-toss at Samuels, but he can only pick up two with his push through the covers. The rest of the over’s pretty decent though, aided by sharp energetic work in the field as Hales cuts off a sweep slog that might have been four but ends up being one. 14th over: West Indies 70-2 (S Hope 15, Samuels 6). Samuels square-drives Willey uppishly for two but generally can’t clear the well-placed infield with his cover drives as Willey varies his pace nicely. Another single rounds off a frugal over. 13th over: West Indies 67-2 (S Hope 15, Samuels 3). Hope removes the shackles and launches Rashid over long-on for not so much a one-bounce four as a one-trickle four, such is the spongey turf. Rashid’s following his shots nicely though, generally tucking him up and bowling on a good length. I still wouldn’t rule him out for Tests in the future, but it seems those that make the decisions would. 12th over: West Indies 63-2 (S Hope 11, Samuels 3). Hope and Samuels not taking any risks at the moment, and aren’t really being given the opportunity to, Willey foxing Hope with a scrambled-seam inswinger that he plays outside, but a more expansive stroke does bring four, kind of by accident, skimming off the outside edge along the ground to the third-man boundary. 11th over: West Indies 57-2 (S Hope 6, Samuels 2). A spin for spin replacement, leg for off, as Rashid replaces Moeen. He keeps it tidy and accurate, conceding no room and only a single apiece to Hope and Samuels. “Martin Matthews is soft,” bellows Bob O’Hara, slamming down his pint and summoning all-comers. “I hear Joe Root will still be playing cricket in December &amp; January. Although not, I hope, with these idiots 10th over: West Indies 55-2 (S Hope 5, Samuels 1). Powerplay two sees Willey back from the Statham End and Samuels is off the mark with a flick to midwicket. Willey’s still finding some movement in the air, and makes Hope play and miss at one he doesn’t properly read. It’s another economical over, and West Indies need to reboot here. “In response to George Davidson’s impassioned crie de coeur,” writes Brian Withington, “can I suggest in defence of the ECB that they might have reckoned on one of those (West) Indian Summers of yore to justify scheduling 5 ODIs in late September. I think Thomas Hardy called it “Martinmas” in Mayor of Casterbridge (O-level English Lit set text 1976 - now that was a summer and a half). Funny how some words stick in the memory, like a Proustian smell of madeleine ...” Proof, also, that every single conversation about West Indies cricket will always at one point invokes the summer of 1976. It’s cricket’s equivalent of Mornington Crescent, or something. 9th over: West Indies 53-2 (S Hope 4, Samuels 0). Woakes pitches a tad too full and wide to give Gayle a chance to swing again, but this aerial drive is another that plugs in the outfield and gives him just two. Morgan pushes his fielders to the edge of the circle, exploiting Gayle’s clear discomfort at running ones and twos. It works, as Gayle is “forced” to go over the top, and doesn’t quite nail another straight drive that Root takes brilliantly. So momentum is with England now at the end of the first powerplay. England have their man. Unable to run freely, Gayle goes inevitably for the drive over the top but doesn’t quite get hold of it and Root, running back, takes an excellent catch on the run at long-off. 8th over: West Indies 51-1 (Gayle 35, S Hope 4). A Hope single off Moeen brings the 50 up before Gayle pretty much walks for another one. But the flow of runs has been stemmed for now, as Moeen tucks up Hope for the rest of a tidy over, that yields only two. “Who’s complaining about cricket in September?” fifth-Yorkshiremans Martin Matthews from, er, north London. “At Highgate CC we play until the 8th of October (against Stage CC since you asked).” 7th over: West Indies 49-1 (Gayle 34, S Hope 3). Woakes cuts Hope in half with a beauty that thwacks the edge of the pad and dobs down to first slip. His subsequent single returns Gayle to the strike, whereupon his frankly contemptuous approach to running between the wickets is almost punished as he almost forgets to run for his dab down to backward point, but the throw at the stumps is nowhere near accurate enough. Bumble thinks Gayle’s been picked up on the stump mic complaining of a hamstring pull. He’s certainly not running easily. He might have to get ‘em in fours and sixes, which he mostly does anyway. 6th over: West Indies 46-1 (Gayle 33, S Hope 1). An early airing of spin, though no an altogether surprising one, as Moeen replaces Willey. This could go either way, though it begins with a couple of sleepy singles, before vindication arrives swiftly as Lewis hoiks one straight to Hales at square leg. The much-praised Shai Hope is the new man in, and begins cautiously, getting off the mark with a nudge round the corner for one to deprive Gayle of the strike. The change of bowling works, Moeen is pulled fiercely to square leg by Lewis, and Hales takes a sharp catch. 5th over: West Indies 43-0 (Gayle 32, Lewis 10). Lewis gets his first four with a classical Proper Cricket shot, driving Woakes off the back foot through the gaps on the offside for four. He squirts another single down to third man to put Gayle on strike, and two slips pushed further out, and Woakes sends a lovely delivery past the left-hander’s outside-edge. A better over for England. An email, less a quip than a serious Letter to the Editor, from George Davidson: Sir, The authorities who are supposed to protect cricket continue to do their best to damage it. Surrey have been emailing me inviting me to buy tickets for an ODI on September 27th. I am daft but I’m not stupid as I don’t fancy that it will be a particularly nice sunny day even in the unlikely event that there is a full days play. That is not even the final ODI of the Summer with one scheduled two days later on September 29th in Southampton. This is an absurd abuse of fans’ love of cricket. They know we will be fools and open our wallets and Sky will fill up their schedules. But they will also not respect us. In Southampton they love seeing England play and want to be seen as a good venue. But their patience has been tried, most notably when the players spent all day in the dressing rooms sheltering from the rain, came out for ten minutes then went back in for tea....the only time when the sun was shining. There are now so many venues in this country that if local fans don’t come out then they know Cardiff or Chester-le-Street or Leeds or Manchester will benefit next year. My tickets for the Oval Test this year were £95 each day. On the Saturday I saw 35 overs so there was no refund at all. I never get to see the 90 overs I have paid for as the players skip off for bad light despite the floodlights shining. The ECB is an utter mess and treats its spectators with contempt. I fear the love of fans for England and cricket can only go unrequited for so long. 4th over: West Indies 38-0 (Gayle 32, Lewis 5). The onslaught continues. Willey fancies an lbw shout against Lewis after rapping him high on the pad, but no one else does: it’s clearly going over. Lewis lives dangerously again, miscuing a pivoted pull shot that falls just short of Hales at deep square leg. Willey’s making the ball do more than Woakes is but can’t legislate for Gayle’s unerring ability to pick up a length ball and effortlessly swing it straight down the ground for SIX, which he does off the fourth delivery of the over, which is prolonged by a wide before Willey finds a low outside-edge off Gayle that doesn’t carry to second slip. Gayle’s comeback shot is, you guessed, another easy SIX down the ground, the biggest of the lot, punishing Willey for over-pitching. Whatever you think of him, he’s a cricketing phenomenon. 3rd over: West Indies 24-0 (Gayle 20, Lewis 4). The onslaught starts? More chance-offering from West Indies as Lewis’s square slash off Woakes just eludes Morgan at backward point and brings two. He adds a single before Gayle gets his first boundary with a crunching aerial straight drive that takes one bounce. The next one doesn’t take any – it’s walloped over long-on and several rows back for SIX, and Gayle pulls the next ball across the line towards the same area for four more for good measure. England are attacking hard here, with three slips in, but these openers can give it back. 2nd over: West Indies 7-0 (Gayle 6, Lewis 1). David Willey opens up at the other end, and gets extravagant swing straight away, and Gayle lets it pass. A languid drive into the covers followed by an aerial clip to deep square leg then bring him two and one respectively, and Lewis gets underway by digging out an attempted yorker to mid-on for a single. Gayle’s first attempt to go large, a chip over mid-off, plugs in the much-fretted-over turf and doesn’t make the boundary. It’s two. “Typical of Manchester to have under-soil rain,” regional-stereotypes Ian Copestake. 1st over: West Indies 1-0 (Gayle 1, Lewis 0). So Chris Woakes has the new ball as we enter the first nine-over powerplay. Chris Gayle’s first ODI shot in more than two years is a limp play and miss as Woakes skilfully pushes one past his outside edge. And his third shot is DROPPED, a sharp slash outside off stump to second slip, where Joe Root snatches at it and spills it. How many more times will England slip fielders do that this season? Gayle gets underway with a flick to square leg for a single and Woakes rounds off a fine first over with a steepling bouncer at the left-handed Lewis. The players are on their way out. Old Trafford looks all lovely and sunny. As it has for the past couple of hours. Before we start: Both sides go with two spinners, to no great surprise: England: Hales, Bairstow, Root, Morgan, Stokes, Buttler, Moeen, Woakes, Rashid, Plunkett, Willey West Indies: Gayle, Lewis, S Hope, Samuels, Mohammed, Powell, Holder, Nurse, Bishoo, Taylor, Williams Jason Holder calls right and opts for first use, backing his top order and spinners. Umpire Tim Robinson says “it’s still not great but dried a little bit”, and we have ourselves a game - 42 overs a side. “Why don’t they move the boundary to exclude the wet areas for this match?” ponders Andrew Benton, thinking right outside that box. “As long as it stays there for both innings, I can’t see a problem.” Given that the damp areas include patches well within the circle, it would make for some crazily easy sixes and overthrows. Worth a go, I guess. Bums on seats and all that. Bumble is out there prodding at some parts of the outfield on which players had been doing some practice, and they do look quite churned. “It’s a bit damp,” he concedes, urging the non-shooting of messengers. Part of the problem, he says, is that Old Trafford has staged two big concerts here this summer, in aid of the Manchester bomb victims, which no one should begrudge, but it’s added to the strain on the surface. John Starbuck weighs in with his first email of the day: “I blame the Old Trafford management,” he thunders. “You can understand them wanting to sweat their assets, as that’s what people are told to do these days, but there’s a category error here: you can’t mix international cricket and rock concerts at the same venue because the quality of the playing surface is all-important. High traffic areas are all very well for a rugby game, because the players expect to be slipping and sliding around - it’s part of the appeal. Not so for the Greatest Game.” “Cricket speaks with forked tongue,” hisses Mike Hill: “ECB campaigns to ‘get the game on’ and at the same time says player safety is paramount. End result: glorious sunny day, wicket and square dry, bit of a damp outfield and no play. people wonder why cricket is dying sport.” Though I suspect a fixture such as this, scheduled as it is, is something of a preacher to the converted. Won’t be many young fans at this one. Still, a decent crowd is in to spend money in the bars... For want of anything better to do, Gary Weightman emails in and waxes nostalgic: “Being somewhat long in the tooth the sight of umpires parading around the outfield poking at damp patches is marvellously old school, the days before supersoppers, the days of hessian mats and sawdust.” On the other hand, Andrew Benton rails at the future: “Cricket needs industrial-sized vacuum cleaners to suck up the water - someone must have thought to invented one, surely?” It’s a really poor show from The Boffins, that - we don’t need any more iPhones. We need monster-rain-vacuumers. And jetpacks, obviously. This is perfectly tedious. Not ready to start yet - perhaps some miraculous transformation will have blessed us in 45 minutes. Still no definite decision. The areas of concern on the pitch appear to be square-ish of the wicket - around backward point - some patches on the boundary, and along the bowlers’ run-ups. Player safety is an understandable concern. This isn’t looking particularly hopeful, and nor does it reflect well on the schedule - who’d have thought it might be touch and go to get a game of cricket on in the autumn? The umpires are on the outfield, stomping around on the suspect bits, then milling and chatting to the captains, and looking somewhat anxious and contemplative, it must be said. The pitch itself “looks absolutely fantastic”, with a decent amount of early carry and plenty in it for spinners later on, according to Jimmy Anderson and David Lloyd on Sky duties. If we’re deprived cricket on it, there’ll be some very unhappy punters. “Can’t help feeling as I did at 7.30pm on Easter Sunday after a surfeit of choccy - I’ve had too much of a good thing,” sighs a phlegmatic Gary Naylor. “Ho hum.” Helpfully, courtesy of Gary, you can pass some time by reading his own county cricket talking points here: Ian Ward on Sky reminds us that West Indies need to win this series 4-0 or 5-0 to guarantee qualification for the World Cup - going through the qualification tournament is their likely fate – which reminds me to be angry anew about the mean and stupid decision to cut the number of competing teams in the finals to 10, and in a tedious single-group format. The people who run cricket and football’s world cups need to swap places. The between-innings break has been reduced to 15 minutes, and latest indications are that if the match can start by 1.30 they’ll play the whole 50 overs each; any more and we’ll start losing some. Some succinct early thoughts from you the public: So while we wait, here’s some famously hot England v West Indies at Old Trafford ODI action from a May half-term week, and still the greatest one-day innings ever played, and one of the greatest things of all time: It isn’t raining, but the outfield is deemed too damp and soft in important areas to start at the moment, and groundstaff “have concerns”, Saturday’s slip-sliding at Durham perhaps particularly prominent in their mind. They’ll look again at 1pm, though given that there’s no wind and it’s not exactly tropical, you have to wonder how much dryer it can get. Some pre-match reading for you. The Spin is in – and if you don’t subscribe, for extra choice tidbits, you really should. Anyway, Andy Bull pays tribute to stalwart county wicketkeepers and international nearly men Chris Read and Jamie Foster in this week’s edition: And county cricketing brain-in-a-jar Will Macpherson is at Lord’s watching relegation-threatened Middlesex get into some alarming early bother against Lancashire, as well as telling you what’s going on elsewhere. Join him here. Morning/afternoon everyone. Time was when the entire season would be done and dusted by this point in September. Tests, ODIs, all the county honours, the works. But here we are, at the start of an ODI series, the final international stanza of this quart-into-a-pint-pot of an English season. It’s too easy to scoff at this summer’s schedule of course, but what with England hosting showpiece 50-over tournaments in the men’s and women’s game, an eagerly anticipated marquee series against South Africa - which actually turned out to be a dampish squib - and a Test series against West Indies to crowbar in too, it’s hard to see when else this series, if it were to be held at all, could be slotted in. As it happens, the unexpectedly watchable nature of the West Indies Test series has kept the pot boiling a little. That involved a very different touring squad, of course, but the return of big guns such as sexism’s Chris Gayle and banter’s Marlon Samuels for the limited-overs stuff adds spice to this final chapter of the international summer. And despite the apparent imbalance in recent form between the sides it’s a tricky series to call. This is England’s first 50-over match in three months, since they were so comprehensively neutered by Pakistan in the Champions Trophy semi-final, an abrupt scuppering of a season-plan that had prioritised that elusive first ODI tournament triumph, and one that exposed a largely undetected one-paced brittleness in Eoin Morgan’s team. West Indies, of course, didn’t even qualify, and were easily beaten at home by England six months ago, following that up with series defeats by Pakistan and India and a draw with Afghanistan. Yet as last Saturday in damp and dark Durham demonstrated, they remain a well-grooved machine with a white ball when the contest is only 20 overs a side. Which side of their game will we see today? It might be a bit nippy out but it’s worth sticking with this one. Stay here, and we’ll be underway at 12.30pm British so-called Summer Time."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"guardian-masterclasses/guardian-masterclass-blog/2017/sep/18/chris-guillebeau-everyone-should-learn-to-think-entrepreneurially-side-hustle-masterclass-blog","type":"article","sectionId":"guardian-masterclasses","sectionName":"Guardian Masterclasses","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-18T15:47:20Z","webTitle":"Chris Guillebeau: 'Everyone should learn to think entrepreneurially'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/guardian-masterclasses/guardian-masterclass-blog/2017/sep/18/chris-guillebeau-everyone-should-learn-to-think-entrepreneurially-side-hustle-masterclass-blog","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/guardian-masterclasses/guardian-masterclass-blog/2017/sep/18/chris-guillebeau-everyone-should-learn-to-think-entrepreneurially-side-hustle-masterclass-blog","fields":{"headline":"Chris Guillebeau: 'Everyone should learn to think entrepreneurially'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"“You don’t have to live your life the way other people expect,” is point number one in Chris Guillebeau’s philosophy. The bestselling author of motivation-packed books The Art of Non-Conformity, The $100 Startup, and Side Hustle, Chris has forged his own path in life, balancing his interests – such as a passion for travel – with humanitarian work in West Africa, and more recently, with his ambitions as a writer and public speaker. You have taken an unconventional career path. Was this something you knew you wanted to do from a young age? I didn’t think much about career paths when I was young. I mostly thought about how to make money without getting a job. Once I figured that out, I discovered music, travel and humanitarian work. Those things kept me busy for a decade. After returning to the US from West Africa, where I volunteered on a hospital ship and moonlighted to support myself, I began a quest to visit every country in the world before my 35th birthday. The first half of the quest wasn’t public at all, it was just something I did for myself because I enjoyed the challenge. Then I started writing about it, and my whole life changed. It’s only since I’ve been an author that I’ve had any sort of career path at all. Who do you admire most in business or in life? Did you have any mentors? The people I admire the most aren’t necessarily “known” people. They are humanitarians who toil away without recognition, or anyone devoted to a cause even if it brings them no glory. As for mentorships, that’s also a bit tricky. I’ve learned from a lot of people. Long ago I was a musician and made the mistake of saying I was self-taught. An older musician corrected me, saying: “No one ever showed you any chords? You don’t copy phrases or rhythms from the masters like we all do?” I understood his point: we’re all influenced by those we encounter or look up to. Still, I think formal mentorship is overrated. A lot of people who say they’re looking for a mentor are just procrastinating or seeking approval. If you have a dream, you don’t need anyone to justify it. It’s your dream, right? You can choose to follow it or let it die; those are the only two options. If a definition of an entrepreneur is “someone who will work 24 hours a day for themselves to avoid working one hour a day for someone else”, how do you avoid burning out? Well, there is probably some hyperbole in that quote. I do try to take a holiday of some kind at least once a year. I honestly feel very fortunate. I love what I do. I have an amazing community of people all over the world. I’m able to write and to travel, two activities that I greatly enjoy. People often ask me about productivity tips. I’ve found that the best hack is to find work you enjoy that also helps people in some way. Then, when you find it, do everything you can to protect and improve it. There’s no burnout in that. Do you think self-employment and entrepreneurship is the future of work for most people? What will the workplace look like in 20 years from now? I’m not really a futurist. If you’d asked me three years ago what I think about podcasts, I’d have said they’re on the way out. Obviously that was completely wrong, and now I host my own podcast, Side Hustle School, every single day. It’s clear that the workplace, at least in the western world, is in the process of being reconstructed. I don’t necessarily believe everyone should become an entrepreneur, but I do think everyone should learn to think entrepreneurially. And we all need more than one source of income. That’s what’s great about a side hustle. You don’t have to take a huge risk, you can start where you are, using the skills you already have, and create an asset for yourself – all without leaving your job. You have visited every country in the world. What have been the most memorable places? I love travel for the sake of travel. I’m that person who looks forward to spending hours in the terminal – I realise that some people just want to get to their destination as quickly as possible, but I savour the journey. That said, a few particularly memorable places include: Liberia, where I lived for nearly a year while working as an aid worker after that country’s decade-long civil war; Macedonia, which I found to be an especially tranquil place after a long overland journey; Laos, where I’ve never returned but it’s always on my list when revisiting south-east Asia, and Australia, which I understand is hardly unconventional but is nevertheless a place where I feel right at home."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/sep/18/michael-quinn-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-18T16:26:00Z","webTitle":"Michael Quinn obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/18/michael-quinn-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/18/michael-quinn-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Michael Quinn obituary","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"My brother-in-law, Michael Quinn, who has died aged 71, was the first British head chef at the Ritz hotel in London. He improved the reputation of the nation’s food and helped put British cooking on the map. Born in Leeds, the youngest of six children of Frank Quinn, a gardener, and his wife, Agnes (nee Conboy), he left Corpus Christi secondary modern, Leeds, at 15, becoming an apprentice chef at the Queens hotel. He won national awards and prestigious posts from the beginning of his career. After working his way up to head chef at various hotels, in 1974, following divorce from his wife, Sheila, he became a single parent. He moved to Accrington to be near his eldest sister and her family, qualified as a teacher, then taught catering students at Accrington FE College. After marrying for the second time, to Jane, in the 70s, he became head chef at Gravetye Manor in West Sussex. In 1982, he was appointed head chef at the Ritz. In his mid-30s, he was at the summit of the culinary world. Michael, who never forgot his roots, translated the menu from French to English, and introduced traditional dishes, such as steak and kidney pie and bread and butter pudding, to the Ritz menu. He was appointed MBE in 1985 for his service to the food business. He was rightly proud of his reputation and worked hard to improve food standards and to raise the status of British food. But all this was taking its toll. He was a functioning alcoholic, and it began to dominate him. He left the Ritz and took a post at Ettington Park hotel near Stratford-upon-Avon, but it was soon apparent that he could not continue working. His second marriage broke down and Michael began a period of staying with his siblings, trying and failing at first to be sober. During a cooking demonstration in Leeds in 1996, Michael collapsed. He was taken to hospital with severe liver disease, and received the last rites. This was the moment he needed; with the help of AA he began the path that led him to be sober for the rest of his life. His heart was not in cooking any more; he needed to tell his story. In 2001 he formed a new charity, the Ark Foundation, with friends, themselves chefs, to educate catering college students about the dangers of alcohol. Under the auspices of the charity Hospitality Action he visited almost all catering colleges in the country and many overseas. He continued in this exhilarating but exhausting work for 13 years. His was a massive talent, which he never entirely recognised in himself. He had been a bringer of change in the kitchen and he became a bringer of change in people’s lives.

Mara Fernanda Castilla, 19, was found dead on Friday, according to the Puebla state governor, Tony Gali. Her body had been abandoned in a ditch some 90 kilometres south-east of Mexico City. Castilla had hailed a car from Cabify, a Spanish ride-sharing service, in the early hours of 8 September after going out clubbing with friends. The driver passed by her apartment – ending the paid portion of the ride there and sending a receipt to her email – but security cameras did not show Castilla exiting the car or entering the building. Castilla was taken to a hotel, where she was sexually assaulted and strangled, according to investigators. The driver has since been arrested. News of Castilla’s murder came during Mexico’s independence holiday – an event marked this year with somewhat downbeat celebrations following a powerful earthquake which killed at least 98 people, and amid public soul-searching over continuing corruption and violence. Some on social media added the official holiday hashtag #VivaMéxico to tweets condemning Castilla’s murder, while protesters in major Mexican cities marched to protest against violence against women on Sunday. “I’m not going to celebrate when there’s something so outrageous happening,” said Liliana Rivera, a psychologist, who protested on Sunday. “There’s this outrage and an outcry because these murders are not being taken seriously by the government unless they go into the media. In every state we have these problems,” Maricruz Ocampo, an activist on women’s issues in the state Querétaro, told the Guardian. “The number that the [federal] government gives is that seven women are killed every day because people can get away with it. There is no other reason.” Puebla, where Castilla moved to study political science, has registered 83 feminicidios so far in 2017. Civil society groups have pushed the Puebla state government to issue a “gender alert” – an emergency mechanism introduced into law in 2007 following a surge of gruesome hate crimes against women in the northern border city of Ciudad Juárez. The request was rejected on 7 July. Over the weekend, the hashtag #SiMeMatan – “if they kill me” –trended on social media. The hashtag has trended previously after officials have implied that female victims of violence were somehow complicit in the crimes committed against them. Four months before her death, Castilla herself used the hashtag on a 5 May tweet reading “#SiMeMatan it’s because I liked to go out at night and drink a lot of beer …” In recent years, ride-hailing services such as Cabify and Uber have exploded in popularity in Mexico – not least because they are perceived to be safer than ordinary taxis, which often do not have seat belts, GPS devices or credit card readers. Taxi drivers have also regularly been involved in crimes including robbery and kidnapping. Meanwhile, armed robberies occur regularly on public transit in the suburbs of Mexico City, while the subway in the capital has female-only cars to prevent sexual assault. “You take Uber and Cabify because you think it’s safe, but it ends up you’re still exposing yourself to danger,” said Ana Olivares, a student protesting in Mexico City. “There’s no way to stay safe.” Cabify came in for further criticism after the company expressed condolences for Castilla’s “death”. Many on social media corrected the Cabify statement to read that Castilla was, in fact, murdered."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2017/sep/19/lord-david-sainsbury-welfare-state-right-philanthropy-benefits","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-19T12:00:17Z","webTitle":"Lord Sainsbury: ‘This is why I believe in the welfare state.

Certain things should be a right’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"David Sainsbury, Lord Sainsbury of Turville, who for 50 years has been a major benefactor of charities, education, research, the arts and projects in developing countries, and whose foundation has already given away more than £1bn, is appalled when I ask if he watched last month’s TV programme Get a House for Free, in which millionaire Marco Robinson gave a flat to the applicant deemed to be the most worthy recipient. “I can’t think of anything I would like less,” he murmurs. “This is the reason why I believe in the proper welfare state, because I think these things should be a right. And I would hate to put myself in a position of trying to judge other people’s worthiness.” In a rare interview, Sainsbury is clear that he doesn’t want to use charitable spending as a substitute for social welfare. The amounts involved are too small, he says, and there is no evidence that charities do things better than the state. What charities can do, he argues, is take risks and innovate. As a former Labour science minister, Sainsbury says government is “incredibly bad” at innovation. “You end up with this utterly ridiculous thing where you have a new idea, and you talk to a Treasury official, who asks whether you can prove that it will be successful. You have to tell them that the point is that it’s innovative – so by definition you can’t prove it’s going to be successful,” he says. So part of the focus of Sainsbury’s charitable work has been to fund start-up projects, in areas like plant science, which have then been taken on by government-funded research councils. “We work very carefully with government, so that any lessons that come out of what we do can be picked up by them,” he says. An early supporter of the SDP who returned to Labour in 1996, Sainsbury has some fairly stringent views on what’s happened to public services since 2010. In 2009, he founded the Institute for Government thinktank, partly because he saw from his time in government that when things didn’t work, “it wasn’t because the civil servants were not trying to do their best; it was that the system was really quite dysfunctional,” he explains. As well as aiming to improve the civil service, the IfG has also reviewed governments’ technical education and industrial and regional policies since 1945. “It is just an appalling story of one half-baked initiative following another half-baked initiative.” But after 10 years’ slog trying to get changes to technical education, Sainsbury does have some hope that things may finally improve in that area at least, following a report published in July 2016 by the panel he chaired. Despite having given away hundreds of millions of his own wealth, Sainsbury himself is so little known to the general public that, unlike US mega-philanthropist Bill Gates, he can go about his daily life unrecognised. At the age of 76, he is now looking back on a life of giving. Many of us in our later years may try and do a bit of tidying up, give away a few things. Sainsbury’s tidying up is on a whole different scale. Not that he is, one hopes, anywhere near the end. Sainsbury still officially works three days a week, but on his own admission works another two or three more on top from home, and thinks the idea of retirement is “rubbish”. Fifty years since he wrote a cheque for £5, using his Sainsbury’s shares, to set up what became the Gatsby Charitable Foundation, named after one of his favourite books, Sainsbury wants to pass on a few ideas accumulated over a lifetime of giving money away through a history of the foundation by science writer and biographer Georgina Ferry, published this month. The foundation has always been ambitious, spending around £50m a year on charitable activities on programmes that range from technical education, plant science and the workings of the brain, as well as helping to reduce poverty in Africa. Sainsbury has been clear from the start that his foundation will not last beyond his own death. This doesn’t mean the work he has supported will stop: he says there will still be funding for organisations like the Centre for Cities and the Institute for Government thinktanks. “Basically I don’t want to start any major new projects because I want to make certain that all the projects I support are well-organised and in good shape when I die.” Sainsbury describes it as “just the luck of my life” that he not only received shares in Sainsbury’s, but that he received them at such a young age. “There wasn’t a lot in the early days but it gradually built up and that’s meant I’ve had 50 years to learn how to do this,” he says. “That’s rather unusual because most people have to make the money first and then, towards their 60s or 70s, think about how they might spend it on philanthropic activities, which gives them quite a short time to learn how to do it.” His main advice to new philanthropists is to do the homework. “First of all decide what it is you really care about and want to change. Because if you’re clear about that then you’ll be prepared to put in the effort of understanding what the issues are in that particular area.” And his second is not to go in with fixed ideas. “Don’t try and draw up a great plan of what you’re going to do, because you don’t know,” he says. “Just fund some small projects in the area, then follow them very closely and see what works. Two or three years later you will know who the good guys are in that field, who is doing interesting stuff and what the problems are.” Only then, he says, can you start to effect true change. And how does he measure that change? Unlike many in the third sector, he is not a fan of auditing impact. “I’m rather unenthusiastic about this new thing about teams of monitors and evaluators,” says Sainsbury. “If you’re clear what you’re trying to do, it’s usually clear whether you’ve succeeded or failed. It’s only when you’re not clear what you’re trying to do that it becomes difficult to measure whether you’re successful or not.” And when things don’t work, he says, he takes lessons from his career in business. “You don’t do what government often does and throw up your hands and say, ‘forget it, we’ll do something else’. You say what’s going wrong and why it’s going wrong – and try and correct it.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/ng-interactive/2017/sep/18/what-is-the-average-debt-where-you-live","type":"interactive","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-18T17:25:30Z","webTitle":"What is the average debt where you live?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/ng-interactive/2017/sep/18/what-is-the-average-debt-where-you-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/ng-interactive/2017/sep/18/what-is-the-average-debt-where-you-live","fields":{"headline":"What is the average debt where you live?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Consumer debt in the UK has soared by almost 10% in the past year.

Yet a one-week gap between jobs was enough for authorities to reject his application for Belgian citizenship. The decision shocked Curtis, who moved to Brussels in 2004 with his Belgian wife. “I have never claimed unemployment benefits or been out of work, so it seemed an unfair or a very a harsh interpretation of the rules,” he said. “I have been paying Belgian taxes since 2004. I have only ever worked for organisations registered in Belgium.” Citizens’ rights are a top priority at the Brexit negotiations, which resumed in Brussels this week. Since the UK’s vote to leave the EU, British residents in Belgium have flocked to town halls to file applications for citizenship. In 2016, 506 British people acquired Belgian nationality, almost four times more than the previous year. Many have found the process more arduous than they anticipated. Applicants must have lived and worked in Belgium for five years and speak one of three official languages: French, Dutch or German. For those unable to meet the work requirements, there are integration courses and language tests. Curtis applied for Belgian nationality during the referendum campaign. After the Brexit vote he was even more convinced a passport was the best way to secure the future for him and his Belgian-British family. Without Belgian citizenship, he could be “locked into Belgium”, unable to consider jobs in other EU countries. Returning to the UK is also a risk, because of uncertainty over his wife’s status. “This whole thing has thrown up a lot of questions and there is no one giving any answers,” he said. Officials say Curtis could get round the requirement of an unbroken five-year work record by taking a 400-hour integration course during the working week. “The Belgian nationality code … leaves very little room for interpretation,” a spokeswoman at his commune of Anderlecht said. “For a working person that is not feasible,” Curtis said, adding that he already feels “pretty well integrated” in Belgium. His two children were born in Belgian hospitals and attend local schools. Curtis reserves most of his criticism for Theresa May and senior British ministers who “started the article 50 process without assessing all the outcomes”. “The focus seems to have been on the status of EU nationals in the UK,” he said. “You have the feeling that: you left the UK, you are on your own. I don’t think we are the number one priority.” Christine Sullivan, an attorney in Brussels, said the Curtis case did not surprise her. “[Working] gaps of even a day can be enough to derail an application,” she said. “With the biggest respect towards the Belgian authorities, the interpretation of the requirement of economic integration is not always in line with legislative precedent or European law.” Uzma Lodhi, 34, who works at the British Chamber of Commerce, has lived in Brussels for 11 years, and has had reassuring signals her application will be granted, though there was one hitch. “My ID card said I was born in London, but my birth certificate said I was born in Edmonton [north London] and they made a big fuss about that, saying that it won’t be accepted,” she said. In the end, the British embassy supplied an official document confirming that Edmonton was in London. Counter-intuitively, British EU officials face the biggest problems in becoming Belgian. This is a small group compared with the 25,000 Britons in Belgium: only about 1,280 British nationals work for the EU’s three main institutions, the European commission, council and parliament. As officials, they are entitled to live in Belgium under a diplomatic protocol card granted by the Belgian foreign ministry, in place of Belgian ID papers. But this diplomatic perk has turned into a big headache. The Belgian government has decided the EU protocol card is not valid for citizenship applications. Many fear their British nationality could cost them their jobs after Brexit. So far, EU authorities have not made any public statement to challenge the Belgian government. Instead hopes are being pinned on the courts, after a British MEP’s assistant took on the Belgian state and won. Laura Rayner, a 33-year-old assistant to a Scottish MEP, who moved to Brussels in 2009, challenged a decision by Flemish authorities to reject her citizenship application. She began her quest for Belgian citizenship at the doors of Leuven town hall at 8.45am on Friday 24 June, 15 minutes before it opened. It was the first day of her maternity leave and she was eight-and-a-half months pregnant. She felt she had no time to lose. A few hours earlier, she had woken to the referendum result. She was warned that morning the protocol card would not be accepted as proof of five years’ residence. When the expected rejection letter dropped though her letterbox six months later, she decided to go to court. Long nights spent researching the finer points of Belgian and European citizenship law resulted in a legal ruling that the EU card could be accepted as proof of residence. A spokeswoman at the Belgian ministry of justice said EU officials had the option of acquiring a Belgian ID card. Applying for a Belgian ID card was a sign of the “wish to become completely rooted” in Belgium, she said. The Rayner case came from a lower court and does not set a precedent, but since the verdict, the assistant has been flooded by requests from EU officials. Now she feels hugely relieved. “Why should I be in a worse position because I am a European official,” she said. “How is that anything other than discrimination?”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/18/russia-zapad-military-drill-enters-final-phase","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-18T16:27:09Z","webTitle":"Vladimir Putin watches display of Russian firepower near EU border","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/18/russia-zapad-military-drill-enters-final-phase","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/18/russia-zapad-military-drill-enters-final-phase","fields":{"headline":"Vladimir Putin watches display of Russian firepower near EU border","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A large-scale Russian military exercise that has spooked western countries has entered its final phase, with helicopters, fighter jets, missiles and tanks employed at a firing range close to Russia’s border with the EU. Vladimir Putin was among those watching the 45-minute display of firepower on a cold and rainy Monday afternoon at the Luga firing range, about 70 miles (113km) from the border with EU member state Estonia. The Russian president, joined by the defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, and a number of army generals, watched through binoculars from a viewing platform. The scenario for Zapad, which Russia is holding jointly with the armed forces of neighbouring Belarus, sees Veishnoria, a fictitious region of Belarus, declare independence and attempt to turn Belarus against Russia, with the help of Nato countries. As the world frets over Russia’s ability to conduct “hybrid warfare” using cyber-attacks, proxies and fake news, Zapad is a reminder of the country’s hard military power. Exercises have also taken place in Belarus and Russia’s Baltic exclave of Kaliningrad. On Monday the exercise transitioned from defence to counterattack, with infantry, artillery, missile, air defence and aviation all involved. According to the scenario, the Veishnorian separatists had seized a number of planes and drones from the government and had to be destroyed. Zapad, which means “west” in Russian, is the reincarnation of a Soviet-era training exercise that involved Warsaw Pact countries, and is carried out every four years. This year’s training has caused particular alarm in the west, with some observers believing it to be the biggest military drill Russia has held since the end of the cold war. Russian officials have denied the exercises are anything other than a standard training exercise, and point to Nato troop buildup in central and eastern Europe as the real threat to stability on the continent. A 4,000-member multinational Nato force has been deployed in the Baltics and Poland to counter the Russian threat. Russia claims only 12,700 troops are taking part in the exercises, which brings them in just under the 13,000 threshold, over which there would be a requirement under a treaty known as the Vienna document to allow western observers to attend. Russia has invited a number of diplomatic observers and says all the fears are misplaced. “We reject complaints of these exercises not being transparent,” Putin’s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, told reporters last week. “We believe that whipping up hysteria around these exercises is a provocation.” According to the scenario of the drills, the supposed separatists of Veishnoria are backed by two fictitious countries, Lubenia and Vesbaria, which appear to be thinly disguised references to Poland and Lithuania. Nato officials say the drills are meant as a warning to the alliance that Russia can mass a large number of troops at short notice, while the three Baltic countries have voiced particular alarm. Others have suggested that becoming so alarmed by the exercises plays into Russia’s hands, giving Moscow an exaggerated threat level. However, Baltic states point to the 2013 Zapad exercises that came shortly before the annexation of Crimea and intervention in East Ukraine. Lithuania’s defence minister, Raimundas Karoblis, suggested there was even a risk of the drill triggering a conflict or being used as cover to leave behind troops in Belarus. “We can’t be totally calm. There is a large foreign army massed next to Lithuanian territory,” he told Reuters. The US army moved 600 paratroopers to the Baltic states for the duration of Zapad, and has taken charge of guarding the air space of the three countries. The exercises have been taking place in a number of locations in the western part of Russia and Belarus. Earlier on Monday, the Russian military said Sukhoi Su-24 bombers practised a strike on ground targets in difficult weather conditions, dropping 250kg bombs on simulated enemy fortifications. Later at Luga, the poor weather continued, with driving rain and low rolling clouds obscuring the view of an Ilyushin 76 plane that dropped paratroopers into the drill with cover from fighter jets. Artillery and missile systems and dozens of tanks were also used. On the other side of the country, a group of four Chinese ships has arrived in the Russian Pacific port of Vladivostok for joint naval exercises, which come as tension rises over North Korea."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2017/sep/19/robots-could-take-4m-private-sector-jobs-within-10-years","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-19T10:34:36Z","webTitle":"Robots 'could take 4m UK private sector jobs within 10 years'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/sep/19/robots-could-take-4m-private-sector-jobs-within-10-years","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/sep/19/robots-could-take-4m-private-sector-jobs-within-10-years","fields":{"headline":"Robots 'could take 4m UK private sector jobs within 10 years'","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Four million jobs in the British private sector could be replaced by robots in the next decade, according to business leaders asked about the future of automation and artificial intelligence. The potential impact amounts to 15% of the current workforce in the sector and emerged in a poll conducted by YouGov for the Royal Society of Arts, whose chief executive, Matthew Taylor, has been advising Downing Street on the future of modern work. Jobs in finance and accounting, transport and distribution and in media, marketing and advertising are most likely to be automated in the next decade, the research says. The RSA’s prediction of the impact of robotics on working lives is lower than some other estimates. Four years ago, academics at the University of Oxford predicted 35% of jobs could be rendered obsolete by new technology, while the Bank of England predicted in 2015 that up to 15m jobs in Britain were at risk from robots “hollowing out” the workforce. The RSA is also more optimistic about the potential of robots and artificial intelligence than US tech billionaire Elon Musk, who has said AI was “the scariest problem” and “our biggest existential threat” because, he predicts, they will be able to do everything better than humans. Research by the University of Oxford and Deloitte last year predicted more than 850,000 public sector jobs could be lost by 2030 through automation. Asda operates a fully automated distribution warehouse in west London; white-collar tasks are being automated by PwC, the accountancy firm, and Linklaters, the law firm, which have been developing software robots that use artificial intelligence to learn to do research tasks usually undertaken by junior accountants and lawyers. The RSA warns that artificial intelligence and robotics will “undoubtedly cause the loss of some jobs, whether it is autonomous vehicles pushing taxi drivers out of business or picking and packing robots usurping warehouse workers”. But it argues that new technologies could phase out mundane jobs, raise productivity levels and so deliver higher wages and “allow workers to concentrate on more human-centric roles that are beyond the reach of machines”. It found that business leaders largely believed that new technologies were more likely to alter jobs rather than eliminate them and that this, combined with the creation of new types of jobs, would lead to greater prosperity in the long run. Care homes are also trialling robots. One in Lincoln plans to use one to help residents remember daily necessities such as taking medication. The robot will also monitor their movements and habits as a nurse would. A care company in London, Three Sisters Home Care, will soon trial the use of robots for lifting people so only one care worker will be needed rather than two. Three Sisters’ chief executive, Jobeda Ali, told the researchers: “If I don’t have to send a person to do a transfer job [lifting], I can send them to have a cup of tea and a chat. This is a much better use of their time than carrying patients or cooking meals.” The prediction that millions of jobs will be lost to robots led the Trades Union Congress to warn against “shredding good jobs”. “The UK must make the most of the economic opportunities that new technologies offer,” said Frances O’Grady, general secretary of the TUC. “Robots and AI could let us produce more for less, boosting national prosperity. But we need to talk about who benefits – and how workers get a fair share. The productivity gains must be used to improve pay and conditions for workers.” Benedict Dellot, the author of the report, said the technical limitations on robots, evidenced so far by driverless cars crashing and the difficulty of getting robots to read at an adult level, would restrict the speed with which jobs will be automated. The RSA has also warned that Britain needs to invest more in robots or risk falling further behind countries including the US, France, Germany, Spain and Italy where companies are buying more robots than in the UK. “AI and robotics could solve some of the gaps and problems in the labour market with low-paid, dull, dirty, dangerous jobs that nobody really wants to fill,” Dellot said. “The technology has the potential to fundamentally improve productivity levels in the UK.” The report also warns that increasing automation could deepen economic inequality and “demographic biases could become further entrenched”. It argues that to avoid this policymakers should take control of the development of the technology by creating an ethical framework to guide the behaviour of AI and to encourage investment in “benevolent technology that enriches the worker experience”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/sep/18/the-nation-is-tiring-of-boriss-vainglorious-act","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-18T17:51:14Z","webTitle":"The nation is tiring of Boris’s vainglorious act | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/sep/18/the-nation-is-tiring-of-boriss-vainglorious-act","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/sep/18/the-nation-is-tiring-of-boriss-vainglorious-act","fields":{"headline":"The nation is tiring of Boris’s vainglorious act","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Boris Johnson certainly is yesterday’s novelty (Opinion, 18 September). When the practice of politics is now so similar to advertising, where style and appearance often matter more than substance, if the Johnson brand is not refreshed it will fall out of favour. It is inevitable that he will be replaced by a newer and more exciting brand, which is that of Jacob Rees-Mogg. Not only will going back to the old message fail to refresh the Johnson brand, it will reveal its vacuousness. Advertisers are selling a product; there is some substance to the advert, however when all that is being sold is the “appearance” of something, the advertiser will inevitably be exposed. Now, with the difficult negotiations over Brexit what a politician needs is knowledge and understanding of the EU. Any politician who lacks that will be found out, as has Boris Johnson. Phrases such as “go whistle” for the money might make a good tabloid headline, but they reveal a vacuousness in the thinking of the speaker. Derrick Joad Leeds • Matthew d’Ancona’s suggestion that Boris Johnson’s latest foray into the Brexit debate falls some way short of the statesmanship displayed by his 19th-century predecessors, Lords Palmerston and Castlereagh, forgets to mention that in his time Castlereagh was one of the most despised politicians of his age, prompting Lord Byron to suggest this epitaph: “Posterity will ne’er survey / A nobler grave than this: / Here lie the bones of Castlereagh: / Stop traveller and piss”. Graham Murdock Professor of culture and economy, Loughborough University • Johnson’s big problem is that, having been instrumental in swaying “the will of the people” to leave the EU, he now has to persist in his deceit of £350m a week for the NHS in the vainglorious hope of ousting his current leader. For the Tories Brexit has always been really about the leadership and a way for them to cling to power when, ironically, it’s their policies of austerity and privatisation that fuelled leave voters’ desire to “take back control”. We can only hope that his bid to become prime minister will mean the end of this failed government and that his party will wake up to the realisation that Johnson is prepared to sacrifice not only them but his country’s prosperity on the altar of his personal ambition. The rest of us can only hope that something better will arise, phoenix-like, from this bonfire of our democracy. Margaret Phelps Penarth, Vale of Glamorgan • Matthew d’Ancona is right. We have all had enough of Boris Johnson’s carefully rehearsed amiable buffoon act. He should leave the political stage before he does any more damage. He will find a natural home on the quiz show circuit, or perhaps as the head of a minor public school where he can entertain the boys and girls with his hilarious little quips. Andrew Colley Little Bradley, Suffolk • Theresa May probably thinks of the old maxim that it’s better to have someone inside the tent pissing out than vice versa (Better to have backseat Boris in plain sight, 18 September). What she doesn’t appear to get is that our Boris’s outpourings are so vast and profligate that, inside or out, waterproofs and umbrellas are the order of the day, not just for her and her party, but the whole of the country she is so failing to lead. Leigh Hughes Saltash, Cornwall • A throwaway reference by Boris Johnson to Jeremy Corbyn as “beardy” in his Telegraph article on Brexit provides the measure of the foreign secretary. Unable to grasp appropriate standards of respect in public life, he still appears to inhabit the mentality of the Bullingdon Club of his earlier years. Keith Flett London • I agree with John Palmer (Tory Brexit is doomed. Corbyn has a chance to build the Europe he wants, 14 September) that Labour should look to the EU if its policies for an anti-austerity recovery and greater social equality are to be achieved, as it is doubtful whether that could happen without the UK being part of a substantially reformed EU pursuing the same goals. However, he is wrong in wanting Labour to commit itself here and now to remaining in the EU. The Keir Starmer formula does by implication leave that open, but nevertheless recognises the referendum result, and failure to do this , as Palmer is recommending, would be likely to have an enormously adverse effect on Labour support, as many Labour leavers who had remained with Labour at this year’s election switched to the Tories. However, if no credible settlement was in sight by next spring, and opinion had shifted substantially to remain, then it would be right for Labour to call for the government to resign and to fight an election on a remain platform. It would be wrong to take such a position now, it may be right next year. Political parties cannot be too far in advance of public opinion.

Mark Carney was setting out his view on inflation days after the Bank’s rate-setting panel indicated it could raise interest rates for the first time in a decade. Carney said the rapid deceleration of migrant labour could lead to shortages for employers, pushing up wage growth and inflation in the short term. However, in the long term, higher levels of immigration did not push down wages or inflation, he said. In a speech in Washington, he said: “Abrupt decreases in migration could result in shortages in some sectors that have become reliant on migrant labour, and contribute more materially to inflationary pressures.” In the longer term, “Brexit could therefore ultimately have only a modest impact on prices in general equilibrium”. Carney’s intervention is significant as it follows a period of intense political debate about the impact of EU migration on wages and employment in Britain, after a copy of the government’s post-Brexit immigration blueprint was leaked to the Guardian earlier this month. Vince Cable, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, claimed Theresa May suppressed Home Office reports that found little evidence of immigration lowering UK wages. Although the governor argued there would be no long run impact on jobs and wages from Brexit discouraging EU workers, his speech is likely to be seized upon by Brexiters arguing for tighter immigration controls. But he also diffuses another argument – that Britain would be able to offset any loss of trade ties with the EU by striking new agreements with other countries, as it will take time for businesses to adapt to any new rules. The reduction and reorientation of trade is “likely to weigh on productivity for some time”, he said, while the actual impact will depend on how quickly any lost access to Europe is replaced by other arrangements. The governor also pointed to an increase in UK exports that only go to manufacturers in the EU, before being sold on to end buyers. This has the potential to limit Britain’s ability to trade directly with other countries. “The UK doesn’t so much export to Europe as through Europe; it is a supplier of components to final goods that are exported beyond the continent,” he said. Carney’s comments come after the Bank’s monetary policy committee (MPC) issued a surprise warning it could raise interest rates as early as November. Speaking in support of that stance, he described Brexit as inflationary, while saying that the rate setting panel has a responsibility to curb such trends. On balance, he said inflation remains likely to overshoot the Bank’s 2% target over the next three years, forcing the MPC’s hand. Other central banks around the world are also seeking to raise interest rates, which means “the case for a modest monetary tightening is reinforced”. Threadneedle Street has previously talked up the likelihood of a rate hike only to not follow through. But this time, there have been indications from Carney, as well as previously dovish MPC members such as Gertjan Vileghe, who was previously considered the Bank’s strongest opponent of a rate hike. The pound, which surged to its highest level since the Brexit vote in June 2016 on Friday after Vileghe made the case for rate rises, slipped back 0.8% against the dollar on Monday after Carney signalled that any hikes would be gradual and limited. While there has been a slowdown in the number of EU workers coming to Britain and fears raised over labour shortages raised by business leaders, the numbers do not yet point to a sharp decline. Figures from the Office for National Statistics show the rate of increase in EU workers coming to Britain is slowing – although yet to retreat in absolute terms. There was however a 1.1% drop in the number of workers from eight of the EU’s most recent eastern European member states, including Poland and the Czech Republic, to 997,000 in the three months to June from the same period a year ago."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/booksblog/2017/sep/21/the-ludlow-ladies-society-withdraws-from-the-2017-not-the-booker-prize","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-21T09:50:33Z","webTitle":"The Ludlow Ladies' Society withdraws from the 2017 Not the Booker prize","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2017/sep/21/the-ludlow-ladies-society-withdraws-from-the-2017-not-the-booker-prize","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/booksblog/2017/sep/21/the-ludlow-ladies-society-withdraws-from-the-2017-not-the-booker-prize","fields":{"headline":"The Ludlow Ladies' Society withdraws from the 2017 Not the Booker prize","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"After a relatively quiet couple of years here on the Not the Booker, our old friend the Lord of Chaos has swooped down to add an extra bit of excitement and drama into this year’s competition. Following on from my review of her novel The Ludlow Ladies’ Society, Ann O’Loughlin has decided to withdraw from the competition. She has asked us to post the following statement: My name is Ann O’Loughlin and I am the author of The Ludlow Ladies’ Society, published by Black &amp; White Publishing. I wish to inform you that on my instructions, Black &amp; White Publishing on Wednesday (13 September) asked the Guardian to withdraw my book from the Not the Booker shortlist. I feel a great sense of relief to be moving away from a competition that caused so much stress in my life and that of my family. As I withdraw, I would like to make a few things clear. I did not ask to be nominated for this competition. I was concerned from the off with the level of unjustifiable criticism in the Guardian comments section directed at my novel by those who had not even read it. I am very proud of The Ludlow Ladies’ Society and very grateful for the loyal readership for my novels all over the world. My work has been translated in to eight languages and is also published in the US. My readership continues to grow and my relationship with my readers is very important to me. As an author, when you send out your book for review, you must take it on the chin when the review is less than favourable. However, what is harder to take is that the review of The Ludlow Ladies’ Society contained inaccuracies and – unbelievably for a book review – a spoiler on the plot. While the Guardian did make some corrections when the errors were pointed out, following a period of reflection, I feel I no longer want to continue in the competition. The fact that the reviewer Mr Sam Jordison did not enjoy the novel or the style of writing has nothing whatsoever to do with my decision. Any attempt to say or represent otherwise would be wrong. As a writer it gladdens my heart that people all over the world love the books I write, and this is what I will now get back to doing. Thank you to all the readers who have contacted me with messages of support. I wish all the remaining shortlisted authors well. I am sad that offence was caused – I had no intention of causing Ann any personal insult. Obviously, I have my own opinion about the existence of any spoilers in my review, but this is Ann’s decision to make. What we can agree on is that we wish her very well, and that we hope that she is spared any stress in future. Meanwhile, we can focus on the remaining five books on our excellent shortlist. Despite what has happened with The Ludlow Ladies’ Society, this is turning into a vintage year of outstanding books. I’ve enjoyed some of the novels so much I’m actually worried that I’m about to bust through my annual ecstatic adjective quota. If next week’s book, Elizabeth Strout’s Anything Is Possible, is as good as the last few, it’s going to be hard to rein myself in. I also can’t wait to find out what happens in the voting and judging rounds. We have some great contenders on our hands and it’s a pleasure to be able to shine the spotlight on them. Onwards!"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/blog/2017/sep/18/sead-kolasinac-arsenal-missing-muscle-arsene-wenger","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-18T18:27:00Z","webTitle":"Sead Kolasinac adds missing muscle to Arsenal’s array of skill-gnomes | Barney Ronay","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2017/sep/18/sead-kolasinac-arsenal-missing-muscle-arsene-wenger","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2017/sep/18/sead-kolasinac-arsenal-missing-muscle-arsene-wenger","fields":{"headline":"Sead Kolasinac adds missing muscle to Arsenal’s array of skill-gnomes","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"One thing you often lose watching a football match on television is the sound levels. Not just the noise of the crowd but the noise of the players, a scale of collision and opposing force that means certain incidents, and indeed the careers of certain players, can have an entirely different register in the flesh. David Luiz’s red card against Arsenal on Sunday was one such case. Replays and stills will show a raised foot but really this was a red card you had to hear. So profound was the thunk of contact those nearby knew instantly the challenge went beyond necessary force and into the realms of dangerous excess. So, red, then. David Luiz does this kind of thing now and again. There has always been something zany about his bullocking runs, veering upfield like a dustcart on an icy incline, wheels spinning, horn parping, shearing off wing mirrors. Why he chose to do so here is perhaps more interesting. Antonio Conte suggested his player had been riled by Alexis Sánchez nipping at him from behind. The player in front of David Luiz might also have had something to do with it. It may have been a coincidence Sead Kolasinac was looming into view as David Luiz set off on his full body lunge. But the fact is Kolasinac had been outmuscling Chelsea’s right side all afternoon, to the frustration of Chelsea’s players and the home crowd. Several times Pedro simply bounced off Kolasinac in a sprint for the ball. Victor Moses, who can often overpower his direct opponent, had a poor game, unable to find space on that flank. Against Cologne on Thursday Kolasinac had spanked the equalising goal though Timo Horn with such force there was a burst of laughter mixed in with the celebration of some Arsenal fans. Here he did something similar, lifting his team simply through his controlled aggression and a basic sense of strength in reserve. Not that anyone should be getting carried away here. It is a familiar Arsenal trope to fight hard for a creditable point after losing their past two away games but there is still something significant in Kolasinac’s presence in this team. If not as an indicator of future Wenger glories – it is, after all, getting late now – then as a glimpse of something that has been missing for too long, an echo of chances missed, opportunities passed, seasons congealed because of a lack, among other things, of just this quality. Kolasinac is a fine player, a member of the Bundesliga team of the season last year. But he is above all a certain type, ambling about on legs that resemble industrial scale sacks of millet, great bulky elbows dangling at his side like a man carrying a pair of rolled-up carpets under his armpits, radiating not just power and willing, but a sense of cheerful optimism. Fans have always loved players like this. There is nothing quite like seeing one of your own walk out at some distant, prickly away ground and immediately barge his way through the toughest player in the opposing team. More to the point this is Arsenal, who have not had a player like this to admire in some time. Not least at Chelsea, where these frail late-Wenger princelings have so often been jounced and bumped off the park. When Wenger signed Kolasinac he suggested the Bosnian might be “the strongest” player he has ever worked with, praising his ability to use his power “without violence”, bumping opponents off without conceding a foul. It is tempting, as ever with the world’s most stubbornly one-note elite level manager, to wonder if there is some sort of willed amnesia in train here. Instead Kolasinac represents something half-forgotten, a note of Wengerisms past, an echo of the powerful, hard-running players who characterised his best title-winning teams. Lauren, Ashley Cole, Nigel Winterburn and Lee Dixon were high-energy full-backs, a little nasty at times. Over time the Gilberto Silva, Patrick Vieira type steadily gave way to the dinky little Velcro-touch skill-gnomes of the stadium debt years, and after that to the non-specific midfield triers of recent years. But the best Wenger teams always had a notable physical power. The last really imposing Arsenal midfield player was probably Abou Diaby, who was also famously frail. Alex Song was a good fit, allowed to leave too soon. Granit Xhaka was supposed to add drive and ballast. Danny Welbeck in full flight can be a domineering presence but it is the easy power of Kolasinac that Arsenal have lacked. There was plenty of gristle in midfield at Chelsea. Both Cesc Fàbregas and N’Golo Kanté might have been Arsenal players had things fallen differently, minor cast members in the romantic comedy of Arsène’s fumbling almost-conquests. At Stamford Bridge they were pressed back before half time by Xhaka and Aaron Ramsey, who played as a genuine midfield pair, covering one another, not playing too flat or occupying the same space. It would be over-egging it to suggest Kolasinac’s aggression had an effect here, a contagion spreading in from his flank, but he was a constant driving presence on the left side. To date he has had more touches per 90 minutes than any other full- or wing-back in the Premier League. He has more assists per 90 minutes than any other defender. Only Moses has made more fouls among defenders. After the match Thierry Henry suggested Kolasinac should switch with Nacho Monreal and play deeper to harness better his exceptional one-on-one defending. But given the particular needs of late-Wenger Arsenal there is something hugely appealing about Kolasinac further upfield in this team, a stiffening effect, like a gust of warm air on a cold day. There are probably two things worth taking from this. First, Chelsea will find other opponents pressing them hard. All four Chelsea red cards so far have come from the same kind of incident, a player overstretching into a tackle under pressure. This may be a coincidence. But it is also possible opponents are steeling themselves to press and rattle and harry Chelsea, to match that high-energy pressing game, as Burnley and Arsenal have. For Arsenal it is far too early to interpret the spirit shown in the past two games as some kind of turning point. More likely Kolasinac’s fine form might just summon a note of regret, a sense of chances missed and seasons gone sour, that early-Wenger dynasty of strong technical football neglected in the mannered drift of the last few years."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2017/sep/17/jeremy-corbyn-will-back-change-to-allow-tough-line-on-antisemitism","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-17T21:00:51Z","webTitle":"Jeremy Corbyn will back change to allow tough line on antisemitism","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/sep/17/jeremy-corbyn-will-back-change-to-allow-tough-line-on-antisemitism","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/sep/17/jeremy-corbyn-will-back-change-to-allow-tough-line-on-antisemitism","fields":{"headline":"Jeremy Corbyn will back change to allow tough line on antisemitism","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Jeremy Corbyn is to back a significant rule change so Labour can take a tougher line on antisemitic abuse, which supporters hope will send a signal at the party’s conference that it is serious about tackling hate. Supporters of the motion say it is vital the party has a unified position on the new antisemitism motion when it is agreed by Labour’s ruling national executive committee (NEC) on Tuesday, although the exact wording of the rule change was still being fiercely debated late on Sunday. Momentum, the party’s leftwing grassroots movement, has said its support for the motion is not assured and will depend on the final wording. Its backers, including the Jewish Labour Movement (JLM), have argued there is a need to make a significant gesture in order to win back Jewish voters. The proposed change would also mean a tougher stance on sexism, Islamophobia, racism and homophobia. At the moment, party members cannot be disciplined for “the mere holding or expression of beliefs and opinions”. But the motion, which will be voted on by members at the party’s conference in Brighton next week, argues that rule should not apply to those who express racist, sexist, Islamophobic, homophobic or antisemitic views. The proposed change has been brought by JLM, the largest group of Jewish Labour members and supporters, who say the current wording led to a more lenient approach to remarks by the former mayor of London, Ken Livingstone, that were widely perceived as antisemitic, when he was found by the party to have breached the rules. Mike Katz, JLM’s national vice-chair, said it was crucial that the final wording of the motion had support from all sides. “We need a rule change that is fit for purpose,” he said. “Fix this and we start fixing the relationship between the party and the Jewish community – not just the right thing to do, but it helps us get closer to winning back seats in Jewish areas we narrowly lost out on in June.” A Labour source said Corbyn was in favour of the change in principle. “Jeremy is committed to tackling antisemitism and is hopeful that the NEC will pass this motion,” the source said. The change has already been agreed in principle by Labour’s equalities committee and will be debated when the full NEC meets on Tuesday to decide the motions delegates will vote on in Brighton. Senior Labour sources backing the JLM motion said they were still concerned it may be watered down before it goes before conference. Some leftwing party activists, including the shadow fire minister, Chris Williamson, have accused Corbyn’s critics of “weaponising antisemitism” in order to attack the leader’s supporters. In a conference voting guide published this week, Labour Party Marxists called on delegates to oppose the motion, calling it “anti-democratic” and likely to stifle free speech. “This is supported by the Jewish Labour Movement, which already tells you that you should probably oppose without even having to read it,” the voting guide reads, adding that the motion “removes the need to rely on rational evidence”. A Momentum source said the group was committed to backing new measures for tackling antisemitism, pointing out that several of the group’s founders, including its chair, Jon Lansman, are Jewish and have suffered antisemitic abuse. However, the source said some members of the group had concerns about the wording of the JLM motion but said the group was not planning to take a specific stance to support or oppose the specific rule change. Richard Angell, the director of Labour’s centrist pressure group Progress, said it was vital the final wording of the motion could still command the support of JLM. “It is time to draw a line under antisemitism in Labour party, have the powers to act when people like Ken Livingstone go out and offend so many British Jews and ensure the Jewish community that supports Labour can flourish in the party,” he said. “It is crucial that the final wording agreed by the NEC has the support of JLM. It is time to unite the party and make clear: antisemitism is not welcome in Labour.” Labour NEC member Alice Perry, who sits on the equalities committee, said the motion would show that the party was committed to standing up to racism. “Labour and the NEC are fully committed to tackling all forms of hate and prejudice,” she said. “Jeremy Corbyn has a proud record of standing up to all forms of racism wherever it takes place.” Katz, who was Labour candidate for Hendon, said concerns about antisemitism had potentially cost the party three seats with high Jewish populations in north London – which would have been enough to deny the Conservatives a majority even with the Democratic Unionist party deal. “This could be a big, healing moment for the party in taking a significant step forward in the fight against antisemitism and all hate speech - if it gets it right,” he said. The NEC meeting is also due to debate a package of party reforms that will be presented by the leader’s office. Though the detail of the reforms is being kept under wraps, party sources suggested they could include more seats on the NEC for ordinary party members, which would be likely to swing the balance on the governing body in favour of Corbynites. However, trade unions, which make up a large chunk of the NEC, are likely to be wary of accepting any reforms that dilute their influence on the committee. The key vote will be on the so-called McDonnell amendment, named after the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, who had favoured reducing the number of MPs needed to nominate a leadership candidate to get their name on the ballot. Activists have proposed reducing the threshold from 15% to 5% of MPs and MEPs, but a compromise deal of 10% is to be proposed by the TSSA union. Labour NEC member Christine Shawcroft, who sits on Momentum’s steering committee, said MPs had been the “gatekeepers of the nominations” for party leader and that the party needed to democratise further. “It’s about making sure members can have their say and that MPs aren’t acting as a block,” she told the BBC’s Sunday Politics. Asked if Momentum and others on the left of the party were planning to introduce mandatory reselection of MPs, Shawcroft said: “No one wants to hound out anyone, we want a democratic say in our representatives, which is the most basic right you can have. Momentum is not campaigning for mandatory reselection.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/sep/18/tied-up-in-nots-same-sex-marriage-divides-last-bastion-of-australian-opposition","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-17T18:00:47Z","webTitle":"Tied up in nots: same-sex marriage divides last bastion of Australian opposition","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/sep/18/tied-up-in-nots-same-sex-marriage-divides-last-bastion-of-australian-opposition","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/sep/18/tied-up-in-nots-same-sex-marriage-divides-last-bastion-of-australian-opposition","fields":{"headline":"Tied up in nots: same-sex marriage divides last bastion of Australian opposition","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"“I’m 50-50, sitting on the fence – on barbed wire, you might say.” The undecided man in his 70s, poring over betting slips with his wife at the local club in the Queensland town of Warwick, says he is not much bothered by same-sex marriage, since it doesn’t affect him. “You’re going to have to make up your mind,” his wife reminds him sharply. The nationwide postal survey forms that could decide whether the Australian parliament legalises same-sex marriage are already in the mail, and she declares her vote will be a resounding “no”, adding: “The Bible says it’s wrong and that’s all there is to it.” The former colonial frontier town of 15,000 is the biggest in Maranoa, a sprawling outback federal electorate three times the size of the UK, and thought to be the country’s last main bastion of opposition to same-sex marriage. But even in Warwick, couples and families are divided by the government’s move to put same-sex marriage to a survey, before deciding whether to follow an array of other liberal democracies and legalise it. The wife at the club confides their son is gay and the question of marriage equality has been the cause of “a lot of argument between us, and I think it would be for a lot of people”. Last year, Maranoa was the only electorate in the country to oppose same-sex marriage outright, according to analysis of voter surveys. That puts it out of step with the rest of Australia, if that analysis and an array of opinion polls hold water. As the campaign enters its second week, signs the yes case has the upper hand are balanced by uncertainty about whether a silent majority – less politically engaged and tending to not to be reflected in opinion polls – will produce a different result. Some opponents have resorted to homophobic propaganda through unofficial leaflets and posters. Contrary to one Christian lobbyist’s claim the no side faced a “David and Goliath” contest, the official no campaign has so far outspent marriage equality supporters five to one on TV advertising. That is a space to watch, after Qantas airline boss Alan Joyce, an Irish-born gay man, last week personally donated $1m to the yes campaign. Leading parliamentarians, including the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull and the opposition leader, Bill Shorten, support marriage equality. Vocal opponents include Turnbull’s predecessors, Tony Abbott and John Howard, who have linked the issue to a broader culture war and a secular progressive attack on churches. The conservative Christian senator Corey Bernardi launched the official no campaign in Sydney on Saturday with the declaration “we’re under assault because we’re on the right side of legal and moral history”. Back at the club in Warwick, a retired pilot tells the Guardian gay marriage is an unfathomable development to a generation that remembers when “homosexuality was something you could be prosecuted for”. It was in 1989 in Roma, another Maranoa town, that the last charges were laid under Queensland’s homosexuality laws. They came in the dying days of rule by the conservative rural National party, which had governed for decades under Joh Bjelke-Petersen, a Lutheran preacher’s son who reportedly told his health minister Aids was God’s punishment for Aboriginal people. But even in Joh country, times change. In his home town of Kingaroy, the high school has backed its first openly transgender students. Gavin Walker, 16, was born Gabrielle, and harassed in year 8 over a same-sex relationship before his transition. But when he became Gavin the “whole school was exceptionally supportive and the transition went fairly seamlessly”, his mother Sandy says. “I think the whole newness of the same-sex thing had kind of rubbed off by then, so it was just, ‘oh, OK, cool’,” she says. Gavin has an 18-year-old transgender sibling who was born Megan and is now Matt. Gavin “carved out the way” for his older brother and two other Kingaroy teens since to make the transition, Sandy says. In Roma, a town of about 7,000, public servant Mitchell Greig says he is more comfortable being openly gay there than in Brisbane and Melbourne, where showing affection was sometimes an invitation for abuse. “I’ve been out here for six years and I’ve lived in Melbourne and Brisbane and you could never go to a normal club and be yourself without any dramas,” he said. “Out here it’s never been an issue. I had a partner for the first two years and that was never a drama.” But neither the yes nor no campaigns have had any visibility in Roma, Greig says. Likewise in places deep in the outback like Charleville, according to local mayor Annie Liston. Liston says she will vote yes as “I’m supporting whatever makes people happy”. “I’m not against, I don’t give it thought, same-sex marriage doesn’t make any difference to me whatsoever.” Benjamin Wilson, who came to Warwick five years ago with his wife, Mandy, says the issue of same-sex marriage is not being talked about much. “We did have a guy putting leaflets in our letterbox the other day from the no campaign – the Coalition for Marriage, I think,” he says. “He believes that if the change in law goes ahead, parents are going to lose their right to decide if their children are allowed sex changes or not and he believes that homosexuality is against God. “I just handed them back to him. I don’t think anyone has a right to tell people who they can and can’t marry.” In Maranoa, as elsewhere, even some Christian couples are divided on legalising same-sex marriage. Ricky and Nora Masculino, who came from the Philippines to settle in Warwick seven years ago, are Seventh Day Adventists. Nora says she opposes same-sex marriage “because we’re Christians, so we’re following what God has ordained, what’s in the Bible”. But Ricky looks beyond religion. “As a Christian, I would definitely say no – when we’re talking about Christians,” he says. But he agreed with legalising same-sex marriage outside his church. “We came from the Philippines and the yes [vote] wouldn’t win in our country. But we’re here in Australia, and other kinds of country like the USA, the United Kingdom, same-sex marriage is – they’re talking about respecting others’ beliefs and decisions and hearts.” The MP for Maranoa, David Littleproud, is not campaigning one way or the other, and will back the majority view in his electorate. If the yes case wins, Littleproud says the legislation will be passed by Christmas and his electorate will “get on with their lives”. “They’ll be worried about when it’s going to rain, what they’re going to get for their commodity prices, how they’re going to pay for their electricity bills,” he says. Littleproud says he resents attempts to portray his electorate as the last holdout of bigotry. “Because we live in small communities, we are more tolerant of variances in views and I think we are a shining light on how this whole debate can be done in such a respectful manner.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/sep/18/wallabies-killer-instinct-eventually-emerges-in-win-over-pumas","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-17T18:00:47Z","webTitle":"Wallabies' killer instinct eventually emerges in win over Pumas | Bret Harris","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/sep/18/wallabies-killer-instinct-eventually-emerges-in-win-over-pumas","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/sep/18/wallabies-killer-instinct-eventually-emerges-in-win-over-pumas","fields":{"headline":"Wallabies' killer instinct eventually emerges in win over Pumas","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Michael Cheika’s grin stretched from ear to ear. And who could blame him? The Wallabies had just beaten Argentina 45-20 in chilly Canberra on Saturday night, their first win in the Rugby Championship and their first victory against anyone since beating Italy in June. After challenging the All Blacks in Dunedin and drawing with the Springboks in Perth, the Pumas offered the Wallabies an opportunity to learn how to win again and they took it, scoring six tries to two, including a double to fullback Israel Folau. But this is a win that needs to be put into perspective. The Pumas are the 10th-ranked team in world rugby. Argentina has a policy of not selecting its Europe-based players, who are some of its best. They have recorded just one win this year, against minnows Georgia in July. This Test was non-negotiable for the Wallabies. Losing to Argentina on Australian soil for the first time since 1983 would not have been tolerated by a disenchanted rugby public. Yet, at half-time former Australia captain and current Australian Rugby Union director John Eales claimed the Pumas had the blueprint to beat the Wallabies. Argentina led 13-10 at half-time after successfully attacking the transition zone close to the ruck with hard, straight running and short passing. The Wallabies missed 17 tackles in the first half, Cheika admitting they were lucky to be behind by only three points. If they were playing the All Blacks, they would have been down by 30. But the second half gave the Wallabies a chance to demonstrate a quality that most observers believed they lacked, a killer instinct. Cheika often talks about identity, but this Wallabies team has multiple personalities or at least dual personalities. The Wallabies were appalling in the first half, their attack let down by poor handling skills and simple errors. Their kicking game was also very ordinary: either aimless or misdirected, it was hard to tell. There was one touch of brilliance from the Wallabies in the first half when Folau scored in the 28th minute after an attacking movement that swept from one side of the field to the other and involved several pairs of hands. It was really quite beautiful and showed what the Wallabies were capable of, but it was just a fleeting moment in an otherwise unimpressive display. Cheika claimed he did not have to saying anything to the players at half-time. Instead, he asked them what they thought was wrong and they replied a lack of urgency. Coincidentally, that was exactly the problem the coach had identified. Great minds think alike. The Wallabies increased their urgency in the second half and looked like a completely different team. And they were. The difference between the Wallabies’ play in the first half and the second half had nothing to do with any great tactical manoeuvres or rousing motivational speeches. They simply held onto the ball, that’s what did the trick. It took the Wallabies only 12 minutes to gain control of the game, leading 24-13 after tries to prop Sekope Kepu and Folau. Midway through the second half the Wallabies’ scramble defence denied the Pumas a try in the right hand corner. That was the game. Argentina was never coming back from there. The Pumas are only a 60-minute team. They have been outscored 80-6 in the last 20 minutes of their previous Tests this year. It was all over, but the question was would the Wallabies relax? They didn’t, putting the Argentinians to the sword with the kind of ruthlessness the All Blacks are renowned for. So which Wallabies team will show up in Bloemfontein when they play the Springboks in two weeks? And which South African team for that matter after the Springboks’ 57-0 loss to the All Blacks in Albany last Saturday. The answer to the latter question can be found in the Wallabies’ own experience. After their 54-34 loss to the All Blacks in Sydney the Australians rebounded to nearly pull off a major upset against New Zealand in Dunedin. That is the response the Wallabies should expect from the Springboks. As for the Wallabies, if the team that played the first half against Argentina shows up in Bloemfontein, they will lose, but if it is the team that played the second half, they might just have a chance to record a rare win at altitude. And that would certainly be something to smile about."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"society/2017/sep/21/pregabalin-new-valium-class-c-drug-deaths","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-21T16:06:19Z","webTitle":"Pregabalin, known as 'new valium', to be made class C drug after deaths","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/sep/21/pregabalin-new-valium-class-c-drug-deaths","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/sep/21/pregabalin-new-valium-class-c-drug-deaths","fields":{"headline":"Pregabalin, known as 'new valium', to be made class C drug after deaths","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A prescription drug described as the “new valium” is to be classified as a class C controlled substance after it was linked to a growing number of UK deaths. Pregabalin – a substance used to treat nerve pain, epilepsy and anxiety – is increasingly being handed out too readily and being used recreationally, according to doctors and pharmacists. They say that when it is mixed with other substances it can lead to overdose. Deaths connected to pregabalin have risen from four in 2012 to 111 last year, according to the Office for National Statistics. Data provided by NHS Digital shows that prescriptions for pregabalin have shot up more than 11-fold in the last decade, from 476,102 in 2006 to 5,547,560 last year. The government has now accepted in principle that pregabalin should be reclassified as a class C controlled substance, which would mean patients could not obtain a repeat prescription. Yasir Abbasi, a consultant psychiatrist and clinical director for addiction services at Mersey Care NHS foundation trust, said the rising prescription numbers were worrying as, if used inappropriately, pregabalin could be hazardous. “Doctors need to be cautious about who they are giving it to and be aware of the potential of the drug to be misused and the fact it could be addictive because there is not much information at the moment. The drug was approved for medical use in 2004 and we need more robust evidence,” Abbasi said. Addaction, the largest drug and alcohol charity, is calling for GPs to be given guidance about how to prescribe pregabalin, particularly to people with substance misuse history. The charity noted that deaths linked to the drug had risen more quickly than those linked to new psychoactive substances. Rachel Britton, Addaction’s lead pharmacist, said: “The deaths linked to it – that will be people taking a cocktail of substances that affect the central nervous system eg heroin, pregabalin and benzodiazepines. It eventually depresses respiration, controlled by the brain, and people who take these cocktails die.” Those who use pregabalin recreationally call it “Budweiser” because it induces a state similar to drunkenness. It makes users feel relaxed and euphoric in a similar way to tranquilisers. It can also enhance the euphoric effects of other drugs, such as opiates, and is likely to increase the risks when taken in this way. Abbasi said that those misusing pregabalin included people who took it on top of other drugs but also those who were prescribed it who, without talking to their doctor, then started taking a higher dose. Testimony from doctors, pharmacists and drug counsellors, who were responding to a Guardian callout, suggests abuse of the drug is widespread. One emergency medicine nurse, who asked to remain anonymous, said her department had seen five cases a month since summer 2016, when someone had overdosed. She said: “Most people who are affected are those with other addiction problems, and ‘pregabs’ is taken along with other substances.” A family doctor working in Scotland, who also asked for anonymity, said: “Pregabalin is overprescribed by GPs and other doctors for all types of pain despite it only being licensed for neuropathic pain and generalised anxiety disorder. Others easily access it off the internet. It is used by drug users in order to enhance the effects of other drugs they are taking … This is only going to increase as the prescription of both continues to increase.” Another anonymous respondent, who works in a hostel, said: “Pregabalin has been the cause of several residents overdosing after using this with other substances. In this environment we suspect residents who are prescribed Pregabalin for anxiety and pain of dealing it to other residents … Over the last six months paramedics have been called out over half a dozen times due to these incidents and it is only through pure luck no one has died and feels only a matter of time before this happens.” Pharmacists were originally advised not to accept requests for cheaper, generic versions of the drug, but this changed in July, when Pfizer’s patent expired. There are concerns that this has prompted a further rise in the drug’s misuse. A statement from Pfizer said: “When prescribed and administered appropriately, pregabalin is an important and effective treatment option for many adults living with chronic neuropathic pain, generalised anxiety disorder and epilepsy.” Earlier this year the British Medical Association (BMA) called for the drug to be made a controlled substance in the UK in the same class as steroids and valium. Last year the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs wrote a letter to the government making the same recommendation. It would mean the drug could not be repeat-dispensed and prescriptions would only be valid for one month. The letter warned of the risk of addiction for both pregabalin and a similar drug called gabapentin. The minister for crime, safeguarding and vulnerability, Sarah Newton, said: “Any death related to misuse of drugs is a tragedy and that is why we have published a comprehensive new drugs strategy to tackle the illicit drug trade, protect the most vulnerable and help those with drug dependency to recover and turn their lives around. “We have accepted the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs advice to control pregabalin and gabapentin as class C drugs in principle, subject to the outcome of a public consultation to assess the impact on the healthcare sector. We will launch the consultation shortly.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2017/sep/20/it-takes-just-4-years-to-detect-human-warming-of-the-oceans","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-20T10:00:15Z","webTitle":"It takes just 4 years to detect human warming of the oceans | John Abraham","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2017/sep/20/it-takes-just-4-years-to-detect-human-warming-of-the-oceans","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2017/sep/20/it-takes-just-4-years-to-detect-human-warming-of-the-oceans","fields":{"headline":"It takes just 4 years to detect human warming of the oceans","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"We’ve known for decades that the Earth is warming, but a key question is, how fast? Another key question is whether the warming is primarily caused by human activities. If we can more precisely measure the rate of warming and the natural component, it would be useful for decision makers, legislators, and others to help us adapt and cope. Indeed, added ocean heat content underlies the potential for dangerous intense hurricanes. An answer to the “how fast?” question was partly answered in an Opinion piece just published on Eos.org, the daily online Earth and space science news site, by scientists from China, Europe and the United States. I was fortunate enough to be part of the research team. To measure how fast the globe is warming, we focused on the extra heat that is being trapped in the climate. The key to measuring the extra heat is by comparing the incoming and outgoing energy – just like you watch your bank account, keeping track of income and expenses to tell whether your bank balance will increase or not. Okay so how do we measure these incoming and outgoing flows? In our view, the best way is in the oceans. We know that the oceans absorb almost all of the excess heat – so, perhaps we can detect energy increases in ocean waters? Measuring the oceans is challenging. They are vast and they are deep – measurements can be noisy. Detecting a long-term trend (a signal) within the noise can be a challenge. But this challenge is exactly what we focused on. We wanted to know how large the signal-to-noise ratio is for ocean heat measurements because this would tell us how many years of data are needed to detect warming. Can we detect global warming with one year of measurements? With a decade? Or do we need multiple decades of measurements to be sure the climate is changing? Our work shows that scientists need less than 4 years of ocean heat measurements to detect a warming signal. This is much shorter than the nearly three decades of measurements that would be required to detect global warming if we were to use temperatures of air near the Earth’s surface. It is also slightly better than the nearly 5 years of sea level rise data that are needed for detecting a long-term trend. This means that the warming is not natural, but rather stems from the human-induced climate change, primarily from increases in heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere. This finding should help change the way we talk about global warming. Normally scientists and the public wait for the official annual “global temperatures” to be released (every January or February) by major research groups like Nasa, Noaa, and the Hadley Centre in the UK. Avid consumers of global warming news often use these air temperatures to “prove” or “disprove” global warming. If it was hot last year, “its global warming!” If last year was cool, “global warming is over!” But the year-to-year fluctuations of air temperatures are predominantly associated with El Niño and weather variability and mislead those who use any one year as climate-change proof. We saw the impact of fluctuations over the past two decades where a slowing of the rise of global surface temperatures led to false claims that global warming had “stopped” or that there was a “hiatus.” No such cessation occurred for ocean heat content. Hence global ocean heat content data isn’t so noisy. It represents the total thermal energy in the ocean waters, and is now known with a high degree of certainty (see the figure below), in part because scientists have improved ocean temperature sensing methods and increased the number of sensors throughout the ocean waters. According to our analysis, the top 10 warmest years of ocean heat content are all in the most recent decade (following 2006) with last two years being the hottest. The heat storage in the ocean corresponds to 3×1023 Joules (a 3 with twenty-three zeroes after it) since 1960. Prior to the 1980s, values are not as well known, and the global record is unreliable prior to about 1960. In the most recent 25 years, the Earth has gained approximately 0.7 Watts for every square meter of surface area. That may not sound like much but think about how many square meters are required to cover the surface of the Earth. To put these numbers in perspective, the heat increase in the oceans since 1992 is about 2000 times the total net generation of electricity in the USA in the past decade. We believe, and argue, that ocean heat content is the key to quantifying how fast the climate is changing, and it has important implications for regional patterns of climate. According to Trenberth: A key reason for the exceptionally active Atlantic hurricane season this year is because of the regional build-up of ocean heat along with its global warming component that fuels hurricanes. “Ocean Heat Content” should become a standard metric not only for measuring climate change but for testing our computer models that are used to predict the future climate."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/16/a-mile-and-a-world-apart-juggalos-and-trump-fans-descend-on-washington","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-16T20:44:34Z","webTitle":"A mile and a world apart, Juggalos and Trump fans descend on Washington","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/16/a-mile-and-a-world-apart-juggalos-and-trump-fans-descend-on-washington","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/16/a-mile-and-a-world-apart-juggalos-and-trump-fans-descend-on-washington","fields":{"headline":"A mile and a world apart, Juggalos and Trump fans descend on Washington","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The genteel air of Washington DC’s national mall was disrupted by people in face paint and people keen to make America great again on Saturday afternoon. Hundreds of Juggalos – fans of the horrorcore rap group Insane Clown Posse – gathered to protest the FBI’s designation of them as a “gang”, while, nearby, hundreds of Donald Trump supporters gathered to cheer the president. The Juggalo March had been planned for more than a year and drew music fans from across the US in a bid to change the group’s reputation. Juggalos – their name is taken from an Insane Clown Posse song – were described in a 2011 FBI report as a “gang”, a label they said has led to discrimination from police and in the workplace. The pro-Trump crowd, meanwhile, were assembled for a rally designed to give the president a signal of their support as Trump struggles through the early months of his first term. Hundreds of Juggalos, many with their faces painted in the black and white style popularized by band members Violent J and Shaggy 2 Dope, spent the afternoon in front of the Lincoln Memorial, at the west end of the national mall. With Abraham Lincoln’s giant statue looking on, Juggalos erected a stage and sound system and blasted hip-hop music as they chanted “family”, painted each others’ faces, and occasionally sprayed each other with the soft drink Faygo – a signature Insane Clown Posse move that some fans have described as a baptism. Todd Okan, 35, said he was pulled over by police in Sacramento, California, because he had stickers of Insane Clown Posse’s “hatchet man” mascot on his car. “They said these symbols are considered a gang symbol,” Okan said. “They were asking me, like: ‘Are you a leader of this gang?’” Okan, an accounting auditor, said he was not in a gang. “I was like: ‘This is the music I listen to’.” A mile to the east, on the other side of the looming Washington Monument, the pro-Trump “mother of all rallies” was taking place. The crowd for Donald Trump’s inauguration ceremony, held on the mall in January, was famously less than that for his predecessor – despite the president’s insistence otherwise – and the attendance at this rally was also smaller than expected. Organizers had promised that “thousands” of Trump supporters would be at the rally, but instead there were only around 400 enthusiasts. Given the events in Charlottesville in August, when a right-wing demonstration ended in the death of anti-racism activist Heather Heyer, there had been concern about the nature of the rally, but on Saturday afternoon all seemed calm. The crowd gathered in a space the size of a football field on the lush grass of the mall, where they listened to sporadic pledges of allegiance and country music. The supporters milled around amiably, some picnicking on the grass, others holding American flags aloft. Tahnee Gonzalez, 31, was carrying a cloth banner that depicted Trump, holding an assault rifle, standing ontop of a tank which was firing its own weaponry. There was also an eagle on it. Gonzalez had travelled from Phoenix, Arizona to attend the rally. She said she decided to come to “show the fake news that there is support for our president”. “It’s America first now. We can no longer support any other country until ours is completely united and strong again,” she said. “I want my fellow millennials to know they need to rise up before it’s too late.” There was little similarity between the Juggalo and Trump events – although facepainting was also available at the “mother of all rallies” – and with the distance of the Reflecting Pool between them, there seemed little chance of any crossover."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/16/hurrican-irma-jose-diary-anguilla-reporter","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-16T23:05:25Z","webTitle":"Hurricane Irma diary: ‘3am: I'm truly exhausted, my body has been operating on overdrive'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/16/hurrican-irma-jose-diary-anguilla-reporter","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/16/hurrican-irma-jose-diary-anguilla-reporter","fields":{"headline":"Hurricane Irma diary: ‘3am: I'm truly exhausted, my body has been operating on overdrive'","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Friday 8 September I woke at 3am this morning. I prepared a bucket bath. Being from the countryside in Dominica I did not always have the privilege of running water indoors, so this was not something uncommon for me. On Anguilla, with only a few salt ponds, no river and no running water, even a bucket bath from a water tank is now a luxury. I popped in my contact lenses from the plastic cups I had stored them in the night before. I had lost my contacts casing when Hurricane Irma hit, somewhere between the flung-away shutters, the uprooted walls and the flooded carpeted floors and walls. With no streetlights, even with my contacts it was difficult to see clearly. To get to work at Radio Anguilla, I managed to manoeuvre around debris, electrical poles and upturned trailers and containers in the middle of the road. At the radio station, I took a walk with the morning announcer and we ran into someone who she knew. The stranger expressed the pain she felt of not being able to get her very sick husband airlifted out to Trinidad for crucial medical treatment. She also said she did not understand what the fuss was about “the UK not doing enough”. “What else do we want? The people got here the next day … We should stop being ungrateful; what could they have done during the hurricane?” Throughout the day, people were still contacting me on Twitter with the names of their missing relatives and I would immediately send out an announcement on the radio. We are still in recovery mode from Irma but already bracing for Hurricane Jose. Imagine having already lost your home, hospital and health centres, schools and churches and now you’re boarding up again awaiting another “catastrophe”. I remember quite vividly a wide-eyed taxi driver popping into the stations convinced that he had a message for the Anguillan people. I let him on air, where he spoke out against the government – and I immediately played the disclaimer. It’s a government-owned radio station after all. Tonight I’m pulling an all-nighter at work. I’ve lost track of what could have been more than 50 calls from people on the ground asking: ‘Wah time the hurricane comin’ again?’ Saturday 9 September It is 3am and I am truly exhausted, my body has been operating on overdrive – I am about to crash on an airbed in the front office of the station. Later, I met a tearful business owner called Mirabelle West. The hurricane had reduced her business to rubble but she was also a victim to looting of alcohol right in her presence. Why people were stealing alcohol at a time like this is still puzzling to me. At 11.30am my mom collected me after her 12-hour night shift from the hospital. We had very little time to make preparations for Hurricane Jose. It was already downgraded to a tropical storm warning by then. We stopped at the only store that was open for last-minute items, and it felt like we were standing in line forever – the supermarket was kind enough to let us in even after the shop was closed because of my mother’s nursing uniform. At 6pm we received the all-clear. Hurricane Jose was heading in another direction. We were eternally grateful. Sunday 10 September Anguilla was spared by Hurricane Jose, but we knew of the slow but gruesome work ahead in restoring the extensive damage sustained from Irma. Meanwhile, being a predominantly Christian community many people took to ministerial deliverance. Radio Anguilla even arranged its own “church service”. It is now noon on Anguilla, I am at Radio Anguilla. A politician is ranting on air, stating that the devastation on Anguilla is primarily due to the “ignorance of some Anguillans who became lackadaisical and built homes with zinc roofs”. My question to him was: “What then do you say about government structures that were torn apart during Hurricane Irma, while civil servants risked their lives to serve?” He replied that the “structures are old”. I was disappointed. Monday 11 September I woke at 6am today, my day started after I had my usual bucket bath. I went in to Radio Anguilla but due to growing tension I decided it best to volunteer at the National Emergency Operations Centre (NEOC). I walked over to the centre and was granted the post of public information officer. By 1pm I was sitting in with the deputy governor and the president of the NEOC writing a press release which outlined that the government aimed to have services such as tourism, health and education functioning within the next six months and that banks were working towards a Wednesday opening. I sent it out and retired at 6pm for a much-needed rest. Tuesday 12 September The restoration of Anguilla continues … Gas stations have been opened since yesterday, but today I witnessed what I believe was the longest line ever to be seen on Anguilla. People were even leaving vehicles unattended and having heated arguments. One woman tried using the roundabout as a means to cut the line saying that she had the “right of way” . In these times people are desperate. The owner of a car rental firm had called the radio station on Saturday morning, he mentioned that persons were stealing gas from his parked cars and “anyone caught would be shot on sight”. Of course, I could not relay that message to the Anguillan people, but like I said, people were getting more desperate. Wednesday 13 September Tensions are growing and things are now quite political. I did an interview with the BBC and they wanted to know if the visit from the foreign secretary had inspired confidence in the UK efforts to restore Anguilla, and whether I thought the UK was doing enough. Personally, I can attest to the presence of the chief minster, the governor, the deputy governor, the leader of the opposition, and other political officials within the community. I can also account for the British presence on Anguilla, assisting with the restoration efforts. It is a sad situation, but Anguillans are doing their utmost with the help of the UK. Truly, it is a matter of exercising patience and regrouping and rebuilding community spirit and efforts to restore what was once known as paradise. Thursday 14 September It is after 9am and there is still no electricity and no running water. In the afternoon, I return to the NEOC to help with a press release. It announced that electricity was being restored on the island with priority being given to critical facilities such as the Princess Alexandra hospital and areas along that route. Lunch was provided, but unfortunately I had an allergic reaction and had to be rushed to the emergency room. After receiving medical attention, I wandered around the hospital looking for my mother and ran into a family friend. He was excited to introduce me to his newborn baby. She was adorable, a true miracle being born in the early hours of the morning. Sadly enough, the generator had failed during the delivery and fortunately his phone light had come to the rescue. Wow. It’s now 8:29pm, I’m unsure of what time I’ll be able to wake up tomorrow, to be frank I’m afraid as to whether I’ll wake up at all. I admit my body is under strain. Friday 15 September In the next two weeks, my mom and I are due for our long-awaited trip to the UK, one that had been planned since January. We think it best to continue with our plan to reconnect with family members in Europe. We are both committed to helping the restoration of Anguilla because we still believe that Anguilla is a gem and the people are truly amazing. A month ago, I made the decision to resign from the Anguilla Public Service. My next step? I do not know for certain. What I am sure of, however, is that with persistence and resilience I envision the restoration of Anguilla. We thank the global community for their support."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/sep/16/dover-arrest-parson-green-tube-bomb","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-16T19:46:00Z","webTitle":"Police search Surrey house as teenager held over tube bomb","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/sep/16/dover-arrest-parson-green-tube-bomb","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/sep/16/dover-arrest-parson-green-tube-bomb","fields":{"headline":"Police search Surrey house as teenager held over tube bomb","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"An 18-year-old man is being questioned by counterterrorism officers after being arrested in Dover in the wake of the Parsons Green bomb attack in west London. Police described the arrest as “significant” after seizing the man in the port area of Dover at 7.50am before taking him from Kent to a south London police station. It was the first breakthrough in the huge investigation to track down the individual or network behind the attack on a London tube train. Six hours later the inquiry widened further when armed police raided a home in the suburb of Sunbury-on-Thames, Surrey, in an operation during which residents were ordered to evacuate surrounding homes immediately. Mojgan Jamali, a mother of three who lives in Cavendish Road, said: “They told me to leave. They said: ‘You have one minute to get out of the house and get away’.” The property that was raided is registered to foster carers Penelope Jones, 71, and her husband Ronald, 88, who were awarded MBEs in the 2009 New Year honours list for services to children and families. With the terror threat level in the UK still at its highest, hundreds of officers are attempting to piece together how many individuals were behind the planting of the improvised explosive device on a packed rush-hour tube carriage on Friday morning. At least 30 people were injured in the attack, and three remain in hospital. The possibility of a cell remaining at large was raised by the Met’s deputy assistant commissioner, Neil Basu, who said police were “keeping an open mind” on whether there was more than one person involved in the attack and its planning. “If there are other people responsible it’s our job to find them,” he added. Earlier Scotland Yard’s most senior officer, Cressida Dick, speaking as she joined officers on patrol in central London, declared the capital would not be cowed by terrorism and urged people to remain vigilant in the face of what she described as a “shift in threat”. Friday’s terror attack was the fifth in the UK this year with at least seven other significant plots known to have been foiled, making it the most sustained period of terror activity in England since the IRA bombing campaign of the 1970s. Armed police are to remain on duty throughout the country while troops have been deployed to guard key infrastructure and transport hubs following the Joint Terrorism Assessment Centre’s decision on Friday to raise the threat level to critical, indicating another attack is expected imminently. Although police were keen to play up the significance of the arrest on the south coast, the Met said it would not be revealing where the suspect was from, whether he was the suspected bomber or the precise details of the offence for which he was arrested. The location of the arrest has, however, led investigators to believe the 18-year-old was intending to head abroad. Dover is the busiest ferry hub in Europe with dozens of crossings a day to Calais alone. A police presence remained around the port area with one witness describing seeing three unmarked police cars with their sirens on leaving the Eastern Docks ferry terminal at around 12.30pm. The home secretary, Amber Rudd, confirmed that the arrest was “very significant” but also that the attack could easily have caused significantly more harm, with the improvised device seemingly failing to detonate fully. Speaking after an emergency meeting of the government’s emergency Cobra committee, Rudd said: “There is no doubt that this was a serious IED, it was good fortune that it did so little damage.” The home secretary then appeared to indicate that the suspected attacker was a man as she pledged to make it harder for individuals to construct similar bombs in the future. “We will have to make sure to take all steps that we can to ensure the sort of materials that this man was able to collect become more and more difficult to combine together,” she said. Scientists from the government’s forensic explosives laboratories in Kent are continuing to inspect the bomb which is believed to have used TATP, an explosive compound made from hydrogen peroxide, commonly sold as hair bleach or other household products. Another central strand of the investigation is focusing on CCTV coverage with large numbers of specialist officers combing through footage to establish when the device was placed on the train and the bomber’s movements before and afterwards. The security minister Ben Wallace suggested that CCTV images of the bomber could be released as part of the hunt for those responsible, but Scotland Yard subsequently denied that was the plan. By lunchtime on Saturday, the Met said 100 witnesses had been interviewed and 180 images and videos sent to detectives by members of the public, a number that is expected to increase as the investigation evolves. “The public’s help remains crucial, and I urge anyone with information, no matter how significant they think it is, to continue letting us know,” said Basu. Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the attack through its Amaq news agency, according to the US-based Site Intelligence. It also remains unclear whether the bomber was already known to the British security services, with Rudd stating it was “much too early to say” whether the bomber was part of the current intelligence picture. On Friday the US president Donald Trump sent tweets suggesting British intelligence officials were aware of who was behind the attack. Another unknown is how long Operation Temperer, the use of military personnel to free up officers for patrols, will remain in force. The plan is believed to allow up to 5,000 troops to be deployed in support of the police."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/sep/16/pep-guardiola-manchester-city-good-balance-sergio-aguero","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-16T19:07:57Z","webTitle":"Pep Guardiola: ‘We are doing many things now that we didn’t do last season’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/sep/16/pep-guardiola-manchester-city-good-balance-sergio-aguero","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/sep/16/pep-guardiola-manchester-city-good-balance-sergio-aguero","fields":{"headline":"Pep Guardiola: ‘We are doing many things now that we didn’t do last season’","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Pep Guardiola believes Manchester City are much better than last season after watching his team thrash Watford 6-0 and go top of the Premier League. Guardiola said greater familiarity with his methods, plus lavish player recruitment in the summer, make him confident City will not dip as they did last season. “I am delighted, so happy,” he said. “There are many things we are doing now that we didn’t do last season.” The City manager attributed last term’s 10-match winning start to a temporary feelgood factor rather than the more substantial excellence he has seen in a week in which his team have scored 15 goals in three games, the win at Watford coming on the back of victories over Liverpool and Feyenoord. “Last season there was new enthusiasm with a new manager and new players and everybody expecting [a lot]. Now we are more stable, we know each other better. And the new players have come to help us be better. The fundamentals of what we do are the same but the difference is we have good balance, good players and good spirit. “Day by day I say thank you to the club – to all the people involved for buying these players. All managers have their own good ideas of how to play but without these players that we have right now, it’s more complicated.” Guardiola cited, in particular, the full-backs on whom City spent over £100m in the summer, indicating that Kyle Walker and Benjamin Mendy have been integral to City’s improved balance. The manager also offered special praise for Sergio Agüero, who scored a hat-trick at Vicarage Road to draw within two goals of City’s all-time record scorer, Eric Brook. “He will beat it and hopefully we will have a good celebration for him because he is a legend, part of the history of our club.” It was not always obvious Agüero would continue to thrive after Guardiola’s arrival. Last season he criticised the Argentinian, insisting the striker needed to make himself even more useful to the team. Guardiola said Agüero has responded as expected and is now much more than a goal-scorer even if he is as prolific as ever. “He always had that, he just needed to get more involved a little bit in the game,” Guardiola said. “He’s a guy you can encourage to play, not just to score goals. I like to have defenders who do not just defend and attackers who do not just score. Everybody has to play. I like to see everybody moving and wanting the ball, not to be there waiting for a situation to come. All our strikers are involved now.” Marco Silva admitted City were superior but suggested Agüero’s first goal was offside, along with the one by Gabriel Jesus. “City are strong enough to come here and create a lot of problems for us and win as they want without offside goals,” the Watford manager said. Guardiola remains aware City have proved nothing yet: “This is very good period, I am curious to see how we react when things are not so good.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"culture/2017/sep/17/emmys-2017-winners-the-full-list","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-18T06:14:35Z","webTitle":"Emmys winners 2017: the full list","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/sep/17/emmys-2017-winners-the-full-list","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2017/sep/17/emmys-2017-winners-the-full-list","fields":{"headline":"Emmys winners 2017: the full list","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Outstanding supporting actor in a drama series Jonathan Banks, Better Call Saul Michael Kelly, House of Cards John Lithgow, The Crown – WINNER David Harbour, Stranger Things Ron Cephas Jones, This Is Us Jeffrey Wright, Westworld Outstanding supporting actress in a comedy series Vanessa Bayer, Saturday Night Live Leslie Jones, Saturday Night Live Kate McKinnon, Saturday Night Live – WINNER Judith Light, Transparent Kathryn Hahn, Transparent Anna Chlumsky, Veep Outstanding supporting actress in a limited series or movie Laura Dern, Big Little Lies – WINNER Regina King, American Crime Shailene Woodley, Big Little Lies Judy Davis, Feud Jackie Hoffman, Feud Michelle Pfeiffer, The Wizard of Lies Outstanding directing in a comedy series Donald Glover, Atlanta – WINNER Jamie Babbit, Silicon Valley Mike Judge, Silicon Valley Morgan Sackett, Veep David Mandel, Veep Dale Stern, Veep Outstanding guest actress in a comedy series Wanda Sykes, Black-ish Carrie Fisher, Catastrophe Kristen Wiig, Saturday Night Live Melissa McCarthy, Saturday Night Live – WINNER Angela Bassett, Master of None Becky Ann Baker, Girls Outstanding guest actor in a comedy series Matthew Rhys, Girls Riz Ahmed, Girls Lin-Manuel Miranda, Saturday Night Live Dave Chappelle, Saturday Night Live – WINNER Tom Hanks, Saturday Night Live Hugh Laurie, Veep Variety sketch series Billy On The Street Documentary Now!

Numbed by Trump’s election victory, Lilla placed the blame largely at the door of “identity politics”, which, he argued, had atomised American politics, undermined civic culture and destroyed the Democrats’ electoral chances. Liberalism, he wrote, “has slipped into a kind of moral panic about racial, gender and sexual identity that has distorted liberalism’s message and prevented it from becoming a unifying force capable of governing”. Lilla’s essay became the eye of a furious political storm. Some critics suggested that he was whistling in the wind – all politics, they insisted, is necessarily identity politics. Others saw it as an attack on minorities. Katherine Franke, professor of law at Columbia, and a colleague of Lilla’s, claimed that Lilla was doing the “background work of making white supremacy respectable”. It’s a debate equally significant for politics on this side of the Atlantic. Here, too, the left has considerably weakened, society has become more fragmented and there has developed an equally fraught debate about the politics of identity. Now Lilla’s op-ed has become a book, The Once and Future Liberal: After Identity Politics. Its publication has reignited the debate over the politics of identity. According to Lilla, the high point of American liberalism came with Roosevelt’s New Deal of the 1930s, which focused not on individual needs but on the collective good. To regain power, Lilla argues, the liberal left needs to rediscover that notion of the common good by adopting a pragmatic form of politics. He is particularly caustic about protest movements such as Black Lives Matter. “We need no more marchers,” he writes. “We need more mayors.” Between them, Lilla and his critics sum up well the impasse of contemporary politics on the left. Many of his critics cannot see that the politics of identity, far from defending the marginalised and the powerless, fragments the possibilities of meaningful social change. Lilla cannot see that the self-proclaimed “liberal centrist” politics he espouses has helped create the fragmentation of which he despairs. In Europe, too, debates about immigration and multiculturalism, about nationalism and federalism, expose a similar kind of deadlock. The roots of contemporary identity politics lie in the new social movements that emerged in the 1960s to challenge the failure of the left to take seriously the issues of racism, homophobia and women’s rights. The struggle for black rights in America, in particular, was highly influential in providing a template for many other groups to develop concepts of identity and self-organisation. Squeezed between an intensely racist society, on the one hand, and a left often indifferent to their plight, many black activists ceded from civil rights organisations and set up separate black groups. This is where Lilla’s celebration of New Deal liberalism looks so threadbare. The “Roosevelt dispensation”, Lilla argues, inaugurated a liberalism filled with “confidence, hope, pride and a spirit of self-sacrifice”. Except that it was not quite like that. It was also a liberalism that accommodated Jim Crow laws, segregation and lynchings. Millions of Americans were excluded from the American “we” that Lilla wants to defend. It was in the struggle against such exclusion that the origins of postwar identity politics lie. “As identity consciousness has increased among liberals,” Lilla has observed, “political consciousness has decreased.” That is to look at the issue back to front. It is not so much that identity consciousness has diminished political consciousness, but rather that the diminishment of ideological politics has allowed the politics of identity to flourish. In the 1960s, the struggles for black rights and women’s rights and gay rights were closely linked to the wider project of social transformation. But as the labour movement lost influence and radical struggles faltered, from the 1980s on, so the relationship between the promotion of identity rights and broader social change frayed. Eventually, the promotion of identity became an end in itself. The universalism that once fuelled radical movements has largely evaporated. The erosion of the power of labour movement organisations, the demise of radical social movements, the decline of collectivist ideologies, the expansion of the market into almost every nook and cranny of social life, the fading of institutions, from trade unions to the church, have all helped to create a more fragmented society. These are the changes that have snapped social bonds and hollowed-out civic life. That hollowing out has been exacerbated by the narrowing of the political sphere, by politics that has self-consciously become less ideological, more technocratic. The Democrats in America have discarded much of their old ideological attachments as well as their links to their old social constituencies. Dick Morris, former chief political adviser to the then president Bill Clinton, whom Lilla lauds, called this the process of “triangulation” – the left stealing the right’s clothes, so that it can appear to be above ideological politics. It was an approach appropriated by Tony Blair for New Labour; many see in Emmanuel Macron’s policies an attempt to fashion a new Gallic version of the same. It is not, however, through triangulation or managerialism that people bind together. They do so through common struggles for social change. Such struggles enable people to reach out beyond their own identities and give meaning to civic solidarity. It is through such social struggles that we can define what common goals should be, and what we might mean by the common good. As the influence of the labour movement has declined, and broader social struggles have faded, so “solidarity” has for many become increasingly defined not in political terms – as collective action in pursuit of certain political ideals – but in much narrower terms of group identity. Trump himself is a product of this. So are the anti-immigration populists of Europe. One of the consequences of the mainstreaming of identity politics is that, on both sides of the Atlantic, racism is becoming rebranded as white identity politics. What Lilla fails to recognise is that the demand for “mayors not marchers” – for pragmatic politics over social movements – is a change that has already happened; and the consequence has been the kind of identity politics he rightly despises. The problem is not that there are marchers rather than mayors. It is, rather, that both marchers and mayors, both activists and politicians, operate in world in which broader visions of social change have faded. How to restore a sense of solidarity based on broader politics rather than narrow identities – that’s the real challenge we face."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/live/2017/sep/17/chelsea-v-arsenal-premier-league-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-17T14:26:49Z","webTitle":"Chelsea 0-0 Arsenal: Premier League – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2017/sep/17/chelsea-v-arsenal-premier-league-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2017/sep/17/chelsea-v-arsenal-premier-league-live","fields":{"headline":"Chelsea 0-0 Arsenal: Premier League – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Arsenal will probably be pleased with their first away point. That was a huge improvement on whatever it was they tried to do at Liverpool. They were solid and disciplined. That said, they might be slightly disappointed not to have scored in the first half, when their dominance forced Antonio Conte into making a half-time change to toughen up his team. Nothing really worked for Chelsea in possession. They need to get Eden Hazard up to speed. They go third - Arsenal stay 12th - but they’re three points behind Manchester City. Thanks for reading. Do join Nick Ames for Manchester United v Everton now. Bye. What a poor game. 90 min+3: Bellerin is booked for a cynical push on Bakayoko. 90 min+1: Moses runs at Kolasinac, who brings him down. Kolasinac has lost his head. He screams at the linesman and is lucky not to receive a second booking for dissent. 90 min: Kolasinac is booked for a hack on Hazard. There will be four added minutes. 90 min: Sanchez finds Monreal in space inside the Chelsea area, but the defender’s shot is blocked! 89 min: Andreas Christensen replaces Alvaro Morata. Kolasinac has returned. 88 min: Kolasinac is still receiving treatment. 87 min: David Luiz makes down the right flank and takes too long to release the ball. He ends up overruning it, with Sanchez pressuring him, panics, loses control and flies into a challenge with Kolasinac. The Arsenal player gets there first and Luiz studs him on the ankle. Ouch. Michael Oliver rushes over and shows the red card. There are no complaints from Luiz and once again Chelsea will finish with 10 against Arsenal. 87 min: This corner’s headed out as far as Moses, who sees his volley blocked. 86 min: Bakayoko’s shot is deflected wide for a corner by Sanchez. It’s cleared. Hazard picks up possession and finds Fabregas on the right. His volleyed cross takes a deflection for another Chelsea corner. 84 min: This is comically inept. No one can complete a pass. They’ve all lost the run of themselves! Look at them charging around! Elneny’s booked for a foul on Bakayoko. 82 min: “How many hundreds of millions of pounds have been spent so Sky could bring us this utter tripe?” says David Flynn. “If this game was on HBO they’d cancel the season halfway through.” 80 min: Mohamed Elneny replaces Alex Iwobi. 79 min: Kante breaks through the middle and manages something rare, a pass to a Chelsea player. It’s Hazard, too, and that spells trouble for Arsenal. He dribbles through, swaying inside on to his right foot, but his rising drive from 18 yards is held by Cech. 78 min: Mohamed Elneny will be on soon. Are Arsenal about to settle for a point? 76 min: Chelsea steam forward and force a corner on the left. Hazard and Fabregas take it quickly. Fabregas skips past one challenge and fires the ball into the middle, but Xhaka clears. 75 min: Bakyoko trips Ramsey on the right. Arsenal have a free-kick. Xhaka lifts it to the far post, Mustafi’s unmarked and he heads it past Courtois, but the flag’s up for offside! He doesn’t know and peels off to celebrate with the Arsenal fans. Alas. His joy is shortlived. 74 min: The second half has drifted by. It’s been fairly dire. 73 min: It seems Welbeck’s tweaked his groin. Olivier Giroud replaces him. 71 min: Welbeck’s down and in need of treatment. 70 min: Eden Hazard replaces the disappointing Willian. 66 min: Alexis Sanchez replaces Alexandre Lacazette. 65 min: Alexis Sanchez is getting ready to come on. There’s no sign of Eden Hazard yet, though. Morata’s booked for dissent after complaining about being penalised for a shoulder barge on Mustafi. 62 min: Another Chelsea move breaks down and Arsenal counter, Welbeck galloping down the left. He cleverly prods a pass inside to Kolasinac, who drives into the Chelsea area. However Azpilicueta does well to jockey him and Kolasinac ends up running the ball out of play before shooting or crossing. 60 min: Morata has had a few tussles with Mustafi and been given nothing. This time he gets a free-kick on the left, though. A chance for Chelsea. Fabregas rolls it down the line to Willian, who cuts inside before shooting miles over. 59 min: It’s been a poor start to the second half. 57 min: Welbeck tries to scoop a pass through to Ramsey, but Courtois reads it. 55 min: Ramsey sprays a slide-rule pass through to Lacazette, but Azpilicueta gets his body in the way and ushers the ball behind. 54 min: Bakayoko makes his first contribution, powering through midfield and injecting some energy into Chelsea’s play. He finds Alonso on the left. He cuts inside and sees his shot blocked by Bellerin. 52 min: A free-kick to Chelsea on the right. Fabregas lofts it in, it’s flicked on and Luiz tries an overhead kick and ends up booting Koscielny in the face. The defender’s down and will need treatment. Was there some kind of high boot controversy recently? Can’t remember. Anyway Luiz is booked. 50 min: This is scrappy. 47 min: Morata pokes a pass to Fabregas, who moves it to the right for Willian. He wastefully shoots straight at Cech. 46 min: Arsenal get the second half underway. Chelsea should be stiffer in midfield now Bakayoko’s on. Tiemoue Bakayoko is coming on for Chelsea. Pedro is coming off. Arsenal are playing well at Stamford Bridge! 45 min+1: There will be two added minutes. Out of nowhere, Morata almost bursts through after beating Mustafi. Monreal steams across, though, and boots it back towards his own goal from 40 yards. Cech does very well to chest down and clear. A bit more oomph from Monreal and that could have been a very funny own goal. 45 min: Chelsea are rattled. They’re struggling to put two passes together. 43 min: Chelsea are rocking. I wonder if Conte might bring on Bakayoko for Fabregas. 41 min: What a miss from Lacazette! This is astonishing! With Arsenal completely on top in midfield, Ramsey decides to creep forward and he drifts past Fabregas as though the Spaniard isn’t there. Into the area he goes, stumbling past one challenge, then another. He’s off balance, but he’s determined and tries to prod a shot into the bottom left corner with his right foot. It bobbles past Courtois, but hits the inside of the post and bounces out to Lacazette, who promptly volleys over the empty net and high into the stands, almost like he was clearing it for a corner! 39 min: Gary Cahill decides to get out of a tight hole by doing a backheel. Does it come off? Well, moments later he’s booting it into the stands. 38 min: Xhaka’s corner is nonsense. So’s Moses’s attempt to clear on the edge of the area. A complete miskick gives Koscielny a chance, but the defender scoops over. 37 min: Iwobi sends in the free-kick; Morata heads behind for a corner. 36 min: Morata loses the ball on the halfway line and Arsenal pour forward, only for Welbeck to wastefully shoot from 18 yards when others were better placed. Arsenal are playing pretty well here, though, keeping their shape and maintaining their discipline - Ozil isn’t playing, by the way. Azpilicueta brings down Lacazette on the left and Arsenal have a free-kick in a promising position. 34 min: David Luiz reckons he’s spotted something developing further forward, so he cunningly boots a long free-kick straight out for a goal-kick. 32 min: Xhaka has a go from 30 yards. It whistles wide of the left post. Courtois had it covered. 31 min: David Luiz lets Michael Oliver know that Xhaka was fouling him at a free-kick a moment or two ago. A replay shows Xhaka had his arms around the Brazilian. Mike Dean would have given a penalty, no doubt about that. 29 min: Bellerin should grow a beard, then he can complete the Andy Carroll look. 27 min: Chelsea are obviously still very good at this football business, but they do lack a bit of a spark without Hazard on the pitch. 25 min: Xhaka expertly sprays a crossfield pass out for a throw. 23 min: This is a highly entertaining game. Moses, heavily involved on the right, has another look down the right and lofts a cross in to Morata, who heads over. 21 min: Of course, Arsenal starting to enjoy themselves does raise the possibility of Chelsea puncturing their balloon with one moment of killer quality. And this is almost it. Fabregas lofts a vintage ball over the Arsenal back three, which has decided to play a useless offside trap, and Pedro’s clear. He races into the area, Koscielny desperately trying to get back, but the Spaniard takes too long to get himself set and allows Cech to make a fairly straightforward block. 20 min: Arsenal are beginning to enjoy themselves now, spreading concern around Stamford Bridge. Kolasinac, who has muscles, decides to have a pop from the left. It flies through the bodies in the middle and Courtois has to react smartly to push it out. The Chelsea goalkeeper did well to get down given that he might have been unsighted. 18 min: Pedro is down after a tackle from Monreal. He’s having some spray applied to his right shin. Time for Eden Hazard to have a jog down the touchline. 17 min: Encouraged by that foray, Arsenal decide to test Chelsea down the right again. And again Bellerin gets the better of Alonso, scooting to the byline and cutting the ball back to the alert Lacazette at the near post. He sweeps it goalwards, despite pressure from Luiz, but Courtois is down quickly to make a good save. 16 min: Arsenal muster some cohesion for the first time, Lacazette holding up the ball well and moving it on to Iwobi, who plays an instant pass inside Alonso for Bellerin to scamper on to. Bellerin crosses first time and it’s an excellent delivery, on to Welbeck’s head, but he’s maybe just stretching a bit too much, leading him to plant his free header just wide. 14 min: I can exclusively reveal that Kante is winning a lot of loose balls. Chelsea keep pushing Arsenal back. Michael Oliver plays an advantage on the right, allowing Moses to charge down the flank and hang a cross into the middle. It’s just too high for Morata. 11 min: The Azpilicueta-Morata combo almost comes off Chelsea again after a flowing move. However Morata’s offside and anyway he heads wide. 9 min: Victor Moses returns to the pitch, but he isn’t moving freely. 8 min: Crossing’s Davide Zappacosta is warming up. 7 min: Play is stopped after a collision between Moses and Lacazette, the pair of them down after clashing knees. 5 min: A corner to Chelsea on the right. Willian and Fabregas opt for a short one. Lacazette falls asleep and lets Fabregas peel off him. The Spaniard reaches the byline and drives a low ball into the six-yard box. It’s shovelled behind for another corner, which comes to nothing. 3 min: Arsenal are rocking. Chelsea are all over them. They’re finding too much space in the middle, threatening to take advantage of Arsenal’s nervousness and lack of organisation. Willian again leads a charge, stepping past Monreal too easily, but he’s tackled before he can advance any further. The ball runs to Fabregas, who sweeps it out to Pedro on the left. He cuts inside and shoots straight at Cech from 20 yards. 2 min: Chelsea bustle forward again, Pedro and Moses pestering Arsenal down the right this time. Moses wins the ball off Kolasinac, who struggles to clear his lines, but Cech claims the wing-back’s cross towards Morata. And we’re off! Chelsea, in blue, get the game underway, attacking from right to left in the first half. There’s plenty of noise inside Stamford Bridge. It’s not long before Chelsea are attacking through the middle, Morata laying off deftly to Willian, who can’t return the ball to the Spaniard. That was a chance for the Brazilian to carve Arsenal open, but he couldn’t take it. Here come the teams. It’s time for The Liquidator! “In the tunnel Koscielny looks as though he is taking a moment to question the point of it all and lingering over thoughts of where he would rather be right now,” says Ian Copestake. “Not that I am projecting or anything!” Antonio Conte speaks. “When you have to play seven games in 21 days, it is normal to have a plan and then make the best decision game by game. Eden is very close and he is improving very well.” Arsene Wenger speaks. “Mesut is injured and Sanchez is close to his best. He played midweek and he is close to starting. Every game is an opportunity to change the history. You have an example that is very negative and we have a chance to change that today. We know we can be strong away from home. We played only four games and we had a difficult start with players coming back late. We have played at Liverpool, Chelsea and Stoke, so let’s focus on the result today.” Gary Neville keeps insisting that Chelsea are going to bulldoze Arsenal in midfield. The inclusion of Cesc Fabregas instead of Tiemoue Bakayako in midfield can certainly be taken as a sign of their confidence. Pre-match reading Chelsea make two changes to the team that beat Leicester last weekend, Gary Cahill replacing Antonio Rudiger in defence on his return from suspension and Willian coming in for Tiemoue Bakayoko. Willian’s return means Cesc Fabregas drops into central midfield against his former side, while Antonio Conte has decided to hold back Eden Hazard, who is yet to start this season after an ankle injury. The big news for Arsenal is that Mesut Ozil is absent with a muscle injury. Alex Iwobi starts in a front three that contains no Alexis Sanchez. The malcontent Chilean, who scored a stunner in that quiet affair against FC Koln on Thursday, is on the bench, Arsene Wenger clearly deciding he isn’t fit enough to start yet. Alexandre Lacazette and Danny Welbeck keep their places after scoring against Bournemouth last weekend. Further back, Aaron Ramsey and Granit Xhaka start in central midfield - it will be interesting to see how they fare given how poor they were against Liverpool. They must protect Arsenal’s back three, otherwise this could get ugly. Chelsea: Courtois; Azpilicueta, David Luiz, Cahill; Moses, Kante, Fabregas, Alonso; Willian, Morata, Pedro. Subs: Caballero, Rudiger, Christensen, Zappacosta, Bakayoko, Hazard, Batshuayi. Arsenal: Cech; Mustafi, Koscielny, Monreal; Bellerin, Xhaka, Ramsey, Kolasinac; Lacazette, Welbeck, Iwobi. Subs: Ospina, Mertesacker, Maitland-Niles, Elneny, Sanchez, Walcott, Giroud. Referee: Michael Oliver. Arsenal have had some good days at Stamford Bridge in the Arsene Wenger era. Nigel Winterburn’s last-minute winner, Kanu’s absurd 15-minute hat-trick (cheerio, Ed de Goey), Sylvinho’s Nigel Winterburn impression, a swaggering come-from-behind win from the Invincibles. Best of all, perhaps, was Robin van Persie leaving John Terry flat on his face as he raced clear to put Arsenal ahead in that barmy 5-3 win over Andre Villas-Boas’s happy campers in October 2011. See, it hasn’t all been bad. And Arsenal have actually done surprisingly well against their bogey side since Antonio Conte’s arrival in west London. It’s almost a year since they walloped Chelsea 3-0 at the Emirates, an experience so harrowing for Branislav Ivanovic that the defender started planning his leaving do midway through the first half, and they also stopped Conte’s men from doing the double, outplaying the champions in the FA Cup final in May. Then they beat them in the Community Shield last month. Could the balance of power be shifting? Three wins in four matches! That looks suspiciously like a power shift right there! Before Arsenal get too excited, however, it’s probably worth remembering that there has been a lot of bad at Stamford Bridge in recent years. The 6-0 on Wenger’s 1000th birthday. A series of Chelsea counter-punches. Diego Costa’s one-man wind-up merchant show in the dog days of the second Mourinho era. And, of course, Conte’s one win over Wenger, secured back in February, a 3-1 victory that pretty much ended any hopes Arsenal had of winning the title. Banned from the touchline, Wenger was sitting in the stands, seething and helpless, watching as Eden Hazard ripped Arsenal apart and sections of the visiting support turned on their manager. Given how these things tend to go, it wouldn’t be a surprise to see a repeat this afternoon. After all, Arsenal’s last away game was that wretched, lily-livered, tactically incompetent 4-0 defeat at Anfield. They’ve started with two defeats on the road, losing at Stoke and Liverpool without scoring a goal, hardly the best way to prepare for a trip to their least favourite ground. After a tame start, Chelsea are beginning to look ominously strong. They have bouncebackability. A month ago, the mood around Stamford Bridge was tense. The Costa brouhaha exacerbated their frustrations in the transfer market and they began the season with a farcical 3-2 home defeat to Burnley. Since then, however, four straight wins. “I trust myself, in my methods,” Conte says. That self-belief is a useful asset for a manager at this club. The Italian says he wasn’t worried when Chelsea crashed at the Emirates last year. That defeat, of course, gave him the platform to make that inspired switch to a back three and, instead of imploding, Chelsea began to motor, steamrollering away from their title rivals. Chelsea probably haven’t reached their peak yet, but Arsenal are probably going to need a complete performance in order to avoid another Stamford Bridge meltdown. Kick-off: 1.30pm."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2017/sep/17/amber-rudd-trump-london-terror-tweet-pure-speculation","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-17T10:35:04Z","webTitle":"Trump's London terror tweet was 'pure speculation', says Rudd","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/sep/17/amber-rudd-trump-london-terror-tweet-pure-speculation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/sep/17/amber-rudd-trump-london-terror-tweet-pure-speculation","fields":{"headline":"Trump's London terror tweet was 'pure speculation', says Rudd","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Donald Trump’s immediate suggestion that the terrorist who left a bomb on the London Underground on Friday was in Scotland Yard’s sights was unhelpful and “pure speculation”, according to Britain’s home secretary. “It is never helpful to have speculation about an ongoing operation and I would include the president of the United States in that comment,” said Amber Rudd, who said the tweet was not based on intelligence. “It is pure speculation,” she told BBC1’s The Andrew Marr Show on Sunday. Asked if her message to the US president was “Donald, just put your phone down and stop tweeting”, the home secretary said: “I don’t think I’d be the first person to say that, would I? We don’t want any speculation on an ongoing operation.” Her comments came after Trump caused anger in London with his tweet, sent soon after the incident. He also used the attack to promote his controversial policy to ban people coming to the US from six Muslim-majority countries. Rudd’s intervention followed a rebuke from the prime minister, Theresa May, who said it was never helpful for anyone to speculate on an ongoing investigation. Rudd went further by naming the US president as she set out the latest developments following the attack. She said there was no evidence as yet to link it to Islamic State. She suggested that Trump’s intervention was different to the US intelligence leaks to the media after the Manchester bombing, which caused anger within the government. “Our particular complaint was an outrageous leak of material following the Manchester inquiry. That was shut down, it didn’t happen again,” she said, adding that the relationship with the US security services was very important to the UK. Rudd said a key focus was to ensure that there was less material available to radicalise young people. She accepted there had been a cut of 24,000 in police numbers during the previous Conservative government, but said that crime had fallen during that period. She said she used every meeting of the government’s emergency Cobra committee, including one she chaired this weekend, to ask police leaders if they had adequate resources. “They say they have,” she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2017/sep/18/project-marks-70-years-of-the-nhs-with-peoples-stories-of-the-service","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-18T05:00:01Z","webTitle":"Project marks 70 years of the NHS with people's stories of the service","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/sep/18/project-marks-70-years-of-the-nhs-with-peoples-stories-of-the-service","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/sep/18/project-marks-70-years-of-the-nhs-with-peoples-stories-of-the-service","fields":{"headline":"Project marks 70 years of the NHS with people's stories of the service","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A heritage project to record individual stories from 70 years of the National Health Service and preserve them for future generations has been given £785,000 of Heritage Lottery funding. The social history project, timed to mark the NHS’s 70th anniversary next year, is one of the last opportunities to speak to the people who were around when the health service was established by Labour in 1948. The University of Manchester team plans to train volunteers from a range of ages and backgrounds to gather stories. Importantly, it will often be people with direct experience of the health service who become volunteer reporters, whether stroke survivors or people who have had mental health issues. Stephanie Snow, the project director, said they were thrilled to be given Heritage Lottery Fund money. She said there were great political and policy histories of the NHS but nothing that captured the individual experience or contribution, whether worker or patient. “They give us a very top-down history,” she said. “In terms of thinking about what care is like now, compared to 1948, we don’t know because we haven’t captured that history.” As well as interviews with workers, users and policymakers, there will be a website which will allow the public to submit their own NHS stories by uploading recordings, photos and documents. A touring exhibition, film and events programme are also planned. The idea is to create the first shared social history of the NHS but Snow said the project would shine light on many other subjects, such as migration, religion or communications. She said: “You could pick any aspect of social history and look for it in the NHS and you would just get this wonderful lens on the way it has changed over time.” It is appropriate to do the project in the 70th anniversary year, she said, but also the last opportunity to talk to people around at the start of the NHS who are now in their 80s and 90s. “The joy of it is that everybody gets it,” said Snow. “Often you do research projects and you explain what you’re doing and it is very relevant and meaningful but it doesn’t relate to most people’s experiences so there is no way of them connecting to it. With this, everybody can connect to it. I think it is going to be such a joy to do … a real challenge, but there is such a sense of goodwill and enthusiasm already.” The project is supported by a wide range of partner organisations. Chris Larkin, regional director at the Stroke Association, said they were thrilled to be working on “such an exciting piece of work”. He added: “We’ll be supporting stroke survivors from our local services to become volunteer reporters and share their experiences of the NHS. It’s wonderful that stroke survivors will have such a vital role in helping to document and celebrate the history of the NHS.” Frances O’Grady, general secretary of the TUC, said: “Everyone has a story about how the NHS changed their lives. Those stories need to be told, need to be captured and celebrated. We’re delighted to be involved with this project and can think of no better way of celebrating the 70th anniversary of the NHS than bearing testimony to the millions of people that have contributed to this wonderful national institution.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"fashion/2017/sep/16/adwoa-aboah-shaking-up-the-fashion-industry","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-16T23:05:25Z","webTitle":"How Adwoa Aboah is shaking up the fashion industry","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2017/sep/16/adwoa-aboah-shaking-up-the-fashion-industry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2017/sep/16/adwoa-aboah-shaking-up-the-fashion-industry","fields":{"headline":"How Adwoa Aboah is shaking up the fashion industry","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Adwoa Aboah is both the poster girl for modern fashion and one of its most vocal critics. The 25-year-old model, who walked the Burberry catwalk on Saturday and Donatella Versace’s Versus show on Sunday, leads discussions around issues from imagery of black women in the media to the impact of social media’s hyperphotogenic visual culture on self esteem on Gurls Talk, the online platform she founded which now has 100,000 Instagram followers. At London fashion week, real talk is the new air-kissing. The rise of Aboah, recently named a contributing editor at Edward Enninful’s British Vogue and GQ’s Woman of the Year, symbolises an unexpected taste for candour which is emerging in an industry long built on the pursuit of unattainable perfection. The Burberry catwalk, not so long ago bedazzled with flashbulb-friendly glitter showers, had a gritty makeover this season. The venue – an 18th-century courthouse in Clerkenwell where the underground cells, it is said, are linked by tunnel to the Old Bailey – hosts an exhibition of British social portraiture photography. Ian Macdonald’s images of Yorkshire workers in the early years of Thatcher, Jo Spence’s pictures of the 1970s traveller community and Charlie Phillips’s portraits of mixed-race couples in 1960s Notting Hill served as the backdrop to Burberry’s latest collection. Fashion does not usually acknowledge, let alone celebrate, the side of British life seen in the Here We Are exhibition. In a Clerkenwell pub, two dishevelled young lovers are captured tenderly snogging over their half-drunk pints. Belfast schoolboys in garish nylon sweaters puff their chests with pride for Alasdair McLellan’s gleaming portraits. Burberry has long mined British culture for inspiration, but the points of reference have until now been highbrow and rarified. Collections have referenced the Bloomsbury group, military costumes, the painters David Hockney and Lucian Freud. Advertising campaigns have starred high-cheekboned aristocrats: both the literal kind, such as Lord Frederick Windsor, and the 21st-century equivalent, Romeo Beckham. Fifteen years after Christopher Bailey began the painstaking task of decontaminating the Burberry brand after the Daniella Westbrook years, steeping the house in upper-class bohemian imagery in order to obliterate the folk memory of football terraces and baseball caps, the brand is ready to embrace its streetwear heritage once again. The new Burberry collection includes a baseball cap and shiny anorak, both printed all over with the house check. Adwoa Aboah wears both on the cover of the latest issue of Dazed magazine. That streetwear is currently both the most cutting edge and the most lucrative branch of fashion perhaps played a role in this change of heart. The cult Russian streetwear designer Gosha , with whom Burberry recently collaborated for a collection shown in St Petersburg, Rubchinskiy sat front row at Saturday’s show. Christopher Bailey, who recently said that he had “never been snotty” about the brand’s history as part of working-class culture, described the photography in Here We Are, which will be open to the public for two weeks, as having a spirit “sometimes ironic, sometimes tender, always truthful … that has guided our September collection”. Meanwhile, the Burberry show was the focus for the largest anti-fur protest seen at London Fashion Week for several years. Uniformed police escorted show attendees through a throng of activists chanting “Shame on London Fashion Week.” The only fur pieces on the Burberry catwalk were fake fur, although the label has used real fur in the past. Fur protesters are lobbying the British Fashion Council to ban fur from official London Fashion Week shows. A fur ban is already implemented by many department stores and magazines. The BFC position currently is that it “does not dictate what designers can or cannot design and has no control over their creative process. We encourage designers to ensure that if they choose to work with fur, they work with reputable organisations that supply ethically sourced fur.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"society/2017/sep/16/universal-credit-rent-arrears-soar","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-16T23:05:25Z","webTitle":"Revealed: universal credit sends rent arrears soaring","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/sep/16/universal-credit-rent-arrears-soar","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/sep/16/universal-credit-rent-arrears-soar","fields":{"headline":"Revealed: universal credit sends rent arrears soaring","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Ministers are coming under intense pressure to put the brakes on the government’s flagship welfare reform programme, following damning new evidence that it is leaving thousands of low-paid workers unable to pay their rent and at risk of homelessness. The Observer can reveal a catalogue of concerns from landlords, councils and charities about universal credit, which have been handed to a parliamentary inquiry investigating the programme. With the accelerated roll-out of the new system just weeks away, some warn that rent arrears among tenants receiving universal credit are running at three, four or even five times the level of those on the old system. Three councils whose tenants have already been moved on to universal credit said they had built up about £8m in rent arrears. Croydon, Hounslow and Southwark said that more than 2,500 tenants claiming it were now at risk of eviction. Some food banks reported that marriages had broken down as a result of the extra pressures of waiting for payments, while some landlords are now choosing not to accept tenants on universal credit. Figures obtained by the Observer under the Freedom of Information Act also show that half of all council tenants across 105 local authorities who receive the housing element of universal credit – which replaces housing benefit – are at least a month behind on their rent, with 30% two months behind. By contrast, less than 10% of council tenants on housing benefit are a month behind on their rent, with under 5% running more than two months behind. More than 30 submissions to the work and pensions select committee’s inquiry into universal credit highlight two main problems. The first is the six-week wait before claimants receive their first payment, with widespread reports of some claimants waiting even longer. The new system also sees money for rent going to tenants, rather than straight to their landlords. While the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) says the measure is designed to encourage claimants to manage their money, landlords are warning that it is simply leading to rising rent arrears. London Councils, the body that represents the capital’s 32 boroughs and the City of London, said the new system “places both claimants and local authorities in a position of financial insecurity”. It said that in areas where universal credit had been fully implemented, there had been “a dramatic decrease in rent collection with many tenants immediately falling into rent arrears”. The Peabody Group, a housing association that owns and manages more than 55,000 homes in London and the south-east, said the rate of rent arrears among its tenants on universal credit was three times greater than those not on the new benefit. It said the average level of arrears for those on universal credit was £1,400 per household. Halton Housing Trust, which owns and manages 7,000 homes in Cheshire, said that while just 17% of its customers were receiving universal credit, they owed 47% of all its outstanding arrears. “We are also seeing an increased risk of claimants who are unable to sustain their tenancy due to increased rent arrears,” it said. Plymouth Community Homes, which has more than 14,000 social rented homes, said 69% of its tenants on universal credit were in arrears, compared to 29% of all tenants. Gloucester City Homes, which has more than 4,000 rented properties, said 85% of its universal credit claimants were in arrears compared to 20% of all other tenants. Islington council in London said 81% of its universal credit claimants were in arrears, compared to 29% across all of its tenants. Chesterfield borough council said 77% of its tenants in receipt of universal credit had rent arrears. The Trussell Trust, Britain’s biggest food bank network, said that it had come across “instances of people referred to food banks having to wait for far longer periods [than six weeks], including up to 10 and 13 weeks” for their first payment. It also reported four recent instances of people dealing with the breakdown of marriages due to financial pressure. The New Charter Group, which owns 20,000 homes across Greater Manchester and Nottinghamshire, said: “Evictions are likely [to] increase leading to higher level of homelessness.” Centrepoint, which provides housing for homeless young people, said some had waited up to 10 weeks for their first payment. “This places tenants at risk of homelessness as they can legally be served a notice to seek possession when rent is unpaid for eight weeks,” it said. David Smith, policy director at the Residential Landlords Association, which represents more than 50,000 private sector landlords, said some members were now “increasingly reluctant” to house people on universal credit. Officials insist programmes designed to help those who are struggling with payments. However, reports suggest help is not always offered to those who need it. Several sources have suggested that David Gauke, the work and pensions secretary, may be open to slowing down the programme should the department’s latest data show up problems. Senior figures are now calling for a pause and overhaul of the system before it is rolled out even faster from next month. Bob Kerslake, former permanent secretary at the Department for Communities and Local Government and now chairman of the Peabody Trust, said: “Everybody can see the potential benefits of this policy, but the implementation is critical and there is now enough evidence about the problems of arrears, particularly for some very vulnerable groups, that makes it essential that these issues are addressed before the roll-out continues.” Nick Macpherson, a former permanent secretary at the Treasury, said: “I still worry about housing support being paid straight to the recipient rather than the landlord, and I question the prioritisation of pensioner benefits over working-age benefits: universal credit is insufficiently generous to provide genuine income support to the poor and workless.” A DWP spokeswoman said: “Universal credit is getting more people into work than the old system. It mirrors the way most people in work are paid, helping to ease the transition into employment.The majority of claimants are comfortable managing their budgets, and for people who need extra support, advance payments are available.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/sep/16/eu-leaders-pledge-action-tax-rise-google-facebook","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-16T23:03:24Z","webTitle":"US retaliation feared as Brussels prepares to close Google’s tax loopholes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/sep/16/eu-leaders-pledge-action-tax-rise-google-facebook","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/sep/16/eu-leaders-pledge-action-tax-rise-google-facebook","fields":{"headline":"US retaliation feared as Brussels prepares to close Google’s tax loopholes","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"EU leaders have agreed to make “swift” progress on raising the tax bills for digital giants such as Google and Facebook, despite warnings from smaller states that unilateral action could drive business away from Europe. France is pushing for a new way of taxing them on the basis of their turnover – rather than profits – to increase the amount collected from companies accused of paying too little in Europe. Currently, such companies tend to be taxed on profits booked by subsidiaries in low-tax countries such as Ireland even when their revenues originate from other EU states. It emerged from a meeting of finance ministers on Saturday that the French proposal has gathered the support of 10 of the 28 EU governments, including Germany, but the move is likely to need the backing of all member states to reduce risks of legal challenges. Estonia, which holds the European council’s rolling presidency, has proposed pursuing a global solution with the cooperation of other economic blocs over a longer time period to avoid hampering the digital economy in the EU. The chancellor Philip Hammond reportedly warned at the meeting against angering Washington, which could abandon global tax reform in retaliation. Further details of both proposals put forward in Tallinn will be fleshed out before a summit of EU leaders on 29 September, which is dedicated to digital issues, with a “direction” to be agreed at a summit of finance ministers in December. However, it appears there is growing support for a “quick fix” within the bloc as a precursor to a global agreement. One EU finance minister at the meeting in Tallinn told his colleagues: “When traditional businesses are asked to pay their tax, they are not given extra time.” The Dutch finance minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem called France’s plan “a very good initiative”. Belgium also supported the move, although its finance minister Johan Van Overtveldt said technical work was necessary. Among the dissenting voices, was Denmark’s finance minister, Kristian Jensen, who said: “I think we should be very careful not to tax what we are going to live on in the future. I am … always sceptical by new taxes and I think Europe taxes heavily enough.” Luxembourg’s finance minister, Pierre Gramegna, who acknowledged there was an issue with online giants’ taxation, said a tax on turnover would hit loss-making companies which are otherwise exempted from paying. He added that it “does not make any sense” for Europe to move without a global agreement. The Czech Republic and Malta both said technical work on a turnover tax would be very complicated. France’s finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, urged the EU commission, which is in charge of making legislative proposals, to produce a formal text by mid 2018. A statement from the Estonian presidency said ministers had agreed to move forward swiftly and to reach an understanding at the finance ministers’ summit in December. “For us, it is important to agree on new international tax rules that also take into account the business models of the digital economy,” said Toomas Tõniste, the Estonian minister for finance, after the meeting. “This would guarantee the equal taxation of all companies regardless of their location or place of activity. I hope today’s discussion helped us get a step closer to a suitable solution.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"culture/2017/sep/16/arts-council-england-visual-arts-north","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-16T23:04:25Z","webTitle":"Turner prizewinners lead calls to rescue fund that lit up visual arts in the north","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/sep/16/arts-council-england-visual-arts-north","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2017/sep/16/arts-council-england-visual-arts-north","fields":{"headline":"Turner prizewinners lead calls to rescue fund that lit up visual arts in the north","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Jubilation rang out across the north-east when England’s four-yearly arts grants were announced early this summer. Cash was being spent outside the capital, it seemed, with fresh funds for a fistful of struggling creative groups. But, amid the celebrations, the team behind one of the area’s most productive and longstanding visual arts organisations, Locus+, was dismayed. All support from Arts Council England had disappeared overnight. This weekend stars and leading figures from the art world are demanding that the council look again at its decision. In a strongly worded appeal, Locus+ is alling on Sir Nicholas Serota, chair of the council, to save a “small but robust organisation” with a “global reach”. Mark Wallinger, Richard Wright and Douglas Gordon, all winners of the Turner prize, are among more than 500 key names to sign the letter. The list also includes Turner nominees Gavin Turk, Mona Hatoum, Simon Patterson, Jane and Louise Wilson, Fiona Banner, Richard Wilson and Cornelia Parker. All want to express their shock and the fear that the loss of funds will strip the country of a wealth of expertise and skill. “I feel passionately about Locus+,” Wallinger told the Observer. “They are completely exemplary as a commissioning agency because of their breadth and scope. They are world-class, so I really don’t understand. “It is quite stupefying all they have managed to achieve. And they were a complete joy to work with. They are both inspiring and enabling.” Wright, a fresco painter who won the Turner prize in 2009, and was due to work with Locus+ again, said: “While many other arts organisations have been motivated by fashion and personal career development, Locus+ have insisted on the quality of the work produced and have unstintingly supported artists regardless of practical considerations, while often working within limited budgets.” The organisation, behind such startling projects as Douglas Gordon’s burning grand piano and Katie Paterson’s touring piece of moon rock, has given artists the means to create unique artworks since 1993, when it was born from the work of the Basement Group, founded in 1979. But its roots extend further, back to the first such visual arts organisation in the country, Projects UK (1983-1992). For the art critic and author Louisa Buck the length of experience at Locus+ is important, but more relevant still is the work they continue to do: “They still have a huge ground base of contacts, as well as the kind of sensitive approach, putting artists first, that is rare. There may be new groups doing this work with artists, but the council should realise it is not easy to do it well.” Wright added that he sees the traditions of Locus+ as “a vital conduit between the fostering of grassroots activities and the establishment of internationally important practices of artists, for over 30 years”. “They are true believers and have helped to make impossible things,” Wright said. “In helping Chris Burden to realise his Ghost Ship project in 2005 they enabled an artist to achieve a lifelong dream, and in so doing helped to develop the practice of an artist who will prove to be of huge significance in the future.” In the letter to Serota, John Kippin, the chair of trustees for Locus+, writes: “The organisation has an enviable track record and reputation for the quality of its commissioning of new works by artists at various stages of their careers, regionally, nationally and internationally.” Jon Bewley, the director and one of only two full-time staff, explained this weekend that he had felt forced to make his plea public because he has had no explanation for the withdrawal of funding decision. A spokesperson for the council said: “We make a significant investment in visual arts in Newcastle Gateshead. Our national portfolio application programme was a competitive process, and during the balancing phase we looked at the breadth of practice and audience engagement of organisations and we preferred other stronger applications.” The statement said that the Arts Council is aware of the disappointment at Locus+ and added that staff in Newcastle have discussed the verdict with its team: “They explained the balancing process to them and reiterated that we want to continue to work with them to see if we can support them in other ways.” Under June’s funding announcement, £86m went to 46 arts organisations in the north-east which were included in its coveted four-yearly “national portfolio”, which the council calls “the backbone of England’s cultural infrastructure”. While Locus+ lost this coveted status, 10 organisations in the area won it for the first time. The artist Simon Patterson, who worked with Locus+ on Landskip, his colourful 2000 spectacle involving military smoke grenades at Compton Verney House in Warwickshire, remains bewildered. “They are an extraordinary organisation which fulfils a unique role in the world of art. They help artists to realise daring works that would otherwise be impossible to achieve within the constraints of the realm of public art, the commercial gallery or public museum sector. Through sheer chutzpah, and at incredibly short notice, they persuaded the mayor of Sydney to allow the installation of Manned Flight 1999, a work comprising a large man-lifting kite, between the columns of Sydney town hall in 2002. “The inexplicable decision of the Arts Council England to withdraw funding from this institution of record would not only be a cultural disaster for the north-east of England, but also for the rest of Britain.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/16/has-vince-cable-been-smoking-too-many-hallucinogenic-drugs","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-16T23:05:25Z","webTitle":"Has Vince Cable been trying too many hallucinogenic drugs? | Andrew Rawnsley","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/16/has-vince-cable-been-smoking-too-many-hallucinogenic-drugs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/16/has-vince-cable-been-smoking-too-many-hallucinogenic-drugs","fields":{"headline":"Has Vince Cable been trying too many hallucinogenic drugs?","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"With hoots of derision. That is how most people are going to respond to our interview with Vince Cable, in which he declares an ambition to convince Britain that he could be the country’s prime minister. Sir Vince commands a parliamentary squad of just a dozen MPs and his party’s poll rating languishes south of 10 points. And he thinks he could be on his way to Number 10? Even those who might prefer him as a candidate for prime minister to the alternatives will ask what on earth the Lib Dem leader can have been smoking. Sir Vince has an ego, but I don’t think he has completely lost his marbles. I doubt he thinks it all that probable that he is going to get to Number 10 as the oldest prime minister since Sir Winston Churchill in the 1950s. What he is trying to signal is that he wants to rescue his party from the margins to which it has been cast in the past two years and get it back into the heart of the national conversation. He wants to be taken seriously. He wants the Lib Dems to matter again. He will have a ready audience for that message at the party conference in Bournemouth. The Lib Dems certainly need some cheering up. They thought the slaughter they suffered at the 2015 election was the nadir. Their reward for five years of coalition was to be cannibalised by their Conservative partners and punished by leftish voters who felt betrayed. They entered the power-share with the Tories with 57 MPs and came out of it with just eight. They thought things couldn’t get worse. In June, they were proved wrong. If the voters gave Nick Clegg a savage beating, they responded to Tim Farron with a shrug of indifference. The Lib Dems achieved a net gain of just four seats and their vote actually shrivelled below the dire performance of two years earlier. In 2015, they were punished for being “a party of government”. In 2017, Mr Farron tried to market them as “a party of protest” and fared no better. Some Lib Dems argue that the June election came “too early” for them. There is something in that. The smell of coalition still clung to their clothes like stale tobacco. Memories of their time in power were too fresh for them to be an attractor of voters who couldn’t stand the Tories, especially when Jeremy Corbyn proved a lot more adept than Mr Farron in the role of the anti-establishment, anti-austerity insurgent. It was too soon for the Lib Dems’ unequivocal opposition to Brexit to gain the traction that they had hoped for. As Sir Vince found out on the doorstep, a lot of the middle-ground voters they had expected to attract were still prepared to give Brexit some benefit of the doubt. For many furious Remainers, voting Labour, despite the many contradictions and ambiguities of its position, was a better way to hurt the Tories. Then there was the large cohort of voters who didn’t regard it as the most important issue in their lives. Sir Vince clearly disdains the approach of his predecessor. He dismisses the idea that they should go back to being “the plucky third party”, which jeers at the bigger two from the touchline, or a “none of the above party”, which is good for winning the occasional byelection but never plausible as a contender for office. He wants the Lib Dems to be seen as a credible force that matters to the national debate. He ought to be right that there is a chance for them. At first glance, the opportunity looks to be a golden one. There is a heap of evidence that many voters still identify themselves as broadly centrist and feel disenfranchised by a choice between a Brexiteering Tory party and a Corbyn-led Labour party. That is a large expanse of political real estate waiting to be occupied, a potentially deep reservoir of support that might be tapped. As the former Lib Dem leader Paddy Ashdown puts it: “That space has never been more empty, voiceless, vacant and uncontested.” Background chatter about the creation of some kind of new centre party is an expression of disenchantment with the offers from the Tories and Labour. This tantalises the Lib Dems with the idea that they could prosper from a dramatic shake-up of British politics and, at the same time, it is a reprimand to them for not being able to fill that space themselves. In June, even as a significant slice of voters expressed dissatisfaction with the choice of Mr Corbyn or Mrs May, they still plumped for one or the other, polarising between the two main parties as they have not for decades and crunching hopes of a Lib Dem revival in the process. Gaze at the Labour benches in the House of Commons and you will see plenty of MPs sitting there who are more in sympathy with Sir Vince’s iteration of social democracy than they are with the ideological orientation of their current leadership. Contemplate the ranks of Conservative MPs and there are plenty of liberal, internationalist Tories who would be a lot more comfortable in the company of the Lib Dems than they are sharing a party with the likes of Jacob Rees-Mogg. Yet there has not been a single defection from either the blue tribe or the red tribe to the Lib Dems. Why would they make that leap? However disillusioned they might be with their own clan, why would a Tory or Labour MP desert a party that commanded 40 or more percentage points at the election to take their chances with a party that attracted fewer than 10? Sir Vince’s priority is a basic one. It is to try to get some uplift in the Lib Dems’ miserably low vote share in order to boost the party’s morale and persuade its rivals and the media to start treating them with more respect. So long as a vote for the Lib Dems can be depicted as a “wasted vote”, they will face a strong headwind against any sort of recovery. So long as they don’t seem terribly relevant to the nation’s destiny, they won’t be much listened to. Part of the challenge is the age-old one for the third party of getting a word in edgeways. They struggled to receive a hearing after they were tipped out of government in 2015. During the election, when the broadcasters were legally obliged to give them a fair crack, what airtime they received was dominated by questions about Tim Farron’s views on gay sex. Not only did that crowd out their messages, it was also a turn-off to the more socially liberal voters they had hoped to attract. Here, Sir Vince has a big advantage over his predecessor. He is regarded as a grownup who deserves to be taken seriously. The Today programme thinks he is worth interviewing. His reputation was made during the financial crisis of 2007-08 when, as one of the rare voices to predict that the bubble would burst, he acquired the status of prophetic sage. The economy was strangely absent from the argument at the June election, but it will become more salient over this parliament. Sir Vince is already proving a lot more successful than his predecessor at getting his voice heard through all the red-on-blue and blue-on-blue noise. The Lib Dems can make themselves matter in parliament. They have a substantial contingent in the House of Lords. Their platoon of MPs is small, but can still be mathematically significant in a hung Commons. Sir Vince is trying to make the Lib Dems punch above their parliamentary weight by putting himself at the heart of cross-party co-operation to amend the Brexit legislation. The biggest and hardest truth for the Lib Dems is that their prospects of a resurrection largely depend on what happens to their rivals. There is, for the moment, a brittle truce in the Labour party between Mr Corbyn and his followers and the many Labour MPs and members who are still essentially unreconciled to what has happened to their party. If that truce breaks down, if Labour is reconvulsed by its fundamental divisions, there will be a revival of talk of a political realignment creating a new centrist force. Sir Vince, once a Labour man who joined the moderate breakaway to the SDP in the 1980s, could be well placed to exploit the opportunities that would create. The Lib Dems’ other great hope is that the anti-Brexit message that didn’t work for them in June will have increasing resonance as the choices facing Britain become clearer, starker and more unappetising. It is simply true – witness Boris Johnson’s latest intervention in which he attempts to make himself the champion of the hard Brexiters – that the Tories are profoundly split. It is not at all implausible for Sir Vince to suggest that it will go horribly wrong in the hands of this rancorously divided government. The Lib Dems might then derive some delayed credit as the party that always said Brexit was a bad idea and offers Britain a possible way out through a second referendum. Will this be enough to get Vince Cable to Number 10? Even in these volatile times, I wouldn’t want to bet my shirt on it. Is it possible that the soil is being fertilised for a Lib Dem revival? That is altogether more plausible."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/16/return-of-mass-homelessness-is-a-stain-on-our-nation","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-16T23:05:25Z","webTitle":"We had dealt with homelessness.

Why has it now returned?","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"One night in 1967, Ronnie Hughes, then a 12-year-old boy who lived with his family on a new estate at the edge of Liverpool, was allowed to stay up late to watch Cathy Come Home, Ken Loach’s TV film about homelessness in modern Britain. Watching it changed Ronnie’s life, as it did many others who were shocked into action. On leaving school, he became a housing officer and has worked to provide good housing for people who need it ever since. Now, through the social enterprise Coming Home, he brings empty homes in Liverpool back into use for secure tenancies at low rents. The housing charity Shelter was also set up because of Cathy Come Home and the film’s impact was such that its title and its theme – if not its lessons – have never been forgotten. So why, 50 years after it was first broadcast, is Britain facing a homelessness crisis on the same scale? I could sum it up in one word – Tories – and that wouldn’t be egregiously inaccurate. As a teenager in 1990, I visited London for the first time and saw the “cardboard city” at Waterloo, scarcely able to believe what I was seeing, but perfectly aware that it was there because of the government of the time. Around that time, seeing people sleeping and begging on the streets was a sad and anger-making part of living in a big city. Once Labour entered power in 1997, visible homelessness pretty much disappeared within a few years. Tories, again, would try and pin that on the “green shoots” of economic growth, but street homelessness was ended, if temporarily, by sustained and specific government funding for the organisations and individuals who knew what needed to be done. Now homelessness is back in all its forms. Everywhere you go, people are back living on the streets, desperate and dishevelled. One man in the subway beneath Birmingham’s Rotunda sits with a sign saying: “I am a homeless person but I feel INVISIBLE!” There are small tent cities in Manchester and those terrible, familiar cardboard-box beds in doorways. It is no coincidence that this phenomenon has returned in the last seven years – more intensely in the last two, since the Tories managed to shed the Lib Dems – although the wider housing crisis has been decades long in the making. The widespread housing insecurity now experienced by millions was avertable and reversible at any point, but for lack of political will and public outrage. Throughout the 1960s, demographers based population forecasts on the birth rate during the postwar baby boom, predicting that the population of Britain would pass 70m before the end of the 20th century. Housebuilding and slum clearance were already close to the top of the political agenda when Cathy Come Home was broadcast, with the completion of new homes, mainly council houses and flats, based on those population projections, reaching 350,000 per year by the late 1960s. By the mid-1970s, there was, technically speaking, a surplus of housing in the UK, with council estates housing a third of all households. The Tories couldn’t be doing with a situation in which, in crude terms, most people’s basic needs were met without significant personal sacrifice. In 1980, they introduced the “right to buy” council homes, so that “deserving” working-class people could saddle themselves with a mortgage and, over time, what was left could be fought for by the “undeserving”. As long ago as 1993, researchers at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, in a report tellingly titled Making It Happen: Finding the Resources for Social Housing, noted that 600,000 more homes would have been built in Britain during the 1980s had we invested the same proportion of GDP in housebuilding as West Germany did during the same period. The Commission on Social Justice, set up by Labour leader John Smith before his untimely death in 1994, commented in its final report that “for the large number of homeless people, housing is an aspiration rather than a reality”, and recommended: “If we want to end the scandal of homelessness in all its forms, we need to build and refurbish more homes for rent at affordable rates.” Just why do we need to repeat this demand in 2017? We know that the calls of the commission weren’t really fulfilled by the Labour government, which took the report’s more third way elements on “rights and responsibilities” and the market “having an active role to play” to more pronounced ends than a government led by Smith may have done. During Labour’s time in power, a sustained slump in housebuilding occurred. When, in 2007, Gordon Brown announced a programme to build “200,000 new homes a year”, it sounded radical and has sounded radical every time a prime minister or party leader has announced the same target since then. In that time, the shortage of secure and affordable housing has spread far beyond London and the south-east to include most towns and cities. So what is to be done? For one thing, work to bring about a change in government as quickly as possible. The existence of extensive and long-term homelessness is ideological. Academics David Whyte and Vickie Cooper describe austerity as being a calculated programme of state violence against the most vulnerable and I don’t disagree with that. The Tories cling to power because they manage to persuade just enough people at any one time that living in shop doorways, hostels or B&amp;Bs is an individual lesson in character-building. They cannot afford to remind the public that people only do it because they do not have a home of their own to sleep in at night. Get rid of them, then encourage a Labour government to build more, build well and encourage community groups to build. (This is already happening in Leeds and Liverpool.) It is bloody expensive to treat people as badly as this government does. The royal borough of Kensington and Chelsea has enough cash in reserve to buy dwellings within its own borough to permanently rehouse everyone made homeless by the fire at Grenfell Tower, but instead it obfuscates the clear need for swift justice and puts up survivors in hotels, where they can’t settle. Street homelessness could be ended within a year and other forms of homelessness caused by eviction, penury and structural disadvantage eradicated in a single term of government if it was made a political priority over Brexit, Trident renewal or any other needless diversion. Cathy Come Home demanded that we change the way we see “home”: to regard it as a right, not a reward. It’s time to make that demand again."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"money/2017/sep/20/tough-calls-on-the-debt-crisis-frontline-with-charity-stepchange","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-20T11:48:39Z","webTitle":"Tough calls: on the debt crisis frontline with charity StepChange","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/sep/20/tough-calls-on-the-debt-crisis-frontline-with-charity-stepchange","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2017/sep/20/tough-calls-on-the-debt-crisis-frontline-with-charity-stepchange","fields":{"headline":"Tough calls: on the debt crisis frontline with charity StepChange","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"There is a pause, a moment’s silence and then a deep exhalation before the words finally come. The caller has only been asked her name but it is a big moment, almost like a confession when she finally speaks. Debt is an exhausting secret to keep, but telling a stranger about a problem you can hardly bear to face yourself takes courage. “It can take people a few times to actually speak to someone,” says Becky Mitchell, a team leader for the helpline run by debt charity StepChange. “They call and end up putting the phone down because they are too scared or embarrassed.” The helpline is based at StepChange’s headquarters on the edge of Leeds’s sprawling shopping precinct. With rows of spotless desks and headset-wearing advisers bowed over their computers, it looks like a call centre. But there are no sales targets on white boards and a prominent sign dangling from the ceiling reminds staff: “We know debt. We understand the causes, but most importantly we know the way out.” “It’s not a call centre, even though we are using call centre equipment,” says Dominic Hopkins, one of hundreds of helpline advisers answering calls during the Friday lunchtime rush. “If I need to take a break because the last call got to me I can.” Without the experienced ear of a StepChange adviser, each call is like listening to a devastatingly sad radio play. In the first six months of 2017 more than 320,000 people contacted StepChange for support with their debt problem with the average unsecured debt pile rising by more than £110 to £14,367 over that timeframe, as they loaded purchases on to credit and store cards or took out personal loans. The accents change as calls are coming in from all over the country but the problems are the same: the plates they had kept spinning for so long have smashed on the floor and they need help to sort through the pieces. To better understand the underlying causes of Britain’s debt crisis, the Guardian was allowed to listen to calls but not to report any personal details or experiences. For many, the advice handed out by people like Hopkins is the first step towards confronting the financial chaos that has taken over their life, affecting their mental health and in some cases that of their children. The most common reason callers give for their dire straits is a change in circumstance, such as the loss of a job or reduced working hours – a common theme given the prevalence of zero-hours contracts – or illness. Sometimes the crisis is triggered by a domestic emergency such as a broken cooker or washing machine. But sometimes, particularly among the growing number of single parents calling the helpline, the problem is simply that they do not have enough money to live on since their relationship broke down. The replacement of the Child Support Agency with the Child Maintenance Service three years ago put the emphasis on parents agreeing a financial settlement and many callers appear resigned to receiving no financial support from their ex-partner. Often it is the frightening officialdom of a court summons that jolts the caller into action but it can also be the panicked reaction to a bailiff’s knock. “One of the more concerning trends is the increased use of enforcement, particularly through the high court, by the water companies,” says Andy Shaw, one of the charity’s debt advice coordinators. “Historically we might have seen cases where clients had got behind with their water bills progressing as far as a county court judgment but no further. The water companies seem to have become more aggressive in their debt collection methods.” After the initial call individuals who want a personal action plan drawn up must call back to have a more detailed conversation so advisers can suggest a course of action, selecting from a list that includes a debt management plan, an individual voluntary arrangement or bankruptcy. At the start of each call, to the optimistic listener, it sounds like the situation might not be too bad as arrears on household essentials such as rent, council tax and utility bills are disclosed. But from then on it just gets messier and messier. Some people haven’t opened letters for months or even years, and as a result small mistakes, such as a parking ticket or traffic violation, have taken on a life of their own in the court system. Overdue household bills turn out to be the tip of a debt iceberg and, as the call progresses, the names of lenders change from well-known high street banks and retailers to esoteric brands targeting borrowers with poor credit ratings with high-interest products. The average caller has about six unsecured debts to their name. Some try to keep the tone breezy as they rustle paperwork, glad to be moving forward, but others are close to tears as they pick over their meagre expenditure to figure out ways to reduce their outgoings. Could they stop smoking or only buy clothes for their children? Like the government, StepChange doesn’t have a magic money tree and its advicecan be hard for callers to hear, even if they have asked for it. “Telling someone their only option is bankruptcy – that’s a very difficult conversation,” says Shaw. “Some clients are open – or resigned – to the idea but there are others who haven’t faced up to the their situation. There is still a significant stigma attached to bankruptcy.” “If someone is facing repossession proceedings and you are helping them prepare their budget to take to court for their hearing – you can see they are not going to be able to afford to keep their home and you have to prepare them for that,” adds Shaw. “That is one of the harder aspects of the role.” StepChange advisers report overwhelmingly that callers want to repay their debts yet a 2016 survey of its clients found that nearly a third of those with credit card debts said none of their creditors would help them by freezing interest, charges or enforcement action. Three-fifths of those who were not shown forbearance went on to borrow more to try to cope with their debt problems. “There is good practice from creditors out there and when they forbear – stop charging interest, stop ringing up and cease court action – people start to recover,” says Peter Tutton, head of policy at StepChange. “Without forbearance no one does. They borrow more and pay them by not paying someone else, and so the crisis goes on.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"crosswords/prize/27316","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-29T23:00:16Z","webTitle":"Prize crossword No 27,316","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/prize/27316","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/prize/27316","fields":{"headline":"Prize crossword No 27,316","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/sep/16/larry-david-curb-your-enthusiasm-series-nine","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-16T23:05:25Z","webTitle":"Preeetty good.

Larry’s back and still misanthropic after all these years","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"When the comedian Larry David confessed on an American chatshow last week that he is neither “a people person” nor “an animal person” and insisted he is one of the rare 2% who fit neither category, it fell a bit short of a TV scoop. His admission will not surprise anyone who has watched a video clip from David’s hugely influential, award-winning sitcom Curb Your Enthusiasm, let alone those aficionados who have devoured all eight seasons. But what his interview with host Jimmy Kimmel did do quite nicely was remind viewers of David’s knack for skewering the absurdities of modern parlance. It is a knack fans of the show have sorely missed in the six years since a new episode aired. From the moment Curb Your Enthusiasm first offered a parodic glimpse of the comedian’s Los Angeles home life in October 1999, David has been lovingly curating a public persona that is so out of sorts with the world that even in promotional mode for his new series he remains determinedly grumpy. In fact, especially in promotional mode. Asked this summer why he is reviving the show after so long, David said it was purely because he couldn’t face the repeated question “is the show coming back?”. Regardless of David’s curbed enthusiasm, the arrival of the ninth series on HBO will rank as one of the most hotly anticipated resurrections in TV history – and this in spite of both the online leaking of several hacked episodes, and the undeniable truth that David’s dyspeptic sense of humour is not everyone’s glass of Californian rosé. By now an appreciation of the Curb canon is used as a common marker of insider tastes. The show’s most famous admirers, such as Ricky Gervais, lapped up its haphazard exposé of the daily irritations of someone who really has little to complain about. And its many rank and file devotees can recite sequences of dialogue just like others do with Monty Python sketches, favourite episodes of Friends or quirky scenes from Seinfeld. That David, who was 70 this summer, became a major player in American television is largely down to his key creative role on Seinfeld, the show that starred Jerry Seinfeld as a charming but callow New Yorker in search of an easy way through life. This seminal sitcom, which also starring Julia Louis Dreyfus and Jason Alexander, remains a pillar of mainstream entertainment 19 years after its final episode. Yet David walked away from it after seven successful seasons, explaining he could not cope with the pressure to stay on form. “I didn’t want it to fall off,” he said. Similar fears have no doubt dogged him in the long gap since season eight of Curb. Luckily, during the interim, another member of the David family took up the baton. Cazzie David, the comedian’s 23-year-old daughter, put together four episodes of a show called Eighty-Sixed on YouTube earlier this year and it bore all the carefully etched curmudgeonly, shallow hallmarks of her father’s work. “It’s pretty amazing,” her father said. “I’ve never been that happy for another person in my life. It’s great. I’m her biggest fan.” So what does the new Curb promise? Among welcome familiar elements will be Leon, Larry’s perpetual house guest, played by J B Smoove, Cheryl Hines as his exasperated ex-wife, and Jeff Garlin as his longtime agent. What will be different? According to David, Larry will be more self-assured this time. “Every day confirms, more and more, he’s right! He’s right about everything; he’s rarely, rarely wrong. And when he is, he apologises.” Also new will be Bryan Cranston, of Breaking Bad fame, appearing as Larry’s therapist. (“Unfortunately for him.”) Those who find David’s crotchety alter ego a depressing cultural icon for our times are already most of the way to the intended joke. Even David’s drawled catchphrase “preeetty good” is deliberately lacklustre and bland. Curb, its creator seems to imply, is no better than we all deserve. What’s more, its improvisational style has inspired a general shake-up of on screen comedy, from Judd Apatow’s cinematic hits, to popular British TV sitcoms such as The Office and Lead Balloon. David grew up in a noisy family home in Brooklyn, the son of a garment industry worker. As a schoolboy he steered away from performance, although he enjoyed it, fearing he would seem effeminate. His move into stand-up comedy came after time spent as a student in Maryland, a place where he felt unable to fit in with the blooming hippie culture. “I had a very difficult time with the lingo,” he has explained. “I couldn’t bring myself to use those words.” Although David often denigrates his stint on the stand-up circuit, he swiftly gained the status of a comics’ comic; a dangerous player, who would sometimes walk off stage mid-set. Once David had created Seinfeld, a sitcom “about nothing” which famously embraced a radical new mantra, “no hugging, no learning”, he made a film, Sour Grapes, and then planned a return to comedy clubs. But the television triumph of Curb intervened. According to Hines the essence of the show’s appeal is David’s desire to dwell on social discomfort. “If there’s a moment that feels awkward, most people are happy to move past that moment and never think about it again. Whereas Larry sees it and feels it and realises how funny it is and then makes an entire episode of that moment. It’s finding that place where most of us don’t want to stay. And he cannot wait to set up camp,” she has said. David has described creating the show’s plots as like “putting together a giant jigsaw puzzle”. He writes a brief outline as the basis for the actors to improvise from, and reportedly then always loses his nerve temporarily. The end result is a show that approaches difficult subjects, both small and large, with a bold lack of cant. Not everyone is so beguiled, of course. The writer and critic Cosmo Landesman points out a lack of social context in the show – possibly more of a problem now in the era of Trump. “Without the grumpy schtick I wonder if David has anything funny to say,” said Landesman. “He has to look at the little problems because the rest of it is so smooth. There is no conflict and the whole world is kissing his arse. Is it satire? Or is it self-satisfaction?” Landesman also suspects Curb has had a bigger effect on the way people behave in real life than it has had on other comedians. And not in a good way. It has given people, he argues, an unhealthy licence to dwell on the minutiae of life. Certainly, the comics’ trick of “bravely” drawing attention to their own failings is a standard way to establish social dominance. But David sees the TV version of himself as a projection of how liberated he would like to be. “We all have good thoughts and bad thoughts, but nobody ever expresses the bad thoughts. We just think them and don’t say them,” he once told Gervais. “But the bad thoughts are funny. I’m such a liar in my life – keeping things to myself, not really telling my true feelings – that I feel like I want to go completely the other way when I have the opportunity.” This summer, however, David suggested the relationship with his Curb incarnation is a little closer, and not just when it comes to a shared love of golf. ”I don’t know if you’re aware of this or not,” he said to assembled media, “but TV Larry is just a quarter-of-an-inch away from real Larry.” David’s real ex-wife, Laurie David, is kinder. “The show-Larry is much more aggressive,” she has claimed. “The real Larry is very gentle and very sweet and doesn’t like to offend people.” But the last word should go to Smoove, who plays that houseguest Larry can’t shake off. “They are one and the same,” he has judged. LARRY’S WORLD Anyone can be confident with a full head of hair. But a confident bald man – there’s your diamond in the rough. I had a wonderful childhood, which is tough because it’s hard to adjust to a miserable adulthood. Hear the birds? Sometimes I like to pretend that I’m deaf and I try to imagine what it’s like not to be able to hear them. It’s not that bad. I don’t like to be out of my comfort zone, which is about a half an inch wide. OK, I’m happy. I’m happy. All right? I’m happy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/17/child-free-childless-too-many-questions-parents","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-16T23:05:25Z","webTitle":"What’s it to you if some people don’t have kids? | Barbara Ellen","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/17/child-free-childless-too-many-questions-parents","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/17/child-free-childless-too-many-questions-parents","fields":{"headline":"What’s it to you if some people don’t have kids?","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"World Childless Week was created by a British woman, Stephanie Phillips, as a way of highlighting the experiences of people who are unable to have children. Not to be confused with those who are childless by choice – the “child-free”, as some say. Seemingly worlds apart, they share a vexed similarity. Of course, most people each group encounters are probably just interested and kind. Less helpfully, the childless can sometimes find themselves tormented by invasive, agonising questions, while the child-free can end up being ruthlessly interrogated about the “strange” decision they’ve made. It’s one thing to listen sympathetically when people are in pain and need to tell their story; quite another to demand a detailed explanation for something that’s effectively none of your damn business. Worse, too often, all this is a mere preamble to what the interrogators really want to do, which is to tell you what they did and how much better it is than what you did – in effect, launching a full-out defence of their own life choices. This is what the childless/child-free need to understand – that the tactless, prying uber-prescriptive babble they endure doesn’t begin and end with the issue of childlessness. The world of parenting is infested with the roar of self-aggrandisement about what certain parents did, why they did it, and why everyone else should do it too. Not all parents are like this, just a certain breed, who never seem to tire of defining themselves by their (often tedious) choices. Natural/assisted birth; breast/bottle; working/staying at home; washable/disposable nappies and so on. Whatever they happen to be talking about, parenting topics that should only ever be friendly, laid-back debates take on a Napisan-soaked pugilism. It’s as though these people aren’t just idling away the time, swapping observations, they’re defending to the hilt their lives and their tribes. All too often, there doesn’t seem to be anything particularly helpful or interesting going on, no new credo or illuminating spin. It’s just a cacophony of different needy voices, all convinced that their way is best. Otherwise, what are they doing with their lives? Perhaps this partly explains all the poking and prodding, the ongoing social examination that the childless and child-free both endure. In their very different ways, their very existence negates the “normal” world of parenting. They’re living, breathing human testaments to the fact that, whether someone dearly, heartbreakingly wanted a family or opted to give procreation a swerve, without children, life goes on. The only sane response to either of these narratives would be a modicum of polite interest and instinctive human solidarity – a respect for their experience or their choice. Frequently, however, it doesn’t quite go like that. On too many occasions, the childless end up having to field pitying questions about their lack of fecundity, sometimes very bluntly, among people they barely know and in a manner that I humbly suggest helps in no way whatsoever. For their part, the child-free are often pressured to explain and justify their stance. There are rude questions, dire warnings about a barren future, an underlying hiss of disbelief. But there’s anxiety in there, too. It’s almost as though the thought simply can’t be accepted that, in actual fact, the parenting life path isn’t remotely special – it is, by definition, ordinary, a trajectory shared by countless others, most of whom don’t feel the slightest compunction to drone on about it. This is where a certain strain of modern parenting seems to end up – not an interesting, complex debate, but a wailing torrent of self-justification. It’s not someone’s childlessness they pity – it’s the fact that they can’t ever be like them. And it’s not people being child-free that gets to them – it’s the fact that they quite clearly and rather hilariously don’t want to be."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"society/2017/sep/16/first-baby-born-under-nhs-national-health-service-aneurin-bevan","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-16T23:05:25Z","webTitle":"‘I was the first baby delivered by the NHS.

She wanted to start pushing. But the doctors and midwives looked up at the clock on the wall and said, “Stop. Hold on, Edna, hold on.” They knew they were moments away from the start of the National Health Service and wanted me to be the first baby born into this new service. So my mother took a deep breath and held on. That’s how I was born at one minute past midnight on Monday 5 July 1948 – the first NHS baby. That was in a cottage hospital in a little corner of west Wales called Glanamman. It was the staff there who told my mother, “You must call her Aneira,” the female form of Aneurin, after Aneurin Bevan, the architect of the NHS. They knew it was significant that Bevan’s dream of a health service that was free for everyone to use had come to fruition that day. I became known as Nye, just like him. When I was a child my mum would introduce me to people, saying, “This is Nye, my National Health baby,” and would allude to Aneurin’s name too. So in my mind I thought that he must be my “other” father, because she always mentioned us in the same sentence. At school, people asked about my name and if I knew what Aneurin Bevan had done for the country. I didn’t then, but I came to understand. The NHS was set up to maintain life. I never knew any of my grandparents because they died between the ages of 30 and 50. But my mother lived until she was 95, which she put down to the NHS. I am the youngest of seven children but was the first to be born in hospital, and it didn’t cost my parents a penny. When my six older siblings were born at home, my mum and my dad, Willie, had to pay a midwife one and six to come and deliver the baby. My mother used to say: “Bevan left people a really important legacy.” She told me how her father, Tommy Hodges, was carried home after breaking his leg while working down the mine. He was laid out on the kitchen table and held down by both men and children while the doctor performed an operation – without anaesthetic. The doctor needed paying, but there was no money. This was the south Wales valleys in the 1930s. Everyone was poor. So they had to sell the family piano to raise money to pay the doctor. That was heartbreaking for the children; it was their only entertainment. Bevan was motivated by seeing human suffering like that in the valleys. He was a true visionary, in that not only did he dream about changing the future, he did something about it. The NHS was revolutionary. It changed lives for the better. I get cross when this government says that people are living longer and using all these services, because the NHS was created to extend life. People are living longer? That was the plan from the start – to stop people dying young, as so many did then. I worked for 28 years as a nurse in a mental health hospital. Some patients had psychosis, schizophrenia or severe depression; others had been brain damaged since birth and their families couldn’t look after them, so they ended up in hospital. It was very challenging, but the standard of nursing was great. You do feel sad for the patients but I was always upbeat. It was hard work, but I was born to do it. The policy in the 1980s of care in the community, which got a lot of people out of mental hospitals who didn’t need to be there and put them in supported housing instead, was the biggest change in my time as a nurse. It was a good thing, because so many patients had become so institutionalised from being in there so long that they couldn’t adjust to life outside the hospital. I know the NHS well because it’s saved my life eight times now. I suffer from anaphylaxis. That’s an allergic reaction to a substance so severe, so violent, that it could kill me. For many people it’s food but in my case it’s painkillers. When I go into anaphylactic shock I get pins and needles in my mouth, my throat swells up and my lungs can’t fill with oxygen. That’s what kills people – the inability to breathe. People who get it need treatment urgently if they go into shock. I’ve been rushed a number of times by ambulance to the Morriston hospital in Swansea and given a shot of adrenaline as an antidote. I’m allergic to codeine, morphine – anything that contains any opiate. I triggered an attack one day by taking Solpadeine, which immediately made my stomach very painful. I only survived because a doctor nearby helped me. On medical advice, I now carry not one but two EpiPens containing adrenaline with me all the time, because my condition is not well controlled. I broke my right elbow in 2014 but couldn’t even have it set because I would have needed pain relief and anaesthetics, but I couldn’t take painkillers in case they killed me. That means my elbow is really painful and I can’t grip things with my right hand and arm. Every night I say thank you for the NHS. It’s been brilliant for me. I’m so eternally grateful to it. But I’m also scared for the NHS’s future as I, and it, approach our 70th birthday. Every time I go to Cardiff and see Aneurin Bevan’s statue I feel very emotional because of how things are going with the NHS. I think the NHS is underfunded and I’m worried about the impact of service closures and increased travel times for patients. Financial cutbacks are putting patients’ lives at risk. But there’s a lot of misuse of NHS care: people taking advantage of it being free. They take it for granted. And the public’s expectations of the NHS, which have grown in my lifetime, are now too high. People can be a bit selfish. When we have an ailment we expect somebody to dish out a prescription and we expect to be seen at a certain time. People complain about how long they had to wait in A&amp;E. But maybe they should be grateful they’ve got an A&amp;E at all and ambulances to take them there. The NHS isn’t a bottomless pit, although some people treat it as if it is. There should be more education about why the NHS was created in the first place and how much operations like heart or lung surgery cost, which can be many thousands. I would like to see people educated about NHS costs, and that should start with schools. Treatment costs should be stated somewhere, to encourage people to be healthier. People are aware now of the dangers of smoking. I would like to see people made aware of the effects of bad diet, alcohol and drugs. The NHS is completely different now from when it was set up. It’s amazing to think how hugely things have changed since Bevan’s day. Drugs are saving lives, we’ve had the growth in medical expertise, and life-extending operations such as heart, lung and kidney transplants are now commonplace. But the moral values that were there at the start should stand today as they did in 1948. I feel passionately about the preservation of this fantastic service, which provides support from the cradle to the grave, for every person in the United Kingdom. It means equality for all. As I believe Aneurin Bevan said: “The National Health Service will last as long as there’s folk left to fight for it.” The NHS is the jewel in our crown and it’s our duty not to let it slip away. Aneira Thomas is assisting a major King’s Fund research programme into the relationship between the public and the NHS to mark the health service’s 70th birthday in July 2018 THE HEALTH SERVICE IS BORN 1942 The reformer William Beveridge proposes a social security system and a health service, to be set up after the war. 1945 Labour wins a landslide. Aneurin Bevan proposes a regional health system with all hospitals in public ownership. 1946 Bevan publishes the NHS Act, promising a free and comprehensive service. Many doctors oppose the proposals and refuse to become employees of government. 1948 The NHS is founded. It has 1,143 voluntary and 1,545 municipal hospitals, with 480,000 beds in total. Bevan visits Park hospital in Davyhulme, now Trafford general hospital, which becomes known as “the birthplace of the NHS”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/16/ian-mcewan-lost-book-more-beguiling-form-of-fake-news","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-16T23:04:25Z","webTitle":"Ian McEwan’s ‘lost’ book is a more beguiling form of fake news | Hephzibah Anderson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/16/ian-mcewan-lost-book-more-beguiling-form-of-fake-news","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/16/ian-mcewan-lost-book-more-beguiling-form-of-fake-news","fields":{"headline":"Ian McEwan’s ‘lost’ book is a more beguiling form of fake news","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"It’s been a busy few days in the literary world, what with the release of this year’s Man Booker shortlist following the recent longlist announcement for its closest non-fiction equivalent, the prestigious Baillie Gifford prize. And yet the most desired text of the week is one that doesn’t exist. It turns out that Ian McEwan, decorated darling of award juries, has a missing novella that he regards as nothing less than “perfect in every way”. This “incredibly beautiful novella” flowed so easily that it slipped his mind and became lost amid a house move and the publication of another book, he told an interviewer for the Audible Sessions series. Convinced he’d find it squirrelled away in a drawer or gathering dust in the attic, he later ransacked cupboards and an old filing cabinet to no avail. Why? Because it seems the novella never existed in the first place. Or, rather, it existed only in his head. He now understands its dogeared, handwritten pages to be “a false memory”, he explained, “nourished by desire”. It’s a tale that could itself have been ripped from the pages of a work of fiction and yet it chimed, in an off-key sort of way, with a report about fake news earlier in the week. A major survey from Yale University found that tagging fake news on social media doesn’t work. Facebook may defensively flaunt its alliance with external fact-checkers but their efforts are largely ineffectual and may even be detrimental, researchers concluded. Flagging news stories as being “disputed by third-party fact-checkers” made the study’s 7,500 participants just 3.7% more likely to spot a fake news headline. And among Trump supporters and 18- to 25-year-olds, mistrust of the media meant that these flags actually enhanced credulity. Of course, fake news is not new. The term was in circulation by the end of the 19th century, then faded out of use in the 1940s, only to attain biting relevance in the internet age. But lately its meaning is blurring: what once referred to clickbaity untruths of the kind peddled by the yellow press is coming to signify something that we merely wish wasn’t so, something that doesn’t jive with our “version” of the truth. Seemingly, the same desire that drove a feted novelist to the brink of insanity – “It was almost like getting mentally ill,” McEwan has said – plays a part in what we define as fake news. It’s easy to mock McEwan’s delusion. (Wait, you’ve written a work of stupendous literary genius in your dreams? Me, too!) But there’s something disturbing about knowing that our novelists are hallucinating novellas. They are canaries of a kind. Though they’re licensed to live in the world of make-believe, there is nothing fake about their fabulation. In addition to channelling all that is timeless in the human experience, great storytellers have always been lead interpreters of the here and now. But when malign invention masquerades as fact and fact is maligned as fiction, it leaves the creators of genuine fiction disenfranchised, with nowhere to retreat but to the interior landscape of their own addled imaginings. Here’s hoping that McEwan’s brush with unreality will ignite a real novella touching on all of the above. When fiction infiltrates fact, we need our novelists more than ever."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/2017/sep/16/watford-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-16T16:10:33Z","webTitle":"Sergio Agüero hat-trick puts rampant Manchester City top of the table","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/sep/16/watford-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/sep/16/watford-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Sergio Agüero hat-trick puts rampant Manchester City top of the table","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Manchester City have blasted their way to the top of the Premier League and only an exceptional team will be able to challenge them. Watford, watched by Elton John and unbeaten before Pep Guardiola’s men rocked up here, fancied their chances but were blown away by a three-goal salvo before half-time. City did not relent and struck the same number again in the second half, bringing their tally to 15 goals from their past three matches, this demonstration of their attacking power coming after the demolitions of Liverpool and Feyenoord. City settled the contest in the first half thanks to a three-goal salvo in 10 minutes. Sergio Agüero scored twice and created one for Gabriel Jesus. Nicolás Otamendi added a fourth after the interval with a close-range header. Then Agüero rounded off his hat-trick, which is why he was happy to let Raheem Sterling take the penalty when the winger was fouled a minute from time. Sterling expressed his gratitude by finishing with the ruthlessness he sometimes lacks. Watford had come into the game on the back of three successive clean sheets in the Premier League but with their first-choice centre-backs still out injured extending that sequence to four was always going to be a tall order against one of Europe’s most awesome attacking forces. Guardiola made one alteration to the City lineup that had started the midweek dismantling of Feyenoord in the Champions League, with Sterling replacing Bernardo Silva. It took him 20 seconds to make an impact as Sterling skittered down the right and delivered a low cross to David Silva. Adrian Mariappa blocked the Spaniard’s close-range shot, but the storm was never going to abate. David Silva and Kevin De Bruyne orchestrated City’s relentless assaults. Benjamin Mendy thrashed a 20-yard shot just over the bar before, in the 10th minute, David Silva swept a diagonal pass over to De Bruyne, who cushioned the ball into the path of Sterling. However, the England winger mis-hit his shot from 10 yards. That was the only stain on an otherwise sparkling display by Sterling. De Bruyne and Agüero went close with shots from outside the area as Watford were corralled deep into their own half. Yet in the 24th minute the hosts almost took a surprise lead from their first venture forward, Richarlison meeting a free-kick by José Holebas and heading a yard wide. Agüero soon showed the Brazilian how it should be done. In the 27th minute, after Tom Cleverley was penalised near halfway for a foul on John Stones, De Bruyne flighted in the free-kick and Agüero headed past Heurelho Gomes, much to the annoyance of Marco Silva, the Watford manager appealing vigorously for offside. The rain was hurtling down and the sky soon fell in on Watford. Agüero scored his second four minutes later, tapping into the net from four yards after excellent work on the left by Jesus and a feeble attempt by Gomes to cut out David Silva’s cross. Agüero then became the supplier, running at Watford’s frazzled defence before slipping a pass through to Jesus, who fired into the bottom corner of the net from 10 yards. Watford were inferior, no doubt about that, but never submissive. They rebelled quite strongly at the start of the second half and even had Ederson in the City goal worried for a moment, André Carrillo cracking a fine volley a couple of yards wide from the right-hand corner of the box. Then Agüero resumed his quest for his hat-trick, twice shooting wide after being fed by Mendy. On the hour the Argentinian was thwarted by Gomes, who batted a crisp shot over the bar. The resultant corner led to City’s fourth goal, Otamendi heading home a cross by David Silva. Nine minutes from time Agüero finally completed his treble. And with brio, too. After a fine run and pass by Kyle Walker, the striker burst past Christian Kabasele and guided a low shot beyond the reach of the advancing Gomes. Another tricky run by Sterling provoked a foul in the box in the 89th minute. The winger picked himself up, consulted with Agüero and rifled the ball into the net from the penalty spot. City, then, surpassed the 5-0 defeat they inflicted on Walter Mazzarri’s Watford back in May. Under Silva they are much better and went into this game knowing that a win would send them to the top of English football for the first time since 1982-83. Graham Taylor’s team finished that campaign as runners-up. City were relegated. That part of the history is certainly not going to be repeated any time soon."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2017/sep/16/leicster-gloucester-premiership-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-16T16:14:04Z","webTitle":"Leicester stop the rot as Ben Youngs’ double sinks sloppy Gloucester","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/sep/16/leicster-gloucester-premiership-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/sep/16/leicster-gloucester-premiership-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Leicester stop the rot as Ben Youngs’ double sinks sloppy Gloucester","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Leicester avoided the indignity of losing their three opening matches in the Premiership for the first time, but a contest between two heavyweights of the English game, who are scrambling to retrieve their reputations, showed how far back they have fallen. A match that was light, frothy and helter-skelter was decided in the opening quarter, when Leicester, armed with plentiful penalties, scored their three tries. The first summed up why Gloucester are the Premiership’s model of inconsistency. Switching off when Ben Youngs has the ball in his hands 10 metres from the line, after his side have been awarded a penalty, is not in any instruction manual. As the England scrum-half assessed his options seven minutes in, the Gloucester flanker Lewis Ludlow – anticipating a kick at goal and a banker three points – was stuffing his gumshield into a sock as he helplessly watched a whirl of green shoot past him. Gloucester were similarly distracted for Youngs’ second on 14 minutes, which equalled the scrum-half’s league tally of tries for last season. Leicester’s response to the plentiful penalties they were awarded was either to take them quickly or opt for an attacking lineout. The set piece, which was led by two novice second rows who had to contend with the former Tigers’ captain Ed Slater – who joined the Cherry and Whites after a pre-season with Leicester – malfunctioned for most of the afternoon, but on this occasion the ball was smuggled to Luke Hamilton, who was held up on the line before Youngs spotted a gap on the blindside. Leicester’s third try followed the best move of the match: their full-back Telusa Veainu, who largely revelled in the anarchic nature of a game without shape, committed Ollie Thorley into leaving the line early before timing his pass to Nick Malouf to finish off a counterattack – but, after that, it was a case of what should have been, with both sides struggling to finish what they had started. The difference between the teams was the urgency Leicester showed at the start, still smarting after their tame capitulation at arch-rivals Northampton the week before. They hit rucks hard, led by the England prop Ellis Genge, whose industry was supplemented by a destructiveness up front, and they rushed up in defence to hurry a back division that had been hit by the late withdrawal of the fly-half Billy Burns, with a knee injury. If the late reshuffle offered an explanation for Gloucester’s long catalogue of errors, it was far from total. Since this stage of the Premiership last season, they have won only one league match on the road, at relegated Bristol last March. They too often resembled a team who have met up for the first time in the car park an hour before kick-off, high on intent but low on understanding. They conceded 11 penalties in the opening half while winning one, and though they disputed some decisions and bemoaned what they saw as conniving by Leicester, their play was more individual than collective, lacking in synchronisation and cohesion. They rallied after trailing 21-0 at the interval, Josh Hohneck running through Veainu after Willi Heinz had manoeuvred the prop into space before Billy Twelvetrees kicked a penalty, but a side who had lost eight of their nine previous Premiership encounters with Leicester never threatened to win here in the tournament for the first time since 2007. The penalties may have been more evenly distributed in the second half, but Leicester continued to dominate in terms of position, undermined by the five attacking lineouts they lost. Gloucester had to attack from deep, but were undone by a combination of over-ambition and sloppiness, and they lacked a focal point. The Gloucester coach, Johan Ackermann, pointed out that – as he had not arrived at the club from South Africa until the final week of August – he was having to introduce systems during the season, rather than before it. Even so, he would expect his charges to show more gumption and wit than they served up here: if he did not know the size of the task he faces before, he does now. “I haven’t got a magic wand,” he said. “It took me four years with the Lions [in South Africa]. I don’t know if it is going take four here. It might take eight, or it might take one. We have got to keep pushing.” It was Leicester who were pushing in the final 20 minutes. They failed to secure try bonus points, confirming victory with a George Ford penalty after Thorley had escaped a yellow card for a deliberate knock-on that thwarted a potential second try for Malouf. The final whistle summoned relief rather than rapture, victory only highlighting what still needs to be done in the shadows cast by the glories of times past."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"crosswords/cryptic/27314","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-27T23:00:22Z","webTitle":"Cryptic crossword No 27,314","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/27314","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/cryptic/27314","fields":{"headline":"Cryptic crossword No 27,314","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"crosswords/cryptic/27315","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-28T23:00:09Z","webTitle":"Cryptic crossword No 27,315","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/27315","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/cryptic/27315","fields":{"headline":"Cryptic crossword No 27,315","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"crosswords/cryptic/27313","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-26T23:00:17Z","webTitle":"Cryptic crossword No 27,313","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/27313","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/cryptic/27313","fields":{"headline":"Cryptic crossword No 27,313","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"us-news/2017/sep/16/st-louis-protesters-take-to-the-streets-after-acquittal","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-16T14:54:33Z","webTitle":"Police arrest 32 protesters in St Louis after acquittal of Jason Stockley","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/sep/16/st-louis-protesters-take-to-the-streets-after-acquittal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/sep/16/st-louis-protesters-take-to-the-streets-after-acquittal","fields":{"headline":"Police arrest 32 protesters in St Louis after acquittal of Jason Stockley","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"St Louis police said 32 people had been arrested during demonstrations against the acquittal of a former police officer, who had been charged with murder in the 2011 fatal shooting of 24-year-old Anthony Lamar Smith. Ten law enforcement officers were injured in the mostly peaceful protests, which began after the not-guilty verdict was handed down by circuit judge Timothy Wilson on Friday morning. The demonstrations quieted early Saturday morning, having taken place in different parts of the city, including outside the home of mayor Lyda Krewson. At one point, the crowd around her home swelled to about 1,000 people, including some who pelted the home with red paint and broke at least two windows. Police distinguished between peaceful protesters and agitators in their description of the events, and said people damaging property “distract from the mission of peaceful protestors”. Ahead of the verdict on Friday, activists had warned that a not-guilty verdict for the former police officer, Jason Stockley, would result in acts of civil disobedience. On Friday night, a line of police in riot gear approached protesters who would not retreat, knocking down one woman in a scene captured by local television helicopter. Officers pepper-sprayed the remaining, standing protestors as the woman remained on the ground, until she was cuffed and led away. Police said in a Tweet on Saturday afternoon that the woman “failed to obey officers’ orders &amp; was charged with ‘Interfering’”. Some protesters became frustrated with a longtime local television reporter, Dan Gray, and threw water bottles at him and his photographer, Tauna Price. Footage of the interaction shows a group of other protesters intervening to help protect the journalists and escort them to a more safe location. “I understand their frustration, I understand their anger,” Gray said. “Perhaps they needed someone to vent it to.” A series of protests were scheduled for the weekend and on Saturday morning, in the suburb of University City, demonstrators gathered at a local park. Demonstrators also filled local shopping centers. Stockley, who now lives in Houston, said on Friday he felt “like a burden has been lifted”. “The taking of someone’s life is the most significant thing one can do, and it’s not done lightly,” Stockley told the St Louis Post-Dispatch. “My main concern now is for the first responders, the people just trying to go to work and the protesters,” he said. “I don’t want anyone to be hurt in any way over this.” In a 30-page ruling, Judge Wilson said Stockley was not guilty of murder because the prosecution failed to prove the officer was not acting in self-defense. The shooting occurred in 2011 after Stockley and his partner attempted to corner Smith’s vehicle in a fast-food restaurant parking lot, believing they had witnessed a drug deal. Smith backed into the police vehicle twice to evade the officers, who said they saw a gun in the man’s vehicle. Stockley fired seven shots at Smith’s car as he drove away, prompting a car chase. During the chase, an in-car video recorded Stockley saying: “Going to kill this motherfucker don’t you know it”. The judge said on Friday that the statement was taken out of context. The officers eventually forced Smith’s vehicle to stop and Stockley shot Smith after approaching his vehicle. Prosecutors accused Stockley of planting a gun on the scene and said it was suspect that the officer entered Smith’s vehicle after the shooting, potentially interfering with evidence. They also highlighted that Stockley’s DNA was on the gun, but not Smith’s, suggesting the man could have been unarmed. The judge said there was no proof Stockley planted the gun. Stockley told the Post-Dispatch on Friday, after the judge’s ruling, that he had wanted to find the gun as quickly as possible if Smith had thrown it out the window. Stockley was suspended from the police department in 2013 for carrying an AK-47 gun on-duty. He resigned shortly after and took a job with an oil company in Texas, where he lives today. Smith’s mother, Annie Smith, said she was disappointed in the judge’s ruling. “My soul is burning,” she said. “My heart is broken. I say, I ain’t get no justice, I could never be at peace.” Police-involved shootings have sparked several high-profile protests in recent years, including in the St Louis area. Three years after Stockley killed Smith, Darren Wilson, a white police officer, fatally shot unarmed 18-year-old Michael Brown, leading to weeks of demonstrations in Ferguson, a suburb of St Louis. The shooting, which followed many other high-profile killings of black people by white officers, renewed discussions about police relations with minorities and prompted a federal civil rights investigation that found the Ferguson police department had discriminated against black citizens. • This article was amended on 18 September 2017. Owing to changes made in the editing process, an earlier version said that Darren Wilson fatally shot Michael Brown three years before Stockley killed Smith. Wilson shot Brown in 2014, three years after Jason Stockley fatally shot Anthony Lamar Smith. This article was also amended to restore a quote from a recording of Stockley."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"fashion/2017/sep/16/giorgio-armani-london-fashion-week-gucci","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-16T23:05:25Z","webTitle":"Giorgio Armani on London fashion week: 'It's the only true city where you see the creative turmoil'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2017/sep/16/giorgio-armani-london-fashion-week-gucci","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2017/sep/16/giorgio-armani-london-fashion-week-gucci","fields":{"headline":"Giorgio Armani on London fashion week: 'It's the only true city where you see the creative turmoil'","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"As a designer, Giorgio Armani is best known for his understated aesthetic of fluid suits in shades of beige, but his presence at London fashion week over the past few days has been pretty attention-grabbing. In the lead-up to his first Emporio Armani show in London for a decade, at a warehouse in the East End on Sunday, he has beamed his logo across County Hall. He has installed a retinue of a hundred or so global employees on a floor of his Mayfair headquarters. All of a sudden, all of the taxis and buses in W1 are covered in his branding. London is important to Armani. “It is probably the only true city where you see the creative turmoil,” he says. “You can feel, you can sense it. “Paris is very romantic, because the people who actually manage the city want it to stay the same. But London is truly modern.” He came here in the 1970s, when he first set up his label. “Carnaby Street was a huge source of inspiration. Like everyone else, I found it to be a magical moment for the place and time. But then I distilled that and tried to adapt it following my own vision.” The fashion industry, which is comfortable with hyperbole, describes Armani as the king, even the god, of style. He is certainly the living designer who – like Coco Chanel and Yves Saint Laurent before him – has most profoundly changed the way we all dress. Over 42 years his business has mushroomed into a sprawling empire with several different clothing lines as well as hotels, real estate, beauty, watches, chocolates, interiors and eyewear. According to Forbes, he is worth $8.6bn. Meeting him is quite an experience. We are in a large room at Armani HQ, surrounded by rack upon rack of clothes and half a dozen trestle tables covered in hundreds of accessories and handbags. Armani is being photographed against the black velvet backdrop strictly stipulated by his team in advance. His suited advisers hover around the photographer, proffering advice about camera angles. I am ushered over to shake his hand, which Armani keeps holding as he leaps up and guides me into a private sideroom. There he sits on a grey bucket chair, with one leg curled up on the seat. He is wearing a navy blue cashmere jumper, navy blue trousers and bright white trainers with little white trainer socks. The designer owes his age-defying bicep definition, he says, to an hour and a half in the gym every morning. “I am very careful with what I eat. That’s why restaurants are not too easy. Because I am very picky.” This would be a cosy set-up, were it not for the three men in Armani suits who sit with us. One of them translates (Armani does not do interviews in English, although, after decades of dressing the likes of Richard Gere and Cate Blanchett, he must speak a bit of it). Another is Armani’s English PR. The third – the most sharply dressed of the three, with dark, Brylcreemed hair – I am never introduced to. Armani is enjoyably grumpy on a number of topics. He is a “simpatico” boss, but “when I do realise that things are not going as I planned, the people who work for me, they will know. It will be painful for them to realise.” He loves London’s buzz and the history of the city, but not “the level of service, the attention to detail in places like restaurants, where the men are always just wearing a shirt. “I would have expected more. Businessmen, just wearing a shirt in a restaurant? That’s not right.” A lot of fashion now is novelty for novelty’s sake. “There are still some things I love to see young people wear. And others I profoundly detest. You need respect,” he says emphatically. “Even what you wear, presenting yourself in front of people, you should show respect through that.” He gives a delightfully backhanded compliment to Gucci and other labels that favour a trend-led approach. “I think it’s right for them to try new things, to be daring, to experiment, because for those brands it would be very risky not to. The real challenge is to be a creative designer but still be true to your own style, without stealing ideas from your colleagues, your friends, people you meet.” Armani’s London extravaganza is part of a reorganisation of the company, which last year concentrated seven design lines into three after a 5% dip in revenue. The restructuring should, he says, “produce a lot more clarity in the eyes of the final consumer”. This relaunch includes the “reopening” of Emporio Armani’s flagship store on Bond Street. “As I bought the business back,” he says, “I had to rethink the whole way the country and the market was managed.” How does he manage such a huge portfolio in such detail? Why doesn’t he just hang out on his yacht? “The true answer,” he says, “is I don’t know. A lot of people my age are playing with their grandchildren or with a dog. I have 10,000 people in my company who are waiting for my guidance, for my leadership, to know what they are supposed to do. I can’t do it any other way. That’s why I have to do it.” In 2003, when Armani was a lad of 69, he said: “It would be ridiculous for a designer to still be in place at 85”. He is now 83, and his succession plan – the establishment of a Giorgio Armani Foundation – was announced only recently. The foundation, he says, was the best plan to ensure this “very rich, very liquid” company will continue, and will invest in charity and culture appropriately. I didn’t want to just leave it on the shoulders of my heirs, this big task which is also a bit of a burden,” he says. “I wanted to designate the people who would do it.” Does he have any ambitions? “I’ve done it all,” he says. “I’ve done so many things and all of these things have stolen a bit of my life away, in a way.” A few times, invisible cues pass between the suited men around me, and then I am asked to wrap up the interview, though Armani, sitting opposite me, fixing me with his steely gaze, has never perceptibly expressed a wish for the interview to be terminated. Eventually I let him go, knowing that he must have given the signal. He is always in charge, after all. “The puppeteer is me,” he says. “And that’s quite a burden, actually.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/16/russia-islamic-state-syria-assad-forces-recapture-town-okeirbat","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-16T13:31:34Z","webTitle":"With Assad's fate secure, Russia sets its sights on Isis fighters in Syria","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/16/russia-islamic-state-syria-assad-forces-recapture-town-okeirbat","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/16/russia-islamic-state-syria-assad-forces-recapture-town-okeirbat","fields":{"headline":"With Assad's fate secure, Russia sets its sights on Isis fighters in Syria","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The head of the Russian army in Syria has said the defeat of Islamic State in the country is imminent during a visit to a strategically located town recently recaptured from Isis by forces loyal to Bashar al-Assad. “All the conditions are in place for the final stage of defeating Isis in Syria,” said Lt Gen Alexander Lapin, standing amid heavy security outside the building of a former Isis sharia court, adorned with the extremist group’s black-and-white logo. “I can promise you that no Isis terrorist will ever set foot in this town again.” Okeirbat was regained by forces loyal to the Syrian government on 2 September after a three-month assault amid intensive Russian airstrikes. Recapturing the town enabled government-backed forces to push forward towards breaking the long-standing siege on Deir ez-Zor, in the east of the country. Russia entered the conflict on the side of Assad’s government in September 2015 at a time when the regime looked close to falling. Although Moscow’s stated goal has always been to defeat Isis, during the first year of engagement the majority of Russian airstrikes targeted other opposition groups, including those supported by western countries. Russia’s long-standing policy in the Middle East has been that retaining the status quo, however unpleasant the regime may be, is always better than revolution, and the Russian intervention appeared designed to shore up the Assad regime at any cost. With Assad now looking more secure, Russia has indeed begun battling Isis. On Thursday, Moscow launched seven cruise missiles at Isis targets south-east of Deir ez-Zor, and said the militants would soon be pushed to the other side of the Euphrates river. The Russians took a group of journalists to Okeirbat as the final leg of a four-day tour for press designed to showcase Moscow’s contribution to the war and the subsequent peacekeeping operation. The trip has shown just how involved Russia is on the ground in Syria, with the country’s military police involved in securing a number of “de-escalation zones” where ceasefires between government forces and moderate opposition groups are in place. On Friday, journalists were flown from the main Russian airbase near Latakia on the Mediterranean coast to an airfield east of Aleppo, and then taken in a convoy of armoured trucks on a five-hour journey along desolate roads to Okeirbat, past the war-destroyed shells of abandoned villages. The convoy was accompanied by black-clad men from Assad’s feared secret police, the Mukhabarat, and pickup trucks mounted with rifles. On arrival, the town was patrolled by what appeared to be Russian special forces soldiers armed with high-end equipment but no insignia. The complicated tangle of forces operating on the ground was evident at a dusty forward operating base outside Okeirbat, where the convoy stopped briefly, which appeared to be manned at least partly by irregular Russians who did not want to speak to the media. The Russians have portrayed the latest advance as entirely run by Syrian army units operating with Russian air cover, but in reality most of the fighting in Syria over the past few years has been led by Iranian-backed militias, with the Syrian army in disarray. Fighting in the area was still ongoing, with an incoming mortar shell landing close to the Russian convoy as it drove towards Okeirbat. In the town itself, dull thuds of artillery could be heard at regular intervals. Isis positions were about 10 miles away from the town, according to the Russians. There was an extensive tunnel network underneath the town that the Isis militants had dug over the past two years, making the capture of Okeirbat especially difficult. The town was also home to an Isis tank workshop. Lapin said the Russians had located the factory by using drones to follow tank tracks, and had carried out airstrikes on the target on 29 August. The tank workshop had three different sections: one for the repair of captured tanks, one to reinforce them with makeshift armour and one to turn tanks into powerful suicide vehicles. There were still the remains of a number of tanks in the workshop, including one with the turret removed. The workshop removed the turrets of about one-third of the tanks it captured from the Syrian army with explosives, and would then use them on suicide missions, said Lapin. When fitted this way, the tanks had a kill radius of 300 metres. Lapin said that during the recent Syrian and Russian operation against Isis, 1,209 fighters had been killed and 49 tanks and 159 pickup trucks mounted with rifles had been destroyed. The Russians have typically either avoided talking about civilian casualties or claimed there have been none, despite monitoring groups frequently reporting casualties, particularly from airstrikes. Okeirbat had a population of 10,000 prior to the outbreak of Syria’s civil war, which had fallen to 2,500 under Isis, said Lapin. The Russians claimed that all the civilians had fled before the final assault on the town, but it was unclear how this had happened, or whether there were in fact civilian casualties during the assault. Observer groups have reported numerous civilian casualties during the current wave of fighting. Lapin said Isis and other Islamic extremist groups now control about 15% of Syria, with Isis in retreat and heading for a final showdown in the Euphrates valley. A separate offensive by opposition fighters backed by the US-led coalition is continuing in the eastern Deir ez-Zor province. The British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights estimates that the Assad government currently controls 48% of Syrian territory, indicating that even after the final defeat of Isis, the country’s long and devastating conflict will be far from over."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2017/sep/16/banksy-gives-205000-to-human-rights-and-anti-arms-trade-groups","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-16T09:13:25Z","webTitle":"Banksy gives £205,000 to human rights and anti-arms trade groups","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/sep/16/banksy-gives-205000-to-human-rights-and-anti-arms-trade-groups","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2017/sep/16/banksy-gives-205000-to-human-rights-and-anti-arms-trade-groups","fields":{"headline":"Banksy gives £205,000 to human rights and anti-arms trade groups","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The street artist Banksy has given a financial boost to peace campaigners by donating the £205,000 raised from the sale of his latest work to Reprieve and Campaign Against Arms Trade. Civilian Drone Strike, which depicts a trio of Predator drones bombing a children’s picture of a house, was auctioned at Art The Arms Fair, a five-day exhibition coinciding the Defence and Security Equipment International arms fair in east London this week. The exhibition was the second half of a two-week festival of protest against the DSEI, the world’s biggest arms fair, which brought together delegations from what activists say are some of the worst human rights-abusing regimes with 1,600 makers and sellers of weapons and military equipment. More than 100 people were arrested in the first week of protests as they attempted to block exhibitors from delivering their equipment to set up stands at the arms fair, according to the Metropolitan police. The force said it would provide an update on the number of arrests later on Saturday. Andrew Smith, of Campaign Against Arms Trade, said the money from the sale of Civilian Drone Strike would help the group to mobilise more protests against arms companies, and against the next DSEI in two years time. “The arms fair is a moral abomination,” he said. Banksy has a track record of supporting political causes with his art. In March he showcased his Walled Off hotel, nestled against the barrier wall in Bethlehem that separates the West Bank from Israel, to highlight the hardships caused by Israeli occupation. In June he risked falling foul of UK election law by offering voters in constituencies around Bristol a free print if they sent in photos of their ballot papers in the general election to prove they had voted for anyone other than the Conservatives."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/live/2017/sep/16/crystal-palace-v-southampton-premier-league-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-16T13:26:57Z","webTitle":"Crystal Palace 0-1 Southampton: Premier League – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2017/sep/16/crystal-palace-v-southampton-premier-league-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2017/sep/16/crystal-palace-v-southampton-premier-league-live","fields":{"headline":"Crystal Palace 0-1 Southampton: Premier League – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"And that’s that! No dream start for Roy Hodgson, then: his team remain rooted to the bottom of the Premier League, pointless and goalless. Saints meanwhile launch themselves up the table to fifth, for a couple of hours at least. Hodgson congratulates his opposite number Pellegrino - “Well played!” - then trudges off with the weight of the world on his shoulders. He’s got quite the job on here. 90 min +4: Ward looks for the top-right corner from 25 yards. He finds the top-right corner of the stand. 90 min +3: Schlupp tries to clear upfield, but Ward-Prowse hassles and harries. The episode ends in a goal kick, but there’s more time eaten up successfully by Saints. 90 min +2: Benteke comes back into his own half to win the ball back. But all he does is bowl Romeu over, and that’s a free kick that’ll allow Saints to run down the clock a bit further. 90 min +1: Gabbiadini comes on for Long. 90 min: Palace throw it into the mixer. Forster gathers. Van Dijk waves his arms around, organising in the I’m In Charge style. There will be five extra minutes. 89 min: Cedric twists and turns down the right and slaps a shot goalwards from just inside the box. It’s gathered easily enough by Hennessey. 87 min: Tadic is replaced by the returning Virgil van Dijk. He seems to get a fair enough reception from the away support. Almost as though most of the heat and noise surrounding transfer talk is generated by the media and on the internet, well away from the real world. 86 min: Bertrand earns a corner for Saints down the left. It’s hit long, and Ward tries to hook a ball over his own head and into the top right from the right-hand corner of the box. Ambitious, to say the least. Up the other end, Yoshida blasts a common-or-garden clearance into the back of Lemina. The ball rebounds into the arms of Forster. 85 min: Ward-Prowse comes on for Redmond. 84 min: Townsend shimmies in from the left, and curls deep for Sako. But Bertrand stands firm and blocks his man in a fair tussle. The ball flies out for a goal kick. 82 min: Dann miscontrols in the midfield. Long goes scampering off. Dann has no option but to drag him back. That’s Palace’s fifth booking of the game. It’s not been a dirty match, this, but there you have it. I’m feeling old. 81 min: Once again, Saints find a bit of joy down the right. Cedric and Tadic combine, though eventually the ball’s run out for a goal kick. This flank has been a serious problem for Palace all afternoon. 80 min: The impressive Lemina goes on a George Best skitter, left to right on the diagonal, and nearly works enough space in the area for a shot. But he’s swarmed by Palace defenders, and slips the ball wide left to Redmond. Redmond hesitates, though earns a corner. Nothing comes of the set piece. 78 min: Hodgson is booed by his own fans! The reason? He replaces the impressive Loftus-Cheek with Sako. Only a smattering of dissent, to be fair, but even so! They work fast round Palace these days. 77 min: Long is booked for complaining, no free kick forthcoming after his being brought down by Ward. 76 min: Cabaye’s delivery is appalling. Easily cleared by Saints. 75 min: Palace are awarded a very cheap free kick out on the right, Ward losing control of the ball, but being lightly brushed in the back by Redmond a split second afterwards. A chance for Palace to load the box. 73 min: Fosu-Mensah goes down holding his ankle. That looked a sore one, but he’s up quickly enough, after a bit of treatment, and looks good to continue. 71 min: Palace enjoy a little possession in the midfield. They go nowhere, but they’ve not kept hold of the ball well today, so it’s better than nothing. Small acorns, and all that. 69 min: McArthur is hooked in favour of Milivojevic. And there’s another good run by Loftus-Cheek down the left. He earns a corner, which is headed out harmlessly by Dann, but this is a little better from Palace, who have improved in this second half, even if that’s not saying a whole lot. 68 min: McArthur is booked for a clumsy slide on Bertrand. Then the lively Loftus-Cheek goes racing down the left, gets the better of Lemina, and crosses for Benteke. But Hoedt contorts his body to hook away. 66 min: For the 387th time this afternoon, Tadic is sent away down the right, this time by a clever reverse ball from Long. To give Schlupp some credit this time, he hares back and stops Tadic in his tracks with a glorious saving tackle, but it should never have come to that. Long races over to try to latch onto the loose ball that’s sprung from the tackle. He pings off Schlupp and goes flying into the stand in the slapstick style. All good knockabout fun. 65 min: ... there’s nowt of note. 64 min: Tadic is once again found in preposterous space down the right. This is a joke; Palace haven’t closed him down this afternoon at all. He should set Long free down the inside-right and into the area with a diagonal sliding pass, but plays it too close to the back-pedalling Dann and the defender slides across to block out for a corner. From which ... 62 min: A free kick out on the right for Saints, Cedric having been upended by a combination of McArthur, Cabaye and Puncheon. The latter, having already been booked, is the recipient of a stern lecture by the referee. He’s on his final warning. To be fair, he hasn’t really done much that’s so awful this afternoon, it’s only fair he’s cut a little slack. 60 min: Cabaye, in the centre circle, quarterbacks long for Benteke. The big striker rises on the edge of the area, and clanks a header miles wide left, and high to boot. 59 min: It is tipping down in south London. Stair rods. Meanwhile the Saints, after rocking early in the half, have reestablished their earlier dominance. They’re first to everything again. 57 min: Ward is booked for a foul committed a couple of minutes earlier, when he dallied on the ball, allowed Davis to run off with it, and rugby tackled him to the floor. 56 min: And now it’s Southampton’s turn to pass up a great chance to score. They ping the ball around awhile, then Redmond bursts into the box down the right. His cross is missed by everyone, then recycled by Tadic out on the left. Tadic chips the ball back into the centre, and Long should plant a header home from six yards. But he fails to connect properly, and after a little pinball, the danger is gone. 54 min: Virgil van Dijk warms up on the touchline. Meanwhile on the pitch, Saints have slipped into game-management mode. The referee has a word as Long takes his sweet time over a throw. 52 min: Thing is, Palace have been pretty poor so far, all told. And they still could, arguably should, have scored on three separate occasions. That surely augurs well. They just need the dam to break. 50 min: Puncheon is booked for a frustrated clatter into the back of Tadic. And a period of pressure is released. 49 min: It’s a slightly subdued Selhurst. And then the roof suddenly nearly comes off! First, Loftus-Cheek dribbles down the right, reaches the byline, and fizzes a low ball through the six-yard box. How did that stay out?! How did Cabaye and Benteke miss it? Then Schlupp drifts in from the left and sets up Puncheon, who has to score from six yards, but Forster blocks brilliantly and Lemina knocks it clear calmly. Much better from Palace, who should be level! When will they score? 47 min: It doesn’t lead to much, but Lemina sells McArthur an outrageous dummy in the midfield, a trick that incorporates a subtle drag-back. He looks a very fine signing indeed. And we’re off again! Saints get the ball rolling for the second half. No changes. Half-time reading: Roy Hodgson storms off in the businesslike fashion. He’ll need to give his team a good talking-to. They’ve been bossed by Saints. The plus points: they’ve nevertheless still managed to create a couple of chances, while their opponents are a little blunt up front, despite their dominance everywhere else. It promises to be a fascinating second half. 45 min +1: So having said that, Palace nearly equalise, Townsend scampering after a long ball down the inside-left channel and sending a screaming, dipping shot just over the bar from an angle! 45 min: The half-time whistle can’t come quickly enough for Palace, who are reduced to a shambles. They’re second to absolutely everything. Redmond crafts more space for himself, this time in a central position, but his shot from 25 yards is weak and easily gathered by Hennessey. 44 min: Palace are hanging on here. Redmond skedaddles into their area from the left, then cuts the ball back for Tadic, whose shot from the penalty spot is blocked. 43 min: Saints ping it around nicely, as they’ve done for the majority of the half. After a few pretty triangles, the ball’s clipped down the inside-left channel for Lemina by Davis. A bit too much juice behind that, or Lemina would have been clear. 42 min: Saints launch yet another attack down the right. This is getting old. Long very nearly scampers clear, but Dann comes across to harry him off the ball. 40 min: Hoedt, deep on the left, sprays a golden pass wide right to release Tadic into acres. Schlupp is on walkabout, goodness knows what his game is. Thankfully for Palace, Tadic’s low cross is dismal. The home side should have been in serious trouble there. 38 min: Cabaye floats a reasonably aimless cross into the Saints box from the right. It’s not what Benteke is after, and the big man communicates this point in the direct style. A few whistles. Both players and punters getting irritated. 36 min: Davis chips forward, down the middle for Redmond, who chests down on the edge of the Palace area with his back to goal. He turns and very nearly slides a clever pass forward to release Long. But Fosu-Mensah and Dann get in the way. Palace are living a little dangerously, and will be thankful that Saints have a few goalscoring issues themselves right now. 34 min: Yet again, Tadic is afforded too much time out on the right. Not entirely sure what Schlupp is up to this afternoon. Fortunately for Palace, Saints haven’t exactly over-committed, and they can easily deal with the resulting cross. But this surely can’t continue. Saints have the run of this flank. 33 min: Cabaye is booked for leaving his foot in on Lemina, as the Saints midfielder whipped a pass away. He can have no complaints, having landed his boot on Lemina’s toes. 31 min: Loftus-Cheek so nearly scores a glorious goal! Townsend wins a ball he had no right to win 35 yards from the Saints goal in a central position. He slips it to his right for Loftus-Cheek, who drops a shoulder once, then twice, and zips past a couple of despairing Saints challenges on a slight left-to-right diagonal run. He enters the area, makes enough space, then looks to whack low into the bottom left. But his effort is deflected out at the last, and the resulting corner comes to nothing. Still, that’s much better from Palace. 29 min: Loftus-Cheek and Benteke one-two in the midfield, allowing the former to have a pop from 25 yards. He sends a glorious low fizzer inches wide of the left-hand post. Had that been on target, I’m not sure Forster was getting to it. 27 min: Tadic finds more space down the right. His cross takes a nick off Schlupp and threatens to loop into the top left along a crazy arc, but Hennessey claims well. Then another Saints attack, as Redmond springs Long free down the inside-right channel. The flag goes up, and it’s the correct decision, but it was very close indeed, and had the linesman kept his flag down, it’d have been an understandable error. Palace playing with fire. 26 min: Something of a lull, but Saints remain in command, keeping hold of the ball. Palace are unable to get anything coherent going. 24 min: An encouraging spell for Palace, who knock it around in the midfield for a while. Schlupp sashays down the inside-left channel before shuttling the ball inside to Cabaye, who sends a speculative effort, aimed for the top left, high and wide from 20 yards. 22 min: Saints continue to hog the ball. Some patient passing, hither and yon. Eventually Redmond takes a whack from 25 yards. It’s straight at Hennessey, albeit oscillating in the air enough to pose the keeper problems. Hennessey deals with it well. 20 min: A pretty dribble down the middle by Saints’ club-record signing Lemina. Ball-on-string stuff. But with options either side as he advances towards the Palace area, he gets giddy and drags an ambitious effort wide left from distance. He had options either side. The home fans beginning to get a little edgy as Saints probe for a second; Palace can’t afford to ship another right now. 18 min: The corner leads to another corner, and that second one comes to nothing. What a chance for Benteke, though. Palace still haven’t scored a goal this season. After that Benteke effort, straight at the keeper, and Scott Dann’s late close-range header at Burnley last week, Palace will be wondering if they’ll ever break their duck. But at least they’re creating chances. 16 min: Redmond slips and allows Townsend to make off with the ball down the right. A pass is slipped forward to Loftus-Cheek, who crosses low. Benteke must score from six yards! But he doesn’t connect powerfully, and Forster is able to claw the ball away. Corner. 14 min: Saints are completely bossing this game right now. They’ve enjoyed nearly 70% of possession in these early exchanges. “I do hope Mr. Hodgson does not moan at the lack of ‘famous support’ his team are getting,” quips Ian Copestake, with reference to Mr Hodgson’s famous stint at Anfield a few years back. Oh Roy! 12 min: Davis swings a cross into the Palace box from a deep position on the right. Ward and Fosu-Mensah are all over the shop, and nowhere near Long, who is drifting in from the left. Long opts for a spectacular header, looking to guide the ball first time into the top right from a position to the left of the D. His effort flies miles wide right. He had time to take that down, and will wish he did so now. 10 min: Townsend goes racing down the right and falls over Hoedt’s extended leg. The ref doesn’t give the free kick, much to the home support’s collective annoyance. Probably the right decision. To be fair to the Palace support, they don’t slip into an extended sulk, and after ironically cheering a decision in their favour 30 seconds later, go back to making a hell of a racket. 8 min: A free kick for Saints out on the right, and a chance for the visitors to load the box. Davis loops it in. Schlupp heads away powerfully, and in any case the whistle goes for some Saints pushing. On the bench, Hodgson has assumed the pensive pose, chin on palm, eyes fixed on some point in the middle distance. So much for Roy Hodgson’s honeymoon period. Davis slides a pass down the inside-right channel for Tadic, who drops a shoulder to waltz past Schlupp. He reaches the byline and fires into the middle low and hard. Hennessey can only parry out to Davis, who had been following up and sidefoots confidently into the bottom right. On the bench, Hodgson tries his best to appear calm. He just about manages it. 4 min: Space for Tadic down the right, set free by a lovely crossfield pass by Redmond. Cedric goes deep on the overlap. A cross, and Palace make a pig’s lug of clearing the ball. Davis has a whack from the edge of the box, though he doesn’t connect properly and Hennessey claims easily enough as the ball bounces apologetically towards the bottom right. 2 min: Townsend races after a long ball down the right wing. Hoedt comes across to shepherd the ball out of play for a goal kick. Palace are certainly on the front foot in these very early exchanges. A fine atmosphere at Selhurst Park, incidentally, though that’s hardly breaking news. There’s always a fine atmosphere at Selhurst. And we’re off! Palace get the ball rolling and they’re out of the blocks quickly, Benteke romping down the left, checking his run, spinning, and looping a cross into the centre. Townsend sticks out a telescopic leg but can’t control and the ball squirts out for a goal kick, to the left of goal. Hopefully as far as Palace are concerned, that’s not the end of Hodgson’s honeymoon period. The teams are out! Crystal Palace are in their usual red and blue, while Saints sport their Rank-Xerox-era-referencing blue-and-very-dark-blue stripes. Or is it blue-and-black? Hm. Anyway, they’re in that. Roy Hodgson waves at the crowd, then gives the cuddly mascot a hug and his best PR smile. We’ll be off in a minute! Roy Hodgson talks! “I thought Palace’s performance last week at Burnley was a good performance, the team was unlucky. But Loftus-Cheek is fit again, so I thought it was good to bring him back. We are very eager. For the players, it is another new start, but we believe in the players and their experience and quality. There is only one way to prove that they are a good team, and that is on the field, and that’s what they hope to do today.” Mauricio Pellegrino speaks! “Virgil van Dijk is training well. But he is coming from eight months without playing the game. Hopefully he can be ready to play. Physically he is good, but he needs more time to be at the same level with his team-mates.” It’s not quite a case of If It Ain’t Broke, Don’t Fix It for Palace. But they did play pretty well at Burnley last Sunday, without reward, so there’s only one change to their starting XI. Lee Chung-Yong, whose poor early backpass sealed Frank de Boer’s fate, and ushered in the Hodgson Era, loses his place to Ruben Loftus-Cheek. Saints by contrast ring the changes, having gone down miserably at home to Watford last week. Out go Jack Stephens, James Ward-Prowse, Sofiane Boufal and Manolo Gabbiadini. In come Maya Yoshida, Mario Lemina, Dusan Tadic and Shane Long. And who’s that on the bench? Why, it’s only Liverpool’s Virgil van Dijk, ready to be reintegrated away from the white-hot heat of St Mary’s. Crystal Palace: Hennessey, Ward, Fosu-Mensah, Dann, Schlupp, McArthur, Cabaye, Puncheon, Townsend, Benteke, Loftus-Cheek. Subs: Speroni, Van Aanholt, Milivojevic, Tomkins, Lee, Sako, Kelly. Southampton: Forster, Cedric, Yoshida, Hoedt, Bertrand, Romeu, Lemina, Tadic, Davis, Redmond, Long. Subs: Stephens, McCarthy, Ward-Prowse, van Dijk, Boufal, Gabbiadini, Targett. Referee: Robert Madley (West Yorkshire). ... in which Roy Hodgson returns to club football, desperate to end his long career on a high note by hauling his boyhood heroes out of trouble, while goal-shy Southampton continue to search for their misplaced mojo. Let’s not kid ourselves: recent form suggests this might not be a free-wheeling classic. Palace have lost all four of their Premier League games so far this season, and have yet to find the net; Southampton have played five matches in league and cup, and have failed to score in four of them.

Pictures showed the 21-year-old man being stopped by officers outside a fried chicken shop in the Hounslow area of west London on Saturday night. Metropolitan police officers were still searching the area on Monday morning. Officers were also searching an address understood to be Farroukh’s home in nearby Stanwell, in Surrey, only metres from the outer boundaries of Heathrow airport. Farroukh was the second person to be arrested over Friday’s attack; an as-yet unnamed 18-year-old man was stopped by officers near the port of Dover on Friday evening. According to a Facebook profile thought to belong to Farroukh, he is originally from Damascus, in Syria, and studied English for speakers of other languages at West Thames college, near the Stanwell property. His profile also claims that he worked for an events company in London. Images of Farroukh on Facebook show him with family members and posing in front of a tourist site in central London. It was reported that he and the 18-year-old had spent time with carers Penelope and Ronald Jones, whose home in Sunbury-on-Thames, in Surrey, was raided by armed police on Saturday morning. That address, as well as those in Stanwell and Hounslow, were all still being searched by counter-terrorism investigators on Monday morning. Images published by the Sun on Sunday night appeared to show Farroukh being arrested by police in Hounslow after a struggle, and officers are understood to have begun searching the chicken shop soon after. Its owner has not responded to a request for comment. The paper quoted an unnamed witness as saying: “The guy had just walked past the takeaway when three blokes and a woman came running past and he was rugby-tackled to the floor. “My mates and I thought he was getting jumped. We were going to help him but they shouted ‘undercover police’ so we stepped back. “The guy was screaming. When they took him down his phone went flying and he dropped his bag containing a drink can and a KitKat. The cops were shouting to get his phone. I guess because it holds important information. “A forensic team wrapped his arms in plastic up to his biceps and his legs up to his thighs. They put plastic on his shoes then put him in overalls and plastic cuffs. They put him in a car which also had all the seats wrapped in plastic.” ITV News released footage on Sunday evening showing a man leaving the Sunbury house on the morning of the attack. He was carrying a bag that resembled that photographed in the tube carriage, prompting speculation that he was the bomber. A spokeswoman for West Thames college said it “confirms that Yahyah Farroukh, who, according to media reports is the second suspect detained in connection with the Parsons Green incident, was a former student at the college from December 2013 to June 2015”. She added: “Yahyah Farroukh joined the college aged 17 to learn English and completed ESOL Threshold courses. The college has robust, well-established Prevent procedures and will co-operate fully with requests from the police.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/sep/18/marriage-equality-scott-morrison-says-he-wants-religious-protections-if-yes-wins","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-18T07:49:38Z","webTitle":"Marriage equality: Scott Morrison says he wants religious protections if 'yes' wins","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/sep/18/marriage-equality-scott-morrison-says-he-wants-religious-protections-if-yes-wins","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/sep/18/marriage-equality-scott-morrison-says-he-wants-religious-protections-if-yes-wins","fields":{"headline":"Marriage equality: Scott Morrison says he wants religious protections if 'yes' wins","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Scott Morrison has issued a warning shot that he will be “very forward leaning” in arguing for religious protections if the same-sex marriage postal survey returns a yes vote, as the Equality Campaign and GetUp insist that their campaign is on track. Morrison told Sky News on Monday afternoon it was “OK to say no” and those who opposed same-sex marriage should “not be intimidated out of it” despite noisy campus counter-protests. “The freedom of religion, more generally, is something that I feel strongly about and one of the reasons I’ve been fairly active on this issue in the past,” he said. “If the survey were to return a yes ... and the prime minister has made this point, he would be making ensure that religious freedoms are protected and I can assure Australians that this would be on the top of my list for that bill and how it went through.” The pace of the marriage equality campaign has intensified because postal survey forms arrived much sooner than was anticipated after the mail-out began on 12 September, with the yes campaign bringing forward phone bank events and planning a major door-knocking blitz on Saturday in response. GetUp data analyst Ben Raue told Guardian Australia the campaign had made 300,000 phone calls so far using the campaign’s yes.org.au phone tool out of a target of half a million, with 200,000 calls in the last week. However, of the 300,000 calls so far only 40,000 reached voters and 19,000 resulted in “meaningful conversations”. The Equality Campaign and GetUp phone campaign is targeting yes voters – as the polls show a majority of Australians support marriage equality it aims to get out the vote rather than persuade undecided voters or those intending to vote no. The yes campaign has used polls and census data to profile voters, yielding insights like that 80% of women under 25 support marriage equality and, although young men also support marriage equality, they are less likely to be sure they will vote. Materials for yes volunteers engaged in phone-bank events say that the Equality Campaign has “purchased access to numbers from commercial databases [to] speak to people across the country”. Callers ask if people have heard about the postal survey, support marriage equality and if they intend to vote to urge them to post their votes immediately. They are encouraged to politely end conversations with people who intend to vote no. Guardian Australia understands from two campaign operatives in separate states and territories that volunteers in phone-bank events have expressed concern at the number of undecided or no voters they encounter on calls, despite the effort to target yes voters. Raue said that of the 19,000 “meaningful conversations”, more than 75% have been with yes voters. Australian Marriage Equality co-chair Alex Greenwich said: “We know a majority of Australians support marriage equality and some demographics are more likely to than not. “But we’re not limiting ourselves to any one group of people ... Calls are being made right across the country and people will be calling different segments of the population. “Occasionally, a volunteer could come across a few tough calls but, for the most part, they encounter people who have got their ballots or are looking forward to so they can vote yes.” GetUp’s marriage equality director, Sally Rugg, said the number of calls and volunteers so far has “completely exceeded expectations” and the campaign was on track to meet its target. “The volunteers are having the best time and are returning back [to make more calls],” she said. Rugg conceded that data to identify likely yes voters “isn’t perfect” but said it was “par for the course” to encounter some no voters because demographics vary in their ability to predict who is a likely yes voter. Rugg said thousands of volunteers would take part in a door-knock campaign on Saturday, allowing them to knock together in centralised groups or to “knock their block” with printed resources showing them which houses to target in their neighbourhood. Asked about whether the Equality Campaign’s polling confirmed public polling that yes voters were more likely to vote, Greenwich said he “hasn’t seen anything that challenges that conclusion”. On Saturday, the Coalition for Marriage launched the no campaign in Sydney, with conservative politicians including Matt Canavan and Cory Bernardi warning of “legal warfare” against opponents if same-sex marriage is legalised. The Coalition for Marriage paints itself as the underdog, despite in the first few weeks of the campaign having outspent the yes campaign five-to-one in free-to-air television advertisements. A new website, The Equality Pulse, has been designed to measure searches for “vote yes” and “vote no” in Google trends in Australia to calculate which campaign is generating more interest. According to the Pulse’s analysis, current Google search trends favour the no campaign. A similar analysis correctly predicted the outcome of the Irish marriage equality referendum in 2015 but differences in the method of voting may “dilute the predictive power” of the analysis, Pulse acknowledges. The Pulse registered three notable spikes in “vote no” searches: 9 August, when the government announced the postal survey; 30 August after the Coalition for Marriage launched its first major TV ad linking same-sex marriage to gender education; and a surge of 275,000 searches on Sunday after the Coalition for Marriage launch."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/sep/20/danielle-macdonald-i-will-never-stop-being-excited-about-harry-potter","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-20T00:29:18Z","webTitle":"Danielle Macdonald: 'I will never stop being excited about Harry Potter'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/20/danielle-macdonald-i-will-never-stop-being-excited-about-harry-potter","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/20/danielle-macdonald-i-will-never-stop-being-excited-about-harry-potter","fields":{"headline":"Danielle Macdonald: 'I will never stop being excited about Harry Potter'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"It’s been a huge year for the 25-year-old Australian actor Danielle Macdonald. Now living in Los Angeles, she was home in June to promote her first lead in a feature film – Sundance’s heartwarming hip-hop hit Patti Cake$ – when her next role was announced: another title character, this time opposite Jennifer Aniston. The film is an adaptation of Julie Murphy’s coming-of-age book Dumplin’, about a plus-size teen who wants to be a beauty queen. Aniston will play her mother. “The first time I saw [Aniston] I was like, ‘I was watching Friends on the plane – and now I’m here,’” Macdonald told Guardian Australia. “It’s weird. It’s always weird.” As she talks about the books that excite her, and how to survive life in LA (“Don’t quit. You’ll get there … Eventually,” reads her Twitter bio), a clear theme emerges: young adult fiction has played a huge role in her life. What’s nostalgia inducing I can count on my fingers how many time I’ve seen my mum wear makeup. She’s just got naturally beautiful skin, eyes – she never really wore makeup, and I guess I didn’t either. When I was a teenager, it was fun to to try things out with friends, but it was always kind of special to me: when I put makeup on, it was for a special occasion. These days I’m obviously wearing it more for work – a lot more – so now not wearing makeup feels special, in a way. You have to have thick skin [in LA], believe me. You’re gonna get a lot of rejection, and people are brutally honest – or sometimes just brutal … People will comment on how you look, people will comment on your skills, they’ll just comment on everything. But I look at it like, they’re not commenting on these things because it’s you. They’re commenting on them in regards to a vision that they have in their head, of a character. You can’t ever take it personally because it’s not personal … You can’t let these things get you down, you really can’t, because it’s every day. You just have to find the people that you love, and surround yourself with them. Harry Potter is the first book that ever got me into reading. I had to read it in year 7, for school, and then I kept reading all of them. I escape into books, I love that feeling when they bring me into a whole other world, and I got to do that for the first time with Harry Potter. It’s still so special to me because I was so closed off to reading before that. I do still love fantasy, but I don’t know that anything will ever top Harry Potter – and I’m fine to leave it as No 1. I will never stop being excited about Harry Potter. What’s thrilling I love tinted moisturiser. I feel like I’m wearing nothing when I’m wearing it, which is how I like to feel, but it still provides me with coverage – and it’s got sunscreen in it so I’m not worried about getting burnt. I’m also one of those people who drags their hands over their face all the time. It’s good knowing that I’m not messing anything up. The industry takes a lot of getting used to. For my job, I always have different hair and makeup and stuff, but in my day-to-day life, I like to keep it really simple … I have friends in LA who wear makeup every single day, never leave the house without a product … For a lot of people, it’s like their protective mask for the world. That’s their thing, and there is nothing wrong with that. My thing is just different. It’s probably just how I grew up. I’m really excited about Dumplin’ right now, because I’m doing the movie. I take photos of books in book stores when I want to remember to get them, and I took a photo of Dumplin’ when I first saw it. The cover is just plain black, with a girl in a red dress with blond curly hair. Maybe it reminded me of me … and then when I heard about the film I was like, ‘Oh wait a minute – this is that book that I wanted to read!’ I read that book in hours, I couldn’t put it down, it’s just so relatable. I loved the relationships, I loved that these girls were just who they were – reading it makes you feel free to be you and just embrace your craziness … It’s about learning that everyone has their own issues, their own insecurities, their own challenges, and we have to be willing to listen to them to be more accepting. What I keep going back to Paw paw ointment. Not going to lie: my favourite thing in the world. I have sensitive skin so if I ever get allergic reactions I put it all over my face for the whole night, and next morning my skin is better again … I can be using a product for a year and then all of a sudden my skin decides to react to it, out of nowhere. Ridiculous. But that’s never happened with paw paw. It’s foolproof. Also, I get dry skin – LA is really dry, a desert – so it’s something that I can just put on overnight and wake up with my skin feeling great. I reread The Duff a lot. I love that book. Again, it’s a coming-of-age book – can you tell that I like this kind of stuff? … “Duff” stands for Designated Ugly Fat Friend, and the point of the book is that everyone feels like that person sometimes, it doesn’t matter who you are or what you do. [Kody Keplinger] was 17 when she wrote it, and it felt like it was a teenager writing for a teenager, so I just really related to it. It’s funny, it’s witty, it’s heartwarming. It’s just really well written. • Patti Cake$ is in cinemas now"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"sport/2017/sep/17/adalaide-byrd-gennady-golovkin-canelo-alvarez-middleweight","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-17T18:01:29Z","webTitle":"Judge Adalaide Byrd’s bizarre call gifts Álvarez another shot at Golovkin","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/sep/17/adalaide-byrd-gennady-golovkin-canelo-alvarez-middleweight","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/sep/17/adalaide-byrd-gennady-golovkin-canelo-alvarez-middleweight","fields":{"headline":"Judge Adalaide Byrd’s bizarre call gifts Álvarez another shot at Golovkin","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Sometimes, professional boxing can leave onlookers and participants drained, from excitement or outrage. Those twin emotions competed with each other yet again here on Saturday night when Adalaide Byrd, a respected official with a long history of sound judgment, came to the daft conclusion that Saúl “Canelo” Álvarez had won all but two rounds of his career-defining and quite excellent fight against Gennady Golovkin. “This is terrible,” Golovkin said in the immediate aftermath, still the owner of his WBC, WBA, IBF and IBO world middleweight titles, but devastated to be denied victory, and only placated by positive talk of the inevitable rematch. In his charming and truncated English, he described the fight as, “a drama show”. He added: “Of course I want the rematch. This was a real fight. Look, I still have all the belts. This was the biggest fight in the world. I’m still the champion.” But not undisputed, like Bernard Hopkins was. And not the lineal champion, which Álvarez remains, because of his win over Miguel Cotto in 2015. There is unfinished business. Certainly, Golovkin is willing to fight Álvarez again, and the Mexican wants it too, of course. But the scorecard shows they drew, when Golovkin deserved to win by a couple of rounds. So they will do it again, largely because of the heroism of the winner and loser, compounded by the eccentricity of Byrd. After taking an early lead then soaking up a steady mid-fight beating, Álvarez fought back and, according to Byrd, won 118-110. He thus avoided what should have been a close and painful defeat. Byrd’s colleagues knew it. Dave Moretti got it about right, giving it to the ageless Kazakh knockout artist 115-113, while Don Trella called it 114-114. The Guardian saw it 7-4-1 in rounds for Golovkin, but could be persuaded that a couple of those were close, and the even round might have gone either way. So the draw was not the outrage. It was the margin of Byrd’s call (she famously refuses to score even rounds). If she had given it to Álvarez by a point there would have been only marginal disgruntlement. In a way it was the ideal decision from a financial point of view, because the rematch will be even bigger, and so will the bank accounts of the fighters, the TV executives, the promoters and all the myriad parties of joined interest. But this was supposed to be an event that decided who was the best fighter in the world. It did not do that. It might, down the road, but everyone was left frustrated. Golovkin’s promoter, Tom Loeffler, said: “I’m sure we can sit down with Oscar [De La Hoya] and put that together.” He added: “There were some close rounds, but I don’t know how [Byrd] scored it like that.” Golovkin’s’s trainer, Abel Sanchez, was more blunt: “I think she needs to go back to school.” Bob Bennett, executive director of the Nevada State Athletic Commission, defended Byrd – a Las Vegan who is married to Hall of Fame referee Bob Byrd – saying: “That’s the life of a judge. She had a bad night in a big fight. She saw the fight in a different way.” Bennett said he nonetheless retained total faith in her competence and, to be fair, she came to the contest with a consistently good record in 442 bouts over 20 years. “When you’re a judge and you’re on the money, nobody says anything about it,” he said. As he had pointed out during the week, the referee, Kenny Bayless, as well as Byrd, Moretti and Trella had, “about 124 years of experience” between them. Bayless has refereed more than 70 championship and elimination fights, Byrd had been a judge in 115 at that level, with Moretti on 169 and Trella 60. Loeffler and De La Hoya go back a long way – he managed Oba Carr, who lost to the Golden Boy in 1999 – so their rapport should smooth the way for another fight, and that might disappoint, as rematches sometimes do. But there remains a chance of justice being done – which did not happen at the T-Mobile Arena on Saturday night. De La Hoya said: “I had it 7-5 [in rounds] for Canelo, but it was one of the best fights we have seen in recent years. Both are tremendous champions. I feel bad that Byrd is taking a bit of heat, but she is a very competent judge over many, many years. Boxing won today.” No it didn’t – as nearly everyone else in the room agreed – including his friend Loeffler, who could not see an overall upside in boxing terms, although he will put that aside when they go through the rematch clause. That, though, is way too much energy devoted to controversy when what the fight and the fighters deserved was celebration of a collision of wills, strength and skill that was at times breathtaking. Álvarez, eight years younger but more seasoned as a pro with 52 fights to 35-year-old Golovkin’s 38 bouts, surprised by taking the early fight to his opponent, who took a few rounds to find his rhythm. Once the Kazakh started driving his lethal jab through the middle of Álvarez’s guard, however, the Mexican struggled. His countering swings under sustained pressure were ill-timed and wild, although some landed. Only one, in the ninth, seriously inconvenienced Golovkin. But Álvarez’s sheer bloodymindedness got him back into the contest. Whatever Byrd thought, he gave up a significant chunk of the action in the middle stages, recovered to grab back a couple of the late rounds but could not summon the one clean finisher he needed to stop Golovkin in his tracks. Nobody has done that to the champion. If Álvarez cannot do it, it is unlikely it will ever happen. Similarly, Álvarez’s chin absorbed shots that have reduced 33 of Golovkin’s opponents to rubble. Thus it is confirmed that two such immovable forces are destined to meet again. In all likelihood Byrd will not be on the judging panel. The moral victory was Golovkin’s, but that was not enough for him. He was plainly distraught afterwards. He had spoken eloquently before the fight about the dangers of the sport to a fighter’s health. He now understands, for the first time in his professional career – and the first time since he was unlucky to be denied a gold medal at the 2004 Olympics – that pain can arrive through other senses. Boxing, perhaps more than many other sports, can do that. It is as unfair as it is inevitable."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/17/the-guardian-view-on-boris-johnsons-pitch-a-ludicrous-fantasy","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-17T17:53:21Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on Boris Johnson’s pitch: a ludicrous fantasy | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/17/the-guardian-view-on-boris-johnsons-pitch-a-ludicrous-fantasy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/17/the-guardian-view-on-boris-johnsons-pitch-a-ludicrous-fantasy","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on Boris Johnson’s pitch: a ludicrous fantasy","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Her Majesty’s secretary of state for foreign and commonwealth affairs, Boris Johnson, is an accomplished confidence man. Like all conmen, he appeals to the larceny in the blood – the wish of the mark to get an impossibly good deal. Mr Johnson’s 4,000-word job application (he wants to be prime minister) in last Saturday’s Telegraph is a masterclass in doublespeak and smarm. Almost everything it says about the prospects of a deal is palpably false, but that hardly matters. It would be worrying in any other foreign secretary, but we know better than to expect this one to share the truth, even if he is in possession of it. However, it is enormously revealing about the state of opinion in the Conservative party. He smells the larceny in the party’s blood; he knows how it wants to be seduced. The members of the Conservative party who might still make him prime minister want to believe Britain is “the second-greatest power on Earth after America”, or at least that it was that as late as “the early years of this century”. They want to believe that wicked foreigners are taking from us £350m a week. What other explanation could there be for national relative decline? Perhaps, because they want to believe it, the more imaginative ones will go on believing, even in the teeth of the prompt, official and unequivocal denial by Sir David Norgrove, chair of the UK statistics Authority. Sir David’s unprecedented public rebuke does not only distinguish between gross and net contributions, as most criticism does: he also points out that the subsidies for agriculture and science that Mr Johnson promises will have to come out of the money simultaneously promised to the NHS. But there are some things Mr Johnson tells his electorate which they take as self-evident. Elderly conservatives don’t have to hope to believe them. They are instinctively convinced they must be true. Chief among these is the claim that you cannot be a patriot and a lover of the European Union. The British civil servants in Brussels are praised to the extent that they sabotaged the work of everyone else there. The only sight that Mr Johnson will admit frightens him is that of “so many young people with the 12 stars lipsticked on their faces … with genuinely split allegiances”. This is an argument that would be dismissed – quite rightly – if it were applied to Scottish supporters of the union. It is entirely possible to be a true patriot and to feel part of a wider polity than that of one’s own nation. In fact, it’s the only way to be. True patriotism demands a sense of proportion, and a loyalty to political and cultural structures wider and more generous than those of the nations that brought us two world wars. Being frightened by the idealism and the generous impulses of young people who declare their allegiance to a European ideal is not true patriotism but the last resort of the scoundrels who inflicted on us this catastrophe. It is reminiscent of the Daily Mail’s demand before the election that Mrs May “crush the saboteurs”; and it is laying the foundations for a new legend of the stab in the back, which will be ready when the old stories about how Britain was the second greatest power in the world, bled dry by the envious leeches of Germany, lose their power to enchant. In this new version of the myth, the humiliations and impoverishment that must follow Brexit will still be the fault of wicked foreigners, but resentment and denial of reality feed on one another, and can never be satisfied. New villains will be needed. The catastrophe will be blamed on everyone who foretold it. We have no need to accept this. The task for all those who believe that Brexit will be a disaster is first to mitigate it and second to ensure responsibility and blame are pinned to the irresponsible clique of Bullingdon boys who brought us to the cliff edge of the referendum and then pushed us off – chief among them Mr Johnson himself."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/2017/sep/18/premier-league-10-talking-points-weekend","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-18T07:46:41Z","webTitle":"Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s action","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/sep/18/premier-league-10-talking-points-weekend","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/sep/18/premier-league-10-talking-points-weekend","fields":{"headline":"Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s action","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"1) Manchester City could break Premier League record Manchester City and Manchester United have goal differences of +14 after five matches. That is more than Celtic in the Scottish Premier League, a division routinely mocked for being uncompetitive. If the Manchester clubs carry on winning by the margins they have enjoyed so far, then they will surpass the Premier League’s record goal difference (+71 racked up by Carlo Ancelotti’s Chelsea in 2009-10), the best ever mustered by Celtic (+80), the New Saints in Wales (+75) and the preposterous Ligue 1 record set by Paris Saint-Germain two years ago (+83). Of course that is a big ‘if’ because there is a small clutch of teams who could frustrate or even beat them. But United and, in particular, City are likely to ridicule many opponents this season. City beat United to the 2012 title on goal difference (+64 against +56); for José Mourinho there would surely be no sweeter way to prevail over Pep Guardiola this season. Paul Doyle • Match report: Watford 0-6 Manchester City 2) Timid Everton showing no return on investment Everton did not deserve to lose 4-0 but a decent second-half showing is no sticking plaster for the damage the last three weeks have caused. This was meant to be the season when Ronald Koeman’s side cut loose and went toe-to-toe with the big boys; consecutive league defeats by Chelsea, Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester United have brought a 0-9 aggregate and if we throw in Thursday’s debacle at Atalanta the debit column since late August rises by three. Everton’s inability to add a striker has been well noted but equally troubling is their general passivity; it was all well and good for Koeman to set them up compactly at Old Trafford but for 20 minutes, by which point they had long since fallen behind, attacking seemed to be anathema. Why be so timid? Everton looked better when they gave it a go but their lack of boldness is becoming a theme. Should something better not be expected after such an eye-watering summer spend? Nick Ames • Match report: Manchester United 4-0 Everton 3) No Costa, no plan B It was an afternoon when Chelsea tried to pick out Álvaro Morata and the summer signing did his level best to get on the end of the crosses. It did not happen for him, although that is not to say he was poor. Just because a striker does not score, Antonio Conte said afterwards, his performance ought not to be damned. But where was Chelsea’s plan B? Out of the country, to be precise. Had Diego Costa been about, this was the type of contest the Chelsea and Spain striker would have relished. Arsenal’s back line, with Shkodran Mustafi in fine form, was unusually comfortable; surely Costa would have done something to unsettle them? The former Atlético Madrid forward, who has been in his native Brazil for weeks, has done so in the past. Conte has had his fill of Costa’s devilment. For Chelsea’s opponents, there is relief that he is out of the picture. David Hytner • Match report: Chelsea 0-0 Arsenal 4) Saints should get better and better Virgil van Dijk got 10 minutes on the pitch for Southampton on Saturday and the fans were supportive. The defender, so desired by Liverpool, is on board at St Mary’s until January at least and that is good news for Mauricio Pellegrino. The manager accepts transfer rumours will continue about the Dutchman, the unfortunate consequence of Southampton’s reputation as a club who develop Champions League talent. But there is an upside to this bind. The more stars Southampton create, the more potential stars see the club as an attractive option. This means the south-coast club can attract talent of a higher calibre than they once did. The summer signings Wesley Hoedt and, especially, Mario Lemina, stood out for the visitors on Saturday. Recruited from Lazio and Juventus respectively, they are an obvious upgrade to the squad. Pellegrino may have to endure uncertainty as Southampton manager but there will be opportunities as well as risks. Paul MacInnes • Match report: Crystal Palace 0-1 Southampton 5) Ibe finally repaying Howe Eddie Howe’s record in the transfer market has been mixed since Bournemouth’s promotion in 2015 and none of his signings has disappointed more than Jordon Ibe. The former Liverpool winger has struggled since joining for £15m, even finding himself on the end of criticism from Howe after the FA Cup defeat at Millwall in January. A handy measure of how underwhelming Ibe has been was his record of no assists in 28 Premier League games before the visit of Brighton &amp; Hove Albion on Friday. That statistic no longer weighs down the 21-year-old, though, after he came off the bench and turned the game by creating fine goals for Andrew Surman and Jermain Defoe. Ibe had been on the pitch for two minutes when he made Surman’s equaliser with a backheel and six minutes later he set up Defoe’s winner with a composed pass, reminding Howe that it is worth persevering with him.

Sean Dyche admitted his gameplan involved targeting Trent Alexander‑Arnold in the air and making life “uncomfortable” for a Liverpool team “who everyone tells you are having a hard time with set pieces”. But to label Burnley simply a long-ball team would be unfair. Both goals on Saturday, to paraphrase the great Bob Paisley, demonstrated it is not about the long ball or the short ball, only the right ball. Dyche said: “Graham Taylor once told me a fantastic story about when he was deemed long ball and he came here [Anfield] back in the day and he had statted about 15 games. He was obsessed with why he was getting labelled that and Bob [Paisley] wasn’t. Bob said: ‘We always pass and keep the ball when we are 3-0 up.’ That was his exact quote.” Andy Hunter • Match report: Liverpool 1-1 Burnley 7) Lascelles is growing up fast If anyone required a reminder of Rafael Benítez’s excellence as a coach and manager it is contained in Newcastle United’s run of three successive Premier League wins. Benítez was devastated when Mike Ashley, the club’s owner, declined to materially strengthen an ostensibly weak squad this summer but he has responded by moulding a formidably well-organised counterattacking team significantly more impressive than the sum of its parts. Previously somewhat ordinary-looking players, most notably Jamaal Lascelles and Christian Atsu, are improving in leaps and bounds. Eyebrows were raised when Benítez retained the 23-year-old Lascelles as captain but an unusually mature centre-half has responded by raising his game appreciably. Off the pitch, he has arguably proved even braver, winning considerable admiration by going where angels fear to tread and resolving a damaging row between board and players about squad bonuses during a telephone call with Ashley. Louise Taylor • Match report: Newcastle United 2-1 Stoke City 8) Aurier settling in well with Spurs Of the Tottenham outfield players who started against Swansea City, only Davinson Sánchez did not try his luck at goal. Spurs had 26 shots, with Serge Aurier perhaps guilty of squandering the best chance when he toe-poked his effort wide during second-half stoppage time. But the Ivorian, a £23m signing from Paris Saint-Germain, who has a booming, colourful grin, has already endeared himself to supporters and team-mates alike since his deadline-day move. He shone against Borussia Dortmund and impressed during his cameo role on Saturday, replacing Moussa Sissoko after Mauricio Pochettino preferred Kieran Trippier at right wing-back. “He’s a good player, a powerful, funny lad,” Trippier said. “His English is OK. He has got pace, power. He has got good delivery on him as well. He is a character, he has a bit of banter about him playing all of his French music and stuff and he’s settled in.” Ben Fisher • Match report: Tottenham Hotspur 0-0 Swansea City 9) Hernández problem causing Bilic a headache A second consecutive clean sheet was welcome for West Ham but their paucity of ideas in attack was a concern in the goalless draw at West Bromwich Albion. Getting the best out of Javier Hernández is becoming a conundrum for Slaven Bilic. “It is not wide wide, we are playing with three or five at the back, so it is more off the striker,” Bilic said. “I don’t think this position is like left-midfield. It is like playing behind the striker with another player like [Michail] Antonio.” Nonetheless Bilic’s insistence that Hernández was not playing on the flank could not disguise the Mexican’s ineffectiveness in a deeper role that restricts his biggest asset, the ability to poach a goal. If Andy Carroll starts in this defensive 3-4-3 system, though, Hernández is compromised: 4-4-2, then? Perhaps, but a more open approach may expose West Ham’s flaws at the back. Balance remains elusive.

Admittedly they were too passive in their only setback so far, the defeat at West Ham last week, but otherwise they have been refreshing to watch and it will encourage David Wagner that his players responded well against Leicester City after the non-performance at the London Stadium. Their energy caused Leicester plenty of problems and they were aggrieved not to have won after Elias Kachunga’s header in the second half was ruled out for the tightest of offsides. One concern, however, is they have found it difficult to make the most of their enterprising play at home. They needed a moment of magic from Aaron Mooy to beat Newcastle, drew 0-0 with Southampton and gifted Leicester a penalty. They will need to be more ruthless as the season wears on.

It was not so much pessimism as prophecy. Twenty-four hours later Alexander Zhukov, the head of the Russian Olympic Committee, confidently predicted at the 131st IOC summit in Lima: “It will be a Russian team with the Russian anthem and Russian flag” in Pyeongchang. Of course it will be. No one who follows the arcane politics of the International Olympic Committee believes otherwise. The fix is indeed in, just as it was before the Rio Olympics, when the IOC niftily side-stepped massive evidence of state-sponsored doping and allowed hundreds of Russians to compete, and again in what is now claimed to have been corrupted bidding processes for the Rio and Tokyo Games, in 2009 and 2013, when votes were allegedly traded for cash. As Tygart points out, doping and buying votes represent two sides of the same coin. If the IOC does not vigorously uphold its values in one area – by ruthlessly prosecuting and expelling dodgy members – why would we expect it to clamp down hard in the other? It was hardly reassuring to hear the IOC president, Thomas Bach, confess he had not seen Icarus, the startling docudrama that reveals just how Russia pulled off the greatest doping trick of all at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics. Then again, perhaps we should not be surprised. Bryan Fogel, the film’s director, tells me that Bach sent him three letters last year promising that the IOC was taking the whole issue seriously before – in Fogel’s words – “deciding to go against every single Olympic value they sell to the world and basically stabbing every clean athlete in the back”. Not everyone is so trenchant. But few doubt that, when the two IOC commissions looking into Russian doping report by the end of the year, an arrangement will be found where a few athletes are sanctioned but the rest head to South Korea. The World Anti-Doping Agency’s position in all this is intriguing, to put it mildly. Having been at loggerheads with the IOC over its Rio decision, Wada is back riding in its sidecar again. That was illustrated last week by its reaction when 17 national anti-doping organisations, including the US and UK, called for Russia to be banned from Pyeongchang. Craig Reedie, Wada’s president, rather than back them, called it “unhelpful” and urged them to look “forward rather than back”. Tygart’s response to his comments is dismissive. “The only unhelpful thing is the lack of decisive action in fully protecting clean athletes’ rights,” he says. “It’s now or never for justice and reform.” Reedie is often genial company but as a former longstanding member of the IOC he is compromised, despite his protestations. More importantly, the 76-year-old’s soft skills, which play well in the corridors of global sport, do not transfer so well to anti-doping. Having Reedie as Wada head sometimes seems as incongruous as seeing Dixon of Dock Green in charge of Interpol. It is hard not to be reminded of Wada’s earlier inaction over Russia for many years. Vitaly Stepanov, a disillusioned Russian anti-doping agent, first approached Wada in 2010 – yet it was four years before he was put in touch with the German journalist Hajo Seppelt. Later, when evidence of widespread doping in Russian athletics was confirmed, Reedie ignored pleas to investigate other sports until evidence from the former head of Russian anti-doping Grigory Rodchenkov made it impossible to do so. Wada’s excuse is it did not have any investigative powers until 2015. Yet what use is a reluctant prosecutor when there’s a crime spree and a star whistleblower wants to spill the beans? As Stepanov put it to the Washington Post last year: “I often wondered what I was to Wada. I didn’t know if I was an informant or just a pain in the butt.” Wise heads counsel that Wada is in a difficult position and also needs to stay close to the IOC given that it faces defamation cases following reports made by Richard McLaren last year. In June, for instance, the Russian sports agent Andrey Baranov filed a $5m defamation case against Wada and McLaren for claiming his athletes used anabolic steroids. Even so, it hardly inspires confidence when Wada is so willing to do the IOC’s bidding. Meanwhile Tygart warns that, if the public and athletes don’t believe what they are seeing, it will have devastating consequences. “The IOC say clean sport is important but they have to show it is not just lip service. Frankly this is probably the last opportunity, because of the erosion of confidence amongst athletes.” It is noticeable that a proposal for a charter of athletes’ rights, which aims to formalise international sport’s obligation to provide a level playing field for competitors, is rapidly gaining traction. It could mean that, just as athletes need to abide by anti-doping rules or face the consequences, sports and governing bodies such as the IOC have to do the same. Incidentally, last week Reedie urged patience from all sides, admitting that “it is quite difficult to get a country like Russia to change things quickly”. Given that its athletes are set to compete in Pyeongchang, some might ask what incentive is there to do so at all?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/18/we-should-end-the-suffering-of-patients-who-know-they-are-dying-and-want-to-do-so-peacefully","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-18T18:00:12Z","webTitle":"We should end the suffering of patients who know they are dying and want to do so peacefully | Peter Singer","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/18/we-should-end-the-suffering-of-patients-who-know-they-are-dying-and-want-to-do-so-peacefully","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/18/we-should-end-the-suffering-of-patients-who-know-they-are-dying-and-want-to-do-so-peacefully","fields":{"headline":"We should end the suffering of patients who know they are dying and want to do so peacefully","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Victorian and New South Wales governments are considering whether to introduce legislation to allow voluntary assistance in dying. I support legislation, with adequate safeguards against abuse, to achieve this objective. People often ask me what connects the various issues I have written about over the years – issues like global poverty, the way we treat animals, and the way we die. My answer is simple: I am seeking to reduce pointless suffering. The world is rich enough to give everyone clean water, basic healthcare and enough to eat, so why do we let people in extreme poverty continue to go without these necessities? We have no need to confine billions of animals on factory farms, causing them lifelong misery, and ending up with less food for ourselves than we feed to them. But the easiest suffering of all to end would be the suffering of patients who know they are dying and who do not want to go through the last days, weeks or months of the dying process. If a doctor is willing to help a patient to die peacefully when the patient has made a careful and reasonable request for that assistance, whose interest is furthered by turning that doctor into a criminal? Forty years ago, when I first began to ask that question, I received two different answers. Some said that it is always wrong to take an innocent human life, or to be complicit in patients taking their own lives (by, for example, writing a prescription for a drug that the patient can use to bring about a peaceful death). There are religions that believe this, but if we do not accept the authority of those religious teachers, why should we support that belief? It makes good sense to hold that it is wrong to kill an innocent person who wants to go on living. We might also agree that it is wrong to kill an innocent person who has some prospect of a future life of acceptable quality. Why, though, should we think that it is wrong to help someone to die if they, after careful thought, ask you for that help, and have good reasons for making that request? Others – or sometimes the same people – argued that once we legalise assistance in dying for some people in some circumstances, we will start sliding down a slippery slope of more and more killing that ends in something like the atrocities committed by the Nazis. This scenario never seemed plausible to me, but in the 1970s it was not easy to definitively refute it. Legalised assistance in dying was then a step into the unknown. No modern country had done it. Forty years on we have a much better basis for saying that allowing doctors to act on considered requests from their terminally or incurably ill patients will not take us down to places we do not choose to go. In the United States, voluntary assistance in dying is now legal in the states of California, Oregon, Washington, Montana, Vermont and Colorado, as well as in Washington DC. It is also legal across all of Canada. In Europe, it is legal in the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg and Switzerland and in South America, in Colombia. We can now draw on 30 years’ experience with the open practice of medical assistance in dying in the Netherlands, and 20 years in Oregon. These jurisdictions have been carefully studied, especially by opponents of assistance in dying seeking evidence of abuse, but they have been unable to demonstrate any slippery slope to disaster. Perhaps the most convincing evidence of this is that no legislature that has legalised assistance in dying has subsequently voted to repeal the legislation. Even when the Dutch had a Roman Catholic prime minister leading a Christian Democrat government, there was no attempt to rescind the legislation. It is no coincidence that two of the Netherlands’ neighbouring states, Belgium and Luxembourg, have, after some years of observing the practice there, decided to adopt similar legislation themselves. They knew better than any other country how well the legalisation of voluntary assistance in dying was working in the Netherlands. Oregon was the pioneer in the US, passing its Dying with Dignity Act in 1997. The numbers using the law are still quite small, but it is interesting that each year only about two thirds of those who obtain a prescription under the act for a lethal drug use it to end their lives. For many, it seems, the fact that they have a way out, should things become unbearable, is already a significant benefit. Contrary to claims that when assistance in dying becomes legal, the poor and vulnerable will be pushed into ending their lives, Oregon statistics show that those using the legislation were overwhelming white (96%) and well-educated (half had a university degree). Objections to legalising assistance in dying come mainly from those with religious beliefs contrary to this practice. To them I would say that, just as with same-sex marriage, if they do not want something for themselves, they are free to avoid it. But we live in a pluralistic society. Not everyone holds religious views, and many who are religious do not accept that it is always wrong to assist someone to die. I cannot see why the minority who have religious objections to voluntary assistance in dying should try to deny it to others who do not share their beliefs.

My hesitancy stems from a history that stretches long before Liz and Donna decided to have me. My grandmother grew up on a farm in the 1940s in Queensland in a town riddled with homophobia and with little exposure to diverse subcultures. It’s a place where the word “fag” is a common colloquialism. At age 21, my mother Donna came out as a lesbian to my grandmother. My grandmother was shocked and devastated and lovingly offered her psychiatric treatment. 32 years on, my grandmother and step-grandfather (although not related by blood, he is absolutely my grandfather) are accepting of my parents’ sexuality, but at bingo they still don’t talk about “gays”, and certainly not in relation to their own family unless directly asked about it. It’s not exactly a secret, but they would never willingly offer the information that their daughter is a lesbian or that their granddaughter was raised by lesbians for fear of social exclusion or judgement. When pondering what boxes their pens will be ticking, I realise that the only time I have ever shifted a core opinion is when someone I cared for opened a safe space for me to expand my thinking, and took the time to respectfully explain another point of view. So recently I went for lunch with my grandparents. Over fish and chips and a floral tablecloth, we had a conversation about the postal survey. I listened to how my grandparents felt about the vote, about my mother coming out as a teenager and about the feminine man at the local bakery in Mackay who made exceptional sponge cake. We gently explored why some gay couples might identify as “butch” or “femme”, about my grandfather’s concern about children being raised in families like ours ( “other” families – they know I am ok), about what they love about traditional marriage and this crazy rapidly evolving world we live in, that has changed so much since they were young. Only then did I offer my personal reflections on why equality is important to me and why I need those I love to stand by me at this time. It was a beautiful, connected conversation. Our world is full of contradictions. Over the last few years in this fight for equality I have been dumbstruck by humans and their incredible ability to separate personal experience from ingrained prejudice. How can my own relatives love their daughter yet hide her sexuality from their closest friends? While we were campaigning in Canberra with Gayby Baby, I met a political advisor working for a Liberal MP who opposed marriage equality, and who was taking leave to get married overseas where it’s legal. And then there was the journalist who took the time to tell a 12 year old child of gay parents that she would never be normal because of their parents’ sexuality. While this road we are travelling, paved with irony and absurdity, can block my view that all people are innately “good”, right now, we have to revive our sense of generosity and create spaces where mutual understanding can breathe. I believe that marriage equality will be won through the openness and willingness of our communities and allies to engage in meaningful conversations with those that have divergent opinions on this issue. So yeah, have a cuppa with someone in your life who may not yet be comfortable with voting yes and listen to them. When we got to the end of lunch, I asked my grandmother if there was anything she felt she had gained from having a lesbian daughter. She looked at me and said quite simply, “You… And that’s why I’ll be voting yes.” Maya Newell has made award-winning short documentaries and has directed Growing Up Gayby (2013) and Gayby Baby (2015) If you would like to be part of a radio podcast, consider recording your conversation (of course with full consent) and sending it to us at: info@thegaybyproject.com"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/2017/sep/17/real-madrid-gareth-bale-real-sociedad-match-report-la-liga","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-17T20:44:09Z","webTitle":"Gareth Bale seals Real Madrid victory over Real Sociedad in La Liga","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/sep/17/real-madrid-gareth-bale-real-sociedad-match-report-la-liga","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/sep/17/real-madrid-gareth-bale-real-sociedad-match-report-la-liga","fields":{"headline":"Gareth Bale seals Real Madrid victory over Real Sociedad in La Liga","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Real Madrid recorded a convincing 3-1 win at Real Sociedad, with Gareth Bale capping the victory with a fine second-half finish. The victory hauls Zinedine Zidane’s side back closer to La Liga leaders, Barcelona, who made it four straight league victories this season after winning 2-1 at Getafe on Saturday. Madrid faced a tricky clash against an in-form side with Cristiano Ronaldo and Marcelo suspended and Karim Benzema and Toni Kroos injured but after disappointing consecutive league draws they made light work of Eusebio Sacristan’s men. Defeat for Sociedad ended their unbeaten start to the campaign, after winning their opening three matches. The exciting 20-year-old, Borja Mayoral, opened the scoring before Kévin Rodrigues pulled the hosts level in San Sebastián. But Real regained the lead when Rodrigues, the Sociedad defender, put the ball past his own goalkeeper after trying to block Mayoral’s cross from the right, before Bale completed the win, lifting the ball over Gerónimo Rulli after sprinting on to Isco’s long ball downfield. Madrid’s Marco Asensio had a goal disallowed late on but by then they had wrapped up the three points. “I’m very happy for Borja Mayoral and Bale; they needed that,” Dani Carvajal, the Real Madrid defender, told Movistar. “We have a big squad and Mayoral is capable of playing and performing at the highest level, as he showed in this game.” Madrid have scored in every game since beating Sociedad 1-0 in April 2016 at Anoeta. “You have to congratulate the players,” said Zidane, who took over at Madrid in January 2016. “It’s the players who are the protagonists. They’re the ones that run; they’re the ones that fight. It’s 73 games but today the most important thing was to win.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2017/sep/17/ronald-koeman-jose-mourinho-everton-manchester-united","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-17T19:03:51Z","webTitle":"Ronald Koeman frustrated by José Mourinho’s top-four comment","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/sep/17/ronald-koeman-jose-mourinho-everton-manchester-united","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/sep/17/ronald-koeman-jose-mourinho-everton-manchester-united","fields":{"headline":"Ronald Koeman frustrated by José Mourinho’s top-four comment","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Ronald Koeman told José Mourinho to “get realistic” after the Manchester United manager claimed before his side’s 4-0 win that Everton should be aiming for a top-four finish “at least” having spent £140m in the summer transfer window. Goals from Antonio Valencia on two minutes, Henrikh Mkhitaryan, on 83, Romelu Lukaku, on 89, and an Anthony Martial penalty in added time put United joint-top with Manchester City, both teams having 13 points and 16 goals with two conceded after five matches. Koeman’s side have lost their last four matches in all competitions and are in the relegation zone. His frustration was evident when discussing Mourinho’s comments. “I read the United programme and my colleague told me about Everton spending £140m and so they need to go for the top four,” the Dutchman said. “If there’s anybody in this room and outside and sees this as something realistic for us, please comment. Be realistic. I’m not happy how we started the season, but please be a bit realistic about Everton. We need time, but it’s difficult in football.” Mourinho had written: “We are up against a team that has spent £140m. Obviously we are playing a team that wants to at least secure a top-four position.” Afterwards, the Portuguese said of his side’s win: “The performance was very good, especially in the first 30-35 minutes, it was probably our best performance of the season. We pressed them and they did not have a chance to get out, they did not have a shot, it was very impressive. I think if the result was two- or three-nil after 30 minutes I would say a clear reflection of fantastic football we played in the first 30-35 minutes. The second goal went in, then game over.” Asked about City, who beat Watford 6-0 on Saturday, Mourinho said: “Today I didn’t think one single second about Man City. I thought about Tottenham, Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool. They didn’t win their matches and it was a chance for us to get two points like they got last week when we drew against Stoke. I was just thinking about them, not City. City won their game, they did their job.” Regarding Paul Pogba and reports he may be out for 12 weeks because of his hamstring injury, Mourinho said: “I don’t know if it is 12 weeks or 12 days, honestly. Any comment, any views, any rumour, is totally wrong, because we do not know if it is 12 weeks or 12 days. “The player was diagnosed initially after the match because of the conditions of the muscle and bleeding, was one more week to wait and see clearly in the scans and nobody in this club spoke about 12 days or 12 weeks. It’s a muscular injury in the hamstring but we have a normal procedure and wait a few more days.

The warning came on Sunday after Trump tweeted about a phone call to South Korean president Moon Jae-in, and appeared to mock Kim Jong-un. “I spoke with President Moon of South Korea last night,” the US president wrote. “Asked him how Rocket Man is doing. Long gas lines forming in North Korea. Too bad!” The latest bellicose language from Washington came just days after North Korea fired another ballistic missile, which overflew Japan, and Kim boasted that such efforts would continue as his country neared its goal of “equilibrium” in military force with the US. Nikki Haley, US ambassador to the United Nations, said North Korea was starting to “feel the pinch” of being “economically strangled” as recent sanctions have caused the country to be “cut off from the world”. But, she said, diplomatic and other non-military options were running out. “If North Korea keeps on with this reckless behavior, if the United States has to defend itself or defend its allies in any way, North Korea will be destroyed,” the former South Carolina governor told CNN’s State of the Union. “We all know that and none of us want that. None of us want war. But … something is going to have to be done.” North Korea will be high on the agenda at the UN general assembly in New York this week, after the UN security council voted unanimously for further sanctions. Asked about Trump’s description of such measures as merely “small steps” towards a solution of the North Korea problem, Haley said: “Everybody in the international community sees what a big deal it is.” CNN host Dana Bash asked if Trump’s now infamous pledge to respond to any action against the US mainland or its territories with “fire and fury like the world has never seen” was an empty threat. She said it was not and that responsibility for any stepping up of action against North Korea now lay with the Pentagon and defense secretary James Mattis. “We are trying to use every diplomatic possibility … [but] we have pretty much exhausted all the things we can do at the security council at this point,” Haley said. “I’m perfectly happy kicking this over to General Mattis now, because he has plenty of military options. We wanted to go through all the diplomatic options to get their attention first and if that doesn’t work, General Mattis will take care of it.” National security adviser HR McMaster told ABC’s This Week Kim Jong-un would “have to give up his nuclear weapons because the president has said he’s not going to tolerate this regime threatening the United States and our citizens with a nuclear weapon”. Asked if that meant Trump would launch a military strike in the event that North Korea did not comply, as it has shown no sign of doing, McMaster said: “He’s been very clear about that, that all options are on the table.” The only concession was given by secretary of state Rex Tillerson, who said on CBS’s Face the Nation that the US still “seeks a peaceful solution” to the North Korean crisis. Pressure on the regime was “designed to bring North Korea to the table for productive and constructive dialogue”, he said. But Tillerson also warned that “we do not have much time left” and said that if efforts to talk were to fail: “Our military option is the only one left.” “We have tried a couple of times to signal to them that we are ready if they are ready [to talk], but they only thing they do is fire more missiles,” Tillerson said.

In Wales, it is splendidly ironic that some of those questioning the validity of the 2016 referendum result are the same people who rejected any such questioning in 1997 when Wales voted for devolved government by 50.3 to 49.7 – a margin so narrow that the verdict could not be confirmed until the very last vote had been counted. There have been four cardinal events in Welsh politics since the second world war. This week Wales is marking, celebrating or bewailing (take your pick) the most recent of them, the poll held in accordance with the Referendums (Scotland and Wales) Act 1997. This was one of the first pieces of legislation passed by the Labour administration of Tony Blair. But it is difficult to understand the peculiar circumstances of 1997 without appreciating what went before. The first event of note was the creation of the Welsh Office (now the Wales Office) in 1965 following the appointment of James Griffiths, one of Labour’s forgotten heroes, as the first secretary of state for Wales. Griffiths had slowly come to the view that Wales needed a Whitehall department wholly dedicated to finding Welsh solutions to Welsh problems. Griffiths was a highly respected figure but even he found it difficult to get Whitehall to take Wales seriously. Imagine how difficult it must have been for some of his less impressive successors. Griffiths’ Labour allies – including his successor, Cledwyn Hughes – were both helped and hindered in 1966 by the momentous victory of Plaid Cymru’s Gwynfor Evans in the Carmarthen parliamentary byelection. Harold Wilson, the prime minister, suddenly became far more receptive to Welsh calls for economic aid. Labour was terrified of a major Plaid advance and started thinking seriously about developing a devolution strategy. This led eventually, thanks in part to the Kilbrandon report, to the Wales Act 1978, which set out the terms for the referendum held on St David’s Day 1979. The referendum was notable for two reasons: the crushing rejection of Labour’s plans by a margin of 80 to 20, and the relentlessly toxic nature of the campaign itself. Set against that base standard, the Brexit debate has been an exercise in gentle merriment. The experience of the ensuing Thatcher years convinced many of the Labour doubters of 1979 that devolved government might after all provide some political protection. On this basis they went ahead with the referendum plans in 1997 and – by a whisker, thanks to Blair’s immense popularity at the time – they carried the day. I spent nearly 15 years as a political journalist at Westminster, and witnessed at first hand the way Wales was treated before devolution arrived. The Welsh select committee did some important and valuable work, but parliamentary debates on Welsh matters could be cancelled for the flimsiest reason, a monthly session of Welsh questions was often a jeering pantomime, and Welsh affairs were generally regarded as a nuisance or worse. There were many Welsh MPs who worked hard to make things better, but they worked within an antiquated system that thwarted their ability to change things. There are still people who think Wales was better governed when Westminster grudgingly devoted some time to Welsh issues, but I am not one of them. This is hardly a controversial statement: it is instructive to note that every major political party now fully endorses the devolved settlement. This is not to say that people are happy with the performance of the national assembly and Welsh government. That is a wholly different matter, and Wales certainly needs far more scrutiny by journalists of its government and politicians. It was the late John Smith who firmly committed Labour to a policy of devolving power that – in his compelling assertion – reflected the “settled will” of the Scottish people. Welsh voters have been on a rather more tortuous journey. The “settled will” of 1979 was one of vehement opposition. By 1997 it had changed to uncertainty. And now, on the eve of this 20th anniversary of the referendum, every credible survey of opinion suggests that the national assembly and Welsh government are widely accepted by Welsh voters. The biggest change of the past few decades has been a fundamental change of perspective. As the Brexit process rolls on, the degree to which Westminster and Whitehall respect the devolved settlement is more relevant than ever. But devolved government – “government closer to the people” in Smith’s words – is here to stay. • Huw Edwards will present 20 Years of Power to be broadcast on BBC1 Wales on Wednesday 20 September"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/2017/sep/17/pep-guardiola-full-backs-short-passes-manchester-city","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-17T21:30:51Z","webTitle":"Manchester City justify Pep Guardiola’s £130m spent on full-backs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/sep/17/pep-guardiola-full-backs-short-passes-manchester-city","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/sep/17/pep-guardiola-full-backs-short-passes-manchester-city","fields":{"headline":"Manchester City justify Pep Guardiola’s £130m spent on full-backs","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Jaws dropped and heads shook when Manchester City spent around £130m on three full-backs this summer. In financial terms that sum meant little to City’s infinitely rich Abu Dhabi rulers. But on the pitch the sense of those investments is becoming clear. They nearly complete City’s team. The two most expensive of those full-backs, Kyle Walker and Benjamin Mendy, each cost more than £50m, about double what City paid Real Madrid for the third, Danilo. Walker and Mendy could not be deployed together for the first few matches of this campaign because of injury and suspension, but they have started City’s last three games and the opposition have paid a heavy price. Liverpool, Feyenoord and Watford have been demolished by a combined score of 15-0. In those matches Mendy and Walker dominated their flanks, flying up and down relentlessly in a way that showed “full-back” to be an outdated label. They also showed how far past it last season’s counterparts were, once-fine performers such as Bacary Sagna, Gaël Clichy, Pablo Zabaleta and Aleksandar Kolarov having become creaking thirty-somethings unable to contribute like the new thrusters. “[Mendy and Walker] are having a big impact, Danilo too,” says Pep Guardiola. “They are young – Mendy is 23 and Kyle (27) is also young enough. They have huge energy to go up and it stretches our play and means we can have more players in the middle to do the short passes. I like our passes to be three, four, five or six metres, no more than that. It gives us continuity. We create spaces in behind and you need players in those positions. Without these signings it would have been more complicated.” Guardiola’s description of the impact was particularly accurate at Vicarage Road, as Mendy and Walker’s raids enabled Kevin De Bruyne and David Silva to flit in-field as they pleased. The pair tormented the hosts. De Bruyne, mind you, is evidently exempt from his manager’s six-metre guideline, his visionary short- and long-range passing making him a marvellous law unto himself. Silva, too, conjures at will. His cross from the left led to Nicolás Otamendi nodding in City’s fourth goal at Watford. With Sergio Agüero scoring a hat-trick, creating a goal for Gabriel Jesus and allowing Raheem Sterling to convert a late penalty, the hosts were overwhelmed despite not playing badly. City could have hit double figures. For all that, City have also benefitted from other factors during their recent run: Liverpool were weakened by the sending-off of Sadio Mané, and Watford were missing their first-choice centre-backs through injury and complained, correctly, that two of City’s first three goals should have been disallowed for offside. Those are important details even if it can feel like nitpicking to point them out given how formidable City have seemed. Similarly, the fact that Watford hinted at lingering problems in City’s central defence when they threatened from a couple of late set-pieces does not mean that Guardiola’s team did not deserve to win heavily. But the Catalan knows his team are not perfect. “After this [win at Watford] it looks like ‘oh no, we cannot improve. But of course we can improve! There are still movements and actions we can improve.” Guardiola notes the progress from last season but also knows that the biggest gauge so far of how much they have improved will come at the end of this month, when they travel to Stamford Bridge. Antonio Conte’s team beat City home and away on their way to the title last season. “I think we have made steps forward,” he says. “Last season we did not win a game away in the Champions League and now we have done that. We won a lot of games away in the Premier League [12 out of 19] but this kind of performance [against Watford] we did not see. We will see when we go to face last season’s champions what our level is.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/blog/2017/sep/17/eden-hazard-chelsea-arsenal","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-17T17:27:42Z","webTitle":"Eden Hazard cameo underlines Chelsea's need for extra source of flair | Barney Ronay","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2017/sep/17/eden-hazard-chelsea-arsenal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2017/sep/17/eden-hazard-chelsea-arsenal","fields":{"headline":"Eden Hazard cameo underlines Chelsea's need for extra source of flair","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"On a rowdy, bruising, enjoyably intense afternoon at Stamford Bridge Chelsea showed two sides to their game. First came the one that doesn’t involve Eden Hazard. For the opening 70 minutes of this 0-0 draw the champions were neat, focused, disciplined and aggressively blunt in their attacking rhythms, the gears a little gummed. After which, in glimpses, they played the other version, the Hazard-remix, the one where Chelsea’s No10 provides a vital free radical element in Antonio Conte’s hard-running 3-5-2, somebody to see the angles between the angles, to create space rather than simply applying relentless physical pressure. Even with a convalescent Hazard on the pitch Chelsea looked not just more potent, but better balanced, a team with deeper gears, even a little champion swagger. At one point as the game ticked down Hazard dropped back, picked up the ball inside the Arsenal half and turned away from Olivier Giroud in a slightly mocking parabola, spinning through 180 degrees like a frigate evading a supertanker, showing in that moment the ability to beat an opponent almost as an afterthought that is beyond anybody else in this Chelsea team. Not that there’s any great shame in that. Chelsea still came close to scoring several times in that opening hour . And Hazard is a genuinely rare presence in the Premier League, the obvious grace note in this hard-running collective, and a player without an obvious replacement in the squad. Even before kick-off it was tempting to wonder where Chelsea might find a goal if Álvaro Morata was closely marked. Willian has three Premier League goals this year. Pedro has two since February. Victor Moses has not scored for Chelsea in the league since last November. N’Golo Kanté has two league goals in a season and a bit. But then Conte’s champions have always been a linear, pared-back machine. Forty-eight of their 85 league goals last season were either scored or made by two players not on the pitch at the start here. Hazard, of course, but also the rogue Diego Costa, Arsenal’s own cackling, kidney‑jabbing nemesis who presumably watched this game on TV in Brazil in a state of unusual excitement, nipping out every few minutes to give his under‑gardener Chinese burns or rake his studs down the achilles of his sous-chef. Chelsea started well here. With 10 minutes gone Morata should have scored, glancing a deep cross from César Azpilicueta wide. After which a strange thing happened. Arsenal began to dig in, to press recklessly high and match Chelsea not just in their formation, but in registers such as will, muscle and work rate. It took Conte to half-time to alter the balance of his Cesc Fàbregas-Kanté pivot in central midfield. For all his incision Fàbregas has been a stretch as a pure central midfielder ever since he came to the club. Here it was one of those days where too many battles are lost, too much ground conceded. In the second half Chelsea were stronger, Tiémoué Bakayoko coming on and almost immediately picking up the ball and driving through the middle of the pitch, all strolling power and balance. Still, though, in a tight game what Chelsea really lacked was a moment of stillness. The game-plan often seems to involve playing tight, high-pressure football and waiting for a mistake, which is let’s face it never the worst idea against late‑Wenger Arsenal. The parts continued to function well here. Now and then Marcos Alonso would spank a hard, flat pass 50 metres to Moses on the other wing. Willian and Pedro sprinted with verve through the channels and Conte became increasingly animated on his touchline as the game began to congeal a little. Hazard’s appearance did open up that attacking third eye a little, a player who simply looks different to everyone else, lower to the ground, able to take the ball on the half-turn and pick up speed instantly. Three or four times there were moments of muscle-memory recall as Hazard ran at Arsenal’s defence with the old preternatural balance, feet battering the turf in double-time. His return will of course be vital to Chelsea’s progress from here. For the last three seasons Chelsea have had two players to wrench days like this their way. Morata is a variation on Costa, but not in any sense a replacement for his horrible, match-turning voodoo. Morata looked like a player finding his space in this team, spending most of the time falling over to no great effect. Similarly there is no real Hazard-alternative in this squad. Chelsea were linked with plenty of refusenik transfer targets this summer but none that would have really changed the way the team plays, or offered a different set of attacking rhythms. Conte seems to want two Chelsea teams that will play the same way. If this claustrophobic game of fine details revealed anything it is that he is perhaps missing another note of flair and uncontrolled creativity to slot in on days like this."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2017/sep/17/manchester-united-everton-premier-league-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-17T17:08:09Z","webTitle":"Antonio Valencia screamer sets up Manchester United win over Everton","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/sep/17/manchester-united-everton-premier-league-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/sep/17/manchester-united-everton-premier-league-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Antonio Valencia screamer sets up Manchester United win over Everton","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"By the end Wayne Rooney could probably be forgiven for wondering what kind of adventures he might be missing with his old team. He had heard his name sung and, before he disappeared into the tunnel, there was a little, polite wave of appreciation. Yet Rooney wore the look of a man whose return to Old Trafford had felt like an ordeal and he can never have imagined there would come a time when he would find himself in the away dressing room ruminating on what it is like to be in the relegation zone. The paradox is that this was not always the fluent, dangerous Manchester United that has been seen in other parts in the new season and it felt slightly perplexing that José Mourinho described it as their best performance so far. Indeed, for a long part of the second half they had flirted with the idea of letting their opponents back into the match and there was clear evidence of how much they would miss the injured Paul Pogba. Ultimately, though, it turned into the third 4-0 win of their opening five league fixtures and another reminder of the team’s firepower. It is the first time United have won their opening three home games since the 2011-12 season and they are level with Manchester City at the top of the Premier League on identical records: 13 points, 15 goals scored, two conceded. Pep Guardiola’s team are top solely because their second name starts with a C rather than a U. Everton, in stark contrast, find themselves in the bottom three on the back of that late flurry of goals when Henrikh Mkhitaryan (83 minutes), Romelu Lukaku (89) and the substitute Anthony Martial (92) quadrupled the score and Rooney, chin in hands, watched forlornly from the dugout, having just been substituted. Antonio Valencia had opened the scoring, four minutes in, with a firecracker of a shot and these feel like difficult moments for Ronald Koeman and his players. Everton have now gone six games in all competitions without a victory, losing the last four with a combined score of 0-12, and have not won in the league since the opening weekend of the season. “Please be realistic,” Koeman said afterwards, taking issue with Mourinho’s reference to Everton being a club that had ambitions of a top-four finish. The reality, however, is that Everton’s supporters were entitled to expect more after an extensive period of summer recruitment. A lot of those fans had already left by the time Martial’s penalty, after a Morgan Schneiderlin handball, completed the scoring. They enjoyed that moment in the first half when Lukaku shot wide when it seemed certain he would score. Yet they also had to endure being shushed by their former striker after he had set up Mkhitaryan’s goal. Lukaku had been booed by the away end and, when he added the third goal, he made a beeline towards the Evertonians, cupping his ear as if to ask why the volume had suddenly gone down. As for Rooney, he found it difficult early on to provide any evidence that he can still flourish at United’s level. He did, however, grow into the game and became a difficult opponent for Eric Bailly in particular. It needed David de Gea’s quick reactions to deny Rooney an equaliser early in the second half and it was something of a surprise that Koeman removed him in the 81st minute. At the risk of sounding slightly cruel it was a better performance than the crowd here became used to seeing from Rooney in recent seasons. Throughout the middle hour of the game there was not actually a great deal between the two teams. Yet Valencia’s goal was a beauty and it is difficult to think of any other time in his eight years at Old Trafford when he has struck a shot more powerfully. United’s captain was 20 yards from goal, aiming diagonally from close to the far corner of the penalty area, when Nemanja Matic’s crossfield pass curled his way and he let fly. The noise of the crowd made it clear they had witnessed something special and the ball flashed past Jordan Pickford at the kind of speed that makes it harsh, perhaps, to question the goalkeeper. Even so, an argument could be made that the shot was central enough to be saved. Hypothetical, perhaps, but it is difficult to think De Gea would have been beaten that way. Even in a four-goal win De Gea showed again why he is so valuable with second-half saves from Rooney and Gylfi Sigurdsson. An equaliser would not have been implausible at that stage but it was still more likely that the home team would score next. Mkhitaryan swept a low shot past Pickford to soothe the crowd’s nerves and Lukaku’s seventh goal in seven games for his new club came from close range in a crowded penalty area. Lukaku’s free-kick had bounced back off the defensive wall but Matic fired the loose ball back in and United’s £75m striker had dashed forward, anticipating the ball might come back his way.

The Brazil defender, already booked, was shown a straight red card by Michael Oliver after planting his right foot into Sead Kolasinac’s left shin three minutes from time. David Luiz had lost control of the ball as he attempted to shrug off Alexis Sánchez, snapping at his back, and was apparently dismissed for use of excessive force. He will now serve a three-match ban, missing the visit of Nottingham Forest on Wednesday in the League Cup, the weekend’s trip to Stoke and, most critically, the home game against Manchester City at the end of the month. He is the third Chelsea player to be sent off in five Premier League fixtures this season, following the dismissals of Gary Cahill and Cesc Fàbregas during the opening-day defeat by Burnley. Before that Pedro Rodríguez was sent off in the Community Shield against Arsenal and Victor Moses was dismissed against the same opponents in the FA Cup final in May. Asked whether he thought Chelsea were developing a problem with indiscipline, Conte said: “I don’t know. Do you think we are becoming bad? For sure, it’s strange, no? A strange situation. Look, I was a player and I think this can happen, this type of period, if you are not so lucky and receive red cards. But we have to try to improve in all situations. “We work to improve tactical and physical situations. In the end, we’ll try to pay more attention in the future. I hope, also, to be more lucky with the refereeing decisions. For us, and also for the opponents. Sometimes the opponents deserve a red card but, instead, they carry on playing with 11 men. So you also have to be more lucky in the future.” The Italian pointed to Sánchez tugging at the defender’s back as David Luiz progressed down the right touchline as key to the latest dismissal. “You know very well that I don’t like to comment on refereeing decisions, it is in the past, but now the only thing I can tell you is it is very important to see what happened before the David Luiz tackle,” said Conte, who will start Eden Hazard against Forest. “For sure [what Sánchez did] was a foul. For sure. And when a player is fouled in a continual way … But, I repeat, the referee took this decision. If he’d stopped the play before, it wouldn’t matter.” Wenger, who lost Danny Welbeck to a groin injury, agreed with Oliver’s decision. “It was excessive force, yes,” he said, pointing out Kolasinac had escaped injury because he was kicking the loose ball and was not set in his stance. “Even Luiz would accept there was a big distance [between him and the ball] and he went in too strong. After that, it’s the decision of the referee. It looked to me like excessive force.” The Arsenal manager was encouraged by his team’s performance, particularly with memories still so raw of the thrashing endured at Liverpool last month, and praised his players’ response to that last away fixture in the Premier League. “People forget we beat Chelsea in the FA Cup final, so we’ve shown that quality many times, but the challenge was higher coming here, to their ground, where they’re traditionally very strong,” he said. “When you deliver the kind of performance we had at Liverpool, you have to accept the criticism. You can only respond on the pitch, and we did that today. “This game posed a question: what would happen? What changed is that, when you’re a footballer, only one thing matters: the next game, and how you respond to a setback. That’s what we saw today. With the right attitude and determination, it was vital for us to come out with a solid performance. We did that.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2017/sep/17/tactics-saved--liberal-democrats-tim-farron-party-conference","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-17T21:00:51Z","webTitle":"My tactics 'saved the Lib Dems', Farron tells party conference","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/sep/17/tactics-saved--liberal-democrats-tim-farron-party-conference","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/sep/17/tactics-saved--liberal-democrats-tim-farron-party-conference","fields":{"headline":"My tactics 'saved the Lib Dems', Farron tells party conference","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Former Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron will tell his party conference that his tactics “saved the Liberal Democrats,” saying the party’s increasing membership was a sign it was on the road to recovery. Farron’s defence of his record came after a fraught session on the conference floor on Sunday, where party members attempted to overturn policy on a second Brexit referendum, in favour of a policy which would see Article 50 reversed without a public vote. After a vote, party members voted in favour of retaining Farron’s policy of giving UK voters a referendum on the final Brexit deal, rather than changing policy to oppose leaving the EU under any circumstance. Farron quit as Lib Dem leader after the June election, where the party won an additional four seats but failed to make a significant national impact. Farron, who was succeeded by Vince Cable, will defend his record in a speech on Monday at the conference in Bournemouth, citing his strategy to build the party from the ground upwards. “The day I took over as leader, one journalist predicted confidently that ‘the party that began with Gladstone will now end with Farron’,” he will say. “I saw those assumptions that we were dead and buried and I resolved that we were going to survive, grow and win again. The Liberal movement of Gladstone, Lloyd George, Shirley Williams, Jo Grimond and Charles Kennedy – the movement I joined as a 16-year-old, was not going to die on my watch.” Farron will say his leadership had seen the first local election gains in eight years as well as a record number of new members. “We saved the Liberal Democrats and I am proud of every single one of you.” Cable repeated his prediction on Sunday that he believed it was possible he could become prime minister. “I think it’s perfectly plausible, actually,” he told the BBC’s Andrew Marr show. “As leader of the third UK party, my job is to be the alternative prime minister. I think British politics is in a remarkable state of flux.” Asked if the Lib Dems could get a Commons majority, Cable said: “It’s possible that we could break through. If British party politics starts to break up, if the traditional structures start to break up, and that could well happen, we are extremely well positioned with moderate, sensible policies. I am very confident talking about being an alternative prime minister.” On Sunday, MP Jo Swinson gave her first conference speech as deputy leader, one of several MPs including Cable who won their seats back in June. Swinson said she was concerned over the direction western politics was heading in, calling it “the politics of the bully.” Swinson said US president Donald Trump should not be offered a state visit, and said he was a product of “anti-liberal forces”. She said: “Trump is a bully, a misogynist and a racist. “When calm heads and brave leaders are needed more than ever, global politics seems broken. A few years ago it would have seemed inconceivable that in such a crisis, China would be a voice of reason, and Russia more measured than America. The politics of the bully is back.” Swinson said the party could not afford to wait for the mood to change. “As far as I can see, there is nothing inevitable about the triumph of liberal values. We need to understand what is going on, so we can work out what to do.” She said the party “needs to be much more radical, both in what we propose and in how we craft it”. Senior figures in the party have admitted the conference, Cable’s first as leader, will be relatively light on new policy, coming so soon after a general election. However, both Cable and Swinson are said to be keen to ensure the focus is not entirely on Brexit, with both keen to discuss new economic policies and social justice. “An exit from Brexit is necessary, but not sufficient,” Swinson told the conference. Former Lib Dem cabinet minister Ed Davey said he backed a new policy which would see company executives prosecuted if they rip off consumers by breaking competition laws. Speaking to reporters in Bournemouth, the former energy secretary, who won his south London seat of Kingston and Surbiton back in June, said he attempted to force through the policy in coalition but had been blocked by former prime minister David Cameron. “I suggested when we are hunting down cartels, when businesses are cheating the public, we should not go through the system we have where the competition authorities investigate and charge,” he said. “That’s an administrative process – we should actually put people in court and have a prosecutor model as they do in the United States. I think if big businesses are cheating consumers, we should put them in the dock and properly question them in a much tougher, robust way.” Davey said he backed action against both firms and individuals, but declined to name the sectors he had in mind when asked whether he was thinking specifically about energy companies. “Ripping customers off of tens of millions is outrageous. If they are in breach of competition law they should feel the uncomfortable position of being put in the dock,” he said. The party’s former leadership contender Norman Lamb announced he intends to stand down as Lib Dem health spokesman to concentrate on his new role as chairman of the Commons science and technology committee. Lamb, whose constituency in North Norfolk had a majority vote to leave the EU, is known to be uncomfortable with the party’s stance on Brexit. Lamb told the Press Association last week the party needed to “start thinking again” about how it approached the issue. “A lot of people felt that we were treating them as if they were idiots for having voted for Brexit,” he said. “And yet, as liberals, we ought to understand people’s anxieties about remote power.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2017/sep/19/abc-cuts-jeopardising-safety-of-remote-communities-study","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-19T05:47:38Z","webTitle":"ABC cuts jeopardising safety of remote communities – study","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/sep/19/abc-cuts-jeopardising-safety-of-remote-communities-study","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2017/sep/19/abc-cuts-jeopardising-safety-of-remote-communities-study","fields":{"headline":"ABC cuts jeopardising safety of remote communities – study","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Cuts to the ABC in regional and rural Australia and the corporation’s increasing reliance on digital technologies is jeopardising the safety of remote communities and their access to emergency warnings, Deakin University research has found. The ABC’s increasingly “digital-first” approach to emergency information and the reduction in ABC reporters’ local knowledge is causing great distress among rural populations who rely on broadcast signals because they don’t have the bandwidth or coverage for digital, researchers say. A reduction of local news and information, centralised newsrooms in metropolitan areas, the closure of several ABC stations and the scaling back of broadcast programming has been disastrous for people outside the cities, according to a new study, Communication life line? ABC emergency broadcasting in rural/regional Australia. But the ABC has played down the study’s significance, saying it is based on parliamentary submissions and is not an “accurate or up-to-date” summary of the corporation’s role in rural and regional Australia; and that the ABC is not funded as an emergency service. Based on public submissions to a parliamentary inquiry, the researchers Julie Freeman, Kristy Hess and Lisa Waller found “burgeoning discontent about the corporation’s ability to fulfil its role as a designated emergency broadcaster and provide communication life lines to rural and regional communities”. There were 67 submissions to the legislation committee in response to a private member’s bill, the ABC rural and regional advocacy bill 2015, which sought to improve rural and regional media coverage. Under the management of Mark Scott and Michelle Guthrie the ABC has been transferring resources from traditional broadcast radio and television to digital platforms and content, including the dissemination of emergency alerts. But not everyone can access the infrastructure needed for digital content. While the ABC’s emergency services website carries the latest disaster advice, if it cannot be accessed or the information is delayed it is useless to some communities. “In some instances, these services are non-existent, putting people’s basic requirements for survival at risk,” the researchers warn. In 2015, after a $250m cut to the ABC’s budget by the Coalition, the ABC closed its offices in Port Augusta in South Australia, Nowra in New South Wales, Gladstone in Queensland, Morwell in Victoria and Wagin in Western Australia, reducing the local information available to communities. In February this year the ABC’s shortwave signal was turned off in the Northern Territory, Papua New Guinea and some parts of the Pacific region, ending the broadcast of ABC local radio over the frequency that can be picked up in remote areas, including where AM and FM aren’t available. Freeman, the lead researcher, said for people trying to access digital emergency warnings the technology still was not good enough. “The ABC is using online content and platforms in place of older services,” Freeman said. “But by taking away services that were already there like shortwave they are reducing what’s available to rural communities. “Because the emergency broadcasts are coming out of Sydney and Melbourne the content is not produced by local reporters any more so a couple of the local councils said there’s been a mispronunciation of local place names and it has taken too long to get information out. “With the closure of regional broadcasting they’re waiting for decision makers in Melbourne to say, ‘OK let’s switch to emergency broadcasting.’ Elements of the bill, introduced by the Nationals senator Bridget McKenzie, are set to be debated later in the year but were not included in the media package that passed the Senate last week. “The reforms include aspects from my private senator’s bill that include the requirement that two ABC board members have an extensive background in rural and regional areas, an ABC rural and regional advisory board be established and be consulted if any changes are made to ABC rural and regional services and service provision to regional and rural Australians be included in the ABC charter,” McKenzie said. An ABC spokesman said earlier this year an additional $15m had been invested to expand coverage of regional news and information. “This investment will create up to 80 new content roles in regional Australia, the first 32 of which have already been filled, to provide increased coverage of news issues in rural and regional Australia including during emergency situations,” he said. “Through the Vast satellite service the ABC reaches 100% of Australian households, a far greater reach than the shortwave service that was outdated, expensive to maintain and had limited users. “The ABC is proud to serve all communities in times of need, including during natural disasters and emergencies. The ABC aims to provide relevant news and information to communities and, in times of emergencies, this will include news and information about the situation at hand. “The ABC is not funded explicitly for its work in the emergency arena and it is not an ‘emergency service’ in the same way that the SES or the fire brigade are, but it works closely with relevant emergency agencies to ensure accurate and up-to-date information is provided to those in need.” The researchers have called for the ABC’s role as a designated emergency broadcaster to be re-evaluated and the charter amended to ensure emergency broadcasting is available in local contexts."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/27/why-is-george-soros-being-dragged-into-the-same-sex-marriage-debate","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-27T03:02:27Z","webTitle":"Why is George Soros being dragged into Australia's same-sex marriage debate? | Jason Wilson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/27/why-is-george-soros-being-dragged-into-the-same-sex-marriage-debate","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/27/why-is-george-soros-being-dragged-into-the-same-sex-marriage-debate","fields":{"headline":"Why is George Soros being dragged into the same-sex marriage debate?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Various groups opposing same-sex marriage have been reduced to importing rightwing conspiracy theories to explain why public opinion does not seem to be trending in their direction. And they have been using some ideas with antisemitic overtones in order to whip up confusion and fear – the only things they really have on their side. The Australian Conservatives are just the latest group to invoke the figure of George Soros as the shadowy string-puller behind the fight for marriage equality. Sifting through the lurid Islamophobic and homophobic images on the group’s car crash of a Facebook page, you can find a meme urging the group’s supporters to “Stop the Globalist Agenda: Vote No”. Alexander Reid Ross, Portland State University lecturer and author of the study of fascism, Against the Fascist Creep, says that the meme “is definitely antisemitic”. And it is of a piece with a long trend on the racist and radical right to scapegoat Soros, just as other rich Jews were in the past. “Soros represents to the antisemite today what Rothschild would have represented to a fascist in the 1930s: ‘the international Jew’ who is weakening ‘our’ ethnic stock by diluting our cultural values with cosmopolitan ideas that invite a foreign invasion of immigrants and terrorists.” He says that it’s not so surprising that opponents of marriage equality would introduce Soros into a conversation that is really about civil rights. “The far right views the patriarchal family as the centerpiece of society and the economy. When they see it as threatened, they point to anything they can nominate as a foreign influence on that process. “That’s how we go from marriage equality to a conversation about Jews undermining society.” Ross also points out how a legitimate concern about the influence of money on politics is focused on one, foreign, Jewish actor as a way of funnelling people to the far right. In a world of billionaires exerting political influence, the right just happens to spotlight the most prominent Jew. Identifying Soros with “globalism” is a well-worn tactic on the far right. The conspiracist broadcaster and internet personality, Alex Jones, has built a career on attributing all manner of ills – from gay frogs to extra-strong marijuana – to the machinations of Soros and a shadowy cabal of globalists. Recently, Jones and others on the far right scrambled to blame Soros for the murder in Charlottesville, even though a member of an antisemitic white nationalist group has been arrested and charged for it. Along with Jones, rightwing media figures like Glenn Beck have also promulgated Soros conspiracy theories. In 2010, Beck aired an hour-long special entitled The Puppet Master, which was condemned by Jewish groups and the Anti-Defamation League. On the so-called “alt right”, Soros is frequently depicted as a manipulator whose goal is to undermine and corrode western civilisation. He is accused of paying “antifa” activists, and even of having been a Nazi collaborator. The latter suggestion has been serially debunked. And the alt right’s internet culture has eroded some of the taboos around public antisemitism that had broad acceptance in western polities from the end of the second world war. “You wouldn’t have seen the Australian Conservatives ad if it weren’t for the antisemitic memes normalising attitudes that are even more extreme than the ones it expresses,” Ross says. “The Overton Window has shifted”. Lyle Shelton of the Australian Christian Lobby has brought Soros up repeatedly in relation to campaign funding. He told the ABC in August that “We don’t have George Soros’s overseas money like we saw in Ireland with the pro-same-sex marriage campaign” (they didn’t quote any evidence he might have presented about Soros’s decisive influence in Ireland). Also in August, the AFR quoted Shelton as saying: “We don’t have Alan Joyce, we don’t have George Soros, we don’t have the corporates co-opted into this”. Around the same time, Shelton appeared on Steve Price’s talkback show with the same complaint, making the point that Soros was Jewish: “We don’t have Qantas and Alan Joyce and corporate Australia behind us. And we don’t have George Soros, the Hungarian-Jewish multi-billionaire philanthropist who funds leftwing causes all over the world.” Soros’s Open Society foundation is one of many organisations who have, in the past, funded some of the groups leading the fight for marriage equality but the fact that Soros is singled out among so many other supporters of progressive causes should make us all question why. The debate over same sex marriage has been anything but “respectful”, and homophobia is not the only prejudice it has unleashed.

But heritage isn't all equal for Trump","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"History and heritage are powerful words in American politics. In the United States, the Founding Fathers are second only to the apostles; the Constitution comes just after the Bible on the bookshelf and the Declaration of Independence is nearly as important an origin story as Genesis. Just days after bloody white supremacist rallies in Charlottesville last month, Donald Trump argued that a growing chorus of voices calling for the removal of Confederate statues would inevitably lead to the removal of monuments honoring the Founding Fathers – tantamount to heresy. But not all heritage and history is holy in these United States. While Trump is quick to defend his Confederate forefathers, he has been equally swift to desecrate places held sacred by Native Americans. Just weeks into his presidency, Trump hamfisted the Dakota Access Pipeline through the graves and homelands of the Standing Rock Sioux in North Dakota. Now, thanks to a leaked memo from interior secretary Ryan Zinke, we know the president plans to shrink protected areas and lift restrictions on extractive developments at 10 national monuments across the country – including the sacred Bears Ears national monument in southern Utah. Bears Ears is one of the most powerful and historic cultural and spiritual centers of the first peoples of the south-west. The monument, established in the twilight of the Obama administration, stands just next door to Canyonlands national park, north of the San Juan river and east of the Colorado. The rock formation after which the monument is named comprises twin buttes standing high above the piñon-juniper treetops, carved canyons, and majestic mesas – like the head of a bear emerging from the south-west landscape. The area is revered by a full five Native nations in the south-west: the Navajo, Hopi, Uintah &amp; Ouray Ute, Ute Mountain Ute and Zuni. This land was the birthplace of Chief Manuelito of the Bít’aa’níí or “Folded Arms People Clan”. Manuelito led the Navajo, the second-largest tribal nation in the United States, in a valiant struggle against removal to internment camps in desolate Bosque Redondo, present-day New Mexico. The Navajo were removed from their homes by gunpoint in 1864 – a dark chapter in Navajo and American history now known simply as the “Long Walk”. Manuelito, the warrior and leader, signed an 1868 treaty that ended this forced exodus, allowing the Navajo to return to a reservation established on homelands spanning parts of Arizona and New Mexico. To this day, the Navajo Nation is the largest Indian reservation in the United States –larger by landmass than many states. Historical analogies are always imperfect, but for all intents and purposes, Manuelito was the Navajo equivalent of a Founding Father. He is, rightly, a legendary figure in the pantheon of the Navajo and south-west. Moreover, Manuelito’s story is but one of many that emanate from Bears Ears. There are a full five nations and dozens more clans and families with roots in the area. Utah Diné Bikéyah, a coalition created to protect Bears Ears, estimates that there are more than 100,000 cultural and archaeological sites protected within the current boundaries of the monument. The Trump administration has not bothered to learn any of that history. Zinke only spared one hour to meet with tribal officials when he visited Salt Lake City in May. “What we are asking for is just a small acreage compared to what was taken away from us.” Utah Diné Bikéyah board chairman Willie Grayeyes said in a press release. “We ask for this simple honor to be given by the President and Secretary: do not alter or change our Proclamation.” But Indigenous calls to honor this sacred place have been ignored. Evidently, history and heritage are only important when invoked to defend alabaster monuments to slaveholders."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/sep/19/peter-dutton-admits-he-will-need-to-rethink-english-test-in-citizenship-overhaul","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-19T02:11:02Z","webTitle":"Peter Dutton concedes he will need to rethink English test in citizenship overhaul","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/sep/19/peter-dutton-admits-he-will-need-to-rethink-english-test-in-citizenship-overhaul","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/sep/19/peter-dutton-admits-he-will-need-to-rethink-english-test-in-citizenship-overhaul","fields":{"headline":"Peter Dutton concedes he will need to rethink English test in citizenship overhaul","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The immigration minister, Peter Dutton, has admitted he will need to overhaul the English-language test in the government’s citizenship package to have any hope of getting the legislation through the parliament. But the critical parliamentary powerbroker on the controversial citizenship overhaul, the Nick Xenophon Team, is signalling the rework will need to be more broad-ranging than just the language test. “There are so many components of this whole package that are a problem,” the NXT senator Stirling Griff told Guardian Australia on Tuesday. “Our position hasn’t changed at all. “Peter Dutton needs to go back to the drawing board.” Last week, the Senate gave Dutton four sitting days to put his controversial citizenship bill up for debate, otherwise it would be struck from the notice paper. The procedural pincer movement in the parliament came less than a week after the Nick Xenophon Team derailed Dutton’s attempt to enact the citizenship package, saying it could not support it in its current form. The government does not currently have the numbers to get its citizenship overhaul – which has been badged politically as a national security measure – through the parliament. It has been unclear how the government would respond to the current parliamentary deadlock – whether it would pull the whole package, or negotiate – but Dutton on Tuesday signalled for the first time he was prepared to negotiate. Asked whether he was prepared to overhaul the English-language test, which currently requires a university standard of language fluency, Dutton told Sky News: “Of course we are flexible.” The minister said he was talking with Nick Xenophon in an effort to reach a compromise. Dutton described the dialogue with the NXT as “constructive”. The government needs the NXT bloc because both Labor and the Greens are opposed to the package. Dutton said the government’s objective was to ensure would-be citizens had a functional level of English, and improved their language proficiency over time. The citizenship changes in their current form would increase the waiting times for permanent residents before they could apply for citizenship (from one year to four years) and force new applicants to complete a tougher English-language test (and achieve a pass mark of 75%) equivalent to level 6 of the international English language testing system (IELTS). The package also gives Dutton significant power to overrule decisions on citizenship applications by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT). As well as raising broad-ranging concerns about the practical implications of the package, the NXT has expressed particular objection to the enhanced ministerial powers over tribunal decisions. Griff said on Tuesday the government needed to go back to the drawing board and consult more widely about the implications of the changes."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/sep/19/my-fear-is-they-just-wont-bother-the-cold-callers-turning-out-the-marriage-equality-vote","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-19T18:12:38Z","webTitle":"'My fear is they just won't bother': the cold callers turning out the marriage equality vote","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/sep/19/my-fear-is-they-just-wont-bother-the-cold-callers-turning-out-the-marriage-equality-vote","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/sep/19/my-fear-is-they-just-wont-bother-the-cold-callers-turning-out-the-marriage-equality-vote","fields":{"headline":"'My fear is they just won't bother': the cold callers turning out the marriage equality vote","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"On Saturday afternoon, in a park in Sydney’s inner west, 30 young people gathered in the sun to debrief about the past hour they had spent cold calling for the yes campaign for marriage equality. “It was heaps harder than I thought it would be,” one woman said, to murmurs of deflated agreement. “But I had some good calls!” said another. Since 23 August, the yes campaign coalition – which is led by the Equality Campaign and includes GetUp and Australian Marriage Equality – have been hosting calling parties, using an automated phone tool connecting volunteers to presumed yes voters around the country. From these official events, grassroots phone banks have sprung up organised by unions, churches, businesses, clubs and groups of friends, using the same tool. The campaign estimates 305 registered calling events have taken place so far, with more than 200 others planned. The calls are dialling a purchased database of commercially available phone numbers held by people who, based on demographic indicators including gender and age, are considered likely to vote yes. (According to the campaign’s data, 80% of young women under 25 support marriage equality, for instance, and while young men also support it, they are less likely to be sure they will vote.) The goal is to activate yes voters to not only return their ballot but to take action themselves: to talk to friends and family, post on social media, or even volunteer themselves. For those making the calls, the process has been eye-opening, offering first-hand access to a divisiveness that many – often in a bubble of their own – might not otherwise have encountered. On Tuesday, the Guardian Essential poll found support for marriage equality has fallen 4% in a fortnight and now sits at 55% to 34% of those opposed (up 3%), with yes voters more likely to vote. A yes vote is by no means a done deal and the campaign believes these conversations will be crucial to its success. But, for the volunteers, they’re not all easy. One man, Alex, estimates he has made around 150 calls so far, 80% of which went straight to voicemail. Of the remainders, 50% were a hard “yes”, 20% a soft “yes” and 20% wanted to be left alone. The rest were “no”. “There are two kinds of negative calls I’ve run into: the hard, ‘Fuck off, I don’t want to talk to you about this’ ... and the definite no voters who are – in the main – reasonably pleasant in how they blow you off,” he said. “That said, maybe five to 10 of the calls I’ve made, the person on the other end has been vitriolic and aggressive. Calling me a ‘faggot’, telling me they’re disappointed in Australia, that I’m ruining Australia, that I’m a paedophile. These calls are why I’ve made sure to be in a group when I’m calling – they’re super hard to recover from and respond to.” Over a few weeks of calling, Alex said, he has noticed “more angry hang-ups” and “more frustration that the conversation is occurring and taking up so much time” – but each time he calls a hard “yes”, his spirits are bolstered. “They’re usually super vocal about their support. When you ask if they’ve spoken to friends, they say, ‘Hell yeah and all my friends are voting yes!’ It feels like a really significant community spirit has built around the yes campaign.” Sally Rugg, the marriage equality director at GetUp who has made around 100 calls herself, agrees: “I’ve been working on this campaign for nearly five years and I have never seen this level of public enthusiasm and unrelenting energy.” After the postal votes were mailed out on 12 September, the script for the calls, which is provided by the campaign, changed from encouraging people to vote yes as soon as they received their letter, to reminding them to mail back their votes immediately and urging them to talk to their loved ones. Ben took part in a phone bank on 9 September and another the following weekend. He said he found a lot more negativity between one weekend and the next. “From the first weekend to the second, I called a lot more people saying that it was none of my business how they were going to vote, which was actually kind of troubling,” he said. “It was troubling because it bolsters two claims made by the no campaign: that people feel pressured into silence and that there’s a big mass of no voters who aren’t vocal about it.” People who had taken part in phone banks over two or three weeks noticed that they seemed to be reaching more men and older people last weekend. It seemed that the calls were getting harder. “I thought there were more waverers, more emboldened ‘no’s, or upset people later [in the campaign],” a volunteer, James, said. “Could be [that we were calling] a different list, hard to say.” GetUp wouldn’t comment on whether the people they are targeting has changed. Another volunteer, Bryony, said she worried that the campaign could backfire with some voters. Following the script last weekend, she called a woman who said she supported marriage equality: “Then I got to the bit where I said, ‘When you get your ballot, tick yes, pop it in the envelope and mail it ASAP.’ “‘DID YOU JUST TELL ME TO TICK YES?!’ she said. ‘I can’t believe you’re calling people and telling them how to vote. You know that it’s human nature to do the opposite of what you’ve been told. If you call people and tell them to tick yes, they’re going to tick no. I can’t believe you would say that.’” James reported speaking to one woman who was “furious about the waste” of resources – “I think she thought taxpayer money was being spent on the call, which I didn’t get a chance to correct” – and other people who were “very cagey about even being asked ‘such a personal question’”. But, he said, most calls he made were “easy ‘yes’s, with not much to do but encourage their vote”. Other volunteers spoke of successful calls: explaining the postal plebiscite to people who supported marriage equality but had not heard about it; or speaking to supporters who were “stoked” to be called and pledged to vote quickly and talk to their friends. For Matt, the highlight was one man who sounded busy but was quick to say “yes”. As per the script, Matt followed up to explain why he thought the vote mattered: “He said, ‘No, I promise, all my friends and family will be voting yes. We were one of the first gay couples in Sydney to have a surrogate child. We all really want this to happen.’” One volunteer, Alyx, thinks the biggest threat to the yes campaign is apathy. “While there have been really beautiful moments, making calls has made me slightly less confident about the result of the postal vote. People have busy lives. They live in their own worlds. My fear is that if they, or someone they love, isn’t directly affected, they just won’t bother voting.” After each call closes, the caller is asked to answer a series of questions about how it went. Was it a “not interested”? A “meaningful conversation”? Did they agree to talk to their family and friends? On Monday, GetUp said the campaign had made 300,000 phone calls so far; 40,000 reached voters and 19,000 had resulted in “meaningful conversations”. Alex said that, of the 150 calls he has made, the most meaningful he had was with his father – a lifelong conservative voter. “I’d been calling strangers all day and hadn’t worked up the courage to properly chat to my parents about it,” he said. But his father, it turned out, was ticking the yes box. “Until that conversation, I’d been pretty worried about the bubble I was in convincing me that we’re headed for a yes ... when the actual sentiment of broader Australia [could be] a no,” Alex said. “My dad has voted LNP for 50 years and he supports it. So that makes me feel a lot better about the result.” Alex also spoke to one young gay man for 20 minutes, as he was walking home the day the “Vote No” skywriting appeared across Sydney. “He said he just ‘needed someone to distract him’. It wasn’t about convincing him but supporting him. And I think that’s important.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/sep/20/social-issues-such-as-same-sex-marriage-are-inextricable-from-sport","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-19T18:00:24Z","webTitle":"Social issues such as same-sex marriage are inextricable from sport | Kate O'Halloran","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/sep/20/social-issues-such-as-same-sex-marriage-are-inextricable-from-sport","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/sep/20/social-issues-such-as-same-sex-marriage-are-inextricable-from-sport","fields":{"headline":"Social issues such as same-sex marriage are inextricable from sport","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"In August this year, on a Friday night with the Western Bulldogs’ season on the line, I experienced one of the more painful incidents of my football-going life. It came in the third quarter, when the Giants kicked away through arch-nemesis Toby Greene, a man well-known to our brood, not just for the boot to the face of Luke Dahlhaus that night, but for his callous hit on Caleb Daniel earlier in the season. Enraged, a teenage boy behind me screamed at Greene as he gestured to the crowd, calling him a “faggot”. My heart sank. Seated next to my girlfriend, my hand in hers, I surveyed the crowd with intent. She nodded in the direction of the boy who had used the slur, and I shook my head at the woman I presumed was his mother. The woman, in turn, angrily denied he had yelled the abuse. I stood, my voice shaking, and addressed the crowd en masse: “I don’t care who said it – it’s not OK”. I left the ground that night feeling alienated from my Bulldogs family and from AFL football more broadly. Although no club or sporting body can completely control its crowds and the diverse communities that flock to it, I questioned whether the AFL would have the guts to publicly stand up to incidents such as this.The AFL has this week thrown its support behind the yes campaign in the marriage equality debate; on Wednesday it replaced its logo at AFL House with a prominent “YES” sign. In so doing, it belatedly follows a range of prominent sporting bodies including the Australian Rugby Union, Cricket Australia, Football Federation Australia and the NRL. The latter’s stance on marriage equality was reportedly inspired by a plea from Ian Roberts, still the only openly gay NRL player (past or present), who wrote to Todd Greenberg asking him not to “miss this moment in history”. Greenberg responded by arguing that “one of the key pillars of rugby league is inclusiveness – and the game has a duty to back up its policy with action”. The ARU was similarly staunch in its support, two years after former Wallabies captains David Pocock and Stephen Moore took a stance against the use of a homophobic slur in a match between the Brumbies and the Waratahs. But despite the current captain, Michael Hooper, arguing that the Wallabies were “all very supportive of the yes campaign”, Israel Folau made waves earlier this week with a tweet to the contrary. The ensuing criticism of Folau, a devout Christian, has since been used as evidence by conservative pundits of “bullying” and “intimidation” by the yes campaign (despite clear evidence that it is LGBTI Australians whose mental health has suffered as a result of the divisive vote). Prominent News Corp columnist Rita Panahi went on to argue that the response to Folau proved the “last thing supporters want is sociopolitical issues intruding on their love of the game”. What such arguments fail to realise is that sociopolitical issues are inextricable from sport. Those who belong to marginalised communities and play or consume sport constantly juggle their love of these games with the ever-present threat of homophobia, sexism and racism – whether it’s attending a match where “faggot” is used to taunt an opponent, or watching Brian Taylor call Harry Taylor a “poofter” for giving a “royal wave” to the crowd when celebrating his 150th game. The response of associated governing bodies serves as a barometer for how acceptable this behaviour is to the broader community. At its simplest, to support marriage equality is to assert that the rights of LGBTI people ought to be equal to that of others. The messaging inherent in such a stance is that they deserve respect in the same way that other members of these sporting communities do. That’s why it was so meaningful for me that my own club pledged its support for marriage equality (alongside Collingwood, North Melbourne and St Kilda) and why I hope that this support can trickle down to fans such as the boy at that game earlier this year. It is not just the culture of Australian sport at stake here, but the lives of those who love it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2017/sep/18/jurgen-klopp-alex-oxlade-chamberlain-relieved-liverpool","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-18T21:30:16Z","webTitle":"Jürgen Klopp says Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain ‘relieved’ to join Liverpool","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/sep/18/jurgen-klopp-alex-oxlade-chamberlain-relieved-liverpool","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/sep/18/jurgen-klopp-alex-oxlade-chamberlain-relieved-liverpool","fields":{"headline":"Jürgen Klopp says Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain ‘relieved’ to join Liverpool","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Jürgen Klopp has claimed Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain’s move from Arsenal came as “a kind of relief” to the England international. The 24-year-old will make his first Liverpool start in the Carabao Cup tie at Leicester City on Tuesday, having made three substitute appearances since signing for an initial £35m on transfer deadline day. Oxlade-Chamberlain spent six years at Arsenal where Arsène Wenger cited a lack of self-belief as one of the reasons the midfielder struggled to establish himself at the Emirates Stadium. Klopp believes there are no confidence issues with his new signing and that a fresh start with Liverpool will enable Oxlade-Chamberlain to make the next step in his development. The Liverpool manager said: “It would be strange for me to say it after two and half weeks when Arsène Wenger said this after working with him for six years. But a new start is very often a kind of relief, that’s how it is. You are in a situation with your old club – and I don’t say this about Alex specifically – and you accept it and it is difficult to make the next step. “I thought it made complete sense for Alex to change club and to come here. So far I can’t see that [he lacks self-belief]. He has settled in perfectly. He knows the situation. He played all the games for Arsenal from the beginning and now he comes here and is on the bench so it looks ‘Oh, not the best decision’ but it is long-term thing. We want to use him and to prepare him also. It is all good from this side at the moment.” Oxlade-Chamberlain said the opportunity to develop under Klopp was a key factor in his decision to leave a more lucrative contract at Arsenal unsigned and join Liverpool. And his new manager admits the player can still make “big steps” in his game. Klopp said: “I played against Arsenal when Alex was in centre-mid, when he was on the wing and when he was wing‑back. It is the highest quality if you can play in different positions in the Premier League. That says a lot about you. The judgment from outside may be that you don’t develop but playing different positions is development. Probably when Alex was 18 or 19 people thought he would be ‘The Man’ – as people think a lot of times pretty early – and immediately you put a rucksack on their back. That makes development not easy. He’s at a perfect age and is still able to make big steps. “I thought he played the last game like a Liverpool player – highest intensity, not fixed on a position, flexible, in the box.

The British prime minister will need more than a Baedeker to find a way of convincing Europeans that Britain is leaving the EU but not Europe, and that it is realistic about the process. Just days ahead of her speech, British and Italian officials, diplomats, academics and experts attended the annual Pontignano conference, not far from Florence. The official topic was “Liberalism in crisis?”. Of course, Brexit loomed large. If the conversations I heard there are anything to go by, Britain has more, not less, worrying to do about how its strategies are perceived on the continent. In Italy there is bafflement over what the UK wants to achieve, and how it plans to do it. Even Theresa May’s choice of Florence for her speech had some people scratching their heads – not least Italian officials working closely on EU matters. Official British explanations that Florence is a symbol of the “renaissance”, the “heart of Europe”, are met with sympathy, but hardly help to set a clear course for the serious matter of Brexit. Some took note, with a smile, that references to “century-old” links between Britain and “the city state” of Florence meant harking back to an era before Italy became a nation state. Some conference participants speculated that May had set her sights on Florence for lack of another option. She couldn’t possibly have gone to Germany, as it’s in the midst of an election campaign; and travelling to France would be awkward on the eve of opposition demonstrations there. Nor could she easily travel to Brussels to deliver a speech on Brexit and Europe – especially not in front of the European parliament. “That would mean throwing herself into the lions’ den,” one Italian told me. To be sure, the Florence speech is awaited with curiosity (although its announcement hardly made headlines in Italy). Italians are happy for the attention, and they don’t need an invocation of A Room With a View to know how much the British love Italy’s culture, landscape, food and style. More importantly, Italy wants to matter on the European scene, and it can at times be frustrated by the attitude of larger players. With Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel wanting to turbo-charge the Franco-German “engine” within the EU, Italy’s worry is that it risks looking even more like a lesser cousin. It’s clear Britain is “desperate” (as one British participant told me) to deepen bilateral discussions with separate EU member states these days. That’s to try to blunt the shock of Brexit, and also discreetly look for wedge issues in the negotiations. But so far there’s been no sign of cracks in European unity. Nor is May’s visit intended as a bilateral one – the Italian prime minister, Paolo Gentiloni, isn’t due to attend. Italy may not be as much of a heavyweight in Europe as it would like, but its politics matter immensely: elections are expected early next year, and populism is on the rise, with the anti-establishment and anti-immigrant Five Star movement leading in the polls. Not only that, but Silvio Berlusconi is rearing his head again, promising to lead Forza Italia at the next election. Migration is the single most important item being debated, and the centre-left government has gone to great lengths to try to curtail migrant arrivals from across the Mediterranean – even making highly controversial deals with Libyan militias. Euroscepticism has grown strongly. In a traditionally fervently pro-EU country (partly because Europe was seen as a protection against the corruption of its own political class), the public mood has turned sour on the European project, mostly as a result of the eurozone crisis. None of this means an exit is being contemplated, however. If anything, a referendum held last year on constitutional reform plans showed how costly the experiment could be (the then prime minister, Matteo Renzi, had to resign). Nor do most observers expect Five Star to reach a point where it could form a government: the consensus among the mainstream parties is to keep it safely out. Still Italy offers a worrying contrast to the more upbeat mood elsewhere in Europe. The stakes for Italy in the Brexit negotiations are relatively high. Unemployment has pushed many of its young people to seek jobs in the UK in recent years. Italy is adamant that the EU must not end up with a large financial gap as a result of Britain’s departure. There are also tentative bilateral talks with the UK on security and defence cooperation. But no one should be under the illusion that Italy intends to break ranks in the Brexit talks; its interests lie in EU solidarity. The expectation among Italian officials is that May’s speech will be “positive” and steer clear of radical Brexit ideology. But Boris Johnson’s antics haven’t gone unnoticed – nor been much of a surprise. After all, he made his “prosecco” comments while attending the Pontignano conference last year. Now, he’s on manoeuvres against May. Will Florence be her answer? Tuscany’s rolling hills and mesmerising cultural heritage make for a strange backdrop against which to settle British political scores, but that is how Brexit is mostly viewed in Italy: an internal British dispute gone awry, which, tediously, everyone now has to deal with. If there’s one unanimous hope I heard from Italian participants in Pontignano, it’s that somehow Brexit might yet be stopped. The British speakers said that was unlikely. One prominent Italian commentator captured the mood of regret this way: “To be alone in 1940 among the enemy was heroic; to be alone in 2017 among friends is absurd.” May will be visiting a country that sees Britain as a friend, but that, like others in Europe, increasingly struggles to understand that friend."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/18/the-guardian-view-on-saudi-arabia-the-seventh-son-rises","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-18T18:30:30Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on Saudi Arabia: the seventh son rises | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/18/the-guardian-view-on-saudi-arabia-the-seventh-son-rises","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/18/the-guardian-view-on-saudi-arabia-the-seventh-son-rises","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on Saudi Arabia: the seventh son rises","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The ascension in June of Muhammed bin Salman as crown prince of Saudi Arabia was an instant Rorschach test for observers of the desert kingdom. Is he a reformer prepared to drag his kingdom, a repressive regime that writes very large welfare cheques, into the 21st century or a callow princeling whose rise to power could destabilise the region? The 31-year-old prince has undoubtedly amassed great power and dominates Saudi economic, diplomatic and domestic policy. The crown prince, known as MBS, is also the architect of the bloody quagmire of the Yemen war and a hardliner in the current Gulf row with neighbouring Qatar. His father, King Salman, 81, is not in good health, walks with a stick and suffers from brain fades in meetings. By anointing his seventh son as the youngest heir apparent in Saudi history, the ailing monarch has signalled a decisive break with the past. If the first few months are a reliable guide, then the omens for the future are not good. The palace coup that saw MBS take power was bloodless. In the summer’s Game of Thrones, his powerful uncles and rivals were either sidelined or placed under house arrest. The sense of how riven the Saudi royal house is could be gleaned from reports, sourced from within the court, claiming the other leading contender for the throne had a drug problem. Last week it emerged that Saudi authorities had launched a crackdown on dissent, targeting Islamic thinkers, public critics and political rivals. Two prominent clerics were taken away for failing to publicly declare their support for the crown prince’s stance toward Qatar. Neither cleric is reflexively conservative – one famously declared homosexuality a sin but added that it shouldn’t be punished in this world. Both are popular with the Saudi public, with millions of Twitter followers. Another journalist has been banned from writing opinion columns, while human rights activists have been given outlandish eight-year prison sentences for peaceful campaigning. Whatever MBS’s public face, this intolerance of dissent is almost paranoid. If there was time for Saudi society to debate how to proceed, it’s probably now. Saudi Arabia was the cradle of jihadism so its stability is a global concern. In domestic terms, Saudi Arabia is a mess. The kingdom is the world’s largest oil exporter, with reserves of 260bn barrels – but it is a one-trick economy. Oil prices have plummeted from the highs of 2014, forcing Riyadh to spend some $200bn from its foreign exchange reserves to cover its deficit. In response the crown prince instigated a Thatcherite programme of privatisation and subsidy cuts to balance the books. But these moves threatened the social contract between the royal family and its subjects, the majority of whom are under 35. On the world stage, Saudi Arabia has been forced on the back foot by events and its own incompetence. The war in Yemen, costly in civilian lives, and a blockade of Qatar are a result of two draining infatuations: curbing Iran’s influence in the Arab world; and snuffing out any whiff of political Islam. Neither has resulted in much success. Instead, both have been embarrassments for the crown prince. Riyadh is now courting Iraq’s leadership – especially those close to Iran. It has withdrawn from Syria, leaving that country’s future in the hands of Moscow, Ankara and Tehran. Now Riyadh faces a tough choice on Afghanistan between its ally Pakistan and Donald Trump, on whom the crown prince ill-advisedly models himself. The crown prince has the vision thing. But his impetuous lack of judgment risks turning it into a mirage."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"society/2017/sep/19/nhs-spends-80m-on-private-ambulances-a-year-data-shows","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-18T23:01:01Z","webTitle":"NHS spends £80m on private ambulances a year, data shows","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/sep/19/nhs-spends-80m-on-private-ambulances-a-year-data-shows","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/sep/19/nhs-spends-80m-on-private-ambulances-a-year-data-shows","fields":{"headline":"NHS spends £80m on private ambulances a year, data shows","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The NHS is spending almost £80m a year hiring private ambulances to answer 999 calls and take patients to hospital for appointments, new figures show. Widespread shortages of paramedics and rising demand forced England’s 10 NHS ambulance trusts to spend £78.4m in 2016-17 on help from non-NHS providers to supplement their own services. That was down on the £79.7m trusts spent in 2015-16, but 22% more than their £64.2m outlay in 2014-15, according to data obtained by the Press Association under freedom of information laws. South Central ambulance service spent the most on private services last year – £16.3m, up from its £13.6m outlay the year before and £12.3m in 2014-15. The East of England ambulance service spent the second-largest amount: £14m, more than double the £6.6m it paid to non-NHS providers the year before. The South East Coast ambulance service spent £11.1m. A spokesman for the Independent Ambulance Association (IAA) said the main reasons for a rise in private ambulance use in the last two years were “staff shortages in NHS ambulance trusts, combined with continued increases in demand”. The benefits of using independent firms include flexibility and good value for money as “it’s cheaper for the NHS than paying overtime”, he added. Jonathan Street, a spokesman for the College of Paramedics, said NHS ambulance staff were “under heavy pressure due to growing numbers of 999 calls”. He added: “These services are increasingly reliant on paramedics and other ambulance clinicians within the private sector to meet the demand, which involves considerable cost.” The disclosures sparked concerns that ambulances supplied by profit-driven firms may provide a lower standard of care than that provided by crews employed by the NHS. “The huge sums spent on private ambulance services expose the pressures on staff due to soaring demand. Experienced and highly trained employees are leaving because of the strain,” said Alan Lofthouse, Unison’s national ambulance officer and a former paramedic. “Paying agency workers to fill the gaps is putting patient safety and the wellbeing of crews at risk,” he claimed. Norman Lamb, the Liberal Democrats’ health spokesman, said the rising spend on private ambulances was a shocking stain on the government’s NHS record. “Ambulance services are simply not being provided with the resources or staff needed to cope with soaring demand. Growing reliance on private sector services is not only costly, inspections have also raised serious concerns over patient safety,” said Lamb. However, the IAA insisted that the standard of care was “no different” to that offered by the NHS, and that all providers are registered with the Care Quality Commission and subject to the same inspection standard as NHS ambulance trusts. Private ambulances are hired from private firms as well as charities such as St John Ambulance and the Red Cross. Dr Taj Hassan, president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, which represents A&amp;E staff, said: “It is concerning that trusts are having to use part of their budget for private ambulances, and serves to highlight the current levels of demand emergency departments are facing.” Hassan also voiced unease about the quality of training private firms provide to their staff, leaving them ill-prepared for treating patients. “The Care Quality Commission has previously highlighted that they may use less qualified staff or staff whose qualifications aren’t regulated or restricted,” he said. “They may be poorly equipped, have poor clinical governance, poor infection prevention, and a lack of or inappropriate equipment.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2017/sep/21/why-we-sleep-by-matthew-walker-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-21T06:30:26Z","webTitle":"Why We Sleep by Matthew Walker review – how more sleep can save your life","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/sep/21/why-we-sleep-by-matthew-walker-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/sep/21/why-we-sleep-by-matthew-walker-review","fields":{"headline":"Why We Sleep by Matthew Walker review – how more sleep can save your life","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Awake at 4.30am the other morning, having been roused from sleep by my four-year-old son climbing into bed with my wife and me (a more or less nightly occurrence), I found myself sitting up and reading about the effects of insufficient sleep. It has been making me stupider, fatter, unhappier, poorer, sicker, worse at sex, as well as more likely to get cancer, Alzheimer’s and to die in a car crash. At the same time, my lack of sleep has been slowly but inexorably shrinking a) my chances of living into my mid 60s, b) my testicles. Why We Sleep by the neuroscientist Matthew Walker – my ill-chosen small-hours reading material – is filled with startling information about the effects of suboptimal shut-eye levels. It’s not a book you should even be thinking about in bed, let alone reading. If it weren’t too unsettling to permit sleep in the first place, it would be the stuff of nightmares. The marginalia in my review copy, scrawled in the wavering hand of a man receiving dark intimations of his own terrible fate – “OMFG”; “This is extremely bad!” – might seem less appropriate to an affably written popular science book than to some kind of arcane Lovecraftian grimoire. Walker’s title is misleading – as he himself states in the early pages, it suggests that there might be only one reason why we sleep. In fact, he presents sleep as a panacea for a bewildering array of conditions that would otherwise cause the slow deterioration of body and mind. In one playful passage, he describes it as though he were marketing a new pharmaceutical: Scientists have discovered a revolutionary new treatment that makes you live longer. It enhances your memory, makes you more attractive. It keeps you slim and lowers food cravings. It protects you from cancer and dementia. It wards off colds and flu. It lowers your risk of heart attacks and stroke, not to mention diabetes. You’ll even feel happier, less depressed, and less anxious. Are you interested? Well, yes, I for one am keenly interested in this wonder drug; the problem, though, is getting your hands on the stuff. Being kneed in the spine by a four-year-old in the dead of night turns out to be the least of it; by the time I’d finished Walker’s book, the whole of modernity lay revealed to me as a vast, many tentacled conspiracy against sleep. One of the book’s real strengths is how clearly it elucidates the extent of the damage wrought by our collective ignorance of the importance and complexity of sleep’s role in our lives, and the difficulty encountered by many of us in getting any. In terms of our natural sleeping tendencies, people can be divided into two broad groups, or “chronotypes”: morning larks and night owls. Each group operates along different circadian lines, and there is pretty much nothing owls can do to become larks – which is tough luck, because work and school scheduling overwhelmingly favour early risers. Owls are often forced, he writes, “to burn the proverbial candle at both ends. Greater ill health caused by a lack of sleep therefore befalls owls, including higher rates of depression, anxiety, diabetes, cancer, heart attack and stroke.” “The importance of insomnia is so colossal that I am tempted to define man as the animal who cannot sleep,” wrote EM Cioran, the patron saint of night owls whose weary visage kept floating into my mind as I read Why We Sleep. Walker’s worldview may not be as bleak as that of the Romanian essayist, but he does paint an intolerably grim portrait of a society in which an increasingly large proportion of us are getting a decreasing amount of sleep. What he calls our “cultural sleep norms” are under assault on multiple fronts: Midnight is no longer ‘mid night’. For many of us, midnight is usually the time when we consider checking our email one last time – and we know what often happens in the protracted thereafter. Compounding the problem, we do not then sleep any longer into the morning hours to accommodate these later sleep-onset times. We cannot. Our circadian biology, and the insatiable early-morning demands of a post-industrial way of life, denies us the sleep we vitally need. Basically, if you’re regularly clocking in at under seven hours a night, you’re doing yourself a disservice as grave as that of regularly smoking or drinking to excess. And as someone who tends to chalk up six hours as a solid victory, and who feels – or at least felt before reading this book – that he can get by on five, I was especially disturbed by the revelation that sleep-deprived people often don’t recognise themselves as such. That low level exhaustion becomes their accepted norm, or baseline. Individuals fail to recognise how their perennial state of sleep deficiency has come to compromise their mental aptitude and physical vitality, including the slow accumulation of ill health. A link between the former and the latter is rarely made in their mind. The book bears a sobering and vital message, too, about the centrality of sleep to the proper development of young minds. Early school starting times – particularly in the US, where, barbarically, almost half of public high schools start before 7.20am – are disastrous for the mental health of teenagers. There is serious evidence, Walker suggests, for viewing lack of sleep as a factor in the onset of depression and schizophrenia. Despite the direness of his warning, Walker’s tone is mostly chipper and likable in the standard pop-sci style, and he is excellent at explaining complex neurological phenomena for a general readership. He does occasionally get bogged down in ill-advised wordplay (here he is on marine mammals and REM sleep, for example: “Seals in the ocean will sample but a soupçon of the stuff”). There is also a deeply weird passage that attempts, via “The Sound of Silence”, to explain sleep’s benefits to memory, but which really only demonstrates how badly a paragraph can fall victim to what I assume are the reprint restrictions on Simon and Garfunkel lyrics. “Perhaps you know the song and lyrics,” beseeches Walker. “Simon and Garfunkel describe meeting their old friend, darkness (sleep). They speak of relaying the day’s events to the sleeping brain at night in the form of a vision, softly creeping – a gentle information upload, if you will.” But I suppose it’s churlish to take issue with the prose of a person who is trying to save you from an existence of exhaustion and misery, terminating in early death – a bit like grumbling about insufficient legroom in a life raft. Because that’s what this book is. It’s probably a little too soon to tell you that Why We Sleep saved my life, but I can tell you that it’s been an eye-opener. • Mark O’Connell’s To Be a Machine is published by Granta.

A report from Avon and Somerset constabulary says the force has reached a “tipping point” because of financial pressures and an increased workload. The report says: “In the aftermath of Manchester, Westminster, London Bridge and … Barcelona, the public have a heightened expectation of policing response that would be very difficult for us to deliver in significant provincial cities such as Bristol and Bath. “Individuals from the south-west region, some of whom are socially isolated and vulnerable, have travelled or expressed a desire to support Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, while others represent a threat as potential ‘lone actors’.” Terrorism plots foiled in the region include that of the former public schoolboy Andrew Ibrahim, who planned to carry out an attack at a shopping centre in Bristol. “A reduction in current funding is likely to mean reduction in prevention activity delivered by our neighbourhood policing teams,” the report says. “At the same time, domestic extremism is still an ongoing and complex threat. Extremist rightwing behaviour is currently characterised by lone actors attempting to incite anti-Islamic hatred while extreme leftwing activists retain the capability and intent to conduct further attacks within the force area. Effective community engagement by neighbourhood officers is critical in gathering the intelligence that uncovers such plots. Since the government’s first comprehensive spending review in 2010, the report says, the Avon and Somerset force has made savings of £65m, with 655 fewer police officers. It will have to find a further £17m by 2021-22 to balance its budget. The report warns: “We now face a tipping point. We cannot sustain further funding cuts without extremely serious consequences.” Other areas flagged up in the report include management of offenders and the increased workload dealing with people with mental health problems. The report says that by May 2017, there were 1,926 registered sexual offenders in the area, a number that had been increasing by 10% a year since 2007. The force currently manages more than 11,000 offenders. Another almost 2,000 “high risk” individuals, including domestic abusers, violent offenders, sexual offenders, robbers and burglars, are not subject to formal management. More than 50,000 police hours were spent on missing people and mental health issues last year. The chief constable, Andy Marsh, said: “Our continuing ability to safeguard communities, protect the vulnerable, and manage major incidents of this kind is being severely tested. It’s simply not sustainable. There are serious choices to be made.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2017/sep/19/public-inquiry-debt-mps-households","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-19T12:50:07Z","webTitle":"Public inquiry needed into UK's £200bn debt crisis, say senior MPs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/sep/19/public-inquiry-debt-mps-households","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2017/sep/19/public-inquiry-debt-mps-households","fields":{"headline":"Public inquiry needed into UK's £200bn debt crisis, say senior MPs","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The chairs of two powerful parliamentary committees have urged the government to set up an independent public inquiry into the £200bn of debt amassed by households. The call by Rachel Reeves, the Labour chair of the business select committee, and Frank Field, the Labour head of the work and pensions select committee, comes as the Conservative-led Treasury select committee plans to hold meetings around the country to examine the impact of debt on individuals and households. “Debt is a huge emotional burden for people,” said Nicky Morgan, the Conservative MP who chairs the Treasury select committee. She added that “unstable personal finances” often emerged as problems raised by her constituents in Loughborough. The £200bn of debt amassed on credit cards, personal loans and car deals is now at the same level it reached before the 2008 financial crisis and there are fears that rises in interest rates could put more households under pressure. Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, warned on Monday that interest rates were likely to rise in response to rising inflation and skills shortages brought on by Brexit that will increase pressure on wages. Field said people in his Birkenhead constituency on the Wirral were being pushed into destitution by the actions of loan sharks and finance companies that heaped extra pain on low income households with sky-high interest charges. He said: “We need a commission to assess the current situation. There are so many moving parts that a proper investigation goes beyond the remit of any single committee.” According to the Money Advice Service, there are now 8.3 million people in the UK with problem debts while the government’s official economic forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, has predicted that unsecured consumer debt – which includes loans, credit cards, overdrafts and car financing – will soar as a proportion of national income over the next four years back above its previous peak in 2007. Reeves, Labour MP for Leeds West – who was speaking in a personal capacity – said she was shocked at the sharp rise in borrowing to finance new car purchases and soaring credit card debts. “It is the government’s responsibility to understand the extent of the issue and who is the worst affected,” she said. “When you have people right up the income scale being told by the banks not to worry that they can’t afford the price of a car, just borrow the money anyway,” Reeves said. Andrew Bailey, the chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority, on Monday called on the government to help craft a sustainable solution to enable vulnerable borrowers to obtain finance. Reeves and Field said they were concerned that there were large gaps in the remits of the regulators given responsibility for monitoring Britain’s debts. Neither the Bank of England, which monitors the banking sector, the FCA nor the OBR has an overarching responsibility to report to government about the UK’s debt position. Reeves said the financial services industry needed to be more transparent about the level of indebtedness and subprime lending. Field said regulators need to be more explicit about the extent of the damage to households and the economy from a shock that could be caused by an increase in unemployment or increased interest rates. The detail of the Treasury select committee inquiry is still being worked out but Morgan said her ambition was take evidence “not just sitting in London”. When she was standing to become chair of the committee after the election, Morgan had flagged the issue of household debt as one of the areas she felt needed closer examination. She wanted to look at “what it is about our households that accumulate debt”. The aim was to “add something intelligent to the policy debate”, said Morgan. A Treasury spokeswoman said the government was focused on supporting the growth of secure and better-paid jobs as the route out of debt. The increase in full-time jobs in the past two years and a higher minimum wage meant that fewer people were coping with low and erratic wages. She added that tighter rules on the financial services industry provided consumers with greater protection than before the 2008 crash. She said: “We have fundamentally reformed the consumer credit market so that the Financial Conduct Authority now [has] robust powers to help consumers, such as protecting 760,0000 people with the new cap on payday loans. A record number of people are in work and we are helping them keep more of what they earn by cutting taxes and raising the ‘national living wage’.” John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said: “Labour is deeply worried by the concerns raised by the Bank of England over the high levels of personal debt.” A senior Bank of England official, Alex Brazier, recently told banks, credit card companies and car loan providers that they risked fresh action against reckless lending and warned of a looming “spiral of complacency” about mounting consumer debt. He added: “Household debt – like most things that are good in moderation – can be dangerous in excess.” McDonnell said: “We believe this is an area where there is a need for government intervention, and we will be bring forward policy proposals on this matter. “The last seven years has seen the Tories fail to tackle the fall in wages, which has also witnessed a surge in unsecured lending; as many families have been forced into debt in order to just make ends meet.” Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader, also supported calls for a public inquiry, adding that it would prove futile if it ignores “an economically destructive extreme Brexit that will push the indebted over the edge”. Cable added: “The government must also immediately implement its manifesto commitment to introduce a ‘breathing space’ for people with problematic debt, conveniently forgotten since the election but now more urgent than ever.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"environment/2017/sep/18/green-finance-taskforce-business-investment-clean-energy-infrastructure","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-18T17:28:07Z","webTitle":"Ministers launch group to help boost green business investment","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/sep/18/green-finance-taskforce-business-investment-clean-energy-infrastructure","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/sep/18/green-finance-taskforce-business-investment-clean-energy-infrastructure","fields":{"headline":"Ministers launch group to help boost green business investment","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A new group led by investors and leading figures from the City of London has been brought together by the government to draw up measures to encourage “green finance” in the UK. The Green Finance Taskforce will have six months to come up with proposals on how to increase investment in the low-carbon economy and will work with banks and other financial institutions. Chaired by Sir Roger Gifford, former lord mayor of London, the taskforce will look at measures to make the UK’s planned investments in infrastructure, for instance on energy and transport, more environmentally sustainable. The government also wants to give investors assurances about how their money is being looked after, and promote ways for consumers to benefit, for instance through green mortgages, which make borrowing cheaper for those who have insulated their homes. Claire Perry, minister for climate change, said the UK already showed strong investment in low-carbon activities, and should build on its strengths. “The transition to a low-carbon economy is a multi-billion pound investment opportunity and a key part of this government’s industrial strategy,” she said. “Developing standards to promote responsible investment in sustainable projects and establishing the Green Finance Taskforce will help ensure businesses across the UK take full advantage of it.” Stephen Barclay, economic secretary to the Treasury, added: “Financial services are a British success story. It is a priority of mine that people are able to access financial products that support their values, whether that be sharia-compliant loans or green mortgages that have a positive environmental impact. This taskforce will keep the UK at the forefront of green finance and help deliver choice for consumers.” However, the government made it clear that its approach is likely to be based on voluntary standards, to be adopted by companies, banks and investment institutions if they wish. These could include standards for companies to disclose their exposure to risks from climate change, which some companies already attempt. As a result, although the taskforce may provide guidelines for investors wishing to ensure they put their money in greener stocks, it is unlikely to have much effect on the behaviour of core fossil fuel companies, or those companies that prefer to stay invested in the fossil fuel economy. Friends of the Earth, the green campaign group, urged the government to go further. “Coming only a few days after it was revealed that the cost of offshore wind has plummeted, this is another welcome boost to the green economy,” said Simon Bullock, senior climate campaigner. “But ministers must also do far more to reduce investment in climate-wrecking fossil fuels, such as fracking and deep sea oil exploration. If we want to stop climate change, 80% of the world’s coal, oil and gas reserves must be left in the ground.” Members of the Green Finance Taskforce include the chief executive of the London Stock Exchange, a senior adviser to the Bank of England, representatives from Barclays, HSBC and Aviva, and representatives from the public sector and academia. The UK government made the announcement on the taskforce to coincide with the opening of Climate Week in New York. There, some UK companies including Aviva, WPP and Marks &amp; Spencer joined with others from around the world to endorse the disclosure of climate risks to investors. Nigel Topping, chief executive of the We Mean Business coalition, said: “There is a great need among the investor community to have consistent climate-related financial risk disclosures from businesses in order to make more informed decisions on capital investment.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2017/sep/26/velkom-to-inklandt-sophie-herxheimer-review-poetry-book-of-the-month","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-26T06:30:35Z","webTitle":"Velkom to Inklandt by Sophie Herxheimer review – following in Grandma’s footsteps","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/sep/26/velkom-to-inklandt-sophie-herxheimer-review-poetry-book-of-the-month","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/sep/26/velkom-to-inklandt-sophie-herxheimer-review-poetry-book-of-the-month","fields":{"headline":"Velkom to Inklandt by Sophie Herxheimer review – following in Grandma’s footsteps","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"This book is uplifting, funny, heart-breaking – a one-off. I have been wondering how Sophie Herxheimer, whom I knew of as a talented painter, came to write these dramatic monologues in the voice of her German Jewish grandmother. For this enterprise, a mix of memory and imagination, is more than ventriloquy, it is a detailed evocation of character – like inspired eavesdropping – a pitch-perfect labour of love. Many poems will bring a lump to your throat, although, if you are taking heed of what Grent Muzzer Liesel believed, you will know to keep your emotions under wraps. There is a particularly moving poem, about the end of Liesel’s life, in which she is visited in hospital by her granddaughter (Herxheimer describes herself through her grandmother’s eyes). The granddaughter breaks an unspoken rule, telling her grandmother she loves her: “…but Luff’s a Sink we neffer/ menschen. Ve bose know zis Rule, chest/ es ve bose know ze rottett Stomek off Dizpair/ Zis is vot makes us… indeeztruktibel.” An “author’s note” explains the poems are written “in a Lenkvitch that my ear remembers as the way my paternal grandmother spoke”. She adds, simply, that her “first 17 years were my grandmother’s last”. Liesel lived in a quiet north London suburb and, visiting her, Herxheimer often wondered how Leisel and her husband had transported “such enormous heavy wooden furniture with them whilst fleeing for their lives”. The book is full of Herxheimer’s wonderful black-and-white papercuts of this remembered furniture – a shelf on which a coffee cup steams, a curvaceous sideboard, a table set with a lacy cloth (one poem is entitled My Demesk Tapell-Kloss). There is also a papercut of a ghostly pair of gloves – crossed, perhaps clapping. She suggests: “Reading the poems aloud is a good way in.” I’d say it was essential. At first, you might think the spelling a gimmick but the more you read, the more powerful the language becomes. Sometimes, there is a split-second delay before you understand. Try reading this title aloud – Dess Bett – then hear what it means. What makes it interesting is that, as readers, we become the foreigners, the decipherers, tasting words on our tongues, trying them out for sense which brings us empathetically closer to Liesel as she acquires English, assimilates in London while holding on to Leipzig. London, the opening poem, is charming yet unrepresentative because Liesel is far subtler than her thoughts about the reassuring nature of London buses. A closet intellectual, she borrows Chekhov from the library, rejoices in Schubert at a funeral, discusses Picasso and Paul Klee with a man who briefly, calamitously, becomes her lover. She works away on her sewing machine to save being “eaten alyfe by Pointlessnesse” (I like the capital P). She remembers people she has lost. Herxheimer never wades into sentimentality, which is one of the reasons the poems are so moving. Tektonnik has a correspondent’s tone but Liesel’s friend Minna (although this is not spelt out) is not about to receive any letter. It ends: “In my Hedt: vair you liff olt Frent,/ oont vair ve go ofa all of ziz:/ vair still ve chet oont larf into ze Nyte.” There is another extraordinary poem about the life and death of Liesel’s twin brothers and – my favourite – Vossch by Hendt, Lern by Hart! about a lambswool sweater surviving the woman who made it. Herxheimer knits a moral into this poem: ‘Make Sinks. Make Sinks up! Play!’ To which I’d add other imperatives: buy, read, cherish this book. London Not zo mainy Dais zinz ve arrivink.

But then I had a quantum leap’","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"In interviews, Jennifer Egan used to spend a fair amount of time explaining what she wasn’t interested in doing with her writing. Verisimilitude was boring. The linear was “the weird scourge of writing prose”. Conventional narratives were absolutely not her bag. In the same conversations, she would sometimes refer to her time at the University of Pennsylvania, when she was “a literary theory nut”; such ideas, she insisted scarily, were with her still. All of which made it seem a safe bet that when she finally delivered a new book – it’s six years since the publication of her Pulitzer prize-winning fourth novel, A Visit from the Goon Squad, which came with a chapter in the form of a PowerPoint presentation – it would be every bit as formally daring as her last. But, no. Reach for your smelling salts, Goon Squad fans. For her next trick, Egan has written a 400-page historical novel called Manhattan Beach. Set in New York during the Depression and the second world war – specifically, much of the action takes place in the Brooklyn Navy Yard, then the biggest builder and repairer of allied ships – it comes not only with a forward-moving plot, but with a thoroughly old-fashioned heroine: the kind of girl, brave and determined, with whom readers are almost duty bound to fall in love. A Victorian novel by any other name, its sensibility is, in other words, so thoroughly conventional, I can’t help but wonder: when, exactly, did its author start thinking verisimilitude and the linear might be interesting after all? Egan laughs. “I’m thrilled you felt it was like a Victorian novel,” she says, speaking on Skype from her home in New York. “I’m obsessed with the Victorian novel. I can’t help it. I feel like the novel then was so powerful and agile in ways I’m not sure it is now.” That said, she isn’t entirely sure how much of a break Manhattan Beach – already longlisted for the National Book awards in the US – represents with her past. Yes, she longed for it to be different. Whenever she finishes a project, all she wants to do is “repudiate” it. However, those who like to describe her as a postmodernist seem sometimes to forget that there is nothing she has done in her novels that the Victorians didn’t do – “and that includes graphic kookiness”. In any case, she didn’t begin by writing a regular kind of narrative. “At first, I was going to rip things up again,” she says. “I thought the book would connect to 9/11, which I felt was the end of something, or at least an important event in a trajectory that had begun with the rise of America as a superpower at the end of world war two, and so there would be these leaps into the future, ie into our present. But all that was dead on arrival. It was so stale. There’s nothing inherently exciting about any narrative move: it’s only exciting if it works, and if it couldn’t be done any other way. Everything else is gimmickry.” When these leaps in time received a thumbs down from her writing group, she knew she had to let them go. “I finally admitted to myself I was sick of all that so-called innovation, and that it would be a relief to get rid of it.” Only then, a new problem: “To my horror, I found it was much harder to write a book in which I had to sustain momentum. With fragmentation [her approach in Goon Squad] you avoid a lot of writing pitfalls, the number one of which is sustaining momentum.” In her acknowledgments, Egan describes “circling” around Manhattan Beach’s setting over a period of years. There was a time when she wasn’t sure she could transform her research into a novel. That job seemed (she tells me this with the same modesty that has her insisting she was “over-rewarded” for Goon Squad) to be beyond her capabilities. “But I’ve learned there is a feeling I have about things that are going to end up in my fiction, a kind of excitement. I have this dream again and again: I find extra rooms in the place where I live. You could say it’s a very New York dream, but I think it’s about writing – the feeling that there is something behind a wall or a door. When I went on my first tour of the Brooklyn Navy Yard, I had the sense that I was pushing through a wall. I was in a hidden city.” Egan found her way to the source of her inspiration through old photographs. When she first moved to New York – she lives in Brooklyn with her husband, a theatre director, and two teenage sons – people had learned to look away from the water. But in these images, the city poured outwards towards its piers, its lifeblood. Having toured the navy yard with its archivist, and having learned of the daily miracles of engineering that were performed there – “such incredible feats, including two ships that were half destroyed being soldered together” – she fell in with a bunch of veteran army divers. “I attended one of their reunions in 2009, and they dressed me in the Mark V diving suit [the kind with a heavy, spherical metal helmet], all 200 pounds of it. Most of them had been in Korea or Vietnam, but there was one second world war veteran there. He had worked as a diver in Cherbourg, clearing out the harbour after the Germans blew everything up when they fled.” In France, this man had come across a female Russian diver – a figure, almost mythological, who enthralled Egan. In the fullness of time, she would import the woman into her novel in the form of the heroine, Anna Kerrigan, the spirited daughter of a dancer from the Ziegfeld Follies. Not content merely with soldering and riveting – the war enabled women to take well-paid jobs previously done only by men – Anna would join that most dangerous and exclusive of navy occupations, becoming a diver. Did any women really dive for the US navy? “I don’t know that they didn’t,” says Egan. “But given that the navy would not even let African American men dive, it doesn’t seem likely.” Egan’s career as a writer – she first decided she wanted to be one in the 1980s, as a lonely backpacker in Europe – has an unusual shape. Her early novels were critically acclaimed and sold well; The Keep, her take on the gothic, was a bestseller. But starting out – she was first published in 1995 – she was somehow never pegged as “a hot, young writer”. This used to trouble her. Now, though, she’s grateful for it. “There’s something wonderful about the feeling that things continue to improve. I had a steady build and then [after the Pulitzer] a quantum leap. I just turned 55, and feel: wow! I’m also one of the lucky ones, in that I have always been able to make a living from it.” She combines fiction with long-form journalism (for the New York Times Magazine), and she doesn’t know where she would be, creatively, without it. “Fiction is my deepest love, but I love journalism, too. It keeps me thinking vigorously, and it reminds me that there is a world out there. It has taught me how to distil enormous quantities of information, and I wouldn’t have been able to write Manhattan Beach without that because I have never scuba dived. Actually, I’ve barely been on a ship.” Acting on a hunch, I ask if she was relieved to have finished Manhattan Beach before the election of Trump. “Oh my God, you said it. Friends who are working on books set in contemporary times are trying to figure out how to account for him; he has a way of sucking all the air out of the room. After the inauguration, I found it almost impossible to work for a couple of weeks. All the existential problems that can crowd in on writers – questions like: what’s the point? – seemed very crushing at that moment.” The president is, however, having an effect on her reading. “I’m reading Trollope now,” she says, almost confidingly. “He’s little read here, but he makes for a great juxtaposition with Trump because he is all about power and money. Every character is introduced along with their annual income: people literally have a price tag on their head.” Thanks to this, Trump may yet turn out to be a cog in the engine of her next novel – which Egan, the so-called postmodernist, is thinking about setting in the 19th century. That surely must tell us something about where we are right now. • Jennifer Egan is appearing at Sydney Writers festival 2018, held between 30 April - 6 May at Carriageworks. • Manhattan Beach by Jennifer Egan will be published in the UK on 3 October (Little, Brown £16.99).

However, on average these outages represent a much smaller quantity of lost generation compared to the day-to-day intermittency of wind or solar. Nuclear plants spend a high proportion of the time generating at their maximum capacity. On emissions, some proponents of both nuclear and renewables do fall into the habit of referring to their technologies as “zero-carbon”, even though there are some greenhouse gas emissions produced with all forms of generation. But there is remarkable academic agreement that the emissions from nuclear, wind, solar and many other non-fossil generation sources are similarly low per unit of electricity generated and these emissions are tiny fractions of those associated with burning coal and gas. We desperately need to cut emissions in our electricity mix to as low as possible. The nuclear industry’s Harmony programme has a goal of 25% of the world’s electricity being supplied by nuclear energy by 2050. The remaining 75% would need to be supplied by a broad mix of other almost zero-carbon generation options, alongside energy storage and smart grids to help deal with intermittent generation and variable demand. We should work together for a strong, clean future for electricity generation rather than quibble while coal burns. Agneta Rising Director general, World Nuclear Association • The simple engineering facts that solar only functions less than one-third of the day and wind only functions when winds are just right mean that they are unreliable and must be backed up at a moment’s notice. In most areas, that’s by burning gas in low-efficiency “peaker” turbine plants that never get shut off fully to protect their expensive equipment. So, wind/solar energy is far from free, has high related emissions and is far more expensive than a nuclear plant that runs 90% of every year for decades. Nuclear power provides far better capacity, stability, longevity and jobs than can wind/solar enterprises, all while providing local communities with reliable power and great economic benefit to boot. The combustion industry loves renewables because their use commits poorly informed electorates and legislatures to installing emissions-producing backup.

In polls, including a recent one for National Poetry Day, The Owl and the Pussycat is often voted our favourite poem. Anyone who has ever doodled a limerick, of any tone or topic, pays homage to his genius. As well as timeless nonsense such as The Jumblies, there’s also his art – brilliantly studied paintings of exotic creatures in far-off lands; luminous desertscapes; antic sketches of men with birds in their beards – work that puts him in a class of his own as an important Victorian artist. Edward Lear is one of those English one-offs who are treasured because they seem to suggest that there are no more important things to do than paint or write, and who embody a benign, provisional and above all amateur spirit. Lear himself, slyly complicit, summarised his place in the English cultural landscape with a teasing, encrypted self-description: How pleasant to know Mr Lear! Who has written such volumes of stuff! Some think him ill-tempered and queer, But a few think him pleasant enough. He was born in London in 1812, the same year as Charles Dickens, one of at least 17, or was it 19 (his mother lost count; there were infant deaths)? Young Edward was both swept up in, and set apart from, this brood. With good reason, he always felt different. By the age of five, he was not only a boy among many sisters, but also diagnosed as epileptic, a lifelong terror he shared with Lewis Carroll. Epilepsy would be one of the secrets that made him solitary, while his atrocious eyesight “formed everything into a horror”. Lear’s nonconformist parents hardly compensated for these childhood traumas: both were largely absent. His City broker father was remote; his “shadowy” mother rejected him. Jenny Uglow declares at the outset that she wants to “follow his life straightforwardly”. In this, she’s echoing the discreet and magisterial example of Vivien Noakes who pioneered this elusive subject in 1968 in Edward Lear: The Life of a Wanderer. But Uglow goes much further than Noakes. This, quite rightly, is the half-life of a gay man in a society that had neither language nor tolerance for homosexuality. By chapter two, on top of all his other troubles, young Edward is grappling with some mysterious abuse, “the greatest evil done to me in my life”. What, exactly, this was remains unclear, though Lear recorded the date of the “greatest evil” every year in his diary. Uglow, whose focus on Lear and his confused sexuality is unflinching, is too good a biographer to indulge in reckless speculation here. Clearly, for “pleasant” Mr Lear, nothing would ever again be “straightforward”, especially once he and his beloved sister Ann began to escape into a parallel universe of exquisite botanical drawing. Nonsense verse soon followed. From boyhood, Lear was “three parts crazy”, but “wholly affectionate.” He would only get more like himself. There were few intrusions on his adolescent solitude, apart from birds, especially parrots, his favourites. Some early zoological work inspired his vocation as an artist. Eventually, he would rival Audubon. Parrots also brought him a patron, Edward Smith-Stanley, 13th Earl of Derby, whose teeming family exposed Lear to a new audience for his gifts as an entertainer. As an artist, Lear was supposed to remain below stairs with the servants, but Stanley liked to have his protege upstairs to amuse his guests. Where Carroll had Alice and the Liddell family, Lear had the Knowsley nursery, where the Stanley children, their friends and nursemaids, kept riotous company. Unlike Carroll, he did not sentimentalise little girls, betraying no hint of the paedophile. Rather, Lear loved the mayhem of childhood to which nonsense was the only answer. Nonsense was infantile, rude, eccentric and grumpy, as children are. Nonsense could celebrate surreal violence and ghoulish accidents. As a roving landscape painter, Lear could be exquisite. Through his crazy wordplay, he could express his inner torment as a homosexual single man in Victorian England. Abroad, in Rome or Corfu, he could be “as happy as a hedgehog” and was free to fall in love with other artists. At home, he had to present himself, half ironically, as a man in need of a wife: “I anticipate the chance of a Mrs Lear”, he wrote, “in 40 years hence.” Unlike some gay Victorians, who went native overseas, it was Lear’s respectable hope that he was “always an Englishman” abroad. “Mr Lear” was certainly a weird bird. As he grew older, this myopic court jester, and nomadic artist, unable to reconcile his sexual with his social self, morphed into his mature, eccentric persona. This was the closet homosexual who, in the summer of 1846, came to teach drawing to Queen Victoria. “How did you get all these beautiful things?” he exclaimed, on first seeing the famous royal collection. “I inherited them, Mr Lear,” replied the Queen. It’s at this point that Jenny Uglow diverges most completely from the narrative line hewn by Vivien Noakes. Uglow’s interest in Lear’s court life is distinctly finite. And yet Windsor did do something for Lear, which was give an awkward, gay man renewed self-confidence. Thus, 1846 also saw the publication of A Book of Nonsense (now an exceedingly rare book). Uglow is good on Lear’s nonsense, attributing just the right amount of consequence to its surreal caprice: There was an Old Person of Rhodes, Who strongly objected to toads; He paid several cousins, To catch them by dozens, That futile Old Person of Rhodes. On his travels again – now to the Holy Land – Lear fell in love with a younger man, Frank Lushington, who would eventually compound Lear’s inner torment. For a while, the senior partner found temporary solace among the pre-Raphaelite brotherhood to whom he looked up as a child among grown-ups, addressing Holman Hunt as “dear Daddy”. Now in his 40s, Lear had become a considerable figure in the mid-Victorian arts world, making friends with Tennyson and especially his wife, Emily, to whom he confessed feeling “jarry and out of tune”. Uglow shows that the life of the Victorian gay man, even in progressive circles, was excruciating. The sexual appetite, wrote one, was “a beast to be suppressed, trampled by the help of surgeons and their cautery of sexual organs”. Only abroad could Lear and Lushington enjoy a semblance of marriage – as Uglow puts it – “without the sex”. But then, how “queer” was Mr Lear? When he and his manservant Giorgio visited Mount Athos, Lear fled screaming from the Holy Mountain and its “mournful, minced fish and marmalade masticating Monx [sic]”. In middle age, Lear’s wordplay had become quasi-Joycean, writes Uglow, “alive, protean, ever evolving, and finding new endings, like new limbs”. This is the Lear beloved of Auden and Eliot. He was, says Uglow, “an eerie, queery, sometimes weary, sometimes cheery Edward Lear”. When “cheery”, he enjoyed moments that were “splendidophoropherostiphongious”, but there was always a terrible sadness, too, that only nonsense could assuage. In 1861, Lear published a new Book of Nonsense, a huge success that would establish him as a classic. Four years later, Lewis Carroll published Alice in Wonderland, a very different kettle of fish, steeped in logic and literary allusion. These two Victorian giants never met, and Lear read Alice “without comment”. Lear’s world, unlike Dodgson’s Oxford idyll, was provisional, nomadic and fraught. Lushington got married and Lear tortured himself with matrimonial fantasies. He would be “forever roaming with a hungry heart”. Finally, the gaiety and sadness of Lear’s life expressed itself in his four greatest poems: The Owl and the Pussycat, The Dong With a Luminous Nose, Some Incidents in the Life of My Uncle Arly and The Jumblies, warbling their “moony song”. He might recognise that he had gone “to sea in a sieve”, but he admonished his diary that “the morbids are not allowed”. This extraordinary Englishman died in self-imposed isolation in San Remo aged 75. Jenny Uglow has written a great life about an artist with half a life, a biography that might break your heart. • Mr Lear: A Life of Art and Nonsense by Jenny Uglow is published by Faber (£25).

Spearheading the launch at the International Convention Centre Sydney on Saturday evening, Bernardi warned the audience that if the Marriage Act was changed to include same-sex couples it would lead to “legal warfare” against supporters of traditional marriage. His warning fitted with the tone of the event, which placed its focus on the flow-on effects of altering marriage. But his warnings were countered by yes campaigners on Sunday, during the national launch of the marriage equality #PostYourYes campaign. Yes rallies were scheduled for Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, Darwin and Perth on Sunday, with advocates pushing to get as many marriage equality supporters as possible to post their same-sex marriage survey forms back to the Bureau of Statistics. On Saturday evening, Bernardi was joined by prominent Coalition politicians Matt Canavan and Concetta Fierravanti-Wells, as well as Lyle Shelton from the Australian Christian Lobby, during the anti-same sex marriage launch. An estimated 1,000 people, many with shirts and placards bearing the slogan “It’s OK to say no”, filled the ICC Sydney at Darling Harbour on Saturday night. “The marriage plebiscite is a referendum on consequences,” the event page said about the postal survey, which is neither a plebiscite nor a referendum. “Changing the Marriage Act will affect you, your family and all Australians.” The event page repeated claims that “radical gay sex education” may become compulsory in schools, and that changing the marriage act “gives licence to gay activists, weaponising anti-discrimination legislation and using it to stifle debate or dissent”. Bernardi, who received a standing ovation before he began his speech, said free speech was under attack from those seeking to redefine marriage, and their mission would have predictable consequences. “We’re under assault because we’re on the right side of legal and moral history,” he said, adding that same-sex marriage would lead to “weaponised” anti-discrimination laws. Shelton, who believes parents should allowed to take their children to gay conversion therapy, made exactly the same warning about weaponised anti-discrimination laws. He also pointed to the former prime minister John Howard, who intervened in the marriage equality debate this week to accuse the Turnbull government of failing to deal with the matter of religious freedom before the postal survey went ahead. “If Malcolm Turnbull, George Brandis and Bill Shorten don’t know how your freedoms are going to be protected, vote no,” he said. The campaigns over marriage equality have stepped up this week as postal vote forms began being delivered. Research by an advertising analytics firm found opponents of marriage equality had outspent yes campaigners on television advertising by about five to one. Ebiquity found the no campaign had spent $312,000 and the yes campaign $64,000 on TV ads. The Australian Bureau of Statistics has spent $1.7m on the campaign so far. Advocates of the yes campaign are pushing supporters to get their vote in the post. Well-known marriage equality advocates, political leaders, couples and campaigners have begun sharing their plans to encourage others to tick yes and post their forms back to the ABS. Alex Greenwich, independent MP for Sydney and co-chair of the Equality Campaign, said on Sunday ahead of the rally in Adelaide that the postal survey was an exciting opportunity to vote yes to national values of fairness and equality. “Millions of envelopes have already been sent out by the ABS, with millions more set to arrive in mail boxes this week. In those envelopes are the hope, dreams and aspiration of everyday Aussies who simply want to marry the person they love in the country we all cherish,” he said. “So today, we launch our national ‘get out to vote’ campaign, to empower all supporters of marriage equality to vote yes – yes for their friends, their family members, their work mates and neighbours, and yes to a fair go for all. “From today we will be knocking as many doors as possible, ringing as many relos as we can and doing everything possible to ensure yes is a success. “When 11.30am on the 15th of November comes, let’s hope this is a moment our nation can finally celebrate getting this done together.” Greenwich was joined at the rally by Liberal MP Christopher Pyne and Labor senator Penny Wong. Tony Abbott’s sister and City of Sydney councillor Christine Forster and her partner Virginia Edwards appeared in Leichhardt in Sydney on Sunday morning to promote the yes campaign. On Friday, seven former presidents of the Australian Medical Association launched a video in support of marriage equality, urging people to vote yes."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/sep/16/police-brought-in-after-marriage-equality-survey-forms-put-up-for-sale-online","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-16T04:26:57Z","webTitle":"Police brought in after marriage equality survey forms put up for sale online","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/sep/16/police-brought-in-after-marriage-equality-survey-forms-put-up-for-sale-online","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/sep/16/police-brought-in-after-marriage-equality-survey-forms-put-up-for-sale-online","fields":{"headline":"Police brought in after marriage equality survey forms put up for sale online","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Australian Bureau of Statistics is in discussion with Australian federal police after it emerged marriage equality postal votes were being put up for sale online. The concerns were raised in the past week as the ABS began sending ballots out to people for the upcoming marriage equality postal survey, and one appeared on eBay with a starting bid of $1,500. There have been up to 20 instances of someone trying to sell their vote online, with one ad to “buy my vote” posted on eBay with a starting bid of $1,500, the ABC reported. “What is this plebiscite worth to you,” the ad said. “The reason I’m selling my vote is because either way I don’t care but thought there are people who do.” The ad has since been taken down but deputy statistician for the ABS, Jonathan Palmer, told a Senate inquiry on Friday the ABS doesn’t have a policy on how to deal with such acts, and he had asked for some cases to be referred to Australian federal police (AFP). “In our original risk register there were some risks that required us to work well with the AFP and we’ve done some of that in risks relating to cyber security,” said Palmer. “But this particular line of fraudulent activity is not one that we, in our mitigation strategies, identified a need to liaise with the AFP earlier, so we are doing it now.” It’s not clear whether selling a vote in the postal survey is a criminal offence. The AFP told Guardian Australia it had not received any formal referrals by Saturday morning, but it was working with the ABS on the issue. “Should a formal referral be received, an evaluation will be conducted in accordance with standard procedures,” a spokesman said. “The AFP has discussed this issue with the ABS and will consider future referrals in accordance these procedures.” Both sides of the marriage equality debate have criticised the actions of people trying to sell their vote. Tiernan Brady, the executive director of the Australians for Equality campaign, told the ABC the person who posted the offer was “an idiot”. “This is a serious discussion about real people’s lives,” he said. Monica Doumit, a spokeswoman for the Coalition For Marriage group, welcomed eBay’s prompt action in removing the ad. “We want all Australian to actually have their say, so obviously people selling their vote online isn’t within the spirit of it,” she told Guardian Australia. “We want all Australians to have their vote rather than trying to make some money.” Amid the concerns about the validity of the voting mechanism, debate reached new heights this week as people started to receive their ballots and campaigns officially launched. On Saturday Labor backbencher Pat Conroy said calls by the former prime minister John Howard for the government to produce legislation detailing religious protections were a “red herring”. “He did this in the Republican movement where he tried to attack future mechanisms rather than the fundamental questions about whether it is a ‘yes’ or ‘no’,” Conroy told the ABC. But Liberal MP Craig Kelly said Howard made a good point and there was no legislation to which Australians could actually say yes or no in the survey. The no campaign has continued to say religious freedoms are under threat if marriage equality is legislated. Prominent no-campaigner Lyle Shelton was widely condemned on Friday for suggesting parents should be able to send their gay children to conversion therapy – a discredited practice considered a threat to the health and human rights of subjected individuals. Shelton told BuzzFeed he considered “conversion therapy” to be a loaded term, but that parents should have the right to take their children to therapy for “help”. “Should people be forced to go to conversion therapy? No, absolutely not,” he said. “Now, children – they are under the care and responsibility of their parents, so I think if someone’s a minor, it is up to their parents. And I think parental rights should be respected.” The Australian Medical Association, as well as past presidents, were quick to “unequivocally condemn” the practice endorsed by Shelton’s remarks. “Conversion therapy is harmful to both the individuals who are subjected to it, and society more broadly, as it perpetuates the erroneous belief that homosexuality is a disorder which requires a cure,” the AMA said on Friday. Several former AMA presidents who appeared in a video on Friday urging people to vote yes, as well as current New South Wales president Professor Brad Frankum, attended a rally with medical professionals, students, and supporters in Sydney’s Martin Place on Saturday. “I think discrimination has very severe long-term adverse psychological and physical health consequences and, as doctors, we are all about people’s health and wellbeing and supporting marriage equality is going to help people in the LGBTIQ community,” said Frankum. A large crowd also attended a marriage equality rally in Adelaide, which heard from Labor senator Penny Wong. It follows a rally last Sunday in Sydney, when an estimated 30,000 people marched in support of marriage equality."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/16/us-must-stop-north-korea-threats-says-china-kim-jong-un-military-equilibrium","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-16T01:39:52Z","webTitle":"US must stop North Korea threats, says China, as Kim Jong-un aims for military 'equilibrium'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/16/us-must-stop-north-korea-threats-says-china-kim-jong-un-military-equilibrium","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/16/us-must-stop-north-korea-threats-says-china-kim-jong-un-military-equilibrium","fields":{"headline":"US must stop North Korea threats, says China, as Kim Jong-un aims for military 'equilibrium'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The United States must stop threatening North Korea’s leader if a peaceful solution to the nuclear crisis is to be found, China’s ambassador to Washington has said, as Kim Jong-un reiterated his country’s aim to reach military “equilibrium” with the US. Cui Tiankai told reporters in Washington: “They [the US] should refrain from issuing more threats. They should do more to find effective ways to resume dialogue and negotiation.” “Honestly, I think the United States should be doing … much more than now, so that there’s real effective international cooperation on this issue.” North Korea’s state news agency, KCNA on Saturday quoted Kim as saying: “Our final goal is to establish the equilibrium of real force with the US and make the US rulers dare not talk about military option.” The US warned on Friday it could revert to military options if the latest sanctions fail to curb North Korean missile and nuclear tests, after Pyongyang fired a missile over Japan for the second time in two weeks. US national security advisor HR McMaster said: “We have been kicking the can down the road and we’re out of road. For those who have been commenting about the lack of a military option – there is a military option. Now, it’s not what we prefer to do, so what we have to do is call on all nations to do everything we can to address this global problem, short of war.” Earlier, the US secretary of state, Rex Tillerson urged Russia and China to “indicate their intolerance for these reckless missile launches by taking direct actions of their own”. The Chinese ambassador was speaking after Pyongyang fired a missile over Japan for the second time in two weeks a move the UN security council said it “strongly condemned”. Speaking in Beijing, a foreign ministry spokeswoman said China opposed the launch but also urged the US to change its tactics towards Pyongyang. “China is not to blame for the escalation of tensions. China does not hold the key to resolving the Korean peninsula nuclear issue, either. Those who tied the knots are responsible for untying [them].” The North Korea issue is likely to take centre stage during Donald Trump’s anticipated state visit to China in November. For months Trump has been struggling to convince Beijing to do more to help him rein in Kim’s regime, using a mixture of public flattery and Twitter diplomacy in his bid to win over the Chinese president, Xi Jinping. “North Korea is a rogue nation which has become a great threat and embarrassment to China, which is trying to help but with little success,” Trump tweeted on 3 September after Pyongyang’s sixth nuclear test. Zhao Tong, a North Korea expert at Beijing’s Carnegie–Tsinghua Center for Global Policy, said it was too early to tell how the issue might affect Trump’s visit. “Many things can happen between now and then. New developments can emerge that seriously change the calculations,” he said. However, Zhao said it was almost certain Kim would continue his campaign in the lead-up to Trump’s arrival. “We are likely to see more tests, maybe including another nuclear tests … It won’t take long before the North Koreans really feel the pain [from the recent UN sanctions]. So I think the North Korean strategy is to use this very short time before they face real problems domestically, to completely conclude their nuclear and missile programs, to achieve all of the key technologies … So they are likely accelerate and to conduct the tests that are most important for them and then quickly soften their position and come to diplomacy.” The US ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, echoed McMaster’s strong rhetoric, even as she said Washington’s preferred resolution to the crisis was through diplomacy and sanctions. “What we are seeing is, they are continuing to be provocative, they are continuing to be reckless and at that point there’s not a whole lot the security council is going to be able to do from here, when you’ve cut 90% of the trade and 30% of the oil,” Haley said. Trump said he was “more confident than ever that our options in addressing this threat are both effective and overwhelming”. Speaking from Joint Base Andrews near Washington he said North Korea “has once again shown its utter contempt for its neighbours and for the entire world community”. Russia’s UN ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia, said the US needed to begin talks with North Korea, something that Washington has so far ruled out. “We called on our US partners and others to implement political and diplomatic solutions that are provided for in the resolution,” Nebenzia told reporters after the security council meeting. “Without implementing this, we also will consider it as a non-compliance with the resolution.” Asked about the prospect for direct talks, a White House spokesman said: “As the president and his national security team have repeatedly said, now is not the time to talk to North Korea.” South Korean president Moon Jae-in also said dialogue with the North was impossible at this point. He ordered officials to analyse and prepare for possible new North Korean threats, including electromagnetic pulse and biochemical attacks. The US and South Korea are technically still at war with North Korea because the 1950-53 Korean conflict ended with a truce and not a peace treaty. The North accuses the US, which has 28,500 troops in South Korea, of planning to invade and regularly threatens to destroy it and its Asian allies.

The expression is playful but his scale – 65ft – dwarfs the fence, making it look puny and eminently climbable. JR, a French visual artist, unveiled the monumental photo last week on the outskirts of Tecate, a Mexican town bordering California. The installation has become a tourist magnet amid renewed focus on Donald Trump’s proposed border wall to block purported would-be immigrant hordes. The toddler, it turns out, isn’t among them. Nor is his family. From their yard, they can reach through the fence and touch US soil but don’t really see the point. They prefer life in Mexico. “I want to stay and work here,” said Lizy Higareda, 24, in Spanish, as her 17-month-old son, Kikito, played at her feet in the family’s living room. “My career, my roots, are here.” The photo of Kikito shows him gazing into the US, but curiosity was not the same as yearning, said his mother, a student and part-time bodega worker. “Our lives are in Tecate. It’s a good life, peaceful.” Would she ever want to visit the US? She shrugged. “Disneyland and Hawaii, sure.” Higareda can feel a California breeze in her kitchen but is content to stay in Mexico, as are most Mexicans. Since the great recession, in fact, more Mexican immigrants are leaving the US than entering, according to the Pew Research Center. This historic reversal did not dent Trump’s promise in last year’s election to build a “big, beautiful wall” to keep out “bad hombres” and other undesirables. A tentative immigration deal with Democrats has clouded the wall’s fate. Higareda’s father, José, 82, a retired schoolteacher, briefly lived in the US and has permanent residency papers but prefers Tecate, which sits in a valley 40 miles east of San Diego. “I’m very proud to be Mexican. It’s a good life, there’s dignity. You can have liberty and work.” Ironically Kikito, whose image looms over the fence a short walk from the family home, has become a symbol of northbound human traffic – those currently trying to cross the border and the so-called Dreamers brought as children. Trump’s rhetoric about a wall inspired JR, who has been called a French version of Banksy, to conjure the image of a child looking over the border. While scouting locations he encountered the Higaredas, who gave him permission to photograph Kikito and turn the image into a temporary installation. The artist included a Google Maps pin on his Instagram profile, which has a million followers, to help people find the installation. You can view it from either side of the border. It is due to come down in early October. “Kikito’s famous now,” said Rosario Armenta, a Mexican visitor. “I see him as a little angel saying something to the United States, something about the Latinos who go there.” A real estate developer from San Diego who gave his name only as Kevin admired it from the US side. “It’s pretty classic what they did with the kid. We should allow more Mexicans to enter legally.” The number of undocumented border crossers is near a historic low. During the 2016 fiscal year the US Border Patrol caught 80 people crossing the border illegally near Tecate. The Higaredas hope Kikito will never feel forced to leave his home, a rambling brick structure atop a hill adorned with dozens of family portraits and a yard boasting an ancient Pontiac, an even older Nissan, four cats, five dogs and 18 chickens. The local school is fine and Tecate is “magical”, said his mother, with a wry smile and air quotes. The town, best known for a brewery which bears its name, is on a federal list of Pueblos Mágicos, places notable for natural beauty or historical or cultural significance. It is quiet and friendly, said Higareda, but also has corruption and occasional violence, blowback from the drug war ravaging other parts of Mexico. She hopes to finish a criminology degree next year and to work as a jail therapist. “I don’t want to fight the drug war. I want to help end it.” Meantime she supplements her husband’s meagre factory wages and her father’s pension by working three days a week in a bodega, earning $23 over that period. “When Kikito took his first steps, I was at work,” she rued. “The first time he said mama, I was at work.” She hopes Kikito will learn English – he would be the first in his family – in order to earn a better wage, not to emigrate. He is her first - and last – child, said Higareda. The pregnancy was tough and money is tight. “He’s become my world, but no more.” Mexico’s fertility rate, once among the world’s highest, has plunged to nearly that of the US, another reason there are fewer people trekking north. During the interview, Tecate’s local celebrity played with a shoe, scrambled over a sofa, scrutinised a cat, emptied a bag, squeezed a pillow and wandered in and out of the kitchen – where his grandmother prepared lunch – before falling asleep in his mother’s lap, guzzling a bottle of milk. “He still doesn’t know what’s on the other side of the fence,” said his mother. “He doesn’t know that Donald Trump thinks Mexicans are killers and rapists. He’s just innocent, curious.” JR explained the installation in advance and gifted her a book titled Can Art Change the World?, but the scale of the work still came a surprise, she said. “So big. And I didn’t realise people would be interested in Kikito.” Tourists coo over him and a few give a few dollars for diapers and milk, the family’s only financial gain from the project, which is fine by them. “It’s not about money, it’s about a special thing happening so early in his life,” said Higareda. Jose, the grandfather, beamed in agreement. “The whole world wants to hug him.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/16/prosecco-popularity-losing-fizz-with-connoisseurs","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-16T23:05:25Z","webTitle":"Bottoms up: onslaught against prosecco falls flat among fans on its home turf","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/16/prosecco-popularity-losing-fizz-with-connoisseurs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/16/prosecco-popularity-losing-fizz-with-connoisseurs","fields":{"headline":"Bottoms up: onslaught against prosecco falls flat among fans on its home turf","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"It’s aperitivo time in Treviso, a city in the heart of the Italian prosecco-making region of Veneto, and some of those gathered in the bars are still smarting over recent criticism of their esteemed sparkling wine. “It’s not true that it’s bad for your teeth,” said Mariolina Ticcò, flashing a confident grin while swirling a glass of her favourite pre-dinner drink. “It must have been a joke. I’ve grown up with prosecco, and have a glass every day, sometimes a little more, sometimes while cooking. It’s normal: everyone here drinks it.” Warnings that the drink rots teeth and erodes gums due to its sugar and high acidity, thus producing a “prosecco smile”, came from dentists in Britain, where demand for the wildly popular wine recently led to scrums at supermarkets. The claims triggered an outcry in Italy, as politicians leapt to the defence of one of their most precious exports. Maurizio Martina, the agriculture minister, lambasted the reports as “fake news” while Luca Zaia, president of the Veneto region, retorted that Britons needed prosecco to help them smile amid Brexit woes. Stefano Zanette, a winemaker, is not dwelling too much on the slight. As president of Veneto’s main consortium for prosecco producers, he doesn’t have time to; a fresh battle is looming. Carlo Petrini, founder of Italy’s Slow Food movement, has taken aim at the winemakers, suggesting in an interview with the Corriere della Sera newspaper that overproduction of prosecco risks turning it into “a commodity like Coca-Cola”. Zanette’s response is withering: “I don’t want to get into a debate with Petrini, but comparing prosecco to Coca-Cola shows that he doesn’t really understand the difference between an industrial commodity and a territory that makes a product that is strictly regulated.” Petrini’s comments came after British shoppers formed long queues outside Lidl supermarkets on the August bank holiday weekend in the hope of snapping up an offer of six bottles for £20. Many had risen early, only to find that the fizz had sold out within minutes. With a bottle costing up to £3 to produce, but selling in the UK for as little as £1.50, the newspaper’s columnist, Gian Antonio Stella, questioned whether it was worth the sector producing almost half a billion bottles a year, only for them to be sold at rock-bottom prices. Petrini argued that the volume of trade was not good for prosecco or the region it comes from. Zanette begs to differ: “We can satisfy demand with our production capacity and at the same time maintain the quality – we don’t just open a tap and out pours a bottle of prosecco. “Besides, supermarket promotions are about sales and marketing and have nothing to do with quality. Like other products, prosecco is sold across a price range, with the lower-priced bottles competing with other sparkling wines. In that respect, prosecco is always made the culprit in a market that contains unregulated varieties.” The sensitivity of prosecco producers is understandable: the UK is now the biggest market for the wine, with almost 105m bottles sold here in 2016, compared with about 11m in 2011. The drink has overtaken sales of its pricier French rival, champagne, and has become so fashionable that “mobile prosecco vans” can now be hired for parties. One of the reasons it’s cheaper is because the production process is more efficient than for champagne. The phase of secondary fermentation – the process that creates the bubbles – takes place inside huge steel tanks, rather than in bottles. Meanwhile, a range of prosecco merchandise has sprung up alongside the drink’s explosive success, including sweets, lip balm and even doormats. In the US, where the drink is just as fashionable, an unofficial National Prosecco Day was launched last year on 13 August. Veneto has also been enjoying the fruits of a boom in prosecco tourism, with visitors now just as likely to hop on a wine tour as they are a gondola in the region’s most famous city, Venice. Tucked away among the vineyards of the Valdobbiadene area is a farmhouse called Osteria Senz’Oste, or Tavern without a Landlord, where bottles of prosecco and plates of cheese and ham await anyone who calls in. As the name suggests, there is nobody to serve or take cash – guests simply leave an offering. The idea was the brainchild of the property’s owner, Cesare de Stefani, a businessman who wanted outsiders to experience the hospitality of his region over a glass of prosecco. It has proved to be a popular stopover, particularly with British tourists. “It’s easy to see why the drink has been so successful abroad,” said De Stefani. “It’s fruity and light on alcohol, you can drink it any time of the day, and it’s convivial and uplifting.” But when it comes to how the drink is promoted overseas, he says producers are perhaps the victims of its success. “The problem is with who sells it and not who produces it. This can have an impact on the drink’s image.” Despite concerns over the implications of Brexit, demand for prosecco in the UK is not expected to slow down soon. Total consumption is forecast to rise by 10.8% to nearly 74m litres a year by 2020, according to figures published this year by the research company International Wine and Spirits Record. “But we’re not indifferent about Brexit,” said Zanette. “The referendum immediately provoked a negative impact with the devaluing of sterling, meaning people had to pay more. We’ll have to wait and see how the UK and EU negotiate, but for sure, prosecco will be a very important card for Italy.” The producers’ main long-term priority was maintaining the drink’s quality and price while protecting its identity, Zanette said. When grappling with media storms, part of the problem is down to the name: drinkers assume prosecco covers all Italian sparkling wines. In fact the wine was named after the hamlet of Prosecco in Friuli-Venezia Giulia, a region east of Veneto, where the main grape used to make it – glera – is believed to have originated. The drink dates as far back as Roman times, while the cultivation of the grape expanded across Friuli and Veneto in the 18th century. As the main ingredient used in Aperol spritz and Bellini cocktails, prosecco has long been a popular tipple in Italy, but sales overseas began to thrive from around 2009, the year it was granted controlled designation of origin status. While he is relaxed about the latest bout of controversy, Zanette is implacably hostile to one result of his product’s popularity: its availability “on tap” in pubs and bars across the UK. “There is a lot of confusion in this market, it’s not easy,” said Zanette. “But the main thing is prosecco comes in a bottle and not in a keg!”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/16/donald-trump-jemele-hill-espn-white-supremacist","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-16T15:18:58Z","webTitle":"Is it wrong to call Trump a white supremacist? | Ameer Hasan Loggins","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/16/donald-trump-jemele-hill-espn-white-supremacist","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/16/donald-trump-jemele-hill-espn-white-supremacist","fields":{"headline":"Is it wrong to call Trump a white supremacist?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"On Monday evening ESPN’s Jemele Hill broke the internet, as they say, when she tweeted: “Donald Trump is a white supremacist who has largely surrounded himself w/ other white supremacists.” This didn’t go down too well in Washington DC. The White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said this was a “fireable offense.” Putting aside the fact that this government meddling has a chilling effect on free speech, to me the most pressing question in all of this is: was Jemele Hill wrong? Let’s examine the facts. In 1973, the Justice Department undertook an investigation of Trump Management for discriminating against prospective black applicants looking to rent housing in their properties. Both Donald and his father (Fred Trump), were named as defendants in the lawsuit, charging the Trump’s with violating the Fair Housing Act of 1968 in the operation of 39 buildings. The Fair Housing Act was a bill that was passed in the wake of the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. It was a key part of civil rights era legislation, and its primary reason for existing was to help dismantle housing segregation. This is a documented case where Donald Trump was accused by the federal government of using a tactic of racialized housing discrimination, in order to maintain segregated living spaces. The Trump Management, in other words, was being sued for employing white supremacist, Jim Crow-esque practices. It doesn’t stop there. Trump has politically aligned himself with politicians who have a documented history of racism. These people include Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who, in 1986, had his nomination to a federal district court rejected after people who had worked with him in Alabama testified under oath that he had made racially charged remarks. Sessions called a black prosecutor “boy,” joked about his support for the Ku Klux Klan and referred to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People as “un-American.” And let us not forget that Trump also elevated former Breitbart head Steve Bannon to a chief strategist role. Former Breitbart editor Ben Shapiro, who worked alongside Bannon, wrote on the Daily Wire that “under Bannon’s leadership, Breitbart openly embraced the white supremacist alt-right … with [now former Breitbart editor Milo] Yiannopoulos pushing white ethno-nationalism as a legitimate response to political correctness, and the comment section turning into a cesspool for white supremacist meme-makers”. It is undeniable that Jemele Hill’s claim that Trump has surrounded himself with white supremacist checks out. But what about Trump himself? Is he a white supremacist? He definitely is a white supremacist sympathiser. Just look at Charlottesville. After white supremacists held violent rallies in Charlottesville, leading to the killing of Heather D Heyer, Trump had a chance to denounce the racism and bigotry that led to her death. The man charged with killing her is James Alex Fields Jr, a man who made his mother believe that he was on his way to, “a Trump rally” . He did not. Instead, Trump blamed, “many sides.” Trump and his family also have fringe views that are espoused by other white supremacists about genetics. Consider an an interview with PBS, in which Trump biographer Michael D’Antonio claimed Trump’s father, Fred Trump, had taught him that their family’s success was due to their genetic superiority. D’Antonio explains that the Trump’s, “subscribe to a racehorse theory of human development ... They believe that there are superior people and that if you put together the genes of a superior woman and a superior man, you get a superior offspring.” The interview featuring D’Antonio concludes with a clip of Donald Trump saying, “You know I’m proud to have that German blood. No question about it”. Here is the thing, ideas of ‘superior’ and ‘inferior’ genes have their roots in eugenics. Eugenics was a commonly accepted means in America of, “protecting society from the offspring of those individuals deemed inferior or dangerous – the poor, the disabled, the mentally ill, criminals, and people of color”. Adolf Hitler’s justification for the Holocaust was in part based on a similar theory of genetic hierarchy. So, is Trump a white supremacist? I’ll allow you to draw your own conclusions. Just remember, he was a) sued by the federal government for white supremacist practices of racialized housing discrimination b) hired Jeff Sessions and Steve Bannon c) ran a bigoted presidential campaign that galvanized white supremacists to hold rallies across America and d) believes in ethnoracial pseudo-scientific theories of genetic superiority. Just why Jemele Hill should be in the cross-hairs for her analysis of these facts – and not the president himself – is a mystery to some, but quite clear to others.

Variety, the entertainment industry journal, went further: “It couldn’t have been easy for Beecham to live with this character, and to her credit she doesn’t try to make her likeable; the real mystery is why anyone wants so much as a coffee with this character.” Beecham’s convincing performance as a sharp-tongued, wayward and unhappy young woman living alone in London is, however, earning her high praise from critics. The signs are that this could be her breakthrough moment. “It’s a cracking little showcase for rising British actress Emily Beecham, who’s seldom offscreen for long as the tale’s lively, complex, intriguing quasi-heroine,” judged the Hollywood Reporter, making favourable comparisons with Lena Dunham’s American television hit, Girls. Beecham, 33, was last seen on the big screen playing opposite Ralph Fiennes and Channing Tatum in a much-admired comic vignette from the Coen Brothers’ 2016 release Hail Caesar! The film, which starred George Clooney, was an affectionate study of 1950s Hollywood and Beecham appeared briefly as an ice-cool, glossy-haired studio starlet. It was quite some distance then from her role in Daphne as the eponymous drink-addled, promiscuous kitchen worker and university dropout. “Emily’s lovely. Nothing like Daphne. She is very friendly,” said Peter Mackie Burns, the film’s director. “And she is nothing like she was in the famous ‘would that it were’ scene from Hail Caesar! either.” Burns and Beecham developed the character of Daphne over several years, together with the screenwriter Nico Mensinga. For Beecham, the part answered a big need for complex and less saccharine female screen roles. “There is a real thirst for it,” she said. “And they are very sought-after jobs when they do come along. Audiences may see these characters as unlikable, but from the actor’s point of view it is great to find a real character to relate to.” The problem, Beecham suspects, is that filmgoers have been fed a diet of idealised leading ladies and as a result more realistic portrayals seem mean. “The girlfriend roles that we are usually offered are nearly always just kind and supportive. So it is refreshing for women and for men to see something different,” she said. Burns agreed that cinema has been slow to catch up with its representations of women. “Film is still problematic,” he said. “It is a very conservative form in many ways. Television responds to things much more quickly.” Complex female characters appeared in literature, yet rarely made it to the big screen, Burns added, citing notable exceptions such as The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie in 1969, starring Maggie Smith, director John Cassavetes’ 1970s films with Gena Rowlands, and Ken Loach’s Poor Cow in 1967. Critics have also compared Daphne with the 1977 American film of the bestselling book, Looking for Mr Goodbar. For the future, Burns said, he would like to ban the phrase “strong woman” from film-making. “What does it mean? You should make any character three dimensional, that is all: someone you can recognise from your own experience. In Daphne we are really asking what happens when you become the person you were pretending to be. When you have put up a carapace and then realise you are living in a way you probably should not be.” The Scottish director and Beecham, who grew up in Cheshire and Hertfordshire, have already made a short film, Happy Birthday to Me, based on a similar character. Burns then wrote a detailed description of Daphne, including what she reads (Slavoj Žižek) and what music she listens to. “I would give the pages to Emily and set her to work,” said Burns. “Once we got on set I didn’t ever discuss how she would play a scene. We were very collaborative and we tried not to rehearse much or have too many takes.” Beecham found it hard to leave Daphne behind when filming finished. “We all got attached to her as a character. We only had four weeks on the shoot and it was sad it came to an end,” she said. “I absolutely would revisit her. It is a rite of passage film, in a way, and I recognise myself and my friends in some of it.” Beecham is a friend of Phoebe Waller-Bridge, creator and star of the acclaimed television series Fleabag, and the two share views about creating better roles for women. “We’ve known each other for about 10 years now and I relate to her feelings about what she went through. When you leave drama school you get a bit of a shock when you find you are stuck in your own casting bracket. And it is all about your looks. Now people are starting to write their own roles in response to that.” Before the British release, Burns offers his star the ultimate bouquet. “She is like Gena Rowlands and there is no higher accolade from me. I think you forget that she is acting.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sustainable-business/2017/sep/29/companies-zero-deforestation-pledges-agriculture-palm-oil-environment","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-29T08:41:00Z","webTitle":"Companies' ‘zero deforestation’ pledges: everything you need to know","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/sep/29/companies-zero-deforestation-pledges-agriculture-palm-oil-environment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/2017/sep/29/companies-zero-deforestation-pledges-agriculture-palm-oil-environment","fields":{"headline":"Companies' ‘zero deforestation’ pledges: everything you need to know","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Whether it’s the destruction of rainforest shared by elephants and orangutans in Sumatra to produce palm oil; reports linking fast food giants to the burning of tropical forests in Brazil and Bolivia; or the hundreds of thousands of hectares of tree cover loss per year in West Africa – the world’s forests are being razed to sate global demand for produce such as palm oil, beef and cocoa. As of March 2017, 447 companies had made 760 commitments to curb forest destruction in supply chains linked to palm oil, soy, timber and pulp, and cattle – principal forest-risk commodities – according to NGO Forest Trends. But what does this mean? And why do deforestation scandals keep emerging? Why does deforestation matter? According to Nasa’s Earth Observatory [pdf], if current rates of tropical deforestation continue, the world’s rainforests will vanish within 100 years, eliminating the majority of plant and animal species on the planet, as well as uprooting the communities who live there. Around 70% of deforestation is linked to the production of agricultural commodities that end up in food products eaten around the world. And deforestation accounts for around 12% of global manmade greenhouse gas emissions. A recent study from Cornell University suggests deforestation contributes more significantly to climate change than previously realised. What are ‘zero deforestation’ commitments? The UN’s sustainable development goals pledge to halt deforestation by 2020. A growing number of companies from McDonald’s to Unilever are also voluntarily committing to eliminate deforestation from their supply chains, both in their individual sustainability policies and through participation in larger initiatives. These include the Consumer Goods Forum – a network of consumer goods manufacturers, retailers and others – which has a commitment to achieve zero net deforestation by 2020. And the New York Declaration on Forests [pdf], which emerged from the UN’s climate summit in 2014, and includes non-binding commitments to half the rate of deforestation by 2020 and end it by 2030. One issue complicating these pledges is a lack of agreement about what a forest even is. The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) offer guidance, but each country is free to define forests within these criteria. And while terms such as “deforestation free” and “zero net deforestation” are often used interchangeably, they are different. Zero net deforestation, for example, allows forest clearance provided an equivalent area is replanted elsewhere. Who is slipping through the net? Anti-deforestation pledges are a positive step, but they have limitations, says Pablo Pacheco, principal scientist at the Centre for International Forestry Research. In the Indonesian palm oil sector corporate groups often do a good job of tracing supply from refineries to mills to plantations, says Pacheco, but face difficulties in tracing smaller, third party suppliers since they are often linked to the market through intermediaries. There is also the issue of some countries, for example China and India, being less engaged in the deforestation debate. China and Hong Kong together are among the largest importers of forest risk commodities globally, yet in 2016 they only scored two out of five on The Forest 500’s annual ranking of jurisdictions based on deforestation policies. What’s the impact? A recent Oxfam report [pdf] on deforestation-free food concluded that despite company commitments, not enough is being done to translate these into policies and action. The report also calls on companies to go beyond their own forest commitments to protect land rights and those who defend them. In Peru, six farmers were recently shot dead in a battle over land rights and palm oil and, in total, more than 145 land defenders have been killed so far this year – many linked to deforestation. There’s also a concern from some campaigners about a focus on company pledges. Sam Lawson, founding director of the NGO Earthsight, says voluntary commitments will only ever capture a certain proportion of the market – with “bad apples showing little regard for legality, let alone sustainability”. Attention on company commitments could also interfere with the time and funding dedicated to forest policy. “The effort spent pushing for corporate voluntary actions ... is distracting attention from some of the critical things, like getting the Indonesian government to cancel the corruptly issued licenses that cover vast areas of forest in that country,” he says. Where next? The UN has just launched the Good Growth Partnership, a four-year project led by the UNDP’s Green Commodities Programme aiming to transform the soy, beef and palm oil supply chains to meet SDG goals around poverty alleviation and tropical deforestation reduction. The increased availability of technology is also helping companies to monitor and manage deforestation. The Global Forest Watch, for example, has developed a monitoring tool which gives near real time alerts on areas of suspected forest clearance. And there is growing hope for cross-sector partnerships, bolstered by the success of Brazil’s soy moratorium. The initiative between government, environmentalists and companies started in 2006 when soy buyers agreed not to purchase soy from deforested areas in the Amazon. The moratorium was extended indefinitely last year and, while it is not without critics, a recent study concludes the deforestation rate pre-moratorium was more than five times that post-moratorium."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"football/2017/sep/15/roy-hodgson-returns-crystal-palace-roots","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-15T21:30:54Z","webTitle":"Roy Hodgson returns refreshed to his Crystal Palace roots","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/sep/15/roy-hodgson-returns-crystal-palace-roots","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/sep/15/roy-hodgson-returns-crystal-palace-roots","fields":{"headline":"Roy Hodgson returns refreshed to his Crystal Palace roots","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Roy Hodgson was as polite as ever and even offered his response through a chuckle but, as his first media conference back in club management stretched beyond the half-hour, it was easy to pinpoint the moment his patience snapped. The drip-feed of references to Nice, Iceland and a night he would rather forget had been incessant. He had already admitted that “careers are defined by small moments and nothing I can say or do will change that”. He had even conceded that he had dared to re-watch the panic gripping in the Allianz Riviera “but not for about 14 months, and I certainly don’t intend to watch it back again now”. It was only when he was asked what his impressions had been as he re-viewed that ignominious departure from Euro 2016 unfurl on his television screen, his audience pushing for one last glimpse of colour or lingering reflection, that the shutters came down. Enough was enough. “Look, I’m not interested in Iceland,” said Hodgson through a smile that betrayed a hint of underlying exasperation. “We’re going back down a route which I’ve said, reasonably politely, is a past chapter. Who cares? You might. There might be people up in Carlisle who’d like to know that. But at the moment I’m south London. I’m here in Beckenham. A lot of the Crystal Palace fans who will be reading this, the ones who interest me most of all, will want to know what Roy Hodgson is saying about Crystal Palace. What is he saying about the job? About our team? That Iceland game has gone and has no relevance to my work now.” England’s most well-travelled coach returns to the dug-out on Saturday back at the club where, in his youth, he had peered out as a teenager from the Holmesdale End terrace. Where he had marvelled at Johnny Byrne’s scoring exploits in the old Division Four or, under floodlights for the first time, in April 1962, drooled as Alfredo di Stéfano, Francisco Gento, Ferenc Puskas and Isidro Díaz González scored for the mighty Real Madrid in a 4-3 friendly victory at Selhurst Park. He has returned to the club where he once aspired to make his name as a player only for his career, still in its infancy in the mid-1960s, to lurch instead into Kentish non-league football with Tonbridge Angels, Gravesend &amp; Northfleet, Maidstone United and Ashford Town. The son of a Croydon bus driver returns at 70 with his reputation preceding him, a 40-year coaching career that has claimed eight league titles at three clubs in Sweden and Denmark and included the top job at Internazionale and four national associations. There were 56 games in charge of England and a fine qualifying record but intense frustration at three major tournaments. The memory of Hodgson in the wake of the Iceland defeat is of a man greyed by the whole experience, a figure diminished and wearied. He had spluttered through that desperately uncomfortable press conference back in Chantilly on the day after the night before, wondering publicly why he was being made to endure this last humiliation. “It would have been unusual if I had not felt [shattered] that day,” he said. “Myself, my coaching staff and the players cared very deeply. We’d had high hopes because we thought we were a good team capable of going a good way into the competition. To lose as we did against a team that, on many occasions, we would have beaten … what can one do other than look shattered? That was a bad day. “The press conference came after a sleepless night. But it’s well over a year ago now. I’ve had lots of time to get my mind back on track and it didn’t take me a year to do that. It took a lot less than that.” The period since has been taken up with consultancy work with City Football Group, spending time at Melbourne City “as a mentor for the young coaches there”. He declined the chance to appear on Strictly Come Dancing, as well as some tentative approaches to return to management, but busied himself instead with media commitments in Qatar or lecturing on the game. He hit the gym and believes he is four or five kilograms off his weight from his playing days. He looks leaner, even younger, certainly less world-weary – and revitalised. “I’ve not had many periods away from football in the last 40 years, so I’m hoping this year will have really recharged my batteries and recharged the enthusiasm and desire to do the job. “Words like redemption mean nothing to me. I’m just really pleased that [the Palace owners] Steve Parish, Josh Harris and David Blitzer decided I can be the man that Crystal Palace need. When the call came [from Parish] my thoughts were what a great opportunity, what a great chance, back in Croydon, back in the Premier League. “There couldn’t have been a better offer for me really: going back to my roots, at a club I’ve supported from afar, although I’ve supported other clubs when I’ve been working for them. What I’ve found in the last couple of days is how much I’ve missed the day-to-day contact with the players. I always felt I could do a good job, can still contribute, so if a position came along at the right level, I wanted to take it. This is it.” He returns to a Premier League even more money-flushed than when he had flourished with Fulham, floundered at Liverpool and excelled with West Bromwich Albion before his four-year tenure with the national side. The implications of tumbling out of the top-flight are even more disastrous, the environment even more brutal than it ever was. Palace had undertaken a month-long recruitment process over the summer as they sought a successor for Sam Allardyce, sifting through 37 applicants – Hodgson was one, and the manager of Saturday’s opponent, Mauricio Pellegrino of Southampton, another – before settling on Frank de Boer. And still the Dutchman lasted 77 days and four top-flight games in charge before Parish and the American major shareholders felt compelled to wield the axe. The team are pointless and goalless at the foot of the division, yet there has been widespread outrage at the brevity of De Boer’s reign – those who had witnessed the plod of his two home games in charge might be slightly less sympathetic – citing it as evidence as much as the lunacy of the Premier League as the board’s flawed due diligence. “I tend to see it as something which reflects the pressures on owners to keep satisfying the fans and to keep their teams in the league,” said Hodgson. “It’s something which is, quite simply, a fact of life. “Nothing has changed in the sense that football is a results-based business. That was the case many years ago. But with the amount of money in the Premier League, that side of it is exacerbated. My job is to come here, do a good job every day on that training field and make certain this team recovers the confidence it’s lost after four straight defeats. To get themselves back on the track they were on at the end of last year and the year before that. “It’s the same group of players. It might even be a slightly improved group given certain signings. So I’m confident they won’t let the fans down and I’m also confident, strangely enough, albeit I have no right to say this, that the fans will stay with us, back the team, suffer and share our plight. But they won’t abandon us.” Hodgson’s own first four games are daunting. Manchester City, Manchester United and Chelsea await after the visit of Southampton. The club’s most potent attacking player, Wilfried Zaha, remains in rehabilitation from a knee injury while the major summer signing, Mamadou Sakho, still lacks match fitness and is unlikely to feature. Hodgson and his coaches, Ray Lewington and Steven Reid, have had two full training sessions to stamp some early ideas on the set-up but, after the attempt at revolution instigated by De Boer, at least the team will be sent out comfortable with everything being asked of them. As Hodgson suggested – “It’s very difficult to impose a style if you don’t have the players who are comfortable with that style” – a level of common sense has returned. “We’ve only begun our work here. But I believe the team will stay up. Absolutely. “I’m feeling as good as I’ve ever felt. You can’t tear up your birth certificate but it’s how you feel. There were times in my 40s when I felt a lot less physically and mentally adept doing this job than I do today. “I’ve signed a two-year contract. I want to keep Palace up and develop them, along with the chairman and the owners, to make us an even better Premier League team going forward. It’s Crystal Palace, Crystal Palace, Crystal Palace from now on in.” And, he might have added, it would be nice to leave Nice behind."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"artanddesign/2017/sep/17/scythians-warriors-of-ancient-siberia-british-museum-review","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-17T07:30:35Z","webTitle":"Scythians: Warriors of Ancient Siberia review – magical riches","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/sep/17/scythians-warriors-of-ancient-siberia-british-museum-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2017/sep/17/scythians-warriors-of-ancient-siberia-british-museum-review","fields":{"headline":"Scythians: Warriors of Ancient Siberia review – magical riches","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Siberia has never enjoyed a good press. We headline it as emptiness, a place of frigid exile, inhospitable both to the body and to the imagination. One of several wonderful things about this British Museum exhibition is that it gives the lie to that void. Siberia comes to life in dramatic, sometimes breathtaking ways: in fabulous gold and soft fur, in the insistent humanity of sticks of crafted furniture and clothes and food. That this life – leathery and intimate and horse-obsessed – is preserved from two and a half thousand years ago makes it all the more magical. For most of that time the only real record of the culture of the Scythian people, nomadic tribes who herded cattle and goats on the grassy corridor of the steppe, came in the writings of Herodotus, who pitched up in his travels on the north shore of the Black Sea some time around 440BC. He observed and wrote about the rituals and habits of a rugged and resourceful people who dominated a vast area for 500 years and who would continue to do so for a century or more to come. It was not until the time of Peter the Great that those observations of Herodotus began to be verified by archaeological discovery. This exhibition, which wears its considerable scholarship lightly, begins by capturing the excitement when those first discoveries were brought to the Winter Palace in St Petersburg from southern Siberia. At first, when confronted with the solid gold belt plaques exquisitely rendered with scenes of battles between mythical and realistic animals – a dragon tearing into the flank of a horse, a jewelled vulture devouring a yak – the enlightened scholars of Peter’s court had no idea where these things came from or how old they were. The Russians considered Siberia to have been a barbarous place, and these objects overturned that idea. When they were determined to be Scythian objects, a debate opened as to whether they were products of an oriental or a Slavic – Russian – civilisation. The more pressing question for anyone looking at these pieces of gold now – bold bracelets and delicate earrings and necklaces as well as the symbolic bling of belt buckles – is who were these cattle herders who left no written record of nearly a millennia of civilisation, but who could create such ornament? Some very good answers to that question are provided by this show, which is the British Museum at its best – gathering the evidence from a mostly unknown time and place in antiquity and making it news. That task had a major stroke of historical fortune. When the graves in the Pazyryk valley in the Altai mountains were first robbed, water entered the underground burial chambers and remained permanently frozen, insulated by the mound of earth above. Wood, felt, silk, leather, human bodies and other organic matter buried in the fourth and fifth centuries BC remained intact until Russian archaeologists excavated the sites in the first half of the last century. More finds are still being made, an effort given greater urgency because of rising temperatures melting permafrost. You get graphic evidence of this fact when you meet the shellacked gaze of a Scythian warlord, his head with skin and teeth intact, dug from a 2,400-year-old grave. The man survived some wounds – his forehead bears the traces of silk sutures – but was killed with three blows from a Scythian battle axe, an example of which is cruelly preserved opposite. Also on display are sections of the man’s crumpled skin with very contemporary looking sleeves of tattoos, the animalistic myths inked with soot. The most extraordinary insight into of the lives of people like this man is then established in an array of objects defrosted from tombs. There are patterned felt textiles, including stockings in a shade of light tan, lovingly designed squirrel fur coats, appliqued with felt, a sable fur pouch and leather purse softened with use. In most displays of this antiquity you are restricted to the hard edges of bronze and pottery. These fabrics lend a more human touch, none more so than the strange false beard of real hair designed to be hooked over the ears, and the saddle bags containing a meal to take a Scythian chief through to eternity: coriander seeds, a sheep’s bone that once was a lump of mutton, and a small cloth bag containing lumps of Scythian cheese (best before 350BC). Some of these objects, mostly borrowed from the State Hermitage Museum, were made with a sense of fierce display – an eagle-topped headdress, for example, carved from wood, decorated with leather and designed to rise a foot or more above the wearer’s head. More often they exhibit a keen utility – pots and stools and sticks of furniture are made for portability, iron age picnic sets for a community always on the move. Some of this travelling was also in the mind. Herodotus described some handy apparatus, made of a small wigwam of three sticks covered in felt inside which hemp seeds were burned on red hot stones, and the smoke inhaled causing the Scythians to “howl with delight”. An example of this mini stoner’s paradise was also found among one chief’s essential grave artefacts. The Scythians were an unrooted people and they borrowed and traded from their sedentary neighbouring cultures: there are Chinese silks, sleeves of Indian cotton, wine cups with a Greek cast. What this exhibition makes clear, however, is that they also had a sophisticated and mysterious culture of their own – grave decorations of men on horseback display not only a warlike tendency, but also a sense of humour and playfulness. You might, as I did, go into this exhibition thinking of ancient Siberian history as a fairly blank canvas; you will come out with a sense of it having been coloured in. • Scythians: Warriors of Ancient Siberia is at the British Museum, London, until 14 January 2018"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"money/2017/sep/18/asking-price-house-london-fall-kensington-chelsea","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-17T23:01:53Z","webTitle":"Asking prices for London homes record biggest falls this decade","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/sep/18/asking-price-house-london-fall-kensington-chelsea","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2017/sep/18/asking-price-house-london-fall-kensington-chelsea","fields":{"headline":"Asking prices for London homes record biggest falls this decade","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Asking prices for homes in London have recorded their biggest annual fall so far this decade and have dropped on average by £18,000 in the space of just a month, the property site Rightmove said on Monday. But this headline finding masks much larger falls in some of the capital’s most expensive boroughs. The average asking price of a home in Kensington and Chelsea plummeted by more than £300,000 between August and September, and Camden was also hit hard. That suggests that a slump in the high-end central London market, described by Rightmove as a readjustment, may be gathering pace as Brexit uncertainty continues and tax changes prompt many wealthy investors to sit on their hands. Rightmove said it measured more than 98,000 asking prices, which represented around 90% of the UK market. The properties were put on sale between 13 August and 9 September. A spokesman said its updated methodology went back to 2010, and the annual fall of 3.2% for London was the largest drop so far this decade. The monthly fall in the capital is the largest since December 2016. The figures come days after the Halifax said UK house price growth had picked up last month, with a 1.1% rise in August. This surprised some observers, because other surveys have suggested that the market was running out of steam. Nationwide building society said property values had dipped slightly by 0.1% to £210,495. Rightmove said the average UK asking price for a home fell by 1.2%, or £3,660, over the past month to £310,000. This is the first fall recorded at this time of year since 2013. The website said, however, that the national average fall had been exacerbated by a 2.9% monthly drop in London, which it described as both large and unusual. Most of the rest of the country experienced smaller monthly falls or – in the case of north-east England, Yorkshire and Humberside and the east Midlands – small rises. The typical price of property coming to market in London has slipped to £610,912, down £18,358 on August’s figure of £629,270. Rightmove said the fall had pushed the annual rate for the capital well into negative territory, and that it now stood at -3.2%, the largest year-on-year decrease so far this decade. The figures disguise wide variations in the fortunes of the capital’s boroughs. The table of the biggest movers was topped by the UK’s most expensive place to buy a home, in Kensington and Chelsea. The royal borough is now a little more affordable because the typical asking price for a newly-marketed home there currently stands at £1.8m, compared with the £2.1m that a typical new seller was asking for in August. That is a reduction of £308,000 in a month. A new seller in the north London borough of Camden is asking an average of 7% or almost £75,000 less than an equivalent seller a month ago. By contrast, the typical asking price in the central borough of Southwark leapt more than 9% from £618,000 to £676,000 between August and September . Roger Collings, a branch manager at the estate agent RE/MAX specialising in Pimlico, Westminster, Mayfair and surrounding areas, said: “Since the introduction of the 3% surcharge on stamp duty paid by investors, along with the uncertainty as to how Brexit will impact London’s property market, investors have been standing on the sidelines. “We are beginning to see more and more investors venturing back into the market, but we are still a long way from the volumes we saw pre-referendum” but “there are markets outside of central London that are still buoyant with local buyers.” Mark Manning, the director of the Leeds and North Yorkshire estate agent Manning Stainton, said the region experienced “a fairly traditional summer slowdown” but outperformed its results from the same period a year ago. “There has been a 10% increase in the volume of new seller enquiries over the last three months in contrast with the same period in 2016, and a more modest 2% increase in the number of new buyer registrations, but an increase nonetheless,” he said. Brian Murphy, the head of lending at the broker firm Mortgage Advice Bureau, said the new data related to asking prices rather than completed transactions, “therefore enabling us to take a ‘temperature check’ in terms of market sentiment and behaviour”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/18/lifting-public-sector-pay-cap-tories","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-18T14:00:26Z","webTitle":"What will cost more than lifting the public sector pay cap?

Not lifting it","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Conservatives are finally backing down on the public sector pay cap – but not without a fight, and not without confusing the maths. I’m guessing the government thought our fear of numbers wouldn’t allow us to work out that inflation of 2.9% means their announcement of 1.7% and 2% respectively for prison staff and police wasn’t really a pay rise. Luckily, we’re not quite that bad at maths. Unfortunately, the Conservatives are still persuading many with the dodgy maths of their public spending cuts. Again and again we hear from ministers that the pay cap can’t be lifted as the country cannot afford to pay public sector workers more. Years of being miseducated on how the economy works – presenting the country’s debt as household debt and public spending as only a cost with no benefits for the economy – have led to widespread economic illiteracy, among politicians as well as the population. The real question should be: can we afford not to increase public sector pay? The costs of maintaining the pay cap are numerous, and the benefits of increasing public sector pay would be huge for the economy. Let’s start with costs of recruitment and retention. This is a big one. Job advertising isn’t cheap and new recruits take time to settle in. Last year, a study found there had been a 61% rise in advertising spend since 2010 in secondary schools alone, costing £56m in 2015. Shortages in the health service mean NHS Trusts are paying millions every month to agency and bank nurses to ensure there are adequate levels of staff on wards. Stress-related leave has also increased in the public sector as workers are understandably getting run down working in understaffed schools and hospital wards. This is just staff – what about the costs to our children of being in classes too big for them to maximise their learning or to a sick individual who has an operation delayed? There are also secondary costs of underinvestment in one part of a co-dependent system. An Age UK study estimated the NHS lost 2.4m bed days, costing it £669m over five years, as shortages of social care support means frail patients cannot be discharged. Once you start putting financial costs on all these outcomes, you quickly get into the billions. Putting the direct costs of the pay cap to public services aside, there is also the so-called multiplier effect to consider. This means when you give someone a pay rise, there are larger positive implications for the economy because it can stimulate further rounds of spending. For example, if there is a £2bn increase in wages for NHS workers and they spend just half of this in shops, then shopkeepers will also receive income. In turn, this increase in income will mean shopkeepers are more likely to employ more people and increase salaries themselves. The treasury would then not just receive more taxes from higher wages among NHS staff, but also the VAT on extra goods sold, and on higher income taxes from jobs created elsewhere. The multiplier effect is thought to be higher for those on low-middle incomes, as they are much more likely to spend it than save it or put it in a tax haven. According to a Unison study based on International Monetary Fund figures, every 1% increase in public sector pay would generate between £710m and £820m for the government in increased income tax. Of course, there are debates about just how big these multiplier effects are – but we must stop thinking about a pay rise as purely negative for the public purse. We all know that our public service workers are worth every penny – but these pennies go well beyond their pay packets. Public investment pays huge dividends over the longer term. For example, investing in universal childcare, paid parental leave and targeted interventions could save the UK £1.5tn in the long term by addressing the underlying causes of crime, mental health problems and drug abuse. Right now, we are barely paying for the upkeep of our public services, let alone getting them match-ready for Brexit, an ageing society, technological developments and our changing climate. It is this lack of investment now that will saddle future generations with huge costs – not the prospect of a larger national debt at a time of record low borrowing rates. Trade unions are calling for a 5% pay rise across the public sector (3.9% in the NHS) to start to claw back some of the lost income public sector workers have experienced since rogue bankers crashed the economy. This would cost around £9bn. It seems like a lot of money, but any equation of public sector pay must be considered against the cost of no investment and the value lost to society as a result. The Treasury would do well to recalculate the supposed “costs” of ending the pay cap. • Faiza Shaheen is director of the Centre for Labour and Social Studies"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/blog/2017/sep/16/sead-kolasinac-back-three-arsenal-chelsea-arsene-wenger","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-16T17:59:18Z","webTitle":"Sead Kolasinac and a back three: how Arsenal can halt Chelsea onslaught | Paul Doyle","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2017/sep/16/sead-kolasinac-back-three-arsenal-chelsea-arsene-wenger","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2017/sep/16/sead-kolasinac-back-three-arsenal-chelsea-arsene-wenger","fields":{"headline":"Sead Kolasinac and a back three: how Arsenal can halt Chelsea onslaught","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Arsenal fans will travel to Stamford Bridge on Sunday with a dram of hope, even though they know that by most measures their spirits should be low. Recent visits to Chelsea have been harrowing for the north London club, with Arsenal losing their last five matches there by a combined score of 15-2. Both their away games in the Premier League this season have brought similar ordeals, with Liverpool thrashing them 4-0 and Stoke City punishing errant finishing and flaky defending to inflict a 1-0 defeat. A strong case can be made for dismissing Arsène Wenger’s timid travellers right now as “same old Arsenal” and not even bothering to watch their inevitable defeat against Antonio Conte’s side on Sunday. But where is the joy in that? It is more entertaining to give Arsenal the benefit of the hefty doubt and instead look to the reason why they might make a contest of their trip to the champions. Those reasons are not so hard to find. For a start Arsenal have beaten Chelsea in their two most recent meetings, both at Wembley. And both wins were deserved, too, as Arsenal were the better side in May’s FA Cup final and again in last month’s Community Shield, even if the second victory was by dint of a penalty shootout. The other reason is that Arsenal have become less predictable – in terms of their formation at least. It used to be fair to criticise Wenger for playing exactly the same way against every opponent no matter what but the Frenchman has developed flexibility to the extent that Conte cannot be quite sure how Arsenal will line up. They finished last season at an encouraging clip after Wenger took inspiration from Conte’s preferred formation and switched to a three-man defence, an uncharacteristically radical shift that yielded 10 wins from their last 11 matches, including the FA Cup final. Wenger has used that pattern again this season, including in the Community Shield, but he has also reverted to a back four at times, notably in Thursday’s Europa League comeback victory against Cologne, when Arsenal, losing at the break, were transformed by the change of tactics at half-time. Wenger explained after the 3-1 win over the German team that flipping to a back four enabled Sead Kolasinac, whom the manager introduced at left‑back, to collude with Alexis Sánchez down the left wing. Both players scored as Arsenal overwhelmed the visitors. That second-half performance – and the suspicion that Wenger remains a back-four man at heart – has heightened expectations that he will start with that scheme at Stamford Bridge in the hope of forcing Chelsea’s wing-backs, Marcos Alonso and Victor Moses, to spend most of their time defending. That would be a daring ploy, banking on Arsenal to attack with enough regularity and sharpness to prevent Chelsea from establishing central dominance before pulling the visitors’ exposed back four apart. For “daring”, one could read reckless. It would be shrewder to stick with three central defenders for this match. That is the formation Arsenal used when beating Chelsea in their two most recent matches. Either way it is essential that Kolasinac starts. Personnel and attitude are more important than formation, and the free signing from Schalke has shown he has the skills and precious steel that Arsenal sorely need. The problem with Wenger’s new‑found flexibility is that it does not always seem well-founded; it can seem a touch random when it leads to players playing in positions to which others would be better suited. For instance, one of the reasons why the switch to a back four in the second half at Stoke did not work as well as it did against Cologne was that, when implementing it, the manager removed Kolasinac (who had been at centre-back) and asked Héctor Bellerín to operate as a left-back while Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain improvised on the right. Kolasinac, bizarrely omitted entirely at Anfield, must start at Chelsea either at left wing-back or left-back. Those are the roles in which he can do most damage to the opposition and provide the most security to Arsenal. Victor Moses and Eden Hazard or Pedro Rodríguez would certainly prefer to face someone less fearsome and relentless, someone more likely to crumble in the manner of same old Arsenal. • This article has been corrected.

In doing so he continued an enduring feud that was given new energy this week with the publication of Clinton’s campaign memoir, What Happened. The gif, which uses old film of Clinton stumbling as she enters a plane and complements “Trump’s amazing golf swing #CrookedHillary”, came from an account, @Fuctupmind, which on Sunday also published a gif of a kitten falling asleep. Seven hours later, the account tweeted: “What happened?” The president’s retweet drew condemnation reminiscent of the response to doctored footage he tweeted in July, which showed him attacking a man with a CNN logo for a head. Many also noted that the presidential retweet came as the White House prepared for a solemn diplomatic occasion, Trump’s first appearance at the United Nations general assembly in New York. The president has derided the UN as “just a club for people to get together, talk and have a good time”. Adam Schiff, the senior Democrat on the House intelligence committee, told ABC’s This Week: “It is distressing … to have a president that, frankly, will tweet and retweet things as juvenile as that. It doesn’t help, I think, in terms of his stature. It doesn’t help in terms of the stature of our whole country.” The retweet was part of a series of morning messages which also referred to North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, with whom the US is locked in an increasingly alarming nuclear standoff, as “Rocket Man”. Trump also retweeted his own controversial messages sent in the aftermath of an explosion on a London tube train on Friday. In an interview broadcast on Sunday, British prime minister Theresa May repeated her criticism of the tweets when she told ABC: “I don’t think it’s helpful for anyone to speculate on what is an ongoing investigation.” The home secretary, Amber Rudd, told the BBC the tweets were “pure speculation, not based on intelligence”. Clinton published her book on 2016, in which she calls Trump a “creep”, on Tuesday. Trump has since tweeted about his rival with evident delight. On Wednesday, Trump tweeted: “Crooked Hillary Clinton blames everybody (and every thing) but herself for her election loss. She lost the debates and lost her direction!” Referring to a description of his supporters used by Clinton during the campaign, he added: “The ‘deplorables’ came back to haunt Hillary. They expressed their feelings loud and clear. She spent big money but, in the end, had no game!” Clinton shot back: “If you didn’t like that book, try this one – some good lessons in here about working together to solve problems.” The former first lady, senator and secretary of state attached a photo of It Takes a Village, a picture book for children she published in 1996. “Happy to send a copy,” she wrote. While accepting ultimate “responsibility for all” her campaign’s missteps in What Happened, Clinton discusses among other factors FBI director James Comey and his conduct of the investigation into her use of a private email server; Russian meddling in the election and the Obama administration’s reluctance to react forcefully; and the influence of Bernie Sanders’s primary challenge from the left. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders accused Clinton of pushing “false narratives” and said it was “sad that after Hillary Clinton ran one of the most negative campaigns in history, and lost, and the last chapter of her public life is going to be now defined by propping up book sales with false and reckless attacks”. In an interview with NPR, Clinton said she will continue to speak out. “I’m going to keep talking and trying to raise the questions that I hope Americans will take seriously, and that I hope the press will take seriously, because we’ve got a lot of choppy water ahead of us,” she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/booksblog/2017/sep/18/tips-links-and-suggestions-what-are-you-reading-this-week","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-18T14:00:26Z","webTitle":"Tips, links and suggestions: what are you reading this week?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2017/sep/18/tips-links-and-suggestions-what-are-you-reading-this-week","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/booksblog/2017/sep/18/tips-links-and-suggestions-what-are-you-reading-this-week","fields":{"headline":"Tips, links and suggestions: what are you reading this week?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Welcome to this week’s blog, and our roundup of your comments and photos from last week. Where are the songs of spring? Think not of them... It’s autumn on Tips, Links And Suggestions and readers like Brooke Sherbrooke have been tailoring their choices accordingly: Just finished Fell by Jenn Ashworth. The Guardian did a quiet write up in June 2017 about the novel. To be honest, I was intrigued at that time, purchased it for my Kindle reader and then forgot about it. When the weather turned cooler a week ago (thank goodness for autumn), I went looking through my TBR pile for a cosy read and this was a perfect match. Ashworth is a talented writer. Autumn has also been on TheLittlestRascal’s mind: Having read Murakami’s Pinball, 1973, I now have got a severe case of book hangover. That autumn from years ago has now merged with my own, its railway stations, stray dogs, and cold rains infesting my precious sunny days. Talking of weather, fingerlakeswanderer has a report from near the eye of last week’s storm: Hi all. Typing this on my phone from where we evacuated to to hunker down for Irma. Last night was dramatic. It sounded like the house was surrounded by banshees keening and wailing. I didn’t sleep much of the night. It is daylight now. Some damage to the house, but we are safe. We arrived Friday to a house with no telly or internet, so I’ve had the chance to read and write all weekend. I read a lot of poetry, especially Kevin Young and Mary Oliver. I also brought with me the new, 900+ page Ken Follett book A Column Of Fire, the third of the Kingsbridge series. I read the whole thing. It was a cracking read and a marvellous distraction. The book begins in 1558 and goes through until the Gunpowder Plot. He has action taking place in England, Scotland, France, Spain, the Netherlands, and Hispaniola. He is focused on the wars taking place in Europe between Catholics and Protestants and brings to life how doctrinal issues divided families. Follett gets to use all his knowledge of spycraft to show how Walsingham and others spied, and the conspiracy stuff is dark and sinister. One of the best parts is that women play lots of important and heroic roles, a reminder that women had agency and power in that time period. I would really recommend this book for an immersive read. On the subject of women with agency, proust has been reading Richard Yates’s The Easter Parade: I loved Revolutionary Road and the short stories, but think this is his masterpiece. Perceptive, insightful, sad. Brilliantly written. Interesting that the main character is a liberated young woman working in advertising in the 1960s. I wonder if the Mad Men Peggy character is based on her to some extent? Elsewhere, frustratedartist, has enjoyed Golden Hill by Francis Spufford: Set in New York in the 1740s, it’s got a great atmosphere with lots of fine mock-18th century writing. It’s got a bit the feel of Tom Jones (the novel not the singer). The narrator and main character has a secret purpose, one he holds back from his readers and from all the other characters until the end of the novel. His actual secret turns out to be a bit of an anti-climax – almost inevitable after such a long build-up, and some pretty major hints along the way, but the novel is packed with other, more unexpected, twists and turns. Thoroughly enjoyable. And finally, jmschrei recommends I Never Talk About It by Quebec actors/writers Véronique Côté and Steve Gagnon: This collaborative project features 37 monologues first performed live and then gathered into a book. In creating an English edition, publisher QC Fiction invited 37 different translators (from first timers to multi-award winners) to each translate a story. At the end of each piece there is a bio of the translator and his or her thoughts about the challenges and decisions they faced in translating the work. The translators came from around the world. As someone who reads a lot of translated literature and is fascinated by the many questions raised by the process of guiding a work from one language (and culture) to another, this is a most interesting (and entertaining) read. Pushed a few buttons too—especially a couple of pieces that were transformed to a US or UK setting, replacing references as necessary. As a Canadian I felt violated as institutions like Tim Hortons Donuts or the Montreal Canadians were removed! Oh Canada! Interesting links about books and reading “Dear Britain, please take your Booker Prize home”: a view from America. Anne Enright takes on gender in literary culture (and wins.) Good news: the descendants of Hemingway’s six-toed cats got through Hurricane Irma okay. South Park just scored an epic victory against Amazon.

On the eve of the Parsons Green attack, the head of counter-terrorism policing, deputy assistant commissioner Neil Basu, rightly said there had been “a shift-change in momentum” behind the terror threat since the Westminster attacks in March. The police and security services have matched that, foiling six terrorist plots and making a record number of arrests, but the same cannot be said for the government’s counter-extremism policy. It is now more than two years since Theresa May outlined a battery of “full spectrum” measures to criminalise non-violent extremism for the first time with the aim of tackling the underlying causes of terrorist attacks. A new extremism bill was duly announced following the 2015 general election, including civil orders to ban extremist groups, restrictions on the behaviour of extremists and powers for the media regulator, Ofcom, to censor extremist content. The bill, however, never appeared. Nor did a similar measure, a counter-extremism and safeguarding bill, which was announced in the May 2016 Queen’s Speech. It emerged that behind the scenes government lawyers had found it impossible to find a “legally robust” definition of extremism that would have any chance of surviving a free speech challenge in the courts. The anti-extremism bills went through “dozens of drafts” but the problem was never resolved. May tried to revive her counter-extremism drive in the aftermath of the attacks this year in Westminster and Manchester by announcing the creation of a statutory commission to counter-extremism and promote British values. Among its tasks is to “identify extremism and advise the government on new policies, laws and other actions that might be required to tackle it”. In other words it is being asked to resolve the problem of defining an extremist, which the government have so far failed to do. Four months later, despite grand claims that it will “learn the lessons from the struggle against racism in the 20th century”, the Home Office has only just got round to advertising for a lead commissioner and has yet to clarify how a statutory commission will be set up without primary legislation. In the meantime, the home secretary, Amber Rudd, has spent the summer going to Silicon Valley to urge the US-based web giants including YouTube, Facebook and Google to do far more to take down terrorist and extremist content despite their protests that they already adopt an aggressive approach. The problems they face are ones of scale and a lack of legal clarity over who is an extremist, not a lack of willingness. The government has done little to repair the tarnished reputation of its Prevent programme aimed at those vulnerable to radicalisation. There have been repeated calls for the programme to be recast and rebranded, or even perhaps replaced as an Engage strategy that puts the affected communities in the driving seat. So far, however, all that has emerged from an internal Home Office review is a desire to expand the programme and increased its network of local community coordinators. Plans to tackle Islamist extremist prisoners in separate dedicated units have also been scaled back. A review of sharia law first announced in 2015 will finally submit its report later this year, but ministers have not been able to resist the temptation to get involved in censoring extremist content. Having been rebuffed by Britain’s major broadcasters, the Home Office now says it intends to use the new Digital Economy Act 2017 to enable Ofcom to act quickly against community radio stations and digital TV channels that breach standards on hate speech and derogatory content. In the face of the paralysis in the government’s drive against extremism, Rudd was again reduced on Sunday to announcing more money for counter-terrorism policing in the wake of the Parsons Green attack. The extra £24m is to go to the Metropolitan and Greater Manchester forces in part to help meet the costs of recent attacks. It is only a fraction of the £707m counter-terrorism policing budget in 2017/18, but it will help to meet criticism that the unfunded rise in police pay could lead to more cuts in counter-terrorism policing."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/sep/17/foster-carers-raided-counter-terrorism-police-penelope-ronald-jones-sunbury","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-17T16:25:11Z","webTitle":"'Beautiful people': the foster carers raided by counter-terrorism police","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/sep/17/foster-carers-raided-counter-terrorism-police-penelope-ronald-jones-sunbury","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/sep/17/foster-carers-raided-counter-terrorism-police-penelope-ronald-jones-sunbury","fields":{"headline":"'Beautiful people': the foster carers raided by counter-terrorism police","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Foster carers Penelope and Ronald Jones, aged 71 and 88 respectively, found themselves thrust into the national spotlight when counter-terrorism police raided their terraced home in Sunbury-on-Thames, Surrey, following the arrest of an 18-year-old at Dover on Saturday in connection with the Parsons Green bombing. The couple, who had been awarded MBEs for services to children and families in 2009, had a 18-year-old and a 22-year-old staying with them recently, according to neighbours and friends. As forensic officers continued to comb their property, and a police cordon remained in place in their street, the couple were understood to be staying with friends. It is unlikely they will be able to return home for days. Alison Griffiths, a Surrey county councillor who knows the couple, described them as “great pillars” of the community. “They do a job that not many people do,” she said. It is understood that over four decades they have provided foster care for 268 children and had taken in at least eight refugees. They had only recently returned to foster caring, according to family friend Jim Adaway, 37. “All I know is that they gave up fostering and someone got in touch with them and they started taking kids again, refugees, about a year ago,” he said. The couple, who have six children of their own, are said to be fit and healthy, although Ronald is said to use a mobility scooter. Neighbour Nicola Ryder, who lives opposite, described them as “beautiful people”, known to friends and neighbours as Penny and Ron. Serena Barber, 45, a long-term family friend, said: “Penny’s a wonderful foster mother. She takes everyone, she doesn’t turn anyone away.” The couple featured in an interview with Elmbridge Can, a community group helping refugees settle in. In the interview, Penelope Jones admitted that fostering “had its up and downs”. But added: “They’re all children, it doesn’t matter if they’re sky blue or with pink dots on – they just need to be loved.” In a BBC interview, after receiving their MBEs in December 2009, Penelope said they treated all their foster children in the same way as they treated their own six children. “We do it because we find it rewarding,” she said. She became a foster mother after working with juveniles in the prison service. The first child they fostered in 1970 was a 16-year-old boy who was always in trouble. “If I wasn’t being called out to a police station, I was patching him up in casualty,” she told the BBC. That led to other placements, with the couple taking in more children who needed a home. “We open our hearts to all the children. Anybody that comes to us we will do whatever we can do to help them with whatever they need. There must have been hundreds of children. I try to stay in touch with them. Some have been adopted. I send them birthday cards – it’s a very extended family,” she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/sep/18/uk-plans-treaty-to-remain-inside-europol-after-brexit","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-18T05:00:01Z","webTitle":"UK plans treaty to remain inside Europol after Brexit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/sep/18/uk-plans-treaty-to-remain-inside-europol-after-brexit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/sep/18/uk-plans-treaty-to-remain-inside-europol-after-brexit","fields":{"headline":"UK plans treaty to remain inside Europol after Brexit","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Proposals for a new UK-EU security treaty to “lock in” membership of Europol, the European arrest warrant and other existing joint measures to combat crime and terrorism after Brexit are to be published on Monday. The home secretary, Amber Rudd, said on Sunday that “a new legal framework” would be proposed to underpin the security treaty despite recent warnings that Britain would lose access to “critical data” if it did not accept the role of the European court of justice. The Brexit paper will outline the British government’s plan to move to a new legal basis for continued cross-border cooperation on security, law enforcement and criminal justice from outside the EU without any “operational gaps”. Rudd said that a UK-EU security treaty was not conditional on the success or otherwise of the overall Brexit talks and could go ahead whatever happened. She said that conversations with her EU counterparts “gave her a lot of encouragement” for its prospects. Six months ago, Rudd warned that Britain might leave Europol and “take our information away” if no future deal was struck on security. “A new treaty would allow us to maintain and strengthen our current level of cooperation and provide a new legal framework to do this,” said the home secretary. “It would mean we are able to respond to threats as they evolve, and would establish the way we can maintain crime-fighting – capabilities between the UK, the EU and its member states. Such a treaty would be in the interest of all parties.” The key measures to be covered by the treaty include: • the European arrest warrant which means that wanted suspects who have escaped to another European country can be quickly returned to face justice. Before it was introduced in 2004, Britain extradited fewer than 60 people a year to other EU countries. Now more than 1,000 are routinely extradited. • Schengen information system II which allows Britain to send and receive alerts on suspected criminals and terrorists. The UK connected to the SIS II database on 13 April 2015. It also covers immigration and asylum data but Britain only takes part in law enforcement aspects. • Europol and Eurojust. Britain has played a leading role in developing Europol and its director since 2009 has been British. Rob Wainwright has overseen its development overseeing databases containing tens of millions of pieces of information on criminals, offences and suspect vehicles, and it helps coordinate crime-fighting operations against drug dealers, human trafficking gangs and terrorists. Eurojust based in the Hague oversees judicial cooperation. The prospects for a security treaty however will turn on the role of the European court of justice. In July, an EU commission assessment underlined the role of the ECJ in this area saying that “compliance with fundamental rights is a key characteristic of EU security policy.”. The Conservative peer, Lord Kirkhope, who has played a crucial role in developing the European passenger name record database, raised concerns in August that Britain would lose access to “critical data” unless it accepted a role for the European court of justice. He feared that Theresa May’s ECJ red line could result in weakened security links. The Liberal Democrats’ home affairs spokesman, Ed Davey, said: “It’s good ministers have stopped threatening to use our collective security as a Brexit bargaining chip, but this proposal is deeply muddled. “Britain must be part of Europe’s top crime-fighting tools like the European arrest warrant and shared databases on criminals. But the prime minister’s refusal to support any deal where the European court of justice retains judicial oversight is damaging our chances of preserving this vital cooperation. “Theresa May must not let her insecurity in the face of Boris Johnson’s latest outburst deflect from the pressing need to keep existing EU crime-fighting measures,” he said. Yvette Cooper, chair of the Commons home affairs select committee, said the position paper hadn’t answered the crucial questions about the European Court of Justice: “If the government is sticking to the prime minister’s ‘red line’ on removing the judicial oversight of the ECJ, where are the proposals for an alternative model of dispute resolution? “What is the likelihood of getting agreement on and then establishing a new model from scratch by March 2019? And what will ministers do if that fails? As the paper makes clear it would be really dangerous to end up with operational gaps in law enforcement and justice because these issues remain unresolved,” she said. Ed Davey, Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, also voiced concerns future security co-operation: “This government has finally woken up to the fact that security cooperation with our European partners is vital. “We should welcome this as a starting point. But instead of accepting a role for the ECJ, the paper repeats Theresa May’s ridiculous red line.This level of delusion would be laughable if it wasn’t so concerning,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2017/sep/17/public-sector-employment-70-year-low-gmb-union-report","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-17T16:26:45Z","webTitle":"Public sector employment is at 70-year low, says GMB report","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/sep/17/public-sector-employment-70-year-low-gmb-union-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/sep/17/public-sector-employment-70-year-low-gmb-union-report","fields":{"headline":"Public sector employment is at 70-year low, says GMB report","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Public sector employment has fallen to a 70-year low in terms of share of the labour market, the GMB union has said, with the loss of just under a million public sector jobs since 2010. The GMB union said the share was now 16.9%, the lowest it had been since 1947, the year before the NHS was founded. The figure did not fall below 20% even during Margaret Thatcher’s premiership, it said. A new report by the union also accused the government of ignoring 55% of public sector workers not covered by a pay review body, including some local government workers and school support staff. Rehana Azam, GMB’s national secretary for public services, accused the government of “dragging us back to the dark days of the past”. “These shocking figures are a stark reminder of the scale of the catastrophe that is befalling our public services,” she said. “Any sensible opportunities for efficiencies are long gone – funding reductions are now cutting into sheer bone. “GMB’s members are performing miracles, but the vital services they deliver are being stripped back and hollowed out and denied the resources they need, and workers are being denied the fair pay rises they deserve.” The report said central government had removed an estimated £5bn from local authority budgets in order to enforce the pay cap across the whole public sector. It said that the cost of agency and temporary workers – driven by recruitment worries – had increased by £2.5bn since 2012-13, rather than the cap saving money. A Treasury spokesman said: “More people are in work than ever before as firms across the country keep expanding and hiring more people. “Since 2010, the government has taken the tough decisions needed to put our public finances on a sound footing while protecting funding for the NHS, seeing crime fall and the number of good schools increase.” The government said that for every job lost in the public sector since 2010, eight new jobs had been created in the private sector."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/sep/17/philippe-coutinho-liverpool-job-offer-barcelona-interested","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-17T21:34:34Z","webTitle":"Philippe Coutinho on Barcelona ‘job offer’: ‘sometimes you get interested’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/sep/17/philippe-coutinho-liverpool-job-offer-barcelona-interested","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/sep/17/philippe-coutinho-liverpool-job-offer-barcelona-interested","fields":{"headline":"Philippe Coutinho on Barcelona ‘job offer’: ‘sometimes you get interested’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Philippe Coutinho has claimed he has no agreement to join Barcelona next summer and is committed to the Liverpool cause this season despite being denied a move to the Catalan club. Coutinho made his first start of the campaign for Jürgen Klopp’s team on Saturday when he played 79 minutes of the 1-1 draw with Burnley. The Brazil international, given a rousing reception when he returned as a substitute against Sevilla in midweek, was the subject of three failed bids from Barcelona during the summer transfer window and submitted a transfer request in an attempt to force a move from Anfield. Liverpool refused to consider selling the 25-year-old even when Barcelona’s third offer increased to a deal worth £119m and, speaking to ESPN Brazil after the Burnley game, Coutinho discussed “a complicated month” for the first time. “What happened was a job offer and, in life, sometimes you get interested; sometimes you don’t and, in my case, everyone knows that I got interested, my family too,” the Liverpool player said. “As I have always said, it is great to receive an offer from such a great club like that. But it is also a great honour being here. Liverpool is a great club worldwide. I’m here and I will give my best as always. “It was a complicated month for me but as I have said, it is an honour to receive that offer but it is also an honour to wear this shirt, so what I can do is work hard and honour that on the field. It is all cool. I’m working hard, my thoughts are on the team’s goals, making a good season, with the national team too, doing my best to get there.” Liverpool declined to sell Luis Suárez in 2013 before, having been repaid by an outstanding campaign from the Uruguay international, allowing him to join Barcelona for £75m the following summer. When asked if he expected to follow Suárez to the Camp Nou next year, Coutinho replied: “Not that I know of.” He added: “I am in a place that I have always been given respect by everyone and I too respect everyone. I have conquered my space in four, five years and never had any problems with anyone – the fans, the board, my team-mates, the coaching staff. That has not changed. As I have said, in life, in every job you get an offer, interested or not. It is all in the past.” Klopp, meanwhile, has again insisted he has no concerns over Liverpool’s profligacy despite another trying afternoon. Liverpool had 35 shots but rarely extended Nick Pope on the goalkeeper’s first Premier League start, and required Mohamed Salah’s fine finish to cancel out Scott Arfield’s opener. “I’m not worried,” said Klopp. “I’m still a football fan but I cannot think after 25 years in the business like a football fan. I know that the mother of all goals is the opportunity, the chance. If we’re not creating chances then I would be really concerned but we are creating. We had enough chances to win. We made a few wrong decisions on the pitch, but it was a really hard game to play.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/live/2017/sep/17/real-sociedad-v-real-madrid-la-liga-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-17T20:45:59Z","webTitle":"Real Sociedad 1-3 Real Madrid: La Liga – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2017/sep/17/real-sociedad-v-real-madrid-la-liga-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2017/sep/17/real-sociedad-v-real-madrid-la-liga-live","fields":{"headline":"Real Sociedad 1-3 Real Madrid: La Liga – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Match report: Gareth Bale seals Real Madrid victory over Real Sociedad in La Liga And that’ll be us for the evening. Cheers for reading, and be excellent to each other. Good fun, that. Sociedad lose for the first time this season, and a Madrid side shorn of some key players get a victory that will encourage them enormously. Bale didn’t do a huge amount until his goal, but what a goal it was, powering through after giving his marker a five-yard start. Probably won’t be quite so many questions about his form now. Peeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep. 90 mins + 4: Ramos, with his team 3-1 up in the fourth minute of stoppage time, powers forward through the middle from centre-back, slips it wide to Bale whose cross looks to complete the one-two, but it doesn’t quite come off. 90 mins + 3: Hernandez is eventually forced off, and Nacho Fernandez comes on for the last few moments of the match. 90 mins: Hernandez is back on but holding that shoulder, and he allows some space for Vela to get in on the right side of the box and shoot...but he skews it wide. 88 mins: Bodies all over the place: Carvahal and Rodrigues collide sliding in for a challenge on the floor, looking like one of those clashes of knees that will make you feel a bit funny. A few seconds earlier Hernandez went for a header and fell awkwardly on his shoulder, and that one looks a little bit more serious... 86 mins: Sub for Madrid: Asensio is off, and Dani Ceballos comes on for the last few minutes. 84 mins: Great defending from Carvahal, who swoops in at the very last as Zurutuza is put through on goal, nipping the ball off the Sociedad man’s toes just as he was about to shoot. GOA...no, wait, it’s disallowed 83 mins: Asensio slots away a typically adroit finish, but the offside flag goes up. Asensio himself wasn’t off, but Bale was, and he blocked a defender who was trying to get back and stop the effort. Right decision. 82 mins: Vela gets down the left and crosses to the near-post, where Willian tries to turn a goal home but can only put a weak shot at goal. They’re chipping away, but it’s probably too late now. 80 mins: Vela feeds Odriozola on the right, he crosses to the back stick for Agirretxe who barrels through Carvahal and gets over the bar. The Madrid right-back is winded rather, but he’s fine to continue. 76 mins: Final change for Sociedad: Januzaj is off, and Imanol Agirretxe, the big centre-forward who missed last season with injury, is on. 76 mins: Asensio dashes behind the Sociedad defence but his cross from the left, looking for Bale in the middle, is cut out. Vasquez then breaks through on goal, but Rulli gets there just before him. 75 mins: Isco lines up a shot from about 25 yards out, but doesn’t get the dip he needs on it and it goes way over. Meanwhile, trusty old Lucas Vasquez is on for Madrid, replacing the impressive youngster Mayoral. 74 mins: Casemeiro goes down clutching his calf, limps off looking for sympathy/treatment, but should be fine to play on. 71 mins: Woof: a Sociedad corner is half-cleared, it drops to Rodrigues who gets plenty of power on a right-footed volley, but not the requisite direction and it flies wide. 69 mins: Sub for Sociedad: Xavi Prieto is off, and Juanmi - the forgotten forward of Southampton - is on. 68 mins: Free-kick to Sociedad on the right, Januzaj will swing it over. Willian is penalised for a slight nudge on Casemeiro as they go up for the header. Sociedad have a good case to be thoroughly miffed by some of the 50-50 decisions in this game. 65 mins: Careless from Bale: he thinks a ball over the top is going out for a goal-kick, but Rodrigues doesn’t give the cause up and chases it down, eventually winning a corner. Luckily for him, nothing comes of said corner. 64 mins: Booking for Willian: think it was for complaining to the referee after Casemeiro body-checked Vela. Silly all round, really. 61 mins: Brilliant stuff from the Welshman. A long pass over the top looks for Bale, who chases with Rodriguez and outstrips him before gently lifting a finish over the keeper and into the net. Brilliant stuff. We’ve barely seen him so far, but... 59 mins: Asensio picks the ball up on the left but skips and lolipops his way down a dead end. At least two teammates despair. Isco then trips Odriozola up, and Sociedad have a free-kick. 57 mins: Canales shoots from outside the area, but leans back and hoofs the thing waaaaaaaay over the bar. And that’s his last action: he’s off, and Carlos Vela is on. 55 mins: Not a surprise that Sociedad have started the season so well: they move the ball around very smartly and quickly, but Odriozola’s attempts to make something of their nice build-up play are stopped by Hernandez. 52 mins: Good stuff from Mayoral. He gets the ball on the left side of the area, fires in a low shot that is parried, and dynamic soul that he is, he’s the first to the rebound, but he can only slice it into the side-netting. Must be a tough old life as a youngster coming through at Madrid: doesn’t matter how well you play, you ain’t getting in the team when everyone’s fit, but this lad is presenting a fine case anyway. 50 mins: A Sociedad corner comes over from the left, Llorente has a free-ish header about 12 yards from goal but Navas holds on, even if his feet were behind his line. 48 mins: Januzaj dinks over a cross from the left, and Sociedad should have a penalty: Xavi Prieto, playing his billionth game for the club after making his debut in 1947, goes for the cross at the back stick but is almost suplexed to the floor by Hernandez. For reasons best known to himself, the referee says no penalty. 46 mins: And we’re away. Asensio crosses from the left but Rulli gathers with relative ease. We’re back out for the second-half. No changes for either side. Here’s a half-time activity: why not order the excellent Portrait Of An Icon, by the excellent Daniel Storey, reigning Football Supporters’ Federation writer of the year. It’s a collection of essays on the most important and influential figures in football history - including, for topical reasons, Zinedine Zidane - it’s got a selection of fine illustrations, and if that’s not enough to convince you, money from the sale of each book goes to the Sir Bobby Robson Foundation. Get stuck in. That’s half-time, and the Sociedad players are chewing in the ear of the referee as they go off. Getting spicy at the Anoeta. Good game this, though: Madrid probably do deserve the lead, but Sociedad have shows some gumption and a few flashes of decent play, notably from the ultimately very unfortunate Rodrigues down the left. For Madrid, Hernandez down their own left flank has been excellent, and young striker Mayoral has scored one and forced the other, which is a decent effort for just his second league start. Peeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep. 45 mins + 1: Januzaj and Ramos go in for a challenge, there’s a small tangle of legs but the former United man is penalised. He’s then doubly-penalised, as he gets a booking for his lengthy complaints. 44 mins: Two shots on goal from a ways out: firstly Modric shoots from the left side, which Rulli pushes away despite it going a yard or so wide, then it breaks to Asensio who has his own effort, but that goes way wide. 43 mins: Hernandez pulls Illaramendi back, but no foul is given for some reason. The ball breaks to Asensio, who is given plenty of space outside the box by Sociedad defenders who clearly like having goals scored against them and feeling bad about life, but this time the shot scoots wide. 41 mins: Booking for Illaramendi, for a broadly pointless cynical pull on Isco’s shirt. I say pointless: Isco was inside his own half. Heading forwards, but in his own half. Illara now has to deal with Modric and Isco on a booking for the rest of the game. 39 mins: Ramos finds himself in attack during open play again, for some reason, but he can’t properly get to a Hernandez cross. 36 mins: Well. Quite a minute. Sociedad nearly take the lead in identical circumstances to their first goal, with Rodrigues volleying a cross to the back post into the ground, but this time it bounces up and hits the bar. Madrid then counter at quite some pace, through Mayoral who muscles out Llorente, which the Sociedad players claim was a foul but it was merely strong play from the young striker. Meanwhile Rodrigues desperately chases the length of the pitch to help defend, Mayoral crosses from the right side of the box but the Sociedad man can only get a toe on the ball and slide it into the net. O, cruel fate Kevin Rodrigues. 34 mins: Sociedad keeper Rulli makes a minor hash of two crosses, the second of which results in a corner. That corner is half-dealt with, but Isco picks it up, feeds Asensio down the left who clips it to the back post. Casemeiro is there to head through a thicket of bodies, and Rulli has to make a decent save: it was almost straight at him, but he was unsighted. 32 mins: Actually it was a cameraman: he’s taken off on the stretcher cart thing they use for injured players, with his leg in a brace. Apparently some of the fans in that temporary stand rushed forwards when Sociedad scored and he got caught in the rush. Hopefully he’s OK. The game continues. 30 mins: The game is being held up for a few minutes. Not really sure what’s happened, other than a fan appears to have been either injured or taken ill in that temporary stand behind the Sociedad goal. 28 mins: The full-backs combine: right-back Odriozola scampers down the flank, puts over a cross where left-back Rodrigues powers in from the other flank, volleys first-time with not a huge amount of power, but it slips through Navas’s fingers and trickles into the net. They’ve barely been in the game, but now they’re level. Well if the Madrid goal was out of nothing, that was really out of nothing. 27 mins: Oh no... 26 mins: The corner comes to nothing. Which reads like a disproportionately bleak sentence. Sorry. I know it’s a Sunday evening and many of you will be gripped by The Fear. Will try to keep it light forthwith. 25 mins: Bale’s been quiet. Largely playing from the right, he tries to cut across the box and work a bit of space for a shot, but he can’t quite manage it. The ball does eventually go out for a Madrid corner, though. 22 mins: Brilliant ball down the right by Carvahal to Asensio, but his low right-footed cross is cut out. 19 mins: Sergio Ramos finds himself in the Sociedad box, he controls a ball into the box on his thigh, flicks it up as if he’s going to try that overhead kick again but he’s hauled down, forcing him to lay it off to the oncoming Mayoral, who doesn’t hit the volley entirely cleanly, but he was only seven or eight yards out, so it goes in anyway. Madrid lead. And from very little, they’re ahead. 18 mins: Sociedad win a corner from the right, it’s half-cleared to the edge of the box then makes its way out to Willian on the left side of the box, but he sort of hits his shot into the ground and it bounces/scuffs to Navas, who claims it easily. 16 mins: There’s Hernandez again, brilliantly controlling a high pass out to the left, muscling his way past Rodrigues and cutting back to Asensio. A goal looks on, but Asensio’s shot is blocked. Madrid haven’t missed Marcelo so far, which will tell you all you need to know about Hernandez’s performance. 13 mins: Theo Hernandez drives from left-back into the Sociedad area, he tumbles as he tries to break between Canales and Illaramendi, but the Former Madrid Sandwich is not deemed to have taken him down, so no penalty. 11 mins: Madrid’s away kit is nice. Lovely and clean, nice shade of a turqoisey blue for the trim, and manages to avoid the frequent problem of a black football kit looking like something from the Sports Direct bargain bin. As an aside, nothing much is happening in the game so far. 8 mins: Modric plays one of those exquisitely perfect passes down the right channel that he’s probably played at least five million times in his career, but Carvahal wastes his work of art by pulling the cross back behind the waiting attackers in the middle. 6 mins: Isco tries to loop a cross over from the left, but it loops too far and goes into that temp stand. It remains weird. Sociedad advance to their attacking third for the first time, but nothing comes of it. 4 mins: Nothing much to report in the game so far, by the way. Madrid had most of the ball, no chances to speak of. 3 mins: There’s a weird mini temporary stand thing on the running track in front of the stands but just behind the goal Madrid are attacking in the first half. About seven or eight rows high, it sort of feels like one of those Olympic hockey games or something where they play in venues not usually used for that sport. 1 min: We’re away. Sociedad kick-off, going right to left. For those of you watching in black and white, they’re in blue and white striped shirts, white shorts and white stockings, Madrid are in all black with light blue trim. Players are in the tunnel. Football is imminent. Beck’s new one is good. Have a listen before the game starts. We’ll get this set out from the start: throughout this minute-by-minute Real Sociedad will be referred to as ‘Sociedad’, Real Madrid will be referred to as ‘Madrid’. In order to best avoid confusion. Thanks. Did you know that Real Madrid, back in 1962, travelled to then-Third Division Crystal Palace to help them launch their floodlights? What an altruistic gesture. Well, sort of: they did it for £10,000, in the days when the word transfer record was £150,000. Here’s what the Guardian had to say about it, anyway: With no Ronaldo and no Benzema, attention will be paid to Gareth Bale, who hasn’t exactly shown his best form so far this term. By which we mean the Real fans gave him a big booing recently. Zinny Zidane wants a little more from the Welshman, for sure. He said: Lately the questions are all about Gareth, but each day he feels better. He had four months out of the team, and to return to his best level he will need four more months at least. We must give him time, and we are happy with him. The price puts you up there, you cannot do anything about that, it happened to me when I found it tough in my first months after I came here. “If Gareth scores twice tomorrow, everyone will be happy. I hope he does and we change what people are thinking about Gareth. We want more from him on the pitch, he does too, but he will be very good very soon, for sure. “Gareth will play his own role. We must not think that Gareth must step up without Karim and Cristiano. We have many players who can make the difference, each day it is someone else. The pressure does not affect him.” Real Sociedad Rulli; Llorente, Aritz, Odriozola, Rodrigues; Zurutuza, Illaramendi, Xavi Prieto; Januzaj, Canales, Willian. Subs: Ramirez, Zubeldia, Juanmi, Agirretxe, Vela, Pardo, Del la Bella. Real Madrid Navas; Carvahal, Ramos, Varane, Hernandez; Modric, Casemeiro; Isco; Mayoral, Bale, Asensio. Subs: Casilla, Nacho, Vasquez, Llorente, Achraf, Ceballos, Franchu. Crisis! Times are hard at Real Madrid. Sure, they’ve won the Champions League for the last two seasons, are managed by a club legend, have one of the greatest players of all time in their ranks and his potential successor warming up very nicely too...but they have drawn two games this season. We jest, but this could be a sticky one for Zizou and the boys. Cristiano Ronaldo is serving the last game of his ban for wrasslin’ with the ref in the Super Cup, plus Marcelo, Mateo Kovacic, Toni Kroos and Karim Benzema are also missing. Marco Asensio is back, so it’s not all gloomy, but they’re also facing a side in rare form. Real Sociedad have three wins from three in the league, and sashayed to victory in the Europa League this week too, scoring 14 goals in those four games. “It’s really positive that we are all convinced we can win tomorrow,” said manager Eusebio, showing the sort of confidence you very much need when facing Real, even without their top dogs. Most of these type of games turn out to be fairly sleepy, routine victories for the big dogs of La Liga, but this one might actually be a contest. Stay tuned. Kick-off: 19.45 BST. Nick will be here presently."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/oct/02/julie-bishop-at-odds-with-donald-trump-on-north-korea-diplomacy","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-02T07:46:52Z","webTitle":"Julie Bishop at odds with Donald Trump on North Korea diplomacy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/02/julie-bishop-at-odds-with-donald-trump-on-north-korea-diplomacy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/oct/02/julie-bishop-at-odds-with-donald-trump-on-north-korea-diplomacy","fields":{"headline":"Julie Bishop at odds with Donald Trump on North Korea diplomacy","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The foreign affairs minister, Julie Bishop, appears to have rejected Donald Trump’s school of diplomacy, insisting the world should keep trying to reach North Korea, despite the US president publicly claiming it is a waste of time. Trump tweeted that “being nice to Rocket man hasn’t worked in 25 years, why would it work now”, adding “Clinton failed, Bush failed and Obama failed. I won’t fail”, in an apparent reference to the Kim dynasty, which began with Kim Il-sung. The US president has taken to calling Kim Jong-un, the current ruler of the rogue state, “rocket man” and announced he had told his secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, he was “wasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man” over Twitter. “Save your energy Rex, we’ll do what has to be done!” he wrote overnight. However, Bishop, speaking from Perth on Monday, said she believed Tillerson was “seeking to find a resolution to the current crisis on the Korean peninsula”. She also praised the US for helping to convince China to “play a much more active role”. “I think that is in response to the president’s focus on North Korea as being an issue that the region must try solve,” she said. Bishop said Australia had an interest in bringing about a peaceful resolution to the crisis, which escalated when Pyongyang authorised the firing of missiles over Japan. It has also stepped up its nuclear advancements and so far has refused to heed calls to put a halt to its program, despite a tightening of economic sanctions on the rogue state. Australia has been in support of the unanimous security council resolutions, while also calling on China to use more of its influence. “Three out of our four major trading partners are in north Asia, any further nuclear tests that threaten the security of the region, of course, would be against our interests, let alone those of the countries in the region,” Bishop said. Trump and Kim have been locked in an escalating war of words, with Trump threatening to “totally destroy North Korea”, if it did not cease its weapons program, while North Korea later accused Trump of a “declaration of war”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"crosswords/quick/14801","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-13T23:00:45Z","webTitle":"Quick crossword No 14,801","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/quick/14801","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/quick/14801","fields":{"headline":"Quick crossword No 14,801","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"us-news/live/2017/oct/02/las-vegas-two-dead-in-mandalay-bay-casino-shooting-latest-updates","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-03T14:14:28Z","webTitle":"Names of Las Vegas victims emerge as police reveal gun stockpile – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2017/oct/02/las-vegas-two-dead-in-mandalay-bay-casino-shooting-latest-updates","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/live/2017/oct/02/las-vegas-two-dead-in-mandalay-bay-casino-shooting-latest-updates","fields":{"headline":"Names of Las Vegas victims emerge as police reveal gun stockpile – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"We are wrapping up this blog now. Thanks for reading. Coverage continues in our new blog: The US is at a defining moment on guns, argues Shannon Watts founder of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America. In an opinion piece for the Guardian she asks: “Do we want to keep experiencing these horrific shooting tragedies because the gun lobby has convinced Congress that we should allow guns for anyone, anywhere, any time – no questions asked? Or will we demand safety in our daily lives – at church, school, concerts and movie theaters?” As we grieve the horrific tragedy in Las Vegas, we must start talking openly and honestly about how to solve our nation’s gun violence crisis. For Congress, that means demanding they reject National Rifle Association leaders’ radical and deadly agenda. In Nevada, that means elected officials enforcing the law their constituents enacted last November. Doing what we’ve been doing for decades – essentially letting the gun lobby write our country’s gun laws – has led to America having the highest rate of gun homicides of any developed nation. Clearly it’s time to do exactly the opposite of what gun lobbyists have instructed us to do: use our voices and votes to save lives. We can’t be silent anymore. Broadcasters in Canada have confirmed the identity of a third Canadian killed in the attack as Calla Medig, of Jasper Alberta. “My heart is numb knowing such a tragedy struck our small community,” Tessa Mac of Jasper said in a Faceook post. “Heaven is an even brighter place now that they have you Calla.” CBC spoke to Las Vegas bartender, Heather Gooze, who spent five hours by the side of Canadian Jordan McIldoon before he died from his gunshot wounds. She used his phone to break the news to his girlfriend and speak to his parents. “I couldn’t just leave him by himself,” she said. Jessica Klymchuk of Valleyview, Alberta was also killed in the attack. At least 59 people have been killed and 527 injured in the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history. The victims so far identified included an off-duty Las Vegas policeman, a San Diego lawyer, and three Canadians. Police have named Stephen Paddock, a 64-year-old retired accountant from Mesquite, Nevada, as the gunman. Police found an arsenal of 42 firearms, explosives and thousands of ammunition rounds in both his Las Vegas hotel room and Mesquite home. Experts believe an accessory known as a bump-stock was probably used in the attack. It modifies a semi-automatic weapon to fire at an automatic rate. There is still no known motive behind the attack, or any known links between Paddock and other organisations. The suspect’s girlfriend was named as a person of interest, but police said he acted alone and that authorities would interview the woman after she returned from a trip to Tokyo. Survivors of previous mass shootings and late night chat show hosts have expressed outrage at the inability of US politicians to control guns and stand up to the powerful National Rifle Association. Theresa May said the UK could not understand US gun laws. Donald Trump has deferred questions about gun control saying “We’ll be talking about gun laws as time goes by.” Speaking to reporters he described Paddock as “very sick” and “demented”. Jason Aldean, the country music singer who was performing at the time of the attack, says it highlighted a “scary” change in the US and the world. In a new post on Instagram he said: “Something has changed in this country and in this world lately that is scary to see.” Hoaxes and fake news spread rapidly online, in some cases with boosts from Facebook and Google algorithms. Last November, Nevada voters narrowly approved a new gun control law that would have required private sellers to conduct the same criminal background check on buyers that licensed gun dealers already use. Closing the loophole was one of the lone bright spots for gun control advocates in an election that put the National Rifle Association’s chosen candidate, Donald Trump, in the White House. But Nevada’s new gun law has never been enforced. Days before it was slated to go into effect, the state’s Republican attorney general released a legal opinion concluding that citizens were “excused from compliance”, calling the new law unenforceable ... Enforcing Nevada’s new background check law may not have made any difference to how easily the perpetrator of Sunday’s attack on a country music concert was able to stockpile dozens of guns. Law enforcement officials have said Stephen Paddock had no serious criminal record, which would likely mean that a background check would not have flagged him as unfit to purchase a gun. At least one gun store in Mesquite, Nevada, where Paddock lived, confirmed that it had sold him several guns legally, and that he had passed a background check. But Nevada’s new law, if it had been enforced, might have provided another paper trail to help law enforcement track down the sources of some of Paddock’s other guns. Donald Trump deferred questions about gun laws as he headed for a trip to Puerto Rico. Asked about the issue he told reporters: “We’ll be talking about gun laws as time goes by.” Pressed on the matter before boarding a helicopter, Trump added: “We’ll deal with that later”. Asked if the shooting was an act of domestic terrorism, Trump said: “He was a sick man, a demented a man. A lot of problems, I guess, and we’re looking into him very very seriously. But we are dealing with a very very sick individual.” Stephen Paddock’s home town of Mesquite, Nevada is a place that caters to firearms enthusiasts. New guns can be bought at the local Walmart superstore, and there are a wide array of secondhand weapons on sale at a nearby pawn shop. If residents want to target-shoot in the desert, they need only drive about 10 minutes away, down a dirt track across the Arizona border, and visit the Smoking Gun Club range. Still, Mesquite, which is dotted with casinos, golf courses and RVs, appears to be more of a haven for gambling-obsessed retirees than gun fanatics. While the streets were largely empty Monday, casinos were packed full of retirees playing slot machines. Paddock and a woman identified as his girlfriend, Marilou Danley, 62, lived in Sun City, an exclusive community for retirees, where some residents zip around the quiet, palm-tree-studded streets on golf carts. The house is in a prime spot in the community: high on a plateau, it has vistas overlooking the city and a neat, well-tended front-yard filled with cactuses and desert bushes. Police were seen searching the home on Monday. “This is a 55-and-over community,” said Tom Jennings, a 71-year-old neighbor who lives in Prominence Village, the name the subdistrict where Paddock lived. “People go to bed here at 8pm.” Jennings said he had never interacted with Paddock but he was known in the neighborhood as “a very normal, everyday, guy”. “But isn’t that the way it always is?” he said. “These guys seem normal and then you wake up one morning and ... this.” Jason Aldean, the country music singer who was performing at the time of the attack, says the mass shooting highlighted a “scary” change in the US and the world. In a new post on Instagram he called for unity in response to the attack. Over the last 24 hrs I have gone through lots of emotions. Scared, Anger, Heartache, Compassion and many others. I truly don’t understand why a person would want to take the life of another. Something has changed in this country and in this world lately that is scary to see. This world is becoming the kind of place I am afraid to raise my children in. At the end of the day we aren’t Democrats or Republicans, Whites or Blacks, Men or Women. We are all humans and we are all Americans and its time to start acting like it and stand together as ONE! That is the only way we will ever get this country to be better than it has ever been, but we have a long way to go and we have to start now. My heart aches for the Victims and their families of this senseless act. I am so sorry for the hurt and pain everyone is feeling right now and there are no words I can say to to take that pain away. Just know you all are in my heart and my prayers as we all go through this together. Time to come together and stop the hate! Donald Trump has tweeted about his pride in the US in his latest update since the mass shooting. The president didn’t mention Las Vegas but his message appears to continue a theme from his White House remarks on Monday when he said: “In moments of tragedy and horror Americans come together as one. It always has.” He also described the shooting as “an act of pure evil”. Trump is due to visit Las Vegas on Wednesday after a trip to hurricane-hit Puerto Rico on Tuesday. The Economist has a grim graph showing how the Las Vegas mass shooting is the worst in modern US history. Jennifer Irvine, a San Diego lawyer who was attending the country music festival, has been named as one of the victims. Her publicist and friends confirmed she was one of at least 59 people killed by Paddock. Jay Jones, Irvine’s publicist told NBC, that Irvine was a smart, charming and driven person. Writing on Facebook, her colleague Thomas Slattery wrote: My good friend, colleague, and business partner Jennifer Irvine was killed by a madman at the festival in Las Vegas. A tragic loss of a kind, generous, and beautiful lady. She will be greatly missed. At least 17 other victims have also been identified. At least 59 people have been killed and 527 injured in the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history. Police have named Stephen Paddock, a 64-year-old from Mesquite, Nevada, as the gunman. Police found an arsenal of 42 firearms, explosives and thousands of ammunition rounds in both his Las Vegas hotel room and Mesquite home. Experts believe an accessory known as a bump-stock was probably used in the attack. It modifies a semi-automatic weapon to fire at an automatic rate. There is still no known motive behind the attack, or any known links between Paddock and other organisations. The suspect’s girlfriend was named as a person of interest, but police said he acted alone and that authorities would interview the woman after she returned from a trip to Tokyo. President Donald Trump said he would visit Las Vegas on Wednesday and called the shooting “an act of pure evil”. Late night chat show hosts in the US have expressed outrage at the inability of US politicians to control guns and stand up to the powerful National Rifle Association. Theresa May said the UK could not understand US gun laws. Hoaxes and fake news spread rapidly online, in some cases with boosts from Facebook and Google algorithms. Murrell Sailers gave a vivid description of trying to shelter from the shots. Speaking to AP, he said: “You could just hear the rounds almost like creeping up on you. Doosh, doosh, doosh. It feels like hunting you down.” Theresa May has expressed incredulity about US gun laws. Speaking to LBC radio she said: “I think we can’t understand it because of course we have a different approach to guns. We have very strong gun laws here, and we tightened the gun laws initially after Dunblane because people saw the atrocity which took place there and we took action as a government. “But of course America has a different approach to guns. It’s up to them to see what they will do now, but I think most people in the UK will say ‘If you look at what’s happened here, surely they will want to do something’.” Asked whether she was aware of any Britons killed or injured in the shooting, she said: “At the moment, I don’t believe there were any British casualties, but there were certainly British people in the area who will have witnessed what was absolutely an appalling attack, completely senseless, random attack, by an individual who I understand had quite an arsenal of weapons in the hotel room.” The former Donald Trump adviser Sebastian Gorka has rounded on Hillary Clinton after she called for more gun controls in the wake of the attack. The former Democratic presidential candidate urged politicians to stand up to the powerful National Rifle Association, which is currently lobbying Congress to support measures to allow gun owners to use silencers. Gorka accused Clinton of trying to politicise the attack. Gorka lost his job as a deputy assistant to Trump on national security in August. Mass shootings in the US have become a national sickness, requiring a national cure, writes Richard Wolffe in an opinion piece for the Guardian. We can’t pray it away. It’s a public health crisis that kills more Americans than HIV, Parkinson’s disease and hypertension. But in spite of repeated medical calls for more studies, we’re not going to admit that because Congress has blocked such research by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for two decades. In truth, this is no time for silence. We don’t stop talking about air safety after a passenger jet goes down. We don’t stop talking about terrorism after another Isis attack. Gun violence is not an act of nature: it’s not an unpredictable earthquake or unexpectedly severe hurricane. The shooting in Las Vegas dominates newspaper front pages across the world. The Las Vegas Review-Journal has tweeted a preview of Tuesday’s front page. Monday’s papers in the city were going to press as news of the shooting was unfolding. Trevor Noah, the South African host of the popular Daily Show, has mocked America’s unwillingness to discuss gun control in the wake of the shooting. He pointed out that in his two years of presenting the show there have been 20 mass shootings and every time politicians have insisted this is not the time to talk about gun laws. He said the country appeared to be keener to blame hotel security than the ready availability of weapons. “We live in a world where people will put a gun before your lives,” Noah said. Two of the survivors of the Las Vegas mass shooting, have defended US gun laws. Caren Mansholt told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that she crouched down as low as possible as multiple rounds of bullets were fired into the crowd from a hotel room where 23 guns were found. She said such attacks would not be prevented by tighter gun laws. “I do believe there is a time and a place for gun ownership. I believe that we have the right to protect ourselves as needed,” she said. Rusty Dees, who was with Mansholt at the time, said: “The biggest problem for me and for many was that we didn’t hear anybody returning fire. I’m very concerned that we had no one outside to protect us. Unfortunately for me being unarmed and unable to do a whole lot decided it was time to get out of there.” Echoing an argument put forward by the former Fox News broadcaster Bill O’Reilly, Dees added: “It’s a tragic cost of freedom, that people can do bad things. If you can find a gun law that would prevent this from happening I could sign up today, but I am proud of our country’s second amendment rights and I’m glad we are allowed to defend ourselves.” Theresa May has paid tribute to off-duty British troops who helped in the aftermath of the attack. Soldiers from the 1st Queen’s Dragoon Guards were taking time off in the resort after training at the Fort Irwin US army base in California when the attack occurred, according to the Daily Mirror. A source told the paper: Due to their experience, the guys who heard the noise knew instantly it was gunfire. Their training immediately kicked in and they rushed to the festival to help. All soldiers in the cavalry are given medical training designed to preserve life on the battlefield. “The injuries they were seeing were the ones they are well versed in treating. Speaking to Sky News, the prime minister said: “I understand there were some British troops nearby who went in and helped people who were affected by this. I would like to thank them for what they did.” May said the attack raised a number of questions. “We have also experienced a number of lone-wolf attacks here in the UK. This is what makes the job of the security services and of our police so difficult.” But she stopped short of backing calls for a change to US gun laws. Speaking to ITV’s Good Morning Britain she is reported as saying: “I think it’s up to America what gun laws they put in place”. At least 59 people have been killed and 527 injured in the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history. Police have named Stephen Paddock, a 64-year-old from Mesquite, Nevada, as the gunman. Police found a huge arsenal of 42 firearms, explosives and ammunition in both his Las Vegas hotel room and Mesquite home. Experts believe an accessory known as a bump-stock was probably used in the attack. It modifies a semi-automatic weapon to fire at an automatic rate. There is still no known motive behind the attack, or any known links between Paddock and other organisations. The suspect’s girlfriend was named as a person of interest, but police said he acted alone and that authorities would interview the woman after she returned from a trip to Tokyo. President Donald Trump said he would visit Las Vegas on Wednesday and called the shooting “an act of pure evil”. Hoaxes and fake news spread rapidly online, in some cases with boosts from Facebook and Google algorithms. Jimmy Kimmel: ‘They should be praying for God to forgive them for letting the gun lobby run this country’ Jimmy Kimmel, who teared up several times during his opening monologue, has delivered an impassioned speech on the need for gun law reform. “Las Vegas happens to be my home town and [Bandleader] Cleto’s hometown and Cleto senior’s home town,” the host said, holding back tears. “This morning we have children without parents and fathers without sons, mothers without daughters ... I don’t know why our so-called leaders continue to allow this to happen. Or, better question, why do we continue to let them allow it to happen?” In a speech that touched on previous massacres in Orlando, Newtown and San Bernadino, Kimmel showed his audience pictures of 56 senators, including John McCain and Marco Rubio, who voted not to close a loophole that allowed people to buy guns without a background check from gun shows or online. “A number of other lawmakers who won’t do anything about this because the NRA has their balls in a money clip, also sent their thoughts and their prayers today, which is good. They should be praying. They should be praying for God to forgive them for letting the gun lobby run this country, because it’s so crazy. “In 1980 we had a big fire at the MGM in Las Vegas. It was horrible, 85 people died, you could see the fire. I was 13 years old, I’ll never forget it. A man jumped out the window. “Then a few months later there was another fire at the Hilton and five people died. So you know what they did? They changed the laws. “I want this to be a comedy show,” he said. “I hate talking about stuff like this. I just want to laugh about things every night, but that, it seems to be becoming increasingly difficult lately. It feels like someone has opened a window into hell.” Associated Press are reporting that an accessory known as a bump-stock was discovered in Paddock’s Las Vegas hotel room, which may have enabled him to fire into the crowd at near-automatic levels. AP are citing two officials on the investigation who spoke on the condition of anonymity. They said two bump-stocks were discovered in Paddock’s room, but were still investigating whether they were actually used in the attack. The accessory works by using a gun’s own recoil to bump against the user’s trigger finger – enabling an increased rate of fire. With a bump-stock, someone can get around restrictions on automatic weapons by firing a semi-automatic weapon at nearly an automatic rate. Previously, the Guardian’s Lois Beckett spoke to firearms expert Massad Ayoob who speculated that a bump-stock had been involved in the shooting. While automatic weapons are heavily regulated, semi-automatic guns are widely available and bump-stocks are perfectly legal to buy. The website of Bump Fire Systems advertised the device for $99.99, saying it permitted “simulated full-auto firing” that was “absolutely legal”. Here is the full video of the 7pm police press briefing from earlier today. Police revised the total number of guns found, said that there was no continuing threat to Las Vegas, and said there was no known motive at this time. Hoax watch Time for a recap of some of the hoaxes, false reports and rumours that may still be floating around. This piece from Buzzfeed rounds up some of the deliberate misinformation being put out there on Twitter and Facebook. It includes fake reports that the suspected gunman was “anti-Trump”, Muslim or an anti-facist – spread by far-right troll accounts – as well as false photos of victims and missing people. A rumour that Marilou Danley – Stephen Paddock’s girlfriend who was initially identified as a person of interest by police – “warned” people of the attack is also false. In a press conference earlier, Assistant Sheriff Todd Fasulo also debunked a rumour that there were multiple shooters. The sheriff’s department has been very adamant that they have no good information about Paddock’s motives at this time. Finally, this piece from Sam Levin shows how the flow of misinformation, especially in the early hours of the incident, spread on Google and Facebook. Candlelight vigils are taking place across the state tonight. Students and staff at the University of Nevada have gathered to support victims of the mass shooting, while religious leaders and the Las Vegas mayor, Carolyn Goodman, spoke at an evening mourning ceremony outside city hall. The Las Vegas strip has also gone dark out of respect for the victims. The GoFundMe for shooting victims has just hit $2.5m. Set up by county commissioner Steve Sisolak, it’s been identified by local authorities as the best way for the public to donate to those affected, after blood banks announced they had enough to last a few days. At the press briefing an hour ago, the fund was on $2.3m, with Sisolak revealing one individual donation hit $400,000. Organisers have now set a new target of $3m. Here’s the latest wrap-up from the Guardian’s Lauren Gambino, with more detail on the growing stockpile of weapons, accessories and explosives, including ammonium nitrate, authorities continue to discover in the home and hotel room of Stephen Paddock. Authorities found 23 guns, including a handgun, in the hotel room of the gunman. At least some were equipped with scopes, devices that help the shooter identify targets at a range, police said. Read the full article here: Mesquite: “People go to bed here at 8pm” From the Guardian’s Paul Lewis, on the ground in Nevada, here’s a look at the town of Mesquite, where police discovered 19 firearms in Paddock’s home. A place for “gamblers and gun lovers”: Mesquite is a place that caters to firearms enthusiasts. New guns can be bought at the local Walmart superstore, and there are a wide array of secondhand weapons on sale at a nearby pawn shop. If residents want to target-shoot in the desert, they need only drive about 10 minutes away, down a dirt track across the Arizona border, and visit the Smoking Gun Club range. Paddock lived in Sun City, an exclusive community for retirees, where some residents zip around the quiet, palm-tree-studded streets on golf carts. “This is a 55-and-over community,” said Tom Jennings, a 71-year-old neighbor. “People go to bed here at 8pm.” Read the piece here: The Guardian’s Tokyo correspondent Justin McCurry has this from Japan: Japan’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, has expressed his “shock and outrage” over the shooting in a message to Donald Trump. “I am immensely shocked and utterly outraged to learn about the shooting incident in Las Vegas which claimed the lives of a number of innocent civilians and is said to be possibly the worst incident in the US history. “I wish to convey my sincerest condolences to all the victims and their families and hope that those who were injured will recover as soon as possible. “We cannot tolerate such indiscriminate and massive shooting incident for any reason and I resolutely condemn it. Japan expresses its sincere solidarity with the Government of the United States and the people of the United States as they try to overcome this difficult time.” Former Fox News presenter Bill O’Reilly has called the Las Vegas shooting “the price of freedom” in a post on his personal website arguing against stricter gun control laws. “The murderer had a number of deadly weapons in his room and you can count on the gun control debate to ramp up,” he said. “But ... I can tell you that government restrictions will not stop psychopaths from harming people. “This is the price of freedom,” he continued. “Violent nuts are allowed to roam free until they do damage, no matter how threatening they are.” “There was only one shooter” Fasulo says blood donations are at capacity and those looking to donate should wait until “at least tomorrow afternoon or even the next day”. Similarly, it’s difficult to distribute the number of food donations they have received. He says the best way to contribute at the moment is to donate to the official GoFundMe, set up by Steve Sisolak, the Clark County commissioner, which has now raised $2.2m over 30,000 donations. He also opened his briefing by dispelling rumours that there were multiple shooters. “We are aware of the rumours that there was more assailant,” he said. “There is no evidence or information to support that theory. We believe there was only one shooter and that was Stephen Paddock”. He said the death toll has not changed since the last update. Assistant Sheriff Todd Fasulo has provided the final planned press briefing for tonight. He’s updated the number of guns found in Paddock’s various homes and rooms across Nevada to 42 firearms, as well as a stock of explosives and thousands of rounds of ammo. The latest confirmed figure is 23 guns in his hotel room in the Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas, and 19 in his home in Mesquite. “Those conversion kits are out there in society” Here’s Thomas Ahern, a former agent of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, on the gunman’s potential use of an automatic , or converted near-automatic weapon, which he described as a “weapon of war”. Earlier reports, from firearms expert Massad Ayoob, raised the possibility that Paddock had fitted his gun with a special device to fire at a rate “faster than almost any human being is able to pull a trigger”. Ahoob said he may have fitted a semi-automatic gun with a “Hellfire or a bump-fire device”, which are legal to obtain. Speaking to Associated Press, Ahern then talked through how this process of conversion may have worked: “There are ways that a semi-automatic can be converted to a fully automatic rifle and fire like a machine gun. That’s through a mechanism called an auto sear. In this conversion kit is a metal piece that is dropped into the trigger mechanism of the gun that converts the gun from firing semi-automatic to fully automatic. Those conversion kits are out there in society.” The Guardian’s New Zealand correspondent Eleanor Ainge Roy has this on Prime Minister Bill English’s response to the mass shooting: The New Zealand Prime Minister Bill English has offered his condolences to the people of the United States in the wake of the Las Vegas massacre. “The thoughts of New Zealanders are with the victims and their families affected by this senseless tragedy,” Mr English said in a statement. “Our thoughts are also with the first responders and the emergency services for their selflessness and heroism in carrying out their duties in the wake of such horror.” “Minister of Foreign Affairs Gerry Brownlee has also written to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Governor of Nevada Brian Sandoval to convey New Zealand’s condolences.” The New Zealand Consulate-General in Los Angeles is in contact with the local authorities and there is no indication at this stage that any New Zealanders have been caught up in the incident. Huge arsenal of guns and explosives continues to grow Naaman Zhou here, taking over our live coverage of the Las Vegas shooting. In roughly half an hour (7pm local time) there will be a press conference from law enforcement with more details on the unfolding investigation. Meanwhile, information about the size of the suspected shooter’s arsenal is slowly trickling out. Clark County Sheriff Joseph Lombardo told press earlier they discovered 18 firearms after a raid on Paddock’s Mesquite home – effectively doubling his arsenal after at least 17 guns were found in his hotel room in Las Vegas. We’re now looking at more than 35 guns, explosives and “several thousand rounds” of ammunition, as well as reports from experts that he may have also obtained a special mechanism to fire at near-automatic speeds. Here’s Lombardo’s full summary of the Mesquite discovery: “We retrieved an excess of 18 additional firearms. Some explosives and several thousand rounds of ammo, along with some electronic devices we are evaluating at this point.” A gunman opened fire at an outdoor music festival from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel and casino on the Las Vegas strip. At least 59 people were killed in the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history. At least 527 people were also injured in the attack, and relatives were continuing to search for their loved ones Monday evening. The victims who have been identified included a nurse, local government workers, a student and an off-duty officer. Police have named Stephen Paddock, a 64-year-old from Mesquite, Nevada as the gunman. The suspect’s girlfriend was named as a person of interest, but police said Paddock acted alone and that authorities would interview the woman after she returned from a trip in Tokyo. The gunman’s brother expressed horror and shock, saying of Paddock: “No religious affiliation, no political affiliation, he just hung out.” Police found at least 17 guns in the hotel room of the suspect, along with other weapons in two of his properties and his vehicle. Officials have said they have not uncovered any information related to a possible motive. The shooter may have been using a fully automatic weapon or may have attached a device to a semi-automatic gun to make it fire at a more rapid pace. President Donald Trump said he would visit Las Vegas on Wednesday and called the shooting “an act of pure evil”. Hoaxes and fake news spread rapidly online, in some cases with boosts from Facebook and Google algorithms. Guardian writer Andrew Gumbel has written about comparisons to the first modern mass shooting in the US in 1966 when a gunman fired from an observation deck on the 28th floor in Texas: The carnage in Las Vegas on Sunday may be the worst mass shooting in American history, but this is not the first time that a lone gunman has fired indiscriminately on a crowd from above. To many in law enforcement who have studied mass killings, the rampage on the Vegas Strip immediately recalled the first mass shooting of the modern era, in which a 25-year-old ex-marine enrolled at the University of Texas rained fire from the 28th-floor observation deck of a clock tower on campus on 1 August 1966. Read the full story here: The Guardian’s Beijing bureau chief Tom Phillips has an update on Chinese president Xi Jinping’s response to the mass shooting: Chinese president Xi Jinping has sent his condolences to Donald Trump over the Las Vegas shooting, according to China’s official news agency Xinhua. Xinhua said Xi “extended deep sympathy to the US government and people, profound condolences to the victims, and sincere solicitude to those wounded”. Xi lamented how the shooting had caused “heavy casualties” and also “wished a quick recovery of the injured”. Las Vegas police have released a new phone number for families searching for loved ones: The FBI has also put out new information for witnesses and survivors: Police have gathered outside a Reno, Nevada home owned by Las Vegas shooter Stephen Paddock. From the Associated Press on the scene: A dozen officers carrying rifles were at the house in an upscale neighborhood near the state line with California on Monday afternoon. They closed a two-block stretch around the house in a neighborhood that has a community clubhouse with a tennis court and a billiard room. Three Swat team trucks and a bomb squad truck accompanied police. Police have already found dozens of weapons at the suspect’s hotel room, his home in Mesquite and in his car. In Reno, neighbor Dee McKay told the AP she last saw Paddock in June. She said the gunman was a professional gambler and that the home’s garage had a safe the size of a refrigerator. The Eiffel Tower and the Empire State Building have both gone dark to pay tribute to Las Vegas: And some images at a vigil in Las Vegas, which is happening now:: Here is footage from the sheriff’s latest update on the casualties and ongoing investigation. The next update from his office is expected at 7pm local time. Here’s a detailed timeline of the shooting and aftermath from Guardian reporters Dan Hernandez and David Smith: Just after 10pm: Rapid fire rings out. At first, few realise the extent of the unfolding horror, assuming the sounds are part of the show. But as bullets continue to rain down, the music stops and Aldean rushes off stage. “He literally dropped his guitar, threw it down and sprinted to the side,” said witness. Brian Claypool. Read the full account here: Some updates on the ongoing donation efforts to support victims, including one GoFundMe page that has raised more than $1.6m towards a $2m goal: Officials and relatives have continued to identify more of the 59 people who died in the shooting. Angie Gomez, a former high school cheerleader, was one of the victims, her former school in California announced: An off-duty Las Vegas police officer and military veteran named Charleston Hartfield has also been identified: Read more about the victims here. There were few significant updates at the latest press conference from law enforcement. Officials say the next update is scheduled for around 7pm local time. Here’s a summary of the latest announcements: A total of 59 people have died, not including the suspect, and 527 people have been injured. Police said authorities found several pounds of ammonium nitrate, a material used to make explosives, in the suspect’s car. At least 17 guns were found in the hotel room of the shooter. The shooter is believed to have fired roughly 500 yards from his hotel room to the site of the concert. The suspect had a girlfriend, who is currently in Tokyo, according to police, who are continuing to investigate her and plan to meet with her when she returns. Police are preparing to raid another property of the suspect in Reno, Nevada. Authorities still have no information to share about a possible motive for the shooting. Several gun dealers have come forward and said they sold weapons to the suspect, who reportedly passed background checks. The suspect may have attended another music festival in Las Vegas one week ago. Sandy Hook Promise, a group formed by several family members of the victims of the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting, have released a statement expressing frustration at the “cyclical” gun control debate and calling for action: Over the past five years, we have witnessed how we generally respond (or don’t) as a country to mass shootings like Las Vegas. It’s usually a cyclical conversation, starting with debate between banning assault weapons or arming more Americans, moving then to a focus on mental illness and “good guys vs bad guys” and finally to policy proposals that may relate directly to what occurred, but possibly not, and no federal legislation changes will pass. By the end of next week this story will be almost gone as if it never happened, even while those most impacted are still reeling from shock and grief. We are asking Americans, in the name of these victims and to protect those still living, do something – let’s move from rhetoric and focusing on just “the gun” to more focus on “the shooter” and steps we can be taking as a country to identify and stop them before it’s too late. Sheriff Joe Lombardo told reporters that the suspect shot through a doorway and struck a hotel security guard in the leg. The shooter also had fertilizer and ammonium nitrate in his car at the casino, he said. A swat team is also preparing to enter the suspect’s home in Reno shortly. Lombardo said he didn’t have much information to share about the suspect, but that he appeared to be “reclusive”. The sheriff said it’s possible that the gunman attended a three-day music festival called Life is Beautiful in downtown Las Vegas one week ago. Las Vegas mayor Carolyn Goodman, speaking at the press conference, has said that first responders saved thousands of lives by acting quickly and getting to the scene within minutes. Victims didn’t know what was happening when the suspect first started firing, she added: They’re thinking it’s fireworks or it’s part of the technology of the music being played. They were thinking it’s coming from different areas. There were 22,000 people at the event, she noted. Nevada US senator Dean Heller said at the conference: “We’ll never forget 1 October 2017. It’s a day we’ll remember for years to come.” Officials say victims have suffered a wide range of injuries, including gunshot wounds, shrapnel wounds, injuries from people jumping fences while trying to escape and more: Officials say the local coroner’s office is still working to identify victims and provide updates to families. Asked if the coroner was able to handle the number of bodies, an official said yes, but added, “I don’t know if anyone can be fully equipped to handle this.” Some further information for victims’ families: Officials in Las Vegas are providing an update at a press conference now. The official death toll is now at 59, and police say 527 people have been injured. Police also say authorities have found 18 firearms, explosives and several thousands of rounds of ammunition at the suspect’s home in Mesquite, Nevada. Clark County, which has jurisdiction over the Las Vegas strip, has just declared a state of emergency: Sam Levin here, taking over our live coverage of the shooting in Las Vegas, where officials are expected to soon provide an update. Chris Michel, owner of a Utah gun store, has spoken out about meeting suspect Stephen Paddock and selling to him. Michel told the Associated Press: There were no red flags. I had no idea he would be capable of this. The owner of Dixie GunWorx said Paddock visited the store several times this year and purchased a shotgun after passing a federal gun background check. The suspect allegedly told the store owner he was “new to the area” and visiting local gunshots. He bought the shotgun in February from the store located in St George, Utah, which is a 40-minute drive from Paddock’s home in Mesquite, Nevada. Another store in Mesquite that reportedly sold firearms to the suspect has also released a statement, saying Paddock “never gave any indication or reason to believe he was unstable or unfit at any time”: The lead guitarist of a country music band playing Route 91 Harvest festival, where a gunman murdered 58 people on Sunday night, has said the horrific experience of the attack has changed his views on gun laws in America. “I’ve been a proponent of the [second] amendment my entire life,” Caleb Keeter posted on Twitter. “Until the events of last night. I cannot express how wrong I was.” In the chaotic hours after the attack, which began around 10pm, the members of the Josh Abbott Band were eventually able to post a message on social media, saying that the band and crew were safe. “I’ll never unhear those gunshots; and our band [and] crew will never forget how that moment made them feel,” singer Josh Abbott wrote on Twitter. “Our hearts are with all the victims.” But Keeter went further, describing the ordeal as a revelation. He said that members of the band’s crew have concealed handgun licenses, and legal firearms on the bus. “They were useless,” he said. “We couldn’t touch them for fear police might think that we were part of the massacre and shoot us. A small group (or one man) laid waste to a city with dedicated, fearless police officers desperately trying to help, because of access to an insane amount of firepower. Enough is enough.” Keeter said that he spent the harrowing moments of the shooting “writing to my parents and the love of my life a goodbye” – and “a living will because I felt like I wasn’t going to live through the night”. Around him, his friends, bandmates and crew were trapped, under fire. “These rounds were powerful enough that my crew guys just standing in a close proximity of a victim shot by this fucking coward received shrapnel wounds.” The feeling, he wrote, “was enough for me to realize that this is completely and totally out of hand.” “We need gun control RIGHT. NOW,” he added. “My biggest regret is that I stubbornly didn’t realize it until my brothers on the road and myself were threatened by it.” Many country musicians have shied away from politics in recent years, fearing a backlash from fans – as the Dixie Chicks suffered for their opposition to the Iraq war. Exceptions include Lee Greenwood and Toby Keith, who performed at the inauguration of Donald Trump, who has promised to defend gun rights from attempts to regulate firearms. Keith defended the performance, noting that he played events for Republican and Democratic presidents: “I don’t apologize for performing for our country or military.” The National Rifle Association, the pro-gun lobbying group, has also established an arm called NRA Country that features country music artists, and encourages musicians and fans to “celebrate the lifestyle”. In April, Trump called himself “a true friend and champion” of the lobbying group. “No longer will the government be trying to undermine your rights and your freedoms as Americans,” the president said at an annual NRA conference. “Instead, we will work with you, by your side.” Over the years, Keeter has argued in favor of gun rights, arguing on Twitter that if current laws were “actually enforced, the people committing the shootings wouldn’t have these guns.” In 2012, he went so far as to say “I fear giving the ability to regulate our weapons to the institution that makes gun ownership a necessity.” He said he regretted that on Monday. “I saw this happening for years and did nothing,” he wrote. “I’d like to do what I can now.” Also on Monday, Democrats in the Senate and House called for universal background checks on gun purchases and a commission to research gun violence prevention. The Trump White House resisted those calls, with spokeswoman Sarah Sanders saying: “There is a time and place for a political debate. But this is a time to unite as a country.” “It would be premature to discuss policy when we don’t fully know all the facts or what took place last night.” The gunman’s brother, Eric Paddock, describes the suspect – and his surprise and horror – to reporters outside his home in central Florida. Facebook and Google promoted false news stories that, in the early, chaotic hours during and after the Las Vegas attack, misidentified a man as the shooter, Sam Levin reports. Before authorities named 64-year-old Stephen Paddock as the suspect, some falsely identified the gunman as someone named Geary Danley. It’s unclear where exactly the hoax originated, but rightwing users aggressively promoted his name, seizing on evidence that he was a liberal. On 4chan, the anonymous message board and a favorite platform of the “alt-right”, some noted that Danley was a registered Democrat. Soon after, Gateway Pundit, a conspiracy-laden blog that now has White House credentials, published an evidence-free story headlined “Las Vegas Shooter Reportedly a Democrat Who Liked Rachel Maddow, MoveOn.org and Associated with Anti-Trump Army”. The piece was based on a review of Facebook “likes”. Despite the fact that the claims were unproven and coming from non-credible sources, Facebook’s “Safety Check” page, which is supposed to help people connect with loved ones during the crisis, ended up briefly promoting a story that said the shooter had “Trump-hating” views, along with links to a number of other hoaxes and scams, according to screenshots. At the same time, Google users who searched Geary Danley’s name were at one point directed to the 4chan threadfilled with false claims. The successful manipulation of social media algorithms to politicize a tragedy speaks to a relatively new pattern of online abuse – from the careless and accidental, like the misidentification of the suspect behind the Boston marathon bombing in 2013, to overt exploitation and targeted disinformation. “It’s getting more polarized. There’s this mad scramble to paint the guy as a Democrat or a Republican, so they can cheer,” Brooke Binkowski, managing editor of fact-checking website Snopes.com, said in an interview. “A lot of this is pushed by trolls deliberately to muddy the conversation.” Google, Facebook and Twitter have faced repeated accusations that they allow propaganda to spread on their sites and reach large audiences. The tech corporations have typically blamed their algorithms and offered vague pledges of improvement. The Mandalay Bay shooting was no exception. Google said in a statement: “Unfortunately, early this morning we were briefly surfacing an inaccurate 4chan website in our Search results for a small number of queries. Within hours, the 4chan story was algorithmically replaced by relevant results. This should not have appeared for any queries, and we’ll continue to make algorithmic improvements to prevent this from happening in the future. Facebook attempted to downplay its role in promoting false stories, saying in a statement: “Our Global Security Operations Center spotted these posts this morning and we have removed them. However, their removal was delayed, allowing them to be screen captured and circulated online. We are working to fix the issue that allowed this to happen in the first place and deeply regret the confusion this caused.” The first of the 58 victims of the Las Vegas shooting are starting to be identified, with details of their lives emerging from family, friends and social media. Jamiles Lartey reports: Sonny Melton, 29, who lived in Big Sandy, Tennessee, and worked at a nearby hospital, was the first victim publicly identified. Family members confirmed to the news station WSMV that he was killed in the gunfire. His wife, Heather Melton, told WZTV that her husband had shielded her from bullets on the ground when the shooting began. “He saved my life and lost his,” she said. A friend of the couple told the Paris (Tennessee) Post-Intelligencer that the two had gotten married about a year ago. “I want everyone to know what a kindhearted loving man he was, but at this point I can barely breathe,” Heather Melton wrote to USA Today. The couple both worked at Henry County medical center in Tennessee, he as a registered nurse, she as an orthopedic surgeon. “The thoughts and prayers of the entire HCMC family are with Sonny and Heather’s families,” the center’s chief executive, Thomas Gee, said in a statement. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation reported that a 23-year-old British Columbia man, Jordan McIldoon, was also among the dead, according to his parents. Another concertgoer posted on Facebook on Sunday night that McIldoon had “died in [her] arms”. “We only had one child,” McIldoon’s parents told CBC. “We just don’t know what to do.” Local outlets in Bakersfield, California have confirmed with family members that 20-year-old Bailey Schweitzer was killed in the attack. Jessica Klymchuk, an Edmonton, Alberta, woman, has also been confirmed dead in the shooting. Stephen Paddock owned several rental properties, had an expired pilot’s license, and enjoyed gambling, the AP reports, drawing from public records, interview with family and the nascent police investigation. The gunman’s brother, Eric Paddock said that he had not talked to his brother in six months and last heard from him in a text message sent after Hurricane Irma. “It was like, ‘You ok?’ ‘Yeah,’” he said. “We talked when we had something to talk about.” He also recalled another recent text showing “a picture that he won $40,000 on a slot machine. But that’s the way he played.” Police searched Paddock’s home in Mesquite, near the Arizona border about 80 miles north-east of Las Vegas, and did not find any bombs or traps that they feared there. He bought the property for $369,000 in 2015, according to property records. Court documents suggest he co-owned rental property in California and Texas. His brother described him as “wealthy”, and someone who enjoyed online poker and cruises. Police also searched a two-bedroom home Paddock owned in a retirement community in Reno, 500 miles from Mesquite. He previously lived in another Mesquite, the Dallas suburb, from 2004 to 2012, according to Mesquite, Texas, police Lt Brian Parrish. Paddock owned at least three separate rental properties, Parrish said, and there was no indication the police department had any contact with him over that time, Parrish said. He has been divorced at least twice, including marriages that ended in 1980 and 1990. One of the ex-wives lives in Southern California, where a large gathering of reporters congregated in her neighborhood. Los Angeles police Sgt Cort Bishop said she did not want to speak with journalists. He relayed that the two had not been in contact for a long time and did not have children. Records also showed that Paddock had gained a pilot’s license in November 2003, and that he had temporary Alaska fishing licenses in 2009 and 2010. In 2012, Paddock sued the Cosmopolitan Hotel &amp; Resorts in Nevada, saying he slipped and fell on a wet floor there. The lawsuit was eventually dismissed by a judge and settled by arbitration. Reached by telephone, Paddock’s lawyer at the time, Jared Richards, said he could not comment because of client confidentiality concerns. Citing unnamed law enforcement sources, NBC and the Wall Street Journal are reporting more details of the police responseto the shooting. According to NBC, police first received a call about the shooting at 10.08pm on Sunday night. An hour and 12 minutes elapsed before they breached the hotel room door, at 11.20pm, around which time the gunman killed himself. Part of the delay, NBC reports, was officers’ struggle to determine which floor and room where the gunman was firing from. “As soon as they got on the floor they knew that that’s where the shots were coming from,” the network’s Pete Williams reported. “Whether they knew that from the smell of gunfire or the sound of gunfire we’re not sure.” Sheriff Joe Lombardo said earlier Monday that he could not confirm reports that smoke from the gunfire set off the hotel room’s fire alarm, which could have directed police to the room. According to the Wall Street Journal, citing an unnamed official, police found 18-20 guns in the room, including automatic rifles and guns in the style of AR-15s and AK-47s. Police have not publicly described what kind of weapons the gunman used. Lauren Gambino, reporting from Washington DC, attended a press conference by former Arizona congresswoman Gabby Giffords, who survived a 2011 shooting that killed six and injured more than a dozen others. “What we’re hearing today at the Capitol and the White House are thoughts and prayers,” her husband, said Mark Kelly said, in remarks delivered outside the Capitol. “Your thoughts and prayers aren’t going to stop the next shooting. Only action and leadership will do that.” Giffords and Kelly, who have become prominent advocates for stricter gun control laws since the 2011 shooting, were due to campaign for Democratic Virginia’s gubernatorial candidate Ralph Northam, but changed their plans after the massacre in Las Vegas. “We don’t have to accept this as normal. it’s not normal. It’s not inevitable. It’s an epidemic that needs to be cured,” Kelly said. He lambasted members of Congress for cowing to political interests, and for considering legislation that he said could create even more chaos during mass shooting situations. “Imagine how much worse last night’s shooting could have been if the gunman had a silencer,” he said, referring to a bill that would make it easier to buy silencers, devices that reduce the noise emitted from the firearm. “Imagine the confusion for first responders if they arrived on the scene to a bunch of civilians wielding their own guns attempting to return fire.” Kelly listed a number of measures he said would help reduce the number of gun deaths each year, including laws to expand background checks, to ban people convicted of domestic violence from purchasing a firearm, to stiffen penalties for straw purchases, and to invest in research on the causes and effects of gun violence. At the end of his remarks, Giffords leaned over the podium to conclude. “The nation is counting on you,” she said. Gun control advocates have mobilized in force since the 20 children were killed at Sandy Hook elementary school, in 2012. And while they have made marginal gains on the state level, the groups, which include Kelly and Giffords’ Americans for Responsible Solutions, and members of Congress such as Connecticut senator Chris Murphy, have had little success at the national level. Asked why the legislative campaign has failed to make a dent in the wake of so many deadly mass shootings, Kelly pointed to an sharp imbalance in resources and entrenched politicization. Though he had little optimism that the current Congress would act, he urged voters to hold legislators accountable at the ballot box. Video of the last briefing by Nevada authorities, including Las Vegas Metro sheriff Joe Lombardo. House minority leader Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, has written Paul Ryan, the Republican Speaker, to demand action on gun control in the aftermath of the shooting. “Congress has a moral duty,” she writes, “to address this horrific and heartbreaking epidemic.” Charged with the solemn duty to protect and defend the American people, we must respond to these tragedies with courage, unity and decisive action. First, Congress must pass the bipartisan King-Thompson legislation to strengthen the life-saving background checks that keep guns out of the wrong hands. But this is only a first step. I urge you to create a Select Committee on Gun Violence to study and report back common sense legislation to help end this crisis. The bipartisan committee would make recommendations to prevent unpseakable tragedies such as the mass shooting in Las Vegas and to restore confidence in the safety of our communities. The White House, however, has resisted calls to action. “There is a time and place for a political debate. But this is a time to unite as a country,” said spokesperson Sarah Huckabee Sanders. “It would be premature to discuss policy when we don’t fully know all the facts or what took place last night.” The suspect’s brother, Eric Paddock, has told television networks that their father was a bank robber who spent time on the FBI’s “Most Wanted” list, but that he was not a part of the family’s life. “My father was on the top 10 list for a while. His name was Benjamin Hoskins Paddock. We didn’t know him. I didn’t know him. He was in jail and broken out of jail.” Paddock echoed police about his brother’s non-existent criminal record. “He doesn’t even have parking tickets,” he said. “He was a wealthy guy and he liked to play video poker. He went on cruises. He sent his mother cookies, big crazy boxes of cookies and stuff.” Archived newspapers from the 1960s show that Benjamin Paddock was wanted for bank robberies in Arizona. A clipping from 6 October 1960, from the Arizona Republic, calls Paddock “a three-time bank robber”and “garbage disposal sales and service man” from Tucson. The article says he was arrested and indicted that year for robbing Phoenix banks of about $25,000. A 1971 clipping from the Tucson Daily Citizen said that the bank robber was named to the FBI’s list after he escaped a Texas prison in 1968. The article says that before his 1960 arrest Paddock lived in Tucson with a wife and four children. An FBI poster from the era names Benjamin Hoskins Paddock – along with several aliases, including “Chromedome” and “Old Baldy” – as an “armed and dangerous” suspect convicted of bank robbery, automobile larceny and “confidence game”. Paddock was captured in Oregon 10 years after his escape from prison, according to law enforcement officials cited by NBC News. Las Vegas mayor Carolyn Goodman, who earlier pleaded for blood donations from whomever can give in the Las Vegas area, tweets a message of gratitude and perseverance. The Las Vegas Metropolitan police and Nevada Emergency Management meanwhile have more instructions for people who want to help, or are still struggling to find missing loved ones. At least 58 people were killed and more than 515 were injured at a country music festival on the Las Vegas Strip, in one of the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history. The gunman fired for several minutes into a 22,000-person crowd from the windows of a 32nd floor hotel room, in the Mandalay Bay resort. Videos show chaos amid the gunfire, as people scrambled for cover, ran from the stage and struggled to save each other’s lives. Police believe the gunman killed himself around the time a Swat team descended on his room. He had checked in there on 28 September, and police found at least 10 weapons with him. Authorities identified the shooter as Stephen Paddock, 64, from Mesquite, Nevada, about 80 miles to the north-east. They were searching properties in his name. Police do not know the motive behind the shooting; the gunman had no prior record in state or federal databases, save a minor traffic violation. The FBI said they have found “no connection to international terrorist organizations”. President Donald Trump called the shooting “an act of pure evil,” and said he will go to las Vegas on Wednesday. The gunman’s girlfriend, Marilou Danley, was named as a person of interest but police said the gunman acted alone at the hotel. Danley is abroad and cooperating with police. The gunman’s brother expressed horror and shock, saying Paddock had no background with weapons. “No religious affiliation, no political affiliation, he just hung out,” he told television networks. “He’s just a guy who lived in a house in Mesquite, drove down and gambled in Las Vegas.” Nevada authorities pleaded for blood donations from people in the Las Vegas area. Governor Brian Sandoval said the scene was “basically a war zone” – “we need blood.” In a pattern repeated after high-profile mass shootings for years, shares in the US’s two largest gun companies have risen sharply after the Vegas attack. Sturm Ruger, America’s largest firearms manufacturer, is up over 4%. American Outdoor Brands (formerly Smith &amp; Wesson) is up over 5%. Such rises are typical after a mass shooting as investors bet fear will lead to higher guns sales. Las Vegas sheriff Joe Lombardo answers a few questions from reporters in the room. On the 10 weapons found in the gunman’s hotel room: “We do know that he brought the weapons in on his own. In the original briefing we believed that he had [a companion]. We have determined that the female is out of the country. He brought these weapons in on his own.” On the new property being investigated, he says it was found by searching through property assessor records. Was the gunman known to law enforcement? “Not at all. We’ve checked all the federal databases and Nevada databases and we have no knowledge of this individual.” On Marilou Danley, the gunman’s girlfriend who is currently abroad: “We still consider her a person of interest. We have been in contact with her and we plan to engage her upon her return to the country.” On how he broke the hotel room windows: ”We believe he had a device similar to a hammer to smash through the windows.” Whether he had tickets to the concert: “I have no idea.” On the gunman’s actions in the hotel: “There will be hours and hours and hours of video surveillance that we will have to recall with the cooperation of the MGM [hotel].” Whether law enforcement could have acted before the shooting: “I don’t know how it could’ve been prevented if we had no prior knowledge of the individual.” Whether cleaning services noticed anything: “It has been reported that individuals were going to and fro from his room, and nothing nefarious was noticed, at this point, as we know now.” On what he knows about the gunman’s final moments: “[I was told] he had killed himself. Exactly – we’ll have to go through our body worn camera and existing video as to whether we engaged him at the same approximate time.” On motive: “I can’t get into the mind of a psychopath at this point.” Authorities in Nevada have one united plea for Nevada: give blood. Dina Titus, a representative for the county, says that while authorities appreciate thoughts and prayers, “we need blood.” Adam Laxalt, Nevada’s attorney general, says, “We’ve never been hit with such a tough situation.” He makes a similar plea. Governor Brian Sandoval takes the podium after Laxalt. “I don’t know if I have words to describe what we’re going through, and what these poor unfortunate victims. “We’re angry, we’re grieving, we’re confused. People are hurting. I want to thank the sheriff and all the first responders, I just had the opportunity to visit some of the patients in the hospital, and it’s unimaginable what people are going through right now. Sandoval says that for all the horror, this was for first responders “their finest hour” in “what basically was a war zone”. “We don’t understand what’s happened. And I’m sure we’ll find out a little more as Metro continues to perform its investigation. We need blood, so if anybody could contribute blood, anybody in the Las Vegas area or locally could do that. As we move on we’ll learn more.” Sandoval stresses this final point. “It was a cowardly, despicable act. There’s not much we can do but we can learn.” The Clark County district attorney, Steve Woodson, takes the podium. “This was a classic WMD. This was a weapon and a man of mass destruction,” he says. “This doesn’t involve politics. All of us are Nevadans. We’re working to get through this.” The mayor, Carolyn Goodman, speaks next about the gunman. “This is a crazed lunatic full of hate. We don’t know much about his background. But it’s certainly not an extension about what we believe in.” The sheriff says there is no new information to report about the suspect, but that police have completed their investigation of his hotel room. They have also identified another property associated with the gunman, and executed a search warrant there. Mesquite police have been searching the gunman’s home there, about 80 miles north-east of Las Vegas. An FBI agent, Aaron Rouse, briefly takes the podium to address the Isis claim, made without any evidence, that the gunman had converted to Islam. “We have determined at this point no connection to international terrorist organization,” Rouse says. Las Vegas Sheriff Joe Lombardo has said the death toll has increased to 58, and there are now 515 people injured. The number of people that have died associated with this event has increased. It may be 59, Lombardo says, as hospitals struggle to treat the sheer number of people injured. Jason Burke, the Guardian’s Africa correspondent and author of The New Threat, a work on the Islamic State and other terrorist groups, writes that the public and the press need to be skeptical of claims that the Las Vegas shooter converted to Islam or was somehow linked to an international group. The Isis claim of responsibility for Las Vegas shooting appears to have been first published on Amaq news agency, an ISIS communication channel which has seen many previous such statements. We need to be very prudent assessing this one. The profile of the attacker alone urges extreme caution, and US officials have already said they have no evidence of any link to the group. Until around a year ago, Isis claims tended to be reliable. The group used carefully calibrated wording to indicate its degree of involvement of the group, and, if there was some exaggeration, there was limited outright fabrication. The group often provided proof of its involvement through videos recorded by attackers before an incident. Isis also started quoting “security sources”, which are thought by security officials to be close friends or relatives, contacted by the group, who confirmed an individual’s motivation and loyalties. Sometimes of these appear to have been “interviewed” by Isis after an attack to back up its claim. But in recent months Isis, facing military defeat and the loss of territories, have repeatedly made claims which have been shown to utterly unjustified. Isis claimed a role in the Westminster attacks in March – and an exhaustive investigation found no link. The group claimed a shooting in a Philippines casino in June, where the attacker was an gambler with large debts and a drinking problem. There are many other examples. This claim today describes the shooter in Las Vegas as a “soldier” of the Isis, who converted to Islam several months ago. This is theoretically possible of course but seems far fetched, not least because he committed suicide. Islamic militant groups launch “fedayeen” actions in which death is a near certainty, thus becoming “martyrs”, but they do not ever take their own lives in this way, which is seen as a terrible sin. Despite the president’s call to unity, the fault lines of gun policy have already appeared in Congress, where some lawmakers are growing increasingly angry after years of horrific mass shootings. Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, a Republican, said in a statement that the “evil tragedy horrifies us all” and that “the whole country stands united in our shock, in our condolences, and in our prayers.” Some Democrats have taken a sterner line. Chris Murphy, the Connecticut senator who has campaigned for gun control since the Newtown school massacre in 2013, pleaded for action. “This must stop,” he said. “It is positively infuriating that my colleagues in Congress are so afraid of the gun industry that they pretend there aren’t public policy responses to this epidemic. “There are, and the thoughts and prayers of politicians are cruelly hollow if they are paired with continued legislative indifference. It’s time for Congress to get off its ass and do something.” Similarly, Virginia representative Don Beyer, said that the shooting – like the hundreds of others over the last few yearss – is “unfathomable and unacceptable.” “We have a moral duty to honor their lives with action. We must not, and we will not, become desensitized to gun violence.” Massachusetts representative Seth Moulton has pledged to protest in the House, as he did after the 2016 shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida. The Mandalay Bay hotel, where the gunman took a corner room and fired onto the concert crowd outside, has announced that guests may return to their rooms. “Our unity cannot be shattered by evil,” the president continues. He invokes scripture, “we know that God lives in the hearts of those who grieve.” “Though we feel such great anger at the senseless murder of our fellow citizens it is our love that defines us today.” He says that he will visit Las Vegas on Wednesday. “I know we are searching for some kind of meaning in the chaos, some kind of light in the darkness. The answers do not come easy.” “We can take solace that even in the darkest space can be brightened by a single light, and even the most terrible despair can be lightened by a single ray of hope.” “We pray for the day when evil is banished and when the innocent are safe from hatred and from fear. May God bless the souls of the lives that are lost. May God give us the grace to heal, and may God provide the grieving families with the strength to carry on. Thank you, and God bless America.” With that he concludes his remarks. President Donald Trump is now addressing the nation on the shooting. “My fellow Americans. we are joined together today in sadness, shock and grief. Last night a gunman opened fire on a large crowd at a country music concert in Las Vegas, Nevada. He brutally murdered more than 50 people and wounded hundreds more. “It was an act of pure evil. The FBI and the department of homeland security are working closely with local authorities to assist with the investigation and they will provide updates as to the investigation and how it develops.” He thanks the Las Vegas police and other first responders. “The speed with which they acted is miraculous. To have found the shooter so quickly after the first shots were fired is something we for which we will always be thankful.” “We cannot fathom their pain, we cannot imagine their loss. The the families of the victims we are praying for you, we are here for you.” In memory of the fallen, he says, he has directed flags to fly at half-staff. “In moments of tragedy and horror Americans come together as one. It always has.” The FBI has spoken with Eric Paddock, the brother of the gunman, at his home in central Florida. Paddock has also given a few interviews at greater length. “He was my brother and it’s like an asteroid fell out of the sky,” Paddock told CNN. He said he last spoke to his brother when Stephen wanted to check in on their mother after Hurricane Irma. Paddock expressed shock and horror to CBS that his brother could commit such a crime. He had “no religious affiliation, no political affiliation, he just hung out”, Paddock said. “He’s not an avid gun guy at all. The fact that he had those kind of weapons is just – where the hell did he get automatic weapons? He has no military background or anything like that. He’s just a guy who lived in a house in Mesquite, drove down and gambled in Las Vegas. He did stuff. Ate burritos.” Paddock said that when he heard the news he became scared for Paddock’s girlfriend, Marilou Danley, worrying that “he might’ve hurt her too”. Police have said Danley was out of the country, unharmed and speaking with investigators. The Las Vegas sheriff, Joseph Lombardo, and President Donald Trump are expected to give respective briefings within the next half hour. Authorities have so far stressed that they know nothing about the shooter’s motivation. Lombardo said he was not yet ready to label the shooting terrorism. Mesquite police are reported to have cleared the suspect’s home, north-east of Las Vegas. Dan Hernandez, reporting from Las Vegas, has spoken with two more survivors of the shooting. “We heard the gunshots, ducked, tried to find cover, [then] once we heard a little break in the popping noise we took off running,” said Brian Schmidt, from Bismarck, North Dakota. “There was no time to think about anything. It was all reaction.” He said the adrenaline was still flowing, hours later: “As far as sitting down and reflecting on this, that process hasn’t started yet. I have no idea when it will.” He expressed thanks to city officials for reacting as quickly as they did. “They did everything they possibly could, given the circumstances. From the moment we ran into officers we felt safe. “We’re just very fortunate to be here.” Survivors and evacuees who are unable to return to their hotel rooms are taking shelter in a large arena near the Mandalay Bay, the Thomas and Mack Center at the University of Nevada Las Vegas. Members of the community have dropped off blankets, water and food, and police are standing guard. The suspect’s brother, Eric Paddock, has told a local Florida station his family is “dumbfounded” by the shooting. “We are completely dumbfounded,” he told WOFL-Channel 35, according to the Orlando Sentinel. “We can’t understand what happened.” “We have absolutely no idea whatsoever,” Paddock said. “I can’t imagine. When you guys find out why this happened, let us know. I have no idea whatsoever.” He said he would provide further comment to the press at some later point. The suspect, Stephen Paddock, lived in central Florida as recently as 2015, according to several media outlets in the state. Florida Today spoke to residents of Heritage Isle retirement community in Viera, where records show Paddock owned a two-bedroom house from 2013-15. Mick Anderson, who bought the house from Paddock, said he never met or spoke with Paddock during the transaction. “It was all done through my realtor and his realtor,” Anderson told the newspaper. “The only thing I can tell you is that the documents were regularly late.” Next-door neighbours Don and Sharon Judy said they saw Paddock and his girlfriend only rarely during the two years he owned the property. Local KTNV news has interviewed Anthony Kappenman, a shooting victim who was in the crowd around centre stage when the shooting broke out. Kappenman said that when he first heard “repetitive popping” he thought it sounded like fireworks. He looked up to the sky to find them. “On the second burst I instantly knew there were no fireworks.” Kappenman said he has experience with guns and that he recognised the sound for what it was, grabbed a friend, and “started ushering her toward safety.” “And then the crowd kind of picked up and realised there was gunfire. It was raining and hitting the concrete so you could hear it,” he said. As the realisation set in, so did panic. People in the crowd starting running and “trampling” each other, Kappenman said, describing it as “pandemonium”. “I grabbed my friend and held her close, tried to keep her at a good pace” – and then shots started landing near her. She jumped for cover as the shots grew closer. “I had one probably miss my head by about two inches.” As he helped his friend back up to get running again, he was struck by shrapnel in his chin – and then shot in the leg. Around them, he said, “people were trying to jump the fence, really anything they could do to scramble to safety”. The whole episode lasted somewhere between five to 10 minutes, he thinks – an eternity of nearly constant gunfire. “I was getting to the back of the festival ground and I could still hear shots ringing out,” he said. Kappenman reached the hospital, where doctors told him the bullet had entered his bone. Another of his friends was hit in the calf; his other friend escaped from injury. At least 50 people have been killed and more than 400 injured at a country music festival in Las Vegas, in the worst mass shooting in US history. Two police officers, including one who was an off-duty member of the Las Vegas police department, are among the dead. The shooter was named by police as Stephen Paddock, 64. Police say they believe he killed himself before officers raided his his room on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel, from where he fired multiple rounds at concertgoers at the Route 91 harvest country music festival. Police found at least 10 guns in Paddock’s room. He had been staying in the room since 28 September. Paddock was described as a “lone wolf” with no known links to terrorist groups. His motives are unknown and he had no police record. A spokesman for the US Department of Homeland Security says there is no information to indicate a “specific credible threat” to other public venues. Police have found Paddock’s “companion”, Marilou Danley. They said she was out of the country and has been questioned by the police. Paddock’s house in Mesquite, Nevada is being searched. His two vehicles have been found. Public records listed previous addresses for Paddock in Texas and California, as well as a 2010 licence to hunt and fish in Alaska. Donald Trump tweeted his condolences and sympathies. His planned trip to hurricane-hit Puerto Rico has been delayed. Jason Aldean, the country music star who was performing as the shooting took place, described the scene as “beyond horrific”. He said he and his crew were safe, but added: “It hurts my heart that this would happen to anyone who was just coming out to enjoy what should have been a fun night.” Concertgoers reported seeing muzzle flashes from the upper floors of the Mandalay Bay hotel and several videos of the aftermath show hundreds of people fleeing in panic as shots continued. Around 22,000 people were attending the concert when Paddock opened fire. Some flights have resumed at the city’s McCarran international airport after all planes were temporarily grounded on Sunday evening. The Department of Homeland Security has repeated the sheriff’s assessment of the current situation in Las Vegas. Acting secretary Elaine Duke said in a statement that there is no “specific credible threat involving other public venues” at this moment. The department is closely monitoring the situation and working with our federal, state, and local partners in responding to and investigating this tragedy. At this time, we have no information to indicate a specific credible threat involving other public venues in the country. However, increased security in and around public places and events may be experienced as officials take additional precautions. Our thoughts and prayers are with all those affected by this incident as we work to support the Las Vegas community. Lombardo says the police have found nothing to suggest a motive for Paddock’s attack. Asked why they did not regard the attack as domestic terrorism, Lombardo said: We have to establish what his motivation is first. There is motiving factors associated with terrorism other than a distraught person just intending to cause mass casualty. Before we label with that it will be a matter of process. Asked whether investigators had found anything to suggest a motive, the sheriff said: “We have not located any items within the room or his house [that would indicate motive].” He also revealed that Paddock had been staying in the room since last Thursday. We have information that he has been there [in the hotel room] since the 28 September. I have no idea whether he prevented the house keepers from entering the room or not. That is a matter for continued investigation. Sheriff Joe Lombardo is giving another press conference. He confirms that more than 50 people were killed and more than 400 were injured in the attack. He says there is nothing “derogatory” in the background of the suspect, Stephen Paddock. “We believe the individual killed himself prior to our entry,” Lombardo said. Some 10 weapons were found in his room on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel. A spokesman for the US Department of Homeland Security says there is no information to indicate a “specific credible threat” to other public venues in US after the Las Vegas shooting. More than 400 people wounded in the attack have been treated in hospital, according to a new update from the police. In a new press release it confirmed that Paddock was found dead in his room. The Las Vegas metropolitan police department identified the lone suspect involved in the late night mass shooting on the Las Vegas Strip as 64-year-old, Stephen Craig Paddock, a white male from Mesquite, Nevada. Paddock opened fire on a crowd of more than 22,000 concert-goers from his hotel room on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel on Sunday evening at approximately 10:08pm. The victims were across the street attending the Route 91 Harvest Festival concert when bullets rang out. LVMPD Swat responded to the call, breached the hotel room and found the suspect dead. The Clark County fire department estimated that approximately 406 people were transported to area hospitals and 50 are dead following Sunday evening’s shooting. Among the dead is an LVMPD officer who was off-duty at the time. His name is being withheld pending notification of next of kin. There were also two on-duty officers injured, one of whom was upgraded recently from critical to stable condition. The other sustained non-life threatening wounds. The Federal Bureau of Investigations is asking for anyone with videos or photos concerning the shooting to call 1-800-CALLFBI or (800) 225-5324. LVMPD and Clark County coroner’s office have set up a hotline for family or friends to report a missing loved one connected to this incident. The hotline is only to take reports on missing people. The number is (866) 535-5654. LVMPD also opened up a family reunification centre at its headquarters at 400 S. Martin L King Blvd in Building B. The identification process of all of the injured and the deceased will take time, so authorities are asking the public for patience. Anyone wishing to help is asked to donate blood for the injured victims of the Strip shooting. United Blood Services will start taking donations at 7am at two locations: 6930 W. Charleston in Las Vegas or 601 Whitney Ranch Drive in Henderson. UMC will also be hosting a blood drive in conjunction with United Blood Services. It will be held at UMC’s Delta Point Building located at 901 N Rancho Lane. There will be updates as to the exact time of the blood drive as more information is available. Paddock may have shot himself, according to McMahill. Speaking to CNN he added: “He was shot. I cannot tell you that it was the police that shot him. He may have self-inflicted that gunshot wound. Those details are still emerging.” He added: “A number of long rifles were in that room. I would say there were at least eight guns up there.” McMahill reported that the number of wounded people in the attack is likely to rise above the more than 200 figure given by Lombardo earlier. He said: “We continue to receive reports from all of our area hospitals where individuals self-transported themselves. So that number of injured individuals I anticipate to continue to climb over the next couple of hours.” Las Vegas undersheriff Kevin McMahill says at least eight guns were found in the hotel room on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel where Stephen Paddock launched his deadly attack. “This is a day I wish I never had to see in my 27 years of law enforcement,” he told CNN. He said the scene was the most disturbing he had ever seen in his career. “We just didn’t see it coming,” McMahill said. Paddock, 64, was a resident of Mesquite, Nevada, a retirement and golf community of about 20,000 people, a police spokesman confirmed. “We don’t have a lot on Mr Paddock,” Mesquite police spokesman Quinn Averett said. Mesquite PD records held no report of any contact with Paddock, Averett said. No calls for service, no arrests, not even a record of a traffic stop. Mesquite is just minutes away from Bunkerville, Nevada, the site of an armed standoff at the Bundy Ranch between federal agents and a ranch family and the citizen militia members who came to support them. Mesquite typically sees about one murder a year, Averett said. Public records listed previous addresses for Stephen Paddock in Texas and California, as well as a 2010 license to hunt and fish in Alaska. The British foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, said Foreign Office staff are trying to establish whether any British citizens were caught up in the attack. In a statement he said: I am horrified by the awful attack at a music festival in Las Vegas this morning. The United Kingdom stands with the American people against this indiscriminate violence. My thoughts are with all those caught up in it. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office is in contact with Las Vegas authorities to establish whether any British people were caught up in the attack and we are ready to help however we can. Any British people in Las Vegas should follow the instructions of local authorities. British tennis player Laura Robson was among the survivors, according to PA. “I’m OK,” BBC Sport reported her saying on social media. Las Vegas police department has so far confirmed that two off-duty police officers were among more than 50 people killed in the attack. One worked for the LVPD. At least two on-duty officers were also injured in the attack. One is in a stable condition after surgery and another with minor injuries. The US vice president, Mike Pence, has also tweeted his condolences. Donald Trump expressed similar sentiments, but apart from one tweet has said nothing else about the attack. Police in Mesquite, where Paddock’s home is being searched, say he did not have a criminal record. “We don’t have a lot on Mr Paddock. He does live here in our city. We have not had any law enforcement contact with him in the past,” Quinn Averett, a spokesman for the Mesquite police department, said. In their records, there is no report of any contact with Paddock – no calls for service, no arrests, not even a record of a traffic stop. Mesquite is a quiet city of about 20,000 people, a “retirement and golf community” with three large casinos that averages about one murder a year, Averett said. At least 50 people have been killed and more than 200 injured at a country music festival in Las Vegas, in the worst mass shooting in US history. Two police officers are among the dead. The shooter was named by police as Stephen Paddock, 64. Several rifles were found in his room on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel, from where he fired multiple rounds at concertgoers at the Route 91 harvest country music festival. Paddock was described as a “lone wolf” with no known links to terrorist groups. His motives are unknown. A Swat team used a controlled explosion to enter his hotel room before shooting him dead. Police believe they have located Paddock’s companion, Marilou Danley, after launching a public hunt for her. She is wanted for questioning and is described as a person of interest. Paddock’s house in Mesquite, Nevada is being searched. His two vehicles have been found. Donald Trump tweeted his condolences and sympathies. His planned trip to hurricane-hit Puerto Rico has been delayed. Jason Aldean, the country music star who was performing as the shooting took place, described the scene as “beyond horrific”. He said he and his crew were safe, but added: “It hurts my heart that this would happen to anyone who was just coming out to enjoy what should have been a fun night.” Concertgoers reported seeing muzzle flashes from the upper floors of the Mandalay Bay hotel and several videos of the aftermath show hundreds of people fleeing in panic as shots continued. Around 22,000 people were attending the concert. Some flights have resumed at the city’s McCarran International airport after all planes were temporarily grounded on Sunday evening. The White House says Donald Trump is being briefed about the shooting. He just put out this tweet to express condolences. The shooting happened during a concert by country music star Jason Aldean. As reported earlier, he put out a statement to express his horror at the events and to reassure fans that he and his crew were safe. Seven albums into his career, Aldean is one of the most successful country music artists in the world. Born in Georgia in 1977, Aldean moved to Nashville at the age of 21. He initially struggled to break into the industry following a series of failed record contracts. Eventually, in 2005, he released his self-titled debut album, which gave him his first No 1 single on the US country charts. The album went platinum, a record also achieved by Aldean’s following five releases – his sales peaking with 2010’s My Kinda Party, which was certified triple-platinum. Over the years, Aldean has worked with acts including Bryan Adams, Kelly Clarkson and Ludacris, and in 2015 was announced as the only country musician to become a partner in Jay-Z’s streaming service Tidal. In 2016, Forbes estimated Aldean’s annual income at $36.5m, making him the fifth highest paid country music act in the world. Aldean is married to the former American Idol contestant Brittany Kerr, who is pregnant with the couple’s first child. He has two daughters from a previous marriage. Here are the main points and quotes from Lombardo’s latest press conference. Deadliest multiple shooting in US history We are looking at in excess of 50 individuals dead and over 200 individuals injured ... Obviously this is a tragic incident and one that we have never experienced in this valley. My condolences go out to the loved ones. That number for family and friends to get an update on loved ones is 1866 535 5654. One Las Vegas police officer among dead One [of our officers] was critical but is stable and one of my officers was off duty attending the concert and lost his life. Suspect named The suspect’s name is Stephen Paddock, with a date of birth of four nine of 1953. As far as history and background, we haven’t completed that part of the investigation. Several rifles were found in Paddock’s room We located numerous firearms within the room that he occupied. All’s we know is that they were rifles. We are executing a search warrant on the room. We have officers at his residence, and we will be executing a search warrant there also shortly. It is going to be a long and tedious investigation. We are bringing in all the resources of the FBI to assist us in this investigation, in particular to their victim witness advocates and their CSI folks to help us process the scene and ensure that we are getting all the evidence that we can possibly obtain. Police are confident they have located Paddock’s companion Marilou Danley We have located the vehicles that I had put out in the first briefing. We are confident but not 100% sure that we have located the female person of interest. I want the people to feel confident and calm that we have accomplished a lot in short period of time. The death toll of at least 50 people killed makes this the deadliest mass shooting in US history. It surpasses the Orlando shooting at the Pulse nightclub in June 2016 when 49 people were killed. One of the dead police officers worked for the LVPD but was off duty at the time, Lombardo says. Another one of the force’s officers is in a critical condition. Lombardo confirms that the dead suspect is Stephen Paddock. He says the investigation will be long and protracted. Lombardo says police have located Danley and the suspect’s vehicles. He said more than 50 people are dead and 200 wounded. Las Vegas sheriff Joseph Lombardo is about to give another press conference. Like NBC, CBS News has also named the dead suspect as Stephen Paddock. This has not been confirmed by police. A law enforcement source told CBS News a search warrant has been issued for the home of the shooter, identified as Stephen Paddock, of Mesquite, Nevada. Police there told CBS News the suspect was white, in his 60s, had been living in a retirement community and hadn’t had any run-ins with law enforcement. He wasn’t a veteran, Mesquite police added. Jake Owen, a country music star who played the set prior to Jason Aldean’s, wrote on Twitter that “gun shots were ringing off of the stage rigging and road cases” during the attack at the Route 91 festival. He suggested that the gunman was aiming at the stage at times. “No one knew where to go,” he added. “Thank you LVPD and responders for keeping us safe.” Other country music stars playing the festival have been reassuring fans of their safety, and sending condolences and prayers. Big &amp; Rich wrote that “everyone in the B&amp;R camp is ok thoughts and prayers to everyone in vegas”. Dylan Scott sent “prayers to everyone” and lamented “what is wrong with this world,” while Kane Brown tweeted: “This world is sick.” Josh Abbott said that he and his band were safe, along with his fiancée, who was locked down in her hotel room. On what appears to be her Facebook profile Danley describes herself as a “proud mum and grandma who lives life to the fullest”. NBC News has named the suspect as 64-year-old Stephen Paddock, citing “multiple sources”. The Guardian cannot verify this. The police say he has been identified as a Las Vegas resident, but have not released his name. His motives are not known. NBC said he has no known terrorist connections. Theresa May has expressed her condolences. Other world leaders, including Sweden’s prime minister, Stefan Löfven, and his Danish counterpart, Lars Løkke Rasmussen, have also expressed their horror at the shooting. MGM Resorts, the owners of the Mandalay Bay hotel where the suspect opened fire from the 32nd floor, said the building and others in the area are still on lockdown. Here’s video footage of that briefing by Sheriff Lombardo (see earlier for the text). Police have said little about why they want to track down Marilou Danley, the dead suspect’s “companion”. Sheriff Lombardo gave no details of whether she was suspected of involvement in the attack, describing her only as an “associate”. On her Facebook profile Danley describes herself as a “proud mum and grandma who lives life to the fullest.” The streets between Mandalay Bay hotel and Sunrise hospital, a nearby medical center, saw ambulances going back and forth between the scene for several hours, writes Daniel Hernandez in Las Vegas. Police shut down the south end of the strip corridor, displacing hundreds of tourists. Many of those who ran from the shooter sought refuge in budget motels, parking garages, and apartment complexes near the event. At a gas station across the street, survivors reunited with friends. Some were teary-eyed, still shaking with fear. Jackie Hoffing, a Las Vegas native, said: “We were there enjoying our time and it was very obvious it was gunfire coming down into the crowd. It was hysteria. There were people trampled. I ran and I jumped walls and I was only with my husband. He stayed with me. We jumped walls, climbed cars, ran for our lives. I’ve never run that hard or been that scared in my whole life.” Hoffing added: “We’ve been in the motel. We knocked on a random door and went in there and hid in the bathroom for the past two and a half hours. We stopped in the lobby and thought we were safe then they came in and said the suspect is here, everybody has to run. It was another stampede. It was more panic than reality. I was texting my children, I thought we were going to die. I told them ‘I love you’.” Krista Metz said: “I’m still shaking. Every time I start thinking about it I start shaking again. We took shelter in a condo with 30 other people.” Desiree Price, from San Diego, said: “I helped someone who was bleeding. (Her shirt and trousers are smeared with blood.) Two girls hid behind a car with us right outside the concert. One girl was shot in her leg, the other had in her shoulder. It didn’t stop so we all ran – we kept going.” Emily Anderson, 35, from San Diego, said: “I saw a lady get hit in the leg and her boyfriend dragging her out, and everyone was running. It was chaos.” Las Vegas police have released a photo of the dead suspect’s companion Marilou Danley. She is wanted for questioning. In his press conference Sheriff Lombardo said: “She is an Asian female, approximately 4ft 11in, weight of 111lbs. We have not located her at this time and we are interested in talking to her for follow up.” More than 20 people have been killed and well in excess of 100 were injured when a “lone wolf” gunman fired multiple shots at the Route 91 Harvest country music festival from a hotel overlooking the event. Two of those killed were off-duty police officers. The only suspect, whose motives are unknown, was killed by police. A Swat team used a controlled explosion to enter his hotel room on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel and casino. Police are searching for the suspect’s companion, Marilou Danley. She is wanted for questioning and is described as a person of interest. Jason Aldean, the country music star who was performing when the shooting took place, described the scene as “beyond horrific”. He said he and his crew were safe, but added: “It hurts my heart that this would happen to anyone who was just coming out to enjoy what should have been a fun night.” Concertgoers reported seeing muzzle flashes from the upper floors of the Mandalay Bay hotel and several videos of the aftermath show hundreds of people fleeing in panic as the gunfire continued. Around 40,000 people were attending the festival. Some flights have resumed at the city’s McCarran International airport after all planes were temporarily grounded on Sunday evening. Here are the main points and quotes from Sheriff Lombardo’s press conference: ‘Lone-wolf’ suspect killed At approximately 10.08pm we had calls coming of multiple shots being fired from the Mandalay Bay hotel towards the Route 91 concert, on the east side of Las Vegas Boulevard. There was a shooter on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay. Officers engaged the suspect at that location. He is dead. He has been identified. He is a local resident. I will not release his name at this time ... We are confident that the primary aggressor in this event has expired, or passed away and is no longer a threat. We do not know what his belief system was at this time. We believe he is the sole aggressor at this point and the scene is static. We are attempting to locate the person of interest. Right now we believe it is a sole actor, a lone wolf-type actor and we have the place under control. Asked if the shooter was part of a militant group, Lombardo said “no”. At least 20 dead including two police officers We have well in excess of 100-plus injured and an excess of 20-plus that have died. I have two police officers who are currently at the hospital, one in critical condition and the other with minor injuries. There were other police officers that were off duty attending the concert, that have expired. We don’t have those individuals identified at this point. Police searching for suspect’s companion We are interested in a companion that is travelling with him [the suspect]. Her name is Marilou Danley. She is an Asian female, approximately 4ft 11in, weight of 111lbs. We have not located her at this time and we are interested in talking to her for follow up. Police search for suspect’s vehicles [There are] two vehicles we are interested in locating. We have a Hyundai Tucson [of unknown colour] with Nevada plate 114B40 and a Chrysler Pacifica Touring, [of unknown colour], Nevada plate 19D401. These are the plates registered to the suspect that we located at the Mandalay Bay. No other shooters are at large There has been multiple conjecture coming through social media that there are multiple shooters at other resorts. That has been proven to be false. Additionally, there have been accusations or beliefs that there is some explosive going off. That is also false. The only explosive contained in this event was our Swat team breaching the room. We are pretty confident that there is no longer a threat other than we are attempting to locate the person of interest. Plea for video evidence Anybody that may have cell phone video or any type of video that would be of benefit to the investigation, please respond to the LVPD HQ and we will take custody of that video. Lombardo said “20 plus” people were killed and “100 plus” were injured. Police officers were among the dead, he said. “The primary aggressor is dead ... the scene is static,” Lombardo confirmed. The dead man lived locally and his motives were not known. There were no explosives involved in the attack but police used a controlled explosion to get to the suspect, he said. The suspected shooter is dead but his companion, Marilou Danley, is still at large, according to Joseph Lombardo, the sheriff of the Las Vegas Metropolitan police department. Lombardo would not give a name for the dead shooter but confirmed he opened fire from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel. Jason Aldean, the country star who was performing as the shooting took place, has issued a statement to express his horror. Writing on Instagram he said: Tonight has been beyond horrific. I still dont know what to say but wanted to let everyone know that Me and my Crew are safe. My Thoughts and prayers go out to everyone involved tonight. It hurts my heart that this would happen to anyone who was just coming out to enjoy what should have been a fun night. We’re still waiting for a police press conference that was due to start 30 minutes ago. Joseph Lombardo, the sheriff of the Las Vegas Metropolitan police department, is due to give an update. Police have confirmed that one suspect is “down” and they do not believe there are any other shooters. More harrowing footage shows the scene outside the Mandalay Bay hotel and the festival venue. Some people stayed down and tended to those injured while others fled as multiple shots were heard. Several off-duty police officers from Bakersfield, California, were at the concert. One was shot in the shoulder, according to a statement published by the KGET News reporter Danny Freeman. Some flights at McCarran International airport have resumed after all flights in and out of Las Vegas were temporarily halted. Here’s footage of the Jason Aldean concert initially carrying on as multiple shots are heard. The performance then stops and festivalgoers flee as gunfire continues. Las Vegas police say they do not believe any more shooters are at large after confirming that a suspect is “down”. Witnesses said the country singer Jason Aldean was performing near the end of the concert when the gunfire began. He was due on stage at 9.40pm, according to the festival programme. Kodiak Yazzi, 36, told Associated Press that he and his girlfriend were watching Aldean’s performance when he heard what sounded like fireworks. The music stopped temporarily and started up again before another round of gunfire sent the performers ducking for cover and fleeing the stage. Thousands fled as bursts of gunfire could be heard for more than five minutes, Yazzi said. The Las Vegas police chief, Joseph Lombardo, is due to give a press conference in about 15 minutes. It confirmed that one suspect is down. Las Vegas police say one suspect is “down” after the shooting, according to AP. It quotes the University Medical Center spokeswoman Danita Cohen as saying 26 people had been admitted to the hospital. Concertgoers reported seeing muzzle flashes from the upper floors of the Mandalay Bay hotel and casino across Las Vegas Boulevard from the country music festival and the sound of what they described as automatic gunfire. Some later huddled in the basement of the nearby Tropicana hotel casino. Some officers took cover behind their vehicles while others carrying assault rifles ran into the Mandalay Bay hotel and casino. Authorities shut down part of the Las Vegas strip and Interstate 15. Witnesses say country singer Jason Aldean was playing near the end of the concert when gunfire began. The University Medical Center spokeswoman Danita Cohen said the Las Vegas hospital was taking in several people with gunshot wounds. Reuters quoted a hospital spokesman saying that 14 of those taken to hospital were “critically wounded”. This is Matthew Weaver with live coverage of the aftermath of a multiple shooting in Las Vegas. Here’s what we know so far: At least two people have been killed and 24 injured after a suspect, or suspects, opened fire at a country music festival across the road from the Mandalay Bay casino and hotel. Police have warned the public to stay away and confirmed that the investigation is still active. The authorities received reports of an active shooter near the Route 91 Harvest festival. Those in the hotel report that it is on lockdown. A Twitter feed citing police scanners said two gunmen who had shot at a bodyguard, and police were on the 32nd floor of the hotel. Witnesses heard numerous gunshots at the casino hotel, where police tactical teams are searching for the attacker. Some flights destined for the McCarran International airport in Las Vegas have been diverted due to the shooting."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2017/oct/02/heidi-allen-tory-mp-theresa-may-universal-credit","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-02T13:35:12Z","webTitle":"Universal credit rollout will go ahead despite Tory MPs' call for delay","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/oct/02/heidi-allen-tory-mp-theresa-may-universal-credit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/oct/02/heidi-allen-tory-mp-theresa-may-universal-credit","fields":{"headline":"Universal credit rollout will go ahead despite Tory MPs' call for delay","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The government is to press ahead with its rollout of universal credit, the work and pensions secretary has confirmed, despite a last-minute appeal from Tory backbenchers for a delay. More than a dozen Conservative MPs had raised concerns with David Gauke’s department that claimants were being forced to use food banks because of the mandatory six-week wait to receive money. On Monday, the MP who led the plea, Heidi Allen, appealed directly to Theresa May to intervene. But in his speech to the Conservative party conference in Manchester, Gauke praised the controversial system, which is being gradually introduced around the country. “Universal credit is working,” he said. “So I can confirm that the rollout will continue, and to the planned timetable. “We’re not going to rush things; it is more important to get this right than to do this quickly, and this won’t be completed until 2022. But across the country, we will continue to transform our welfare system to further support those who aspire to work.” Gauke said the government would be “refreshing the guidance” to staff at the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) over the possibility of giving advance payments to claimants in difficulty. “Claimants who want an advance payment will not have to wait six weeks, they will receive this advance within five working days,” Gauke said. “And if someone is in immediate need, then we fast-track the payment, meaning they will receive it on the same day.” Debbie Abrahams, the shadow work and pensions secretary, condemned the confirmation of the rollout, saying Gauke “should immediately end the misery caused by the six-week wait for payment of universal credit”. Charities and campaign groups also expressed concern. Child Poverty Action Group said it welcomed the government being more proactive on advance payments, but its chief executive, Alison Garnham, said: “Given the serious and wide-ranging concerns about nearly every aspect of universal credit, we had hoped for more on how the government plans to address the funding, policy design and administrative problems plaguing universal credit before it is rolled out to families.” Gillian Guy, the chief executive of Citizens Advice, said it was good that Gauke had recognised there were problems. “However, we are disappointed he has not taken this opportunity to pause the rollout to ensure the problems are fixed before it speeds up significantly. “Evidence from Citizens Advice and others – including the DWP itself – shows many people risk getting into serious debt as a result of delayed first payments. Advance payments can help people make ends meet during this period, but they must be combined with more action to reduce the number of people waiting more than six weeks for their initial payment.” Speaking earlier on Monday, Allen said she and 14 other Conservative MPs, two more than originally reported, had written to the government calling for the rollout to be paused. “My understanding is there isn’t any legislation that might stop or start this, it is already in train. It is more a question of whether it reflects what we heard the prime minister say when she first became PM on the steps of No 10,” Allen told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “She showed to me a really clear understanding of people who are struggling to make ends meet. “So to me, it doesn’t fit with that belief in a moral compass. These are the vulnerable people with no recourse to savings. We should be supporting them, because universal credit is about supporting people in work and helping them move up the working ladder and take on more hours. That is who we should, as Conservatives, be supporting.” Allen’s comments came after the former government official Dame Louise Casey, who conducted a year-long study for ministers into community cohesion, likened pressing ahead with the universal credit rollout to “jumping over a cliff”. She told BBC Radio 4’s PM programme on Friday that the changes, which involve merging six benefits into a single monthly payment, made her “hair stand on end”. Casey, who led the rough sleepers unit under Tony Blair’s Labour government, said the plans, which have been tried on 530,000 claimants, would “end up making the situation worse for people that are working poor, let alone people that are on benefits”. The Labour MP Frank Field, who chairs the work and pensions select committee, said: “David Gauke has today pressed the button that will cause havoc to hundreds of thousands of poorer people’s lives, building up to a meltdown over Christmas. “It is not too late for him to act politically wisely, as well as compassionately. People must be put before arbitrary rollout dates of a project which cannot work.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/live/2017/oct/02/uk-manufacturing-growth-hard-brexit-eurozone-monarch-airline-fails-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-02T19:54:28Z","webTitle":"US factory growth hits 13-year high, but UK economy 'loses momentum' – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/oct/02/uk-manufacturing-growth-hard-brexit-eurozone-monarch-airline-fails-business-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2017/oct/02/uk-manufacturing-growth-hard-brexit-eurozone-monarch-airline-fails-business-live","fields":{"headline":"US factory growth hits 13-year high, but UK economy 'loses momentum' – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"And finally.... European stock markets mostly ended the day higher, although Spain was dragged down by worries over how Catalonia’s push for independence may develop. In London, the FTSE 100 closed 66 points higher at 7,438, a rise of 0.9%. Germany’s DAX gained 0.6% and France’s CAC rose by 0.4%. But Spain’s IBEX had a bad day, losing 1.2% following Sunday’s violent clashes over the disputed Catalan referendum. David Madden of CMC Markets explains: The Spanish stock market is suffering after the violent images and footage that were broadcasted around the world yesterday of the Catalonian independence referendum. The use of force by police officers shocked viewers around the globe, and the heightened tensions in the region have prompted investors to cash in their positions. Opinion polls in advance of the referendum suggested that the pro-independence side were in a minority, but I suspect Madrid’s actions will drive up calls for independence. The political uncertainty is weighing on their stock market, and until the situation is solved, traders will be wary. And that’s all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, reckons the tensions gripping Britain’s Conservative Party have helped to drag the pound down today. He writes: “It has not been a Monday to remember for the pound, and the remainder of the week poses further challenges to the UK currency. “This morning’s underwhelming manufacturing PMI reading could well spur a sell off, while Theresa May’s premiership is coming under increasing scrutiny, and that’s likely to leave the pound losing further ground. That scrutiny has been fuelled by foreign secretary Boris Johnson, with a series of interviews and speeches in recent days that have challenged May over Brexit. Yesterday, the PM was even asked whether Johnson was ‘unsackable’, following claims that he was actually trying to get the boot -- either to bolster support for a future leadership challenge, or simply because he’s struggling to make ends meet on his ministerial salary (a mere £140,000....). The US economy appears to be romping ahead, if today’s ISM factory survey is any guide. Capital Economics explain: The rise in the ISM manufacturing index to a 13-year high of 60.8 in September, from 58.8, is the latest illustration of the benefit to the manufacturing sector from the weaker dollar and strong global demand. The index is now, at face value, consistent with GDP growth surging above 5% annualised in the second half of this year. Over in Greece the government has tabled its first draft of the 2018 budget, in which its projects a primary surplus target of 3.5%. Helena Smith reports from Athens. Presenting the draft before the House, alternative finance minister George Chouliarakis called it the last budget Greece would experience under international supervision. Chouliarakis declared: “It is clear that this will be the last budget under a [bailout] program”. The draft, which is expected to be voted on this December, foresees the debt-stricken country not only achieving a primary surplus of 3.5% next year (high by any standards) but a GDP growth rate of 2.4%. Athens’ leftist-led government has said it want to make a “clean exit” with the country’s return to markets its third international bailout programme expires next August. Greece’s has been shored up to the tune of more than €300bn since its near economic collapse in 2010. Mexico’s factories also had a good September. Activity grew at the fastest rate in 16 months, sending the Mexico manufacturing PMI up to 52.8 last month, from 52.2 in August. The jump in US factory growth is helping to keep Wall Street at record highs today. The Dow Jones industrial average has gained 74 points, or 0.3%, to 22,479. The rally is led by Intel, Procter &amp; Gamble and Goldman Sachs, who have all gained 1%. This chart from Danske Bank shows how US manufacturing has strengthened in recent months (according to ISM, anyway). Wow! America’s factory sector has posted its fastest growth in 13 years. The Institute for Supply Management’s manufacturing activity index jumped to 60.8 in September, from 58.8 in August. Any reading over 50 shows growth. This is the fastest acceleration in 13 years, and it suggests that the US economy ended the last quarter strongly. Firms reported that new orders accelerated last month, encouraging them to take on more staff and boost production. But.... companies also experienced a big jump in material costs (as we also saw in the UK earlier). This upbeat message is backed up by Markit’s rival US PMI index, released a few minutes ago. It also rose last month, but to a more modest 53.1. Canada’s manufacturing sector has posted another month of solid manufacturing growth. The Canadian factory PMI has risen to 55.0, up from 54.6 in August. Factory bosses reported that output and new business growth both jumped in September, with job creation also up. Brazil’s manufacturing survey is out....and it shows that the sector expanded a little in September. The Brazilian factory PMU came in at 50.9, matching August’s level, which indicates slow but steady growth. Sterling has just hit a three-week low against the dollar, down 1%, or 1.3 cents at $1.3265. The pound has also shed 0.5% against the euro, to €1.128, as this morning’s factory slowdown continues to weigh. Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM, says: Sterling got off to a rough start during Monday’s trading session after weaker than expected data from Britain’s manufacturing sector, suggested that the economy could be losing momentum. It’s turning into the worst day for the pound since early June - after the last general election. Uber’s UK boss, Jo Bertram, has stepped down to do something “new and exciting” instead – as the ride-hailing firm fights to retain its licence to operate in London. More here. It’s Conservative Party conference week! And chancellor Phillip Hammond has tried to excite delegates in Manchester by extending the Help to Buy scheme. Hammond announced that the government will provide an extra £10bn to the scheme, which lets people get a loan from the government to help buy a newly build house. This will let the scheme run until 2021, Hammond said, meaning it can help an estimated 130,000 more homebuyers over the next few years. Marvellous stuff! Except, some experts reckon Help to Buy is a deeply flawed idea that pumps up house prices rather than tackling problems with supply. After all, if you don’t build more houses, you’ll simply have more people chasing the ones on the market. Sam Bowman, Executive Director of the Adam Smith Institute, gave the scheme a serious hoofing, saying: “Reviving Help to Buy is like throwing petrol onto a bonfire. The property market is totally dysfunctional because supply is so tightly constrained by planning rules, and adding more demand without improving the supply of houses is just going to raise house prices and make homes more unaffordable for people who don’t qualify for the Help to Buy subsidy. Shares in Britain’s biggest housebuilders have jumped this morning, with Persimmon gaining 3.7% and Barratt up 3.5%. City traders have worker out that Hammond’s new cash injection will boost their profits..... Sterling has made a poor start to October, falling almost one cent against the US dollar to $1.3296. The slowdown in UK factory growth last month didn’t help the pound, as it has stirred concerns over the health of the wider economy. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says: The market never appreciates signs of a slowdown, especially when they are likely linked to the thick fog of uncertainty still surrounding Brexit. Tomorrow we get a healthcheck on Britain’s construction sector, followed by the big one - the services PMI - on Wednesday. Kathleen Brooks of City Index suspects that these surveys may be underwhelming. We expect the rest of the surveys to also show signs of moderation as the UK economy enters a period of slow cooling rather than falling off a cliff. There is another factor, though. The US dollar is strengthening, on rumours that the next head of the US Federal Reserve could be Kevin Warsh. He’s seen as more hawkish than Janet Yellen, the current Fed chair, so could raise interest rates more aggressively. Nicholas Megaw of the Financial Times makes a good point about the PMI -- UK firms aren’t receiving enough support from the weak pound. He writes: This month’s survey showed less benefit from the pound, with fewer firms reporting a boost to overseas demand while more reported an increase in cost inflation. Input price inflation hit a six-month high, with higher commodity prices and supply chain pressures also driving up costs. Here’s our economics correspondent Richard Partington on today’s UK factory survey: Britain’s manufacturers slowed the pace of output in September amid a rise in production costs linked to the weak pound. The Markit/Cips UK manufacturing PMI barometer of factory sentiment showed activity fell to 55.9 last month from 56.9 in August, as the cost of goods used in the production process increased to a six-month high. Although the reading was below City expectations, the figure is still above the 50 mark that separates expansion from contraction. But the survey of purchasing executives in more than 600 industrial companies points to weaker growth in the UK economy. Rob Dobson, the director at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey, said: “Although it looks as if the sector made solid progress through the third quarter as a whole, the growth slowdown in September is a further sign that momentum is being lost across the broader UK economy.” While the report showed gains in new orders to be slower than in the prior month, companies reported that demand remained solid in both domestic and overseas markets. But the rising cost of commodities, and the weak pound pushing up the price of other raw materials, damaged optimism in the industrial sector. Scotiabank’s Alan Clarke said the figures were disappointing but far from a weak reading on the UK economy. “In the big scheme of things, this is reasonably in keeping with what we have seen over the past year,” he said. More here: Over at Luton airport, passengers who hoped to fly with Monarch Airlines today have been scrambling to find alternative flights - or going home disappointed. One was Mark Henson, 50, from Dover. He arrived at the airport at 4am for the same flight to Portugal, and was told it had been cancelled. He told Press Association: “We got told to go home: ‘We can’t help you so you may as well go home.’ “He told me I wouldn’t be be able to get a flight.” Mr Henson was able to book two seats on a flight on Monday evening but said it was a “scandal” that prices on other airlines were so high. He accused companies of “money-making” out of “somebody else’s misery”. The slowdown in factory growth may be partly due to Brexit uncertainty. Bosses will be reluctant to buy expensive new machinery until they know what trading conditions they will face from 2019. Shannon Murphy, assistant head of risk underwriting at Euler Hermes, says firms needs clarity: “Manufacturers across a range of sectors, particularly steel and oil and gas, are cashing in on sterling’s fall in the last year while the UK continues to reap the benefits of the Single Market. However, businesses are not committing to long term investments and the flip side of the weaker pound is that increased input costs are weighing down on margins. “The promise of a transition deal has provided reassurance, but manufacturers are calling for negotiations to progress quickly on trade and EU workers’ rights to settle the nerves on the availability of qualified overseas employees and new investment.” We shouldn’t be too gloomy about UK manufacturing. The sector has now racked up 14 months of growth in a row, having shrunk immediately after last year’s EU referendum. Ms Lee Hopley, chief economist at EEF, says UK factories are struggling to meet orders because they’ve failed to invest in new equipment: Emerging problems in the supply chain, signalled by lengthening lead times, are likely related to the subdued investment performance of the past few quarters. Companies will only satisfy some of their capacity needs through additional recruitment which needs to be complemented with higher capital spend on productivity enhancing investment. With the demand outlook holding up, government action in the forthcoming Budget to spur companies to commit to investment in the UK will be a priority.” Worryingly, some UK factories are struggling to deliver their orders in time due to supply shortages, according to the PMI report. Duncan Brock, Director of Customer Relationships at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply, explains: “The biggest news this month is the fall in the productivity of manufacturing supply chains as suppliers lost the fight to keep on top of promised delivery times and their performance weakened to the greatest extent for six-and-a-half years. The blame lay squarely at the feet of capacity constraints and some commodity shortages in food, but also other materials such as plastics and steel. British factories will probably be forced to pass their higher raw material costs onto consumers, which could push UK inflation even higher. Mike Rigby, Head of Manufacturing at Barclays, warns: With cost pressures remaining elevated and margins being increasingly squeezed, it’s only a matter of time before manufacturers raise prices which will likely impact the domestic demand that has been fuelling growth in the sector.” The drop in the UK factory PMI in September suggests Britain’s economy is losing momentum, warns Rob Dobson, Director at IHS Markit. He says: “The latest PMI survey showed a modest deceleration in the rates of expansion in UK manufacturing production and new orders. Although it looks as if the sector made solid progress through the third quarter as a whole, the growth slowdown in September is a further sign that momentum is being lost across the broader UK economy. Exports remain a bright spot, however, still rising at one of the strongest rates over the past six-and-a-half years. Dobson also warns that rising commodity prices and the weak pound will continue to drive import costs up. That will “dent profitability and potentially disrupt production schedules in coming months”. Just in: UK factory growth slowed last month, as Britain failed to match the eurozone’s strong performance. The UK’s factory PMI , which measures activity across the sector, fell to 55.9 in September, from August’s 56.7. That is weaker than the City expected, and shows that the sector expanded at a more modest rate. Encouragingly, the survey found the new exports remained solid. Data firm Markit says: Growth of new export business remained among the best registered over the past six-and-a-half years. There were reports of increased sales to Europe, the USA, China and Brazil. Some firms also mentioned an ongoing boost from the historical weakness of sterling, although this was less prominent as a factor than earlier in the year But firms were also hit by higher costs, with input price inflation hitting its highest rate since March. That’s due to rising commodity prices and the knock-on impact of the pound’s fall last year (which is still rippling through the economy). Reaction to follow.... Breaking! The eurozone’s manufacturing sector has posted its best month since early 2011. That’s according to data firm Markit, whose euro area factory PMI has jumped to 58.1, the highest in six and a half years. That’s up from August’s 57.4, and shows that the sector grew strongly (any reading over 50 shows an expansion). Factory bosses reported that new orders piled in last month, mainly from overseas customers. That encouraged them to take on new staff, at the fastest rate since Markit started tracking the sector two decade ago. The recovery was pretty broad-based too, with Germany and the Netherlands recording the strongest growth. Encouragingly, Greek factories also reported growth, at the fastest rate in almost a decade. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, reckons the recovery could continue for some time.... The eurozone manufacturing boom kicked into an even higher gear in September..... “Surging order book growth has encouraged manufacturers to take on extra staff at a rate never previously seen in the 20-year history of the PMI survey. Despite this expansion of capacity, backlogs of incomplete work built up at a faster rate, suggesting that the hiring upturn has plenty more room to run. Over in Madrid, shares have fallen following yesterday’s referendum in Catalonia, and the violent clashes between Spanish police and those trying to take part. Catalonian president Carles Puigdemont has indicated that the region could declare independence after Sunday’s poll, even though the vote had already been declared illegal by Spain’s constitutional court. Catalan officials say 90% of votes were cast in favour of independence, although the turnout was only 42.3% [it might have been higher if Spanish police hadn’t disrupted the vote, dragged people out by the hair and fired rubber bullet at crowds protecting poling stations]. With the next step uncertain, bank shares led the selloff in Spain - knocking almost 1% off the IBEX index. Spanish government bonds have also been hit, pushing the gap between Spain’s borrowing costs and Germany’s close to a four-month high. The Unite union has accused Theresa May’s government of ‘sitting on its hands’ and allowing Monarch to fail. Monarch needed help due to terror attacks in Egypt and Tunisia, which encouraged more rivals to compete on its Spanish roots. The “decimation” of the tourist trade in Turkey was another crucial factor. But Unite argues that Monarch could have kept flying if ministers had given it a ‘bridging loan’, to cover the cost of restructuring its business. After all, Angela Merkel provided Air Berlin with credit lines in August when it fell into insolvency, preventing its collapse. National officer Oliver Richardson says Britain should learn from Germany’s example: Continuing uncertainty surrounding Brexit and the ability of UK airlines to fly freely in Europe after the UK has left the EU undoubtedly hindered Monarch getting the investment it needed to restructure and survive. “This uncertainty, combined with the apparent unwillingness of the Government to assist at commercial rates and at a profit to the taxpayer, has left thousands of jobs at a great British airline hanging by a thread. “Now is not the time for Government ministers to wash their hands of a problem they have contributed to. “Ministers need to act fast by intervening in a similar way as their German counterparts did with Air Berlin and help secure a future for Monarch.” Monarch’s unhappy demise is good news for its rivals, including Ryanair, which is going through its own crisis right now (having cancelled flights due to a lack of pilots). Shares in easyJet have jumped by 5% at the start of trading, while BA’s parent company, IAG, are up 2%. Ryanair’s share are up over 3%. Following Monarch’s collapse at 4am, the Civil Aviation Authority is now conducting the “biggest ever peacetime repatriation” in UK history. Two flights from Ibiza have already landed this morning, at Gatwick and Birmingham, but that still leaves over 100,000 people abroad. Anyone who arrives at a UK airport hoping to fly with Monarch Airlines will be disappointed today: Here’s our Q&amp;A on what they should do: UK manufacturers fear they could lose £17bn per year in European sales if Britain leaves the EU under a ‘Hard Brexit’. That’s according to a new report from top law firm Baker McKenzie, which examines the implications of Britain defaulting to World Trade Organisation rules. It found that Britain’s Automotive, Technology, Healthcare and Consumer Goods businesses would all suffer if new tariffs were imposed. Crucially, those four sectors export almost half their products to the UK; while the UK accounts for just 9% of exports from the EU. That implies Britain would suffer more than the UK under a ‘Hard Brexit’ scenario. But can’t Britain just export more to China, the US, Korea, etc?... ....Yes, but this report reckons that UK exports to five key markets need to increase by 60% to offset ‘hard Brexit’ EU export loss. Baker McKenzie Trade partner Jenny Revis says: “These figures indicate the extent to which the UK’s key manufacturing sectors are likely to be hit by the impact of a hard Brexit. You can understand why there is now mounting pressure for the UK to negotiate new customs arrangements for post Brexit trade with the EU and for companies to work with their industry groups to help shape future trading relations with the EU.” The report also questions whether German car makers, for example, would push chancellor Angela Merkel to give the UK a good Brexit deal (as some commentators claim). While Britain does buy a lot of German cars -- Britain is simply a less important market to Europe than Europe is to Britain, as this chart shows: This may give Brussels the upper hand in the ongoing Brexit negotiations, warns Ross Denton of Baker McKenzie: “We have heard a lot about how much Europe exports to the UK, for example, in the automotive sector. “That may be true in numerical terms, but when you look at this as a percentage of their trade, you can clearly see that the EU exports a lot more broadly, to a whole host of other markets, and consequently, it is far less dependant on the UK as a market than the UK is on it. This will have significant implications for upcoming negotiations.” Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Today we discover how Britain’s factories performed last month, as data firm IHS Markit publishes its health check on manufacturers across the globe. Economists expect the UK factory PMI to drop to 56.2, from last month’s 56.9. That would indicate that growth slowed a little but remains solid (anything over 50 shows growth). Konstantinos Anthis of ADS Securities says the figures could hit sterling. The pound will be making headlines as well as the PMI figures from all 3 sectors of the domestic economy are pending for release over the next few days. Today the release of the Manufacturing figures will set the stage and analysts are expecting a softer reading which could dampen expectations for a stronger pound in October. The British currency saw a strong performance during September following renewed bullishness from the Bank of England that suggested that a higher interest rate policy might be needed to arrest the rallying inflation. A flurry of PMIs from across the world will also show how the global economy fared in September. The other big news this morning is that Britain’s fifth-biggest airline, Monarch, has collapsed overnight leaving 110,000 holidaymakers stranded overseas. It’s the biggest collapse of a UK airline ever, according to the Civil Aviation Authority, and means 300,000 bookings have also been cancelled. The UK is now scrambling to arrange new flight to get people home. The CAA chief executive, Andrew Haines, says: “We are putting together, at very short notice and for a period of two weeks, what is effectively one of the UK’s largest airlines to manage this task. The scale and challenge of this operation means that some disruption is inevitable. We ask customers to bear with us as we work around the clock to bring everyone home.” European traders will also be watching events in Spain closely, following the disturbing scenes of violence in Catalonia yesterday Here’s the agenda: 9am BST: Eurozone manufacturing PMI for September 9.30am BST: UK manufacturing PMI for September 10am BST: Eurozone unemployment report for August 2.30pm BST: Canadian manufacturing PMI for September 3pm BST: US manufacturing PMI for September"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2017/oct/07/from-graham-to-the-skywhale-the-unsettling-mutations-of-patricia-piccinini","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-06T21:36:39Z","webTitle":"From Graham to the Skywhale: the unsettling mutations of Patricia Piccinini","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/oct/07/from-graham-to-the-skywhale-the-unsettling-mutations-of-patricia-piccinini","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2017/oct/07/from-graham-to-the-skywhale-the-unsettling-mutations-of-patricia-piccinini","fields":{"headline":"From Graham to the Skywhale: the unsettling mutations of Patricia Piccinini","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Walking through Patricia Piccinini’s Melbourne studio is more like wandering through a cabinet of monstrous curiosities than visiting an artist’s workspace. Observed within: a beast nursing a human child at her breast. Miniature anatomical models. Organic forms mouthing soundless words from the walls. Boxes and boxes of feathers. The severed head of a mannequin child upon a table. An immobile bird of prey made entirely from hair. A baby fused with an egg. The resemblance of these rooms to a zoology lab or old surgeon’s college is unsurprising; Piccinini tells me she taught herself to draw in an anatomy museum. In a space like that, she says, hers was the advantage: “The models always remained still.”’ Since then, the multidisciplinary Australian artist has attracted global renown for figurative works that render fantastic, hybrid-human creatures in such anatomic detail that their stillness seems their most unnatural feature. This year, two of Australia’s major galleries have announced separate exhibitions of the artist’s strange, motionless menageries: Brisbane’s Gallery of Modern Art are staging the most comprehensive retrospective of her work to date next year; and later this month, Piccinini will have seven works at the National Gallery’s Hyper Real exhibition in Canberra. While her creatures may allude to something orphic and arcane, Piccinini’s own framework remains as observational and material as a dissecting room. “I like 19th century social realism,” she says. “[They depicted] how the Industrial Revolution had an effect on the everyday people. I’m interested in the same thing that’s happening now, in how technological innovation is changing the way that we see the body.” Piccinini’s explorations of biology’s potential for change led the New York Times to hail her “sculptures of life forms that don’t exist”. Over the last few years her unique, three-dimensional monsters made of parts both familiar and strange have made their way into collections across with world, as well as into the Australian popular imagination. The infamous Skywhale – a titanic, 100-foot-long hot air ball with ten pendulous breasts and a friendly face – first floated over Canberra, commissioned for the city’s centenary celebrations in 2013, before travelling as far afield as Japan and Ireland. Last year, the Transport Accident Commission invited the artist to propose what the human body would have to look like in order to resist a high-impact car crash. The result was “Graham”: a thick-necked survivor with a reinforced skull cavity and sacks of air across his chest. Graham made international news. They are but two amongst Piccinini’s many unsettling mutations of human and animal forms. Her Madonnas are not clothed for piety but brazen and naked, half-ape, bristling with hair. Babies in swaddling have adult faces and snouts. Nature’s expected laws of delineation – defining scales from skin, bones from feathers, sacs from follicles – are collapsed, all rules rewritten. What’s uncanny about Piccinini’s work is not that an artist’s mind can conjure such creatures. It’s that the finesse of their detail make every variegated body that she crafts seem suddenly possible. But for Piccinini, the beasts she invents are the logical conclusion of what is possible within the ongoing material conversation between evolutionary forces and environmental ones. Describing herself as “ambivalent about technology”, her relationship to its potential is not so much dystopian as it is technical and explorative. To create Graham, she worked with a trauma surgeon and a crash investigator. “I really listened and internalised the science of it,” she said at the time, “then I approached it in a creative way, on an emotional level.” Juxtapositions of the scientific against the emotional are perhaps to be expected from an artist whose first university degree was in economics, at the Australian National University. The course offered her understanding of human systems, activity and phenomenons of mass behaviour – although the insight she shares with me was in learning not how the world works, “but how people think the world works”. The false perception, the artist declares, is that supply and demand drive productivity; for Piccinini, the motivation for all human productivity is desire. It’s a conclusion expressed with the considered sincerity that defines Piccinini’s approach to her own creative process. Discussing the upcoming Hyper Real exhibition – where she will be featured alongside artists including Belinda de Bruyckere and Ron Mueck – Piccinini explains the continuing appeal of realism with articulate care. “If you’re making art that’s the opposite of realism – which is a kind of formalism – then it’s difficult for everyday person to connect with that, because to understand formalism … you have to have a knowledge of [it] and a background in it,” she explains. “That can be alienating … whereas realism has the potential to be so inclusive. Anyone can connect to it – because it’s what they know.” At Brisbane’s QAGOMA, the spectrum of what the artist intends as a “compassionate vision” of the body will be recognised with some scale. The Curious Affection exhibition will fill the gallery’s entire ground floor with a decade’s worth of Piccinini’s most recognisable works, as well as a bespoke large-scale new inflatable sculpture and an immersive multisensory installation. I have my own experience of aesthetic immersion in Piccinini’s studio when she takes me into its “hair room”. In it, an assistant is sewing individual hairs into the arms of a fleshy figure frozen in the act of giving birth. Were it not got the gentle, intellectual presence of Piccinini herself, I’d be freaking out and bolting for the door. But, of course, these are not real pieces of body or dissections of flesh; they’re instruments of a discursive project - even if the hair itself is human. As Piccinini reminds me, with some tenderness: “I use realism, but I don’t want to represent reality. I want to represent ideas.” • Hyper Real, featuring the work of Patricia Piccinini alongside Ron Mueck, Sam Jinks and Belinda de Bruyckere, opens at the National Gallery of Australia, Canberra on 20 October.

Presenting the trophy to the US captain, Steve Stricker, at the Presidents Cup golf tournament in New Jersey, Trump said: “On behalf of all of the people of Texas, and all of the people – if you look today and see what is happening, how horrible it is, but we have it under really great control – Puerto Rico and the people of Florida who have really suffered over this last short period of time with the hurricanes, I want to just remember them. “And we’re going to dedicate this trophy to all of those people that went through so much that we love, a part of our great state, really a part of our great nation.” Trump tweeted a video of him presenting the trophy later on Sunday. Earlier on Sunday Trump dismissed those who questioned his administration’s commitment to rebuilding Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria as “politically motivated ingrates”, alluding to San Juan’s mayor, Carmen Yulín Cruz. The president spent much of the weekend at his New Jersey golf club and then attended the tournament. Trump was the first sitting president to present the tournament’s winning team with a trophy. The president said the players were “a tremendous group of folks” and called them “great champions”. His administration has been criticised for allegedly failing to do enough to help Puerto Rico as most of its 3.4 million residents struggle with a lack of power, shortages of water and collapsed infrastructure following Hurricane Maria. Trump and senior administration figures are set to visit Puerto Rico on Tuesday, at which point they will come face to face with the ongoing hardship on an island that is home to 3.5 million American citizens. There have been some signs of tentative progress made. The Trump administration has been rattled by the criticism from Yulín Cruz, and by a growing theme on social media and cable news comparing the apparently sluggish response to the Puerto Rican disaster to the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans in 2005. Trump said in tweets that the federal government has done “a great job with the almost impossible situation”. But the Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer, said Trump should stop wasting time attacking Puerto Rico officials who were seeking hurricane relief and “roll up his sleeves and get to work”. White House officials said the administration was doing all it could to help victims of Hurricane Maria. Budget director Mick Mulvaney said the public needed to “judge us by the actions, please” in terms of efforts to help Puerto Rico. He said Trump was responding after Yulín Cruz criticised him for not doing enough when, Mulvaney said, “the progress is there, and the effort is there”. The Treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, said Cruz’s comments were “unfair” and that “when the president gets attacked, he attacks back”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/oct/02/sydney-property-drops-after-17-month-climb-but-melbourne-rises","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-02T05:40:52Z","webTitle":"Sydney property drops after 17-month climb but Melbourne rises","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/02/sydney-property-drops-after-17-month-climb-but-melbourne-rises","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/oct/02/sydney-property-drops-after-17-month-climb-but-melbourne-rises","fields":{"headline":"Sydney property drops after 17-month climb but Melbourne rises","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Sydney’s housing market is finally showing signs of slowing, with new data revealing prices have dropped for the first time in more than a year. Melbourne and Hobart continued to record strong growth in September. The 0.1% fall marked the first time Sydney’s property market has gone backwards in 17 months. Across Australia, combined capital growth was only 0.7% during the quarter down from peaks of 3.5% less than a year ago in December 2016. Property analyics firm CoreLogic said the figures showed the housing market was “clearly losing steam” and that tighter lending rules were affecting the market. “This slowing in the combined capitals growth trend is heavily influenced by conditions across the Sydney market where capital gains have stalled,” analyst Tim Lawless said. Across the quarter, Sydney’s market only grew by 0.2%, while annual growth has been pegged back to 10.5% from 13% in August. Sydney’s median dwelling value is $909,613. The news of a slowing market will likely be welcomed by regulators. The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority has sought to tighten interest-only mortgage lending and the Reserve Bank of Australia has warned about the rise in household debt. However, other capital city markets continued to grow during the same period. Prices in Melbourne grew by 0.9% in the month and 2% across the quarter, while Hobart was the fastest growing capital – increasing by 1.7% and 3.4% in the same period. Results were mixed across the other capitals. Prices fell in both Perth and Darwin, while Brisbane and Adelaide showed some growth. But while the housing market may be cooling, rent is increasing faster than before. A year ago capital city rents were rising at the annual rate of just 0.8% but according to CoreLogic the past 12 months growth has risen to 2.8%. In Sydney, rental growth has increased from 2.2% a year ago to 4.8%, while rents in Melbourne are now tracking at 4.8%, up from 2.4% a year ago. In Hobart, weekly rents are now rising at 8.5% per year. Lawless said the latest data also showed an “increasing presence” of first-home buyers in the market, arguing moves to increase access to the market by axing stamp duty were working. “Based on housing finance commitments data, first-home buyer activity surged higher in NSW and Victoria as first-timer buyers took advantage of stamp duty concessions that went live on July 1st,” he said. “Between June and July, the number of first home buyer commitments increased by 28% across New South Wales and 11% across Victoria. However, he said first-home buyer numbers are “trending higher across other states where stamp duty rules were unchanged, suggesting that lower affordability barriers and an increasing appetite for owner-occupier lending is fuelling a broader rebound across the first-time buyer segment”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/oct/02/marriage-equality-poll-shows-77-have-now-voted-in-postal-survey","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-02T06:42:21Z","webTitle":"Marriage equality poll shows 77% have now voted in postal survey","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/02/marriage-equality-poll-shows-77-have-now-voted-in-postal-survey","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/oct/02/marriage-equality-poll-shows-77-have-now-voted-in-postal-survey","fields":{"headline":"Marriage equality poll shows 77% have now voted in postal survey","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A new poll finds that 77% of enrolled Australians have already returned their marriage law postal survey forms, a development that may take the heat out of the campaign. The poll, conducted for the Equality Campaign by Newgate Research, found that, in addition to the overall turnout, about 69% of enrolled 18- to 24-year-olds had voted and posted their forms. A further 17% of people in that age group said they had filled out their forms but were yet to post them, suggesting a total of 86% of young people will have voted if their forms are received before the 7 November deadline. By comparison, just 34% of 18- to 24-year-olds took part in the 1998 postal ballot to select delegates for the constitutional convention on the republic. A separate Reachtel poll released on Monday showed the yes side set for a thumping victory, with 64.3% of respondents saying they had sent back their ballot and voted yes compared with 15.5% who had voted no. A further 6% have a ballot and planned to vote yes and 5.7% planned to vote no. Some 5.7% said they would not vote and 2.8% had not received a ballot. A total of 16 million Australians are enrolled to vote in the marriage law postal survey, so the Newgate Research poll result implies about 12.3 million have already voted. About 1.7 million Australians aged 18 to 24 are enrolled to vote. The poll suggests that 1.2 million have already voted and a total of 1.5 million will have voted if they return their ballots as they intend. The poll, which surveyed 1,000 people from Monday to Thursday last week, also found that more than 80% of people aged over 65 had voted. On Tuesday the Australian Bureau of Statistics will release an update on how many survey forms it has received. It is expected to show a majority of Australians have voted. The result will be lower than poll turnout figures because it takes two to six days for posted forms to be received. The Equality Campaign’s executive director, Tiernan Brady, said the poll showed a “very high turnout” and Australia was on track to “smash” Ireland’s turnout of 64% in its referendum on same-sex marriage. “People understand the power of their vote and [the poll] reflects what we’ve been hearing on the doors and phone calls … that the vast majority of people have voted,” he told Sky News. “The vast majority of people see that this is not a normal political question … They understand this is about real people’s lives, real people’s dignity.” Brady urged young people and others who had voted and not returned their ballot “to make sure it goes in the post box or else it just won’t count”. “We’ve always wanted a high turnout because we’ve always believed the Australian people are for marriage equality and to treat lesbian and gay people equally in law.” The director of the Australian Christian Lobby, Lyle Shelton, told Sky News “it would surprise me” if the turnout was as high as 77% already, suggesting that “millions and millions of Australians are yet to cast their vote”. Shelton welcomed a high turnout, labelling it a “a good thing for our democracy” and adding that anything over 60% would be “credible”. “This is going to be a campaign about who can keep fighting right down to the wire on 7 November.” Shelton said the no and yes campaigns were “on a unity ticket” that voters should have their say rather than leaving survey forms on the kitchen table or fridge. Asked about the high turnout among older people, Brady said that “even though people over 65 might be less likely to support [marriage equality], there’s still a majority in support”. “There isn’t one particular demographic where we don’t think we can win.” On Monday Guardian Australia reported that the surge in enrolment, in which an extra 98,000 Australians put their names down to vote in the marriage law postal survey, was driven by young people, women and inner-city residents."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2017/oct/02/cosmic-welcome-mat-for-aliens-unveiled-in-australia","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-02T02:46:53Z","webTitle":"One small step: world's first welcome mat for aliens unveiled in Australia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/oct/02/cosmic-welcome-mat-for-aliens-unveiled-in-australia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2017/oct/02/cosmic-welcome-mat-for-aliens-unveiled-in-australia","fields":{"headline":"One small step: world's first welcome mat for aliens unveiled in Australia","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The planet’s first cosmic welcome mat – here to welcome extraterrestrial life to the Adelaide Convention Centre and the 68th International Astronautical Conference – seems comically small and slightly askew. It’s not that the mat itself is small: it’s standard doormat size, perhaps a bit larger. But conference venue entrances are built to compensate for masses of foot traffic, and it’s here that the mat finds itself: between the oversized doors and the oversized floor sticker covered in sponsor branding, welcoming delegates to the conference. But then again: who is to say how big the aliens who could be joining us in Adelaide are? Perhaps they will be tiny. This welcome mat could be huge. The mat is an art project from experimental philosopher Jonathon Keats and space archeologist Alice Gorman, and in the context of the IAC it’s hard to know what to make of it. Most people seem to make nothing of it at all, walking determinedly through the doors towards the exhibition hall, the presentation of papers, the major talks on a new Australian space agency or Elon Musk’s plans to colonise Mars. The mat just sits there, small and largely ignored. I watch occasional feet step across it, but just as often I notice a small side step: the body’s reaction to the subconscious realisation that something is out of place. The mat was inspired by the Fermi Paradox, a serious but simple scientific question about our place in the universe: if our modelling shows a high likelihood of the existence extraterrestrial civilizations, why haven’t we found any yet? Or, to put it another way, “Where is everybody?” Here, Keats’ response is: maybe we’ve not been welcoming enough: “Maybe the reason we’ve never encountered aliens is that they never felt invited,” he says. “From an outsider’s perspective, human behaviour can appear pretty unfriendly – and the impression has some truth to it.” Maybe there is some value in looking for aliens not on planets in other galaxies, but in simply saying, “welcome”, and looking for them on Earth. The mat itself is a splotch of red on blue, fading to purple: there is something distinctly 70s about the colour scheme. The red, the press materials tell me, represents “the alien” – an “amorphous blob” chosen for its lack of similarity to known beings on our planet – while the blue represents the sky, and the violet represents artificial indoor light. Any alien – which, I read, will be aware of the fact that it is alien – will see this red blob, sitting in the purple, and understand it has been welcomed from the outside in. The welcome mat will have done its job. The mat at the IAC is one of four deployed in Adelaide for the first stage in this project; Keats hopes to eventually see a welcome mat on the International Space Station. The other three are at Flinders University, where each day archeology students study the mats, visually at first and then by collecting material deposits for analysis. The students seem, like university students often are, trapped between earnestness and incredulity: in white lab coats and facemasks to avoid contamination, they lean in close to the mat, peering at its surface. They diligently record the weather conditions. They sweep half the mat and then start laughing at the idea they have to sweep the whole thing – but then they sweep the whole thing anyway. It’s tempting, having seen the mat, to consider its failings: why is a cosmic welcome mat still just a welcome mat? Why does it assume that sight is the primary communicator, and not noise or touch or smell? But these questions are hardly the point. As it often is with conceptual art, the physical object isn’t the most interesting facet. The mat itself may be a bit silly, but there is a surprising profundity to it. The conference is filled with people whose ambitions and careers rely on a profound faith: that humanity can achieve greatness, that the universe is more incredible than we can ever know. They imagine the impossible: and then do the science and the work to make that impossibility a reality. Why not then imagine, if only for a moment, that aliens could have come to the Adelaide Convention Centre and felt welcome – even if just for a moment. • The Cosmic Welcome Mat is on view at State Studio in Los Angeles from 11-29 October. Jonathon Keats and Alice Gorman will be speaking about the project at an event at State Studio on 11 October"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/oct/02/summer-ice-cream-boycott-threat-over-workplace-dispute","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-02T01:45:56Z","webTitle":"Summer ice-cream boycott threat over Streets workplace row","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/02/summer-ice-cream-boycott-threat-over-workplace-dispute","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/oct/02/summer-ice-cream-boycott-threat-over-workplace-dispute","fields":{"headline":"Summer ice-cream boycott threat over Streets workplace row","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Australians may be asked to boycott some of the nation’s best-known ice creams over summer, as Streets workers threaten to emulate the successful Carlton and United Breweries campaign. The New South Wales-based workers who make Paddle Pops, Golden Gaytimes, Bubble O’Bills and Magnums are locked in an increasingly bitter dispute with Unilever, the multinational that owns Streets. The Australian Manufacturing Workers’ Union says a recent push by the company to terminate the existing enterprise agreement would mean a 46% pay cut and significant loss of working conditions – claims the company rejects. Like the CUB campaign, the boycott would aim to put pressure on Unilever by hitting its branding and bottom line, which rose to an $11.24bn (€7.47bn) full-year pretax profit in 2016. The union’s NSW secretary, Steve Murphy, said Australians would be more easily persuaded to switch ice creams than beer, giving the boycott more potency than the CUB campaign. “If you think about the CUB campaign to boycott their beers – this is Australia, it’s pretty hard to not drink the beer that you love,” Murphy said. “It’s a whole lot easier to change the brand of ice cream you eat. There are other brands of ice cream that are made in Australia. You don’t particularly get a taste for one brand, you can change pretty readily. “So I think the effect of a boycott on Unilever is going to be pretty signficant, we saw from CUB they lost a significant amount of their market share for a long period of time.” The ice creams are made at a plant in the outer Sydney suburb of Minto, where the union has about 145 members, who operate across a rotating five-day roster. Unilever said the costs of production at the site remained high and were not competitive with other manufacturers. The company applied to the Fair Work Commission (FWC) to terminate the agreement last month, saying it had explored all other options to “create more flexible working conditions and enhance the competitiveness and viability of the factory in the longer term”. A spokesman said the company had committed last week to preserving parts of the existing enterprise agreement, including pay, until April next year. “This commitment would come into effect in the event of a FWC decision to terminate the existing enterprise agreement,” a spokesman said. “The intent of this commitment is to provide our employees with a period of stability while discussions are ongoing to find a mutually agreeable solution to make the site more viable and competitive in the long term.” Unilever said the union’s claim of a 46% pay cut had “no basis in fact”. “Having been at the centre of negotiations for more than 16 months the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union (AMWU) should be aware of this,” it said in a statement. Murphy said workers had already reduced the cost of production at Minto significantly, and were given guarantees that doing so would ensure the site’s viability. He said real milk was used in local production, and any move offshore could mean powder would be substituted. The union said the company’s application to the FWC had left workers fearing for their livelihoods and the future of their families. “They’re worried about the effect on their family, they’re worried about what their future is going to look like. One person even wrote that they’re worried about whether or not their family would be able to stay together if their pay was cut by 46%,” Murphy said. “There’s a level of anger among the workers. But the biggest feeling is disappointment. They’ve worked hard for this company, they work 24 hours a day … to make ice cream, and the first time there’s a hiccup in whatever the company’s agenda is, they just go into an all-out attack on the workers.” The dispute began when negotiations over a new enterprise agreement, overseen by the FWC, broke down. After 15 months of discussions, workers overwhelmingly voted to reject the company’s offer. The AMWU said Unilever then refused to participate in further negotiations. “We had the agreement voted down 132 to nine, that was in July,” Murphy said. “Since then the company has not met with the union once, they refused to meet with us, they refused to allow our delegates to participate in any discussions about the agreement. “They refuse to allow any of our delegates to attend the FWC meetings, and what they’ve said is that ‘if any of your delegates show up to the commission, we will leave’.” Murphy said the relationship with the company had previously been healthy and productive. Now, he said, the company had installed CCTV to monitor workers, and threatened anyone who shared posts as part of the AMWU’s social media campaign. If the FWC approves Unilever’s termination application, workers would be put back on award rates until a new agreement was reached. The company has undertaken to preserve some clauses in the agreement until 30 April, but Murphy said that was of little comfort. “When the company has gone three months so far and refuses to come to the negotiating table, refuses to sit down in good faith and iron out the wording for five different clauses, it’s really got no value to those workers,” he said. Unilever has previously faced criticism for reducing the size of Paddle Pops by 15%. The company said the “vast majority” of its ice creams are still produced at the Minto plant. But it said there were a small number which were imported from Europe and Asia, due to the “lack of flexibility and operational efficiency at our Minto site”. “These are the issues we are seeking to address through our application to the Fair Work Commission as our goal is to manufacture as much as possible locally,” a spokesman said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/blog/2017/oct/02/premier-league-talking-points-everton-swansea-southampton-antonio-conte","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-02T07:33:40Z","webTitle":"Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s action","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2017/oct/02/premier-league-talking-points-everton-swansea-southampton-antonio-conte","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2017/oct/02/premier-league-talking-points-everton-swansea-southampton-antonio-conte","fields":{"headline":"Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s action","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"1) Hughton hankers after firepower Chris Hughton, the Brighton &amp; Hove Albion manager, said it all when he highlighted how his team had not been “out of sight” against Arsenal, just as they had not been against Manchester City on the opening weekend of the season. On both occasions, the final scoreline of 0-2 hinted at respectability. Which, in truth, was Brighton’s priority. The gap to the Premier League’s top six clubs yawns like a chasm and Hughton’s approach at the Emirates Stadium – an approach born out of necessity – was characterised by damage limitation. Hughton used a 4-5-1 system and, even after Nacho Monreal’s early opener, Brighton did not come out. Their lack of firepower remains a worry. It was the fourth time in seven league matches that they had drawn a blank. However, their season will not be defined by away games like this. David Hytner • Match report: Arsenal 2-0 Brighton &amp; Hove Albion 2) Vardy’s body needs some respite After an uneasy start to the season, in which Leicester City have earned a meagre five points, Craig Shakespeare can find some respite before they host West Bromwich Albion on 16 October. The same applies for Jamie Vardy – omitted from the England squad – who will be given a steroid injection to solve his hip problem this week. His manager defended the striker’s decision to play through the pain barrier for his club but not country. “The idea for us and for England is he comes back once he’s had that little bit of a break raring to go again,” Shakespeare said, adding that medical staff from both parties had discussed the issue. “It’s never been questioned, Jamie wants to play for England and for Leicester. The time now: it’s right to give him this break, just to give a little bit of a rest, to fully recover from this injury.” Ben Fisher • Match report: Bournemouth 0-0 Leicester City 3) Conte needs to find a plan B Antonio Conte returns home to Italy for a few days over the international window seeking “a rest”, but he will spend the next fortnight stewing on the defeat to Manchester City. He has retained a league title as a manager before, though never in a division where the elite are quite this reinforced. At Juventus in 2012 he had been braced for a renewed challenge from Milan. “But, instead, they sold Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Thiago Silva to Paris Saint-Germain, so they became weaker,” he said. “It wasn’t simple second time, but it was easier. Here, from last season to this, you have big teams becoming bigger.” Manchester City demonstrated as much at Chelsea’s expense on Saturday, and Manchester United, only off the top on goal difference, appear just as imposing. Therein lies the justification for Conte’s frustration, aired within Stamford Bridge over the summer, at the need for more significant squad strengthening to keep ahead of the rest. The head coach always knew life was going to be harder this time round. Saturday proved it. Dominic Fifield • Match report: Chelsea 0-1 Manchester City • Barney Ronay on Gabriel Jesus helping Manchester City tick • Antonio Conte laments loss of ‘complete player’ Kevin De Bruyne 4) Everton need to go back to basics Everton’s struggles continue. While not replacing Romelu Lukaku’s clinical finishing is obviously a problem so, too, is Ronald Koeman’s defence. Michael Keane was signed in the summer from Burnley for £30m. But statuesque defending made Burnley look more like Barcelona as they combined for a total of 24 passes through nine players for Jeff Hendrick to apply the finishing touch past Jordan Pickford. Morgan Schneiderlin allowed Hendrick to ease past him, leaving Pickford stranded, and the lack of desire from the Frenchman and the unit as a whole shows a defence badly out of form. At this stage last season Everton had conceded four goals and kept three clean sheets. They have now conceded 12. If Koeman cannot bring his side back to basing their success on being difficult to beat then, regardless of how well his expensive attacking force play, Everton will continue to struggle. Graham Searles • Match report: Everton 0-1 Burnley • Koeman defiant over Everton future 5) Huddersfield crash back down to earth Amid a cornucopia of perks, the downside to being a footballer is that you have to do your growing-up in public. So far in his short career Dele Alli has attracted derision for some naughty challenges, a rude gesture and, on Saturday against Huddersfield Town, a devious dive. Those deeds were varying degrees of bad. But if they are the worst things that this 21-year-old has done while rising to the top of a fiercely competitive profession, and if he learns from them, then who among us can honestly hold them against him for long? As for Huddersfield, they entered this match with the second best defensive record in the Premier League, but ended with their first home defeat in the league this season. “They’re one of the best teams in the league. You could tell that,” the Huddersfield midfielder Aaron Mooy said after the defeat. Paul Doyle • Match report: Huddersfield Town 0-4 Tottenham Hotspur 6) Hodgson wants his players to show their mettle Crystal Palace’s hammering at Manchester United makes it seven defeats from as many Premier League games, 17 goals conceded and none scored. Chelsea visit Selhurst Park on 14 October. So, how is the spirit among Roy Hodgson’s players? “It’s been excellent,” he said. “Obviously, it’s going to get more fractious because we put our messages across quite strongly and there will be some on the field who don’t pick up those messages as quickly as others. But that’s nothing I can’t deal with.” Yet the manager will again be without three key figures for Chelsea’s visit. “[Christian] Benteke won’t be back for a few weeks, so we still won’t have a recognised centre forward. Wilf Zaha probably won’t be back [each has a knee problem]. Ruben Loftus-Cheek [ineligible] can’t play. So it’s got to be the lads I put out there who go out there and run their bollocks off, if you excuse my expression, to try to do the best job they can possibly do,” Hodgson says. It may get worse before it gets any better. Jamie Jackson • Match report: Manchester United 4-0 Crystal Palace • Roy Hodgson says Crystal Palace are fighting in a class they can’t handle 7) Lack of finishing power haunting Klopp’s men Time was when Newcastle v Liverpool was a match anticipated like no other. Two aggressive teams who were seemingly interested only in attacking and with centre-forwards who could be relied upon to deliver in front of goal. The thing is that time was more than 20 years ago. While Liverpool’s aspirations have not changed much in that time, namely a first league title since 1990, Newcastle had to recalibrate theirs long ago. The death of Freddy Shepherd last week, and his commemoration at this match, served as a reminder of the Magpies’ Icarus-like brush with the Premier League title in 1996. For Newcastle, this draw will have given them encouragement in their ability to hold out against better sides. For Liverpool, the failure to convert chances, once again, haunts them, like that clock that has been ticking for 27 years. Conrad Leach • Match report: Newcastle United 1-1 Liverpool 8) Pellegrino needs a rethink on forward options There is an argument that Southampton’s attackers lost so much confidence under Claude Puel last season that it will take time for Mauricio Pellegrino’s ideas to take hold. But after this defeat by Stoke City, concern is growing about Pellegrino’s flexibility. Southampton’s two wins have come against Crystal Palace and a 10-man West Ham, and scoring five goals in seven matches has not exactly set pulses racing at St Mary’s. Pellegrino has favoured a 4-2-3-1 system and Shane Long started as a lone striker against Stoke, with Charlie Austin and Manolo Gabbiadini both on the bench. Long’s tireless running can be useful in that role, but his selflessness is rendered ineffective by the inability of Southampton’s creative players to take advantage of the space created by the Irish forward. Might it be time for Pellegrino to think about pairing Long with Austin or Gabbiadini? Jacob Steinberg • Match report: Stoke City 2-1 Southampton 9) West Brom treading water despite money spent There was a feeling that West Brom had made some brilliant signings when the transfer window closed, and the excitement around the Hawthorns was tangible. A month later the view about Albion’s activity in the market has not changed but the same cannot be said for the mood. Albion sit 10th, which is respectable enough, but the broader picture shows only three wins from 19 league matches and, perhaps most frustratingly for the supporters, no shift in the way the team plays, despite £40m being spent. Tony Pulis is never going to ask his teams to open up and play gung-ho, but it is hard to escape the feeling that the group of players at his disposal should be capable of coming up with a better way of holding on to a 2-1 lead than time-wasting almost throughout the second half. The tactics were overly negative and came back to bite Albion when Watford scored a 95th-minute equaliser. Stuart James • Match report: West Bromwich Albion 2-2 Watford 10) Clement’s cupboard is bare in attack It was always likely to be a difficult season for Swansea after the departures of Fernando Llorente and Gylfi Sigurdsson. Their combination was pivotal in Swansea’s fight to stay up and it is no surprise they are toiling without them. Paul Clement could not hide his frustration after the defeat to West Ham, which pushed Swansea into the bottom three. The manager was pleased with his team’s composed passing in midfield but he was unhappy with their decisions in the final third and critical of his forwards for their timidity. Wilfried Bony had one effort before being taken off at half-time, while Tammy Abraham and Jordan Ayew were quiet. Yet Clement must also shoulder some of the blame. Swansea created nothing at the London Stadium and three goals in seven games is damning. They lack imagination and width and will be in huge trouble if nothing changes.

Speaking in a historically charged venue, the First Congregational Church of Atlanta, one of the oldest African American churches in the US founded in 1867 by freed slaves, the California senator gave a blunt account of the problems facing the nation. “Racism is real in this country,” she said, “sexism is real in this country, homophobia is real … antisemitism is real.” She also lamented what she called a “systematic attempt to suppress the vote in America”, citing court rulings that found that “they” – a clear though implicit reference to Republicans – “target African Americans with almost surgical precision”. Harris, who in January took up the US Senate seat vacated by Barbara Boxer, went on to criticise the vilification and scapegoating of undocumented migrants, the plight of Puerto Ricans in the wake of Hurricane Maria, and the move by the US attorney general, Jeff Sessions, to “re-escalate the failed war on drugs”. But she also made a strong bid to reclaim the concept of patriotism and love of country for the progressive movement. Though she did not mention Trump by name, she invoked the president when she said that “there are forces of hate and division trying to tear us apart”. “Americans have so much more in common than what separates us,” she said. Her kind of patriotism, Harris said, was to believe in the country’s ideals and fight for them. “When we fight for the ideals behind the constitution of the United States,” she said, “that is the very definition of being a patriot.” Again, Harris did not refer directly to the ongoing spat between Trump and NFL players who have been protesting racial injustice by kneeling during the national anthem. But her purpose was plain. “When we sing The Star-Spangled Banner, we rightly think of brave men and women who defend the freedom of those they may never meet … We also think about those marching in the streets who demand the ideals of that flag represent them too.” Harris, 52, began her eye-catching career in public service as a prosecutor, working as district attorney of San Francisco and then attorney general of California from 2010. In eight months in the Senate she has made a mark. Playing to the left, she backed Bernie Sanders in his plan for “Medicare for all” healthcare reform. Forging bipartisan credentials, she teamed up with the Kentucky Republican senator Rand Paul to introduce legislation to help people put behind bars because they cannot afford bail. The First Congregational Church has a long history of hosting sermons and addresses by prominent black leaders. Booker T Washington, a leader of former slaves in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, spoke there.

You can find all the latest details on Sunday’s events in this full report. The Spanish prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, said earlier the referendum “only served to cause serious harm to coexistence” among Spaniards but he is “not going to close any door” to dialogue. The pope made a plea for unity during a tour of northern Italy on Sunday. During a stop in Bologna, he told students there they had a right to culture, hope and peace and that recent populist and nationalist movements in Europe were threatening that peace. Pope Francis didn’t refer directly to the violence of Catalonia’s banned independence referendum but urged Europeans to put aside nationalistic and other interests for the sake of unity. “Don’t be afraid of unity,” he said. “May special interests and nationalism not render the courageous dreams of the founders of the European Union in vain.” The ugly images emanating from Barcelona and elsewhere suggest Spain has lurched into a moment of deep crisis. Are five centuries of coexistence really under threat, asks Giles Tremlett in this analysis piece: The task of clearing up the mess begins on Monday, but there is no obvious way forward and nobody who looks capable at the moment of healing the wounds. It may all get rapidly worse. Separatists in the Catalan parliament threaten to declare independence within 48 hours, even though the results of a referendum held in such circumstances may be widely deemed invalid. A unilateral declaration of independence might, in turn, lead to the regional government being taken over by Madrid. Both steps would deepen the rift considerably. But since neither side was prepared to budge before the long-expected “train crash” happened on Sunday, there is little reason to hope for caution now – especially as both claim the moral high ground. The Spanish prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, says he was bound to uphold a court decision to suspend the referendum because the country’s constitution does not allow a regional government to unilaterally call one on independence. Many would question if it needed that level of police violence. Catalonia’s regional president, Carles Puigdemont, says he was obliged to call the referendum, because that is what separatist parties pledged to do if they won elections in 2015. Opponents in Catalonia accuse him of riding roughshod over the rules that govern even his own parliament. In practice, a declaration of independence seems unworkable. Many Catalans who oppose separatism – a majority before Sunday – would be outraged at having their nationality changed like that. Foreign governments and international institutions would deem the declaration invalid, turning Catalonia into a pariah state within Europe. Other arguments aside, however, the temptation to wave a red rag in front of Rajoy’s conservative government may prove too enticing. Even before this vote, Rajoy’s refusal to consider a legal referendum – along with his history of opposing other transfers of power to Catalonia’s regional government – was largely responsible for the separatist upswing. Footage from earlier in the day here of one emergency service pitted against another as police clash with firefighters. 90% of the 2.26 million Catalans who voted on Sunday voted in favour of independence, according to preliminary results released by the region’s government. The region has 5.3 million voters. Officials said 770,000 votes were lost due to disruption which resulted in polling stations being raided by Spanish police. Carles Puigdemont, Catalan’s leader, announced in a televised statement that the region had earned the right to become an independent state and that results would be passed the region’s parliament in the coming days. In a press conference shortly before Puigdemont’s, a defiant Mariano Rajoy, the Spanish prime minister, said no referendum had been held today and blamed unrest on the Catalan government. According to the Catalan department of health, 761 people were injured in the unrest. Two were seriously injured and remain in hospitals in Barcelona. At least 10 police officers are said to have been injured. Videos from earlier in the day show police hitting people in the crowd with batons while voters hold up their hands, police dragging voters from polling stations by their hair and Spanish police attacking Catalan firefighters. Rajoy praised the police and said they acted with “firmness and serenity”. Socialist leader Pedro Sánchez urged the Spanish government to negotiate with Catalonia and said Spanish and Catalan leaders had failed so far. There have been several calls by Catalan politicians and opposition MPs for the Spanish prime minister to resign over the hardline police response. The UK Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, asked Prime Minister Theresa May to intervene “to find political solution to the crisis”. Barcelona’s La Liga match against Las Palmas was played at an empty Camp Nou after the Catalan club’s request for the match to be postponed due to unrest was rejected. More than 40 unions and associations in Catalonia have called a region-wide strike on Tuesday in protest against today’s “grave violation of rights”. Puigdemont blamed the situation in Catalonia on the “intransigence, the repression, the complete denial of reality, the hostility seen during the democratic demands made by our country”. Carles Puigdemont, the head of the region’s government, made this video announcement earlier. He said: “On this day of hope and suffering, Catalonia’s citizens have earned the right to have an independent state in the form of a republic ... We have earned the right to be listened to, respected and recognised.” Unions and Catalan associations have called for a region-wide strike on Tuesday due to “the grave violation of rights and freedoms”, calling on people to take to the streets in Catalonia. Turull, the Catalan government spokesman, says authorities have calculated that a total of 770,000 votes were lost because of the disruption. “Four hundred schools [used as polling stations] have been sealed and many votes have been directly stolen,” he said. The turnout was 42%, say Catalan officials. On Sunday afternoon, the Spanish interior ministry said police had closed 79 of the 2,315 polling stations set up for the referendum. Earlier,, the Catalan government had reported that, despite the police’s efforts, voting was taking place in 96% of polling stations. Monday’s front page from daily newspaper La Vanguardia, the main newspaper in Catalonia. The downpage story says Puigdemont will raise the DUI – or unilateral declaration of independence – in parliament in the coming days. The Catalan president, Carles Puigdemont, has welcomed the preliminary results. He pressed ahead with the referendum despite opposition from the Spanish state and the region’s own high court. Jordi Turull, a Catalan regional government spokesman, said early on Monday that 90% of the 2.26 million Catalans who voted on Sunday voted in favour of independence. The region has 5.3 million voters. He said nearly 8% of voters rejected independence and the rest of the ballots were blank or void. He said 15,000 votes were still being counted. We are restarting this blog after the Catalan government announced preliminary results for the independence referendum that showed a 90% “yes” vote. We will bring you the latest updates here. We are going to close this blog now. Thanks so much for joining us today on what has been an extraordinary day in Spain’s history as Catalonia held a referendum on its independence in the face of a police crackdown. Here’s a roundup of the evening’s events: Carles Puigdemont, Catalan’s leader, announced in a televised statement that the region had earned the right to become an independent state and that results of the contentious referendum were expected in a few days. In a press conference shortly before, a defiant Mariano Rajoy, the Spanish prime minister, said no referendum had been held today and blamed unrest on the Catalan government. Socialist leader Pedro Sánchez urged the Spanish government to negotiate with Catalonia and said Spanish and Catalan leaders had failed so far. Videos from earlier in the day show police hitting people in the crowd with batons while voters hold up their hands, police dragging voters from polling stations by their hair and Spanish police attacking Catalan firefighters. Rajoy praised the police and said they acted with “firmness and serenity”. According to the Catalan department of health, 761 people were injured in the unrest. Two were seriously injured and remain in hospitals in Barcelona. At least 10 police officers are said to have been injured. There have been several calls by Catalan politicians and opposition MPs for the Spanish prime minister to resign over the hardline police response. The Liberal Democrat leader, Vince Cable urged Boris Johnson to make clear that the violence against voters was unacceptable, while Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, called the foreign office’s statement “shamefully weak”. Earlier, the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, asked Theresa May to intervene “to find political solution to the crisis”. Barcelona’s La Liga match against Las Palmas was played at an empty Camp Nou after the Catalan club’s request for the match to be postponed due to unrest was rejected. More than 40 unions and associations in Catalonia have called a region-wide strike on Tuesday in protest against today’s “grave violation of rights”. Here’s the full report: Here’s more on the violence at polling stations: More than 40 unions and associations in Catalonia have called a region-wide strike for Tuesday, after a major police crackdown on a banned independence referendum. In a statement on Sunday, UGT and CCOO, Spain’s biggest unions, the Catalan national assembly (ANC), a powerful pro-independence civil association, and 41 other organisations called for a large-scale strike in protest against “the grave violation of rights and freedoms” today. The statement continued: We call all society, on employers’ organisations, business owners, unions, workers, self-employed workers, institutions and all the citizens of Catalonia to stop the ‘country’ on Tuesday, October 3. Pro-independence Catalans often refer to the northeastern region as a “country.” Catalonia’s Carles Puigdemont said the door had today been opened to a unilateral declaration of independence. He said in a televised address: With this day of hope and suffering, the citizens of Catalonia have won the right to an independent state in the form a republic. He also said that the EU could no longer “continue to look the other way” from human rights violations around the referendum. On the violence at polling stations, he said: The Spanish government has today written a shameful page in its relationship with Catalonia. His speech was welcomed by those watching on a big screen, ITN’s Dominic Reynolds reports. Carles Puigdemont said that the “citizens of Catalonia have earned the right to have an independent state.” He said official results of the vote, which have not yet announced, will be sent to the parliament to proceed. Making a direct appeal to the EU, he said: “We Catalans have earned the right to be heard in Europe.” Carles Puigdemont, Catalan’s leader, has announced that the region has won the right to become an independent state with vote results expected in a few days. More to follow. Carles Puigdemont, the president of Catalonia, is due to speak soon we have been told. We’ll bring the key points from that press conference when we have it. In the meantime, here’s an interesting thread from Fernando Rodriguez-Vila that is doing the rounds on Twitter and is worth a read. Here’s a roundup of the reaction to today’s unrest in Catalonia. While some have expressed outrage at the level of violence, others perhaps mindful of separatist movements in their own nations, sounded a note of caution Guy Verhofstadt, the European parliament’s Brexit chief, said: I don’t want to interfere in the domestic issues of Spain but I absolutely condemn what happened today in Catalonia. Scottish first minister Nicola Sturgeon said: Regardless of views on independence, we should all condemn the scenes being witnessed and call on Spain to change course before someone is seriously hurt. Britain’s foreign ministry said: The referendum is a matter for the Spanish government and people. We want to see Spanish law and the Spanish constitution respected and the rule of law upheld. Belgium prime minister Charles Michel said: Violence can never be the answer! We condemn all forms of violence and reaffirm our call for political dialogue. Serbian foreign minister Ivica Dacic said: Our position is clear and principled, Spain is one of the greatest friends of Serbia. “[Madrid] is in the same position on the issue of the territorial integrity of Serbia. French economy minister Bruno Le Maire said: Spain is a friendly nation, a proud people. Clearly I hope that civil peace will reign in Spain. Here’s more from the press conference that Spanish prime minister Mariano Rajoy held a little earlier, via the AFP news agency. Rajoy said Sunday that the rule of law had prevailed in Catalonia because an independence referendum in the region prohibited by the courts had been blocked. “Today there has not been a self-determination referendum in Catalonia. The rule of law remains in force with all its strength,” he said in a televised address. Security forces “performed their duty” in Catalonia and respected a court order to prevent voting from taking place, he added in his first public comments Sunday on the referendum. “It would have been easier for everyone to look the other way,” the conservative prime minister said. The referendum was a “real attack on the rule of law... to which the state reacted with firmness and serenity”. Socialist leader Pedro Sánchez spoke at a press conference shortly after Mariano Rajoy. He urged the Spanish prime minister to negotiate with Catalonia and said: “Rest assured that we will overcome this situation. I want to send Catalans and all other Spaniards a message of security.” Sánchez said his party would guarantee this stability by “betting on peaceful coexistence, not confrontation” and by “opening a political negotiation channel that is more urgent than ever”. Nicola Sturgeon has criticised the response from the foreign office calling it “shamefully weak”. Tweeting a screenshot of the earlier foreign office statement, the first minister of Scotland said a true friend would tell Spain what happened today was wrong. In a press conference a short time ago, a defiant Mariano Rajoy blamed unrest on the Catalan government. He called the referendum “a process that has only served to sow division, to confront citizens and to provoke unwanted situations has failed” and added that it has created “serious damage to coexistence”. He said: The responsibility for these acts solely and exclusively falls on those who promoted the rupture of legality and coexistence ... The vast majority of the people of Catalonia did not want to participate in the secessionists’ script. They have shown that they are law-abiding people and quietly ignored the call [to vote] … All Spaniards value their attitude. He went on to praise Spanish police for defending role of law, thanked the EU for its support and said the actions of the Spanish government were within the law. We cannot allow the progress of the past 40 years to be replaced by blackmail. Today we all have reasons to trust our democracy. This only served to hurt our coexistence. I offer dialogue within law. I expect them (Catalans) to renounce to what they have done so far. In Barcelona, people gathered to watch the Spanish prime minister’s speech on a big screen. When he said that the majority of people had not wanted to participate in the referendum, the crowd reacted with derision and anger. The Catalan government’s pollster recently found that 70% wanted a referendum on the territory’s future, although support for independence is only 41%. Mariano Rajoy is now speaking in a press conference. He says: “Today there was no referendum on self-determination in Catalonia.” The large majority of Catalonia did not want to participate in today’s referendum and they had obeyed the law, he added. He said he hoped Catalan leaders would now give up on their separatist goals and get back to political normality. Polling stations closed in Catalonia’s controversial referendum at 8pm local time, with ballot boxes being reportedly taken to secret locations. More from the speech to follow. A total of 761 people needed assistance from Catalonia’s Medical Emergency Systems, according to the Catalan department of health. A total of 335 have been hurt in Barcelona alone. Earlier in Girona, residents were building barricades in front of polling stations to prevent police closing them before 8pm. Here are some shots from outside a sports centre and a school. If you are just joining us, catch up with this full report on today’s events in Catalonia from my colleagues Sam Jones and Stephen Burgen. The Spanish prime minister Mariano Rajoy is due to speak in a press conference at 8.15pm local time. We’ll bring you the key points from that shortly. Several leftwing Spanish politicians have demanded Mariano Rajoy’s resignation, the AFP news agency reports. Barcelona mayor Ada Colau said the prime minister, who leads the ruling conservative Popular party (PP), “had crossed all red lines”. “He is a coward who does not live up to his state responsibilities... as a result he must resign,” she told reporters. Colau demanded that police stop their crackdown against the referendum, which Spain’s central government and the courts have deemed illegal. Police have baton-charged and fired rubber bullets to disperse crowds protecting polling stations in Barcelona and other towns and cities. Videos posted on social media show police dragging voters from polling stations by their hair, throwing people down stairs and attacking Catalan firefighters who were protecting polling stations. Catalan’s department of health said 465 people had been treated across the province in relation to the violence. Pablo Iglesias, the leader of leftwing party Podemos, referenced PP’s allies in parliament in a series of posts on Twitter. He said: To open a new scenario of dialogue and coexistence, it is necessary to send the PP and Ciudadanos to the opposition. If something breaks Spain it will be because the PP and those who support it in parliament continue to destroy democracy,” he added in messages accompanied by pictures of injured protesters, some of them bleeding. Pablo Echenique, a leading member of Podemos, wrote on Facebook that the PP’s policies in Catalonia, could “fracture a society and destroy a country … you have to remove the tumour before it kills the patient”. PP spokesman Fernando Martinez-Maillo defended the government, saying that “the only ones responsible for what is happening in Catalonia today is [Catalan president Carles] Puigdemont, the government of Catalonia and its partners.” Max Borrell Espinosa was in the Jaume Balmes high school in Barcelona when riot police charged in this morning. The 17-year-old, who is not a student at the school but lives nearby, says young and old alike were beaten with truncheons. He said: Yesterday around 300 of us decided to spend the night in Jaume Balmes secondary school, playing sport, listening to music and watching movies in a relaxed and festive atmosphere with the aim of being able to open the school on Sunday for the referendum. This morning, when we opened the doors, vanloads of riot police arrived. We had agreed on a policy of passive resistance to protect the ballot boxes. The aggression of the state security forces created an atmosphere of tension, beating the young and elderly alike with their truncheons. After what happened in Jaume Balmes and many other polling stations, there is a widespread feeling among all Catalans that we are fighting to make this democratic process a reality. We are powerless faced with the repression of the Spanish government but brave enough to carry on with this process that will allow us to decide our future in a democratic fashion. The Liberal Democrat leader, Vince Cable, has said Boris Johnson should call in the Spanish ambassador and tell him that the police response to the Catalonian independence referendum is unacceptable. Cable said: Police in a democracy should never drag people violently out of polling stations, whatever the arguments for or against holding a referendum. The police response looks to have been brutal and completely disproportionate. The foreign secretary should break off from conspiring against the prime minister and call in the Spanish ambassador to tell him that this is unacceptable. My colleague Irene Baqué has posted this video shot by her brother Pablo Baqué in the Plaza del Sol in Madrid. People there have taken to the streets calling for Mariano Rajoy’s resignation after today’s events. They are shouting: “Go Rajoy. Here we are the anti-fascists.” The Spanish home office has published a video on Twitter of a Guardia Civil officer being hit with a chair after he had smashed his way into a polling station. Hello. This is Nicola Slawson taking over from Patrick. My colleague Ben Fisher has this report on Barcelona’s La Liga match against Las Palmas, which was played at an empty Camp Nou. Barcelona continued their 100% start to life in La Liga in bizarre circumstances, beating Las Palmas 3-0 at an empty Camp Nou. The Catalan club had asked for the match to be postponed due to protests in the city over Catalonia’s independence referendum, in which more than 460 people have been injured. That request was rejected and Barcelona, threatened with a six-point deduction according to club president Josep Maria Bartomeu, took the decision to play the match behind closed doors just 20 minutes before kick-off, leaving thousands of supporters stranded outside. A statement from La Liga said the match should take place as normal because the security and safety of fans had been “guaranteed” by the Catalan police. “We have not been able to find a way to postpone it. From there, all together, directors, executives and players met and we decided, exceptionally, to play the game behind closed doors,” Bartomeu said. “Els Mossos [the Catalan police force] told us the game could be played normally. Playing this way, with the stadium empty, the club shows its disagreement [with the decision not to postpone the game]. The league told us we would lose six points, three from today and three as a penalty.” Las Palmas had the national flag embroidered on to their match-day shirts to show their support for a united Spain while Barcelona emerged for the warmup wearing a yellow-and-red-striped shirt – the colours of the Estelada flag associated with Catalan independence. Earlier on Sunday, defender Gerard Piqué tweeted a photo of him voting in the referendum. “Together we are unstoppable defending democracy,” he said. Read the full report here: It has been a long day, and it is not over yet. I am handing over the liveblog to my colleague Nicola Slawson. Thanks for reading and have a peaceful evening. The Catalan government has announced voting will not go on any longer than 8pm Spanish time, unless people are already in queues at polling stations. The Catalan government’s spokesperson Jordi Turull is addressing media again. Turull says 319 polling stations have been closed by police on Sunday as he condemned the violence. What the police are doing is a real scandal, a savagery. The Spanish state is in a very difficult situation before the world... What the police is doing is truly an international embarrassment. The Foreign Office spokesperson has commented on today’s events in Catalonia. The referendum is a matter for the Spanish government and people. We want to see Spanish law and the Spanish constitution respected and the rule of law upheld. Spain is a close ally and a good friend, whose strength and unity matters to us. I don’t want to interfere in the domestic issues of Spain but I absolutely condemn what happened today in Catalonia. On one hand, the separatist parties went forward with a so-called referendum that was forbidden by the Constitutional Court, knowing all too well that only a minority would participate as 60 % of the Catalans are against separation. And on the other hand - even when based on court decisions - the use of disproportionate violence to stop this. In the European Union we try to find solutions through political dialogue and with respect for the constitutional order as enshrined in the Treaties, especially in art. 4. It’s high time for de-escalation. Only a negotiated solution in which all political parties, including the opposition in the Catalan Parliament, are involved and with respect for the Constitutional and legal order of the country, is the way forward. According to the Catalan health ministry, 465 people have been injured as Catalans vote in an “illegal” referendum on the region’s independence. The two most seriously injured are in hospitals in Barcelona. Although advocates stressed the right to political self-determination, the vote was banned by Spain’s constitutional court and millions of ballot papers were confiscated before the vote. Local and national authorities say 336 voting centres, of more than 2,000, across the region have been closed by police. Voting has been marred by a brutal police crackdown. Videos show police hitting people in the crowd with batons while voters hold up their hands, police dragging voters from polling stations by their hair, and Spanish police attacking Catalan firefighters. The police action has been mostly confined to Barcelona, the Catalonian capital. There has been no police presence in the majority of voting stations throughout the region. Polls have shown 70% of Catalans want to be able to vote in a referendum but they are more evenly divided when it comes to independence. There have been several calls for the Spanish prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, to resign over the police response from Catalan politicians and opposition MPs. Human Rights Watch has released a statement calling on Spanish authorities to respect citizens’ right to peaceful assembly and refrain from using excessive force. The Labour party has condemned the police violence. Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, said: “It is unacceptable for the Spanish authorities to overreact to today’s events through aggressive police action and the forcible closure of polling stations.” The European Union is yet to make an official comment. A lot has happened in Catalonia today. If you want to read the most up to date version of events, here is the latest from the Guardian’s Sam Jones and Stephen Burgen. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has spoken out against the violence in Catalonia for a second time today. He has asked Theresa May to speak to the Spanish prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, about the crisis and try to end the police crackdown. The Catalan health ministry has provided more details on the 465 people injured by police violence: 216 were hurt in Barcelona, 80 in Girona, 64 in Lleida, 53 in Terres de l’Ebre, 27 in Catalunya central and 25 in Tarragona. The two most seriously injured are in hospitals in Barcelona. The Spanish authorities and Catalan police have released further details on the number of polling stations they have closed down today. Spanish national police have closed down 46 in total (27 in Barcelona, six in Tarragona, six in Girona and seven in Lleida). The Guardia Civil have closed another 46 (14 in Barcelona, 12 in Tarragona, eight in Girona and 12 in Lleida). Catalan police, the Mossos, say they have closed 244 polling stations across Catalonia. In total, 336 polling stations have been closed down by local and national authorities. To put these numbers in context, the Catalan government says more than 2,000 polling stations were set up across the province for the referendum. The majority remain open. The tension between Spanish police forces continues in Catalonia. In Sant Joan de Vilatorrada, a municipality about 30 miles from Barcelona, Guardia Civil officers and Mossos agents were recorded pushing each other as the Guardia Civil raided a polling station. The Labour party has released a statement on the events in Catalonia. Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, said: Police violence in Catalonia today is shocking, and the Spanish government should take action to end it now. While we believe disputes over sovereignty should be resolved in accordance with rules and laws, and any referendum on these issues needs to be both democratic and fair, it is unacceptable for the Spanish authorities to overreact to today’s events through aggressive police action and the forcible closure of polling stations. They must respect the right to peaceful protest, and all sides must strive to come together and reach a political solution to this constitutional crisis. Violence of any sort will simply worsen divisions, and make a resolution harder to reach. Spain’s interior ministry has also provided an update on their operation to halt today’s independence referendum. 92 “illegal” voting centres have been closed by the national police and the Guardia Civil across Catalonia. Three people, including one girl, have been arrested for civil disobedience and attacking an officer. Nine police officers and three members of the Guardia Civil have been injured so far. Catalan’s department of health has said 465 people have been treated across the province in relation to the violence. A solidarity march with Catalonia is taking place outside the European Union offices in Edinburgh. Many commentators are concerned about the EU’s response, which has said nothing on the disorder so far. The Guardia Civil, Spain’s military law enforcement agency, has launched a social media attack on Catalan’s local police force, the Mossos, over their response to the referendum. A heated standoff between the two forces has been posted on a Guardia Civil Twitter page with the caption: “Some seem to be unclear. Shameful.” Another post accuses Mossos of ignoring the Spanish court order to halt the referendum, preferring to eat a sandwich instead. Catalonia’s government says 337 people have been injured, some seriously, during a police crackdown on the independence referendum this Sunday. Nine police officers and two members of the Guardia Civil have been injured in the disorder, according to the Spanish interior ministry. The voting has been marred by a brutal police crackdown in which several instances of violence against voters have been recorded. Videos show police dragging voters from polling stations by their hair, unprovoked attacks on protesters and Spanish police attacking Catalan firefighters. There have been several calls for the Spanish prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, to resign over the police response from Catalan politicians and opposition MPs. Barcelona’s La Liga fixture against Las Palmas is being played behind closed doors as a result of the disorder. Another video of police brutality has emerged. This time, Spanish police have been recorded attacking Catalan firefighters. Human Rights Watch has released a statement calling on Spanish authorities to respect their citizens’ right to peaceful assembly and refrain from using excessive force. FC Barcelona has announced their La Liga clash with Las Palmas will be played behind closed doors. In a statement, the Catalan club said: “FC Barcelona condemn the events which have taken place in many parts of Catalonia today in order to prevent its citizens exercising their democratic rights to free expression. “Given the exceptional nature of events, the board of directors have decided that the FC Barcelona first team game against Las Palmas will be played behind closed doors following the Professional Football League’s refusal to postpone the game.” The Catalan Football Federation had already suspended all matches due to referendum, but FC Barcelona are not under their jurisdiction. Earlier today, Las Palmas announced a Spanish flag had been sewn on to their kit for the game to show support for “the unity of Spain”. The fiery Twitter posts from the Spanish interior ministry continue. Exposing children to this type of situation and using them during the day is another sign of intolerable unreason Details on voter turnout in the independence referendum are sparse at the moment. Voting has been slow because the electronic census used to count the ballot is down, and people are voting on paper, according to Spanish media. Stephen Burgen reports that police repression has been far from systematic. He says people from all over Catalonia are sending messages saying they are voting where there is no police presence. Radio Catalonia journalist Mar Riera Sola has posted footage of police charging at a crowd while entering the village of Sant Iscle de Vallalta, 30 miles north-east of Barcelona. The Guardian’s Sam Jones has spoken to Jesús López Rodríguez, a 51-year-old administrator who lives opposite the Ramon Llull school, who witnessed this morning’s violent police raid on the polling station. We were in the street from 5am. Hundreds of us were waiting to vote peacefully. The ballot boxes came at about 7.30am. Around eight o’clock, we saw seven national police vans. Half an hour later, the police came in riot gear with shields and helmets. They told us that the Catalan high court had ordered them to take the ballot boxes and they told us that we needed to disperse. We said, ‘No! No! No!’. Then about 20 police officers charged us. It was short – about two minutes – and we stayed together. I heard the chief officer telling them to retreat. But they just stopped and stayed there for about 15 minutes. Then eight or nine national vans came and they cordoned off the surrounding streets. We were pushing back and forth until they started to arrest people. They dragged people out violently. We stood our ground but they dragged people away, kicking them and throwing them to the ground … Lots more police came - maybe 100 or more. When they saw they couldn’t get into the main building, they jumped over the fence and went in. They came out with ballot boxes 10 minutes later and they broke down the doors [of the school] with axes. They left with the ballot boxes. There were a lot of police but we stayed there trying to vote. We looked around for other places to vote and then we came back. Half an hour later, we saw lots of police vans on Gran Vía. Then, at about 10.25am, they started to shoot rubber bullets – at least 30 or 40. People were running away, scared and totally defenceless. I ran towards the shots but my wife pulled me back. I was down there for a lot of hours this morning and I didn’t hear one insult [towards the police] … I feel really angry about it but I also hope that people in Europe and around the world see what’s happening in Catalonia. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has called on the Spanish government to stop the violence in Catalonia. Stephen Burgen has spoken to Martí Pont, 19, who was among the occupants of the Escola Ramon Llull school when Spanish police arrived in force. Video footage shows officers dragging voters out by their hair and throwing people down stairs at the school. “I was there last night and there were a couple of dozen people but when I went back at 5.30am there were maybe 300. The Mossos came, saw how many people there were, and left. A couple of hours later the ballot boxes arrived and we all started applauding. It was raining heavily. Then seven vanloads of Policia Nacional arrived. We all gathered around the front door and kept calm. There were some elderly people but no kids. Then 15 police in body armour and five more wearing balaclavas arrived. They started pushing us with their shields and throwing us aside but there were too many of us. Then more and more vanloads arrived from all sides. They started pushing through and pulling people out. Then they broke in through another door and took away the ballot boxes and voting papers. Right then people didn’t know what to do because there were police in front and behind. They started dragging us out, often by the throat. Lots of women were dragged out by the hair. Then we saw them put the ballot boxes in a Seat, an ordinary car. We sat down in front of and behind their vans so they couldn’t leave. They took out their truncheons and began separating us. We went down carrer Marina, blocking them street by street. They started hitting us with truncheons but didn’t use their guns. We met up with another group and the police warned journalists to go away. They ran off and the police started firing rubber bullets. This was at the junction of Diputació and Sardenya. Everyone who could, fled, but others got hit, in the back and the knee. Everyone went off to find somewhere else to vote. Readers have been sharing their eyewitness accounts with us –you can share yours with us here. ‘It is frightening. We are living in a world where human rights are being ignored’ What is happening at the moment is a mini revolution – the Catalans want a referendum and right now we are waiting for Guardias to arrive as that is what has been happening elsewhere. Old people have been attacked ... We are doing what we want to do which is just vote. It has not been violent where we are but what we are hearing and seeing [is worrying]. Last night, I was outside the square eating sausages we cooked on the BBQ and talking about what tomorrow means and now we are talking about what Monday means and Tuesday. It is frightening. We are living in a world where human rights are being ignored. I think Catalonia deserves to be listened to. If the rest of the world does not put its arms up and prevent the Spanish government from attacking peaceful demonstrators, then that is worrying. I have got children with me at the moment. They know what is going on and they can feel this tension – it’s just not nice. You bring children up to be peaceful and seeing the establishment carry old ladies off. It would be great if everything news-wise shows what is really happenings. Fiona Williamson, 44, from Barcelona ‘This is history. People say they will not move if there is violence’ Sitting outside the polling station in Barcelona Nord, we’re here on holiday but it is fascinating to watch all these people voting. They are here to stand and be visible, we’ve talked to some people. Other stations around here are closed so more people are coming here to vote. The local Catalan police are patrolling but there is no aggravation towards them, they are not stopping the process. Earlier today, I saw seven police vans drive by, the cars beeped their horns in protest. Catalonian flags are hanging in windows, there is graffiti for voting yes. There are no posters for no. I talked to a girl and asked if she knew anyone voting no. She said she knew some people from university, but there was no argument between them. They just wanted to vote. People clap when they leave the station. A man handed his umbrella to another pushing an elderly lady in a wheelchair. The atmosphere is friendly and momentous. People are happy to talk and share with us. This is history. They say they will not move if there is violence. It’s too important. Caitríona O’Brien and Malachy McDermott, Irish holidaymakers in Barcelona The Catalan government has said 337 people have been injured “by the Spanish state police violence.” They have accused Spanish police of responding with a ‘go get them’ attitude. The Catalan foreign minister Raül Romeva has said: “We have initiated contacts with the EU about the violation of fundamental rights that puts the very same EU at risk. “We urge Europe’s institutions to condemn the violence that European citizens are suffering” Soraya Sáenz de Santamaría, the Spanish deputy prime minister, said in a press conference that the “absolute irresponsibility of the Catalan government has had to be dealt with by the professionalism of the state’s security forces. With firmness and and proportionality we have thrown into disarray the Generalitat’s plans. There hasn’t been a referendum nor the semblance of one. Nothing good will come of this.” Belgium prime minister Charles Michel has spoken out against the violence and called for political dialogue. He is the first world leader to do so. Catalonia’s ombudsman has said he will complain about the Spanish government’s tactics to European authorities including the European council, according to AP. Rafael Ribo said on Sunday the government forces had used disproportionate tactics in “violent actions against citizens” while trying to shut down the disputed independence referendum. Ribo, an appointee by the regional parliament who leads the office overseeing citizens’ rights, said in an emotional appearance before reporters that the Spanish government has shown “little respect for human rights”. He called on the government to stop all violent actions against citizens. Former Catalan president Artur Mas has told Spanish TV that the prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, should “resign immediately” from his position. He said Rajoy is in charge of a “violent state”, calling the Spanish leader “authoritarian” and “a represser”. On police violence, Mas said: “We cannot be in a common state project which uses batons and police brutality.” The Spanish interior ministry has tweeted a video of Guardia Civil officers running from protesters throwing rocks. The Podemos leader, Pablo Iglesias, has spoken out against the violence again. If something breaks Spain it will be because the PP [People’s party] and those who support it in Congress continue to destroy democracy. The Spanish interior ministry has said nine police officers and two Guardia Civil officers have been injured while trying to stop the referendum. They also posted a video of “hooded” figures throwing objects at police in central Barcelona. Video footage of police brutality against voters in Girona has appeared. The video shows police hitting people in the crowd with batons while voters hold up their hands. Spanish media are reporting someone hit in the eye with a rubber bullet has been taken into surgery at Sant Pau hospital in Barcelona. The injured person is said to have been hit by a police projectile after being removed from Ramón Llull school. Small counter protests have formed in the centre of Madrid in Plaza Mayor and Puerta del Sol. Groups of people are waving Spanish flags, chanting “I am Spanish” and “Spanish united, never divided.” The Guardia Civil has broken its silence following several videos of brutality against voters. The police force said it was “resisting harassment and provocation” while completing its functions “in defence of the law”. The Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has condemned the violence, and asked the Spanish government to let Catalans vote peacefully. Videos of police brutality against voters are going viral on social media. Spanish journalist Héctor Juanatey has posted footage of police forcibly removing voters outside a polling station at Guinardò market in Barcelona. Another video shows police dragging a voter out of a polling station by their hair at Ramon Llull school in the Catalan capital. Catalan local media are reporting today’s La Liga game between Barcelona and Las Palmas may be suspended after Las Palmas announced they will wear a Spanish flag on their kit to show support for “the unity of Spain”. In a statement, the club said: “Today, what we do is very simple. With the Spanish flag embroidered in our equipment we want to vote unequivocally in an imaginary vote to which nobody has summoned us: we believe in the unity of Spain.” Barcelona’s footballers have expressed their support for today’s referendum. Former captain Carles Puyol tweeted “voting is democracy” this morning, while Catalan defender Gerard Piqué posted a photo casting a vote. Former Barcelona midfielder Xavi Hernandez said what is happening in Catalonia is “an embarrassment”, and called for the Spanish state to let Catalans vote in peace. The Catalan president, Carles Puigdemont, has told reporters that “violence will not stop Catalans from voting”. The Catalan government says 38 people have been treated by emergency services in the disorder. The Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has tweeted about the ”shocking” scenes in some parts of Catalonia this morning. Catalonia’s government says 38 people have been treated by emergency services due to “repression by Spanish police”. The Spanish interior minister, Juan Ignacio Zoido, has described the response of the Guardia Civil and Spanish police as “proportional and professional”, posting a video of an officer helping a father and child in Sant Julia de Ramis, Girona. Barcelona’s mayor, Ada Colau, has called on the Spanish prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, to resign and demanded police stop using violence against voters. Police action against the peaceful population must stop. Today, in Catalonia and in the state, we have to demand it. #ResignRajoy Videos of Spanish police removing ballot boxes at Ramon Llull school in Barcelona while voters chant “we will vote” have been posted on social media. The Guardian’s Madrid correspondent Sam Jones has been speaking to more voters: Joaquin Pons, 89, was also delighted to have cast his ballot, as he had done in the symbolic referendum held three years ago. “Last time it was cardboard ballot boxes,” he said. “This time they were real. It was very emotional.” Pons said that he felt Catalans had had little choice but to proceed unilaterally. “It would have been nice if we could all have stayed together in Spain but the Madrid government has made it impossible. It’s sad but that’s the way it is.” There are still long lines of people waiting to cast their vote across Catalonia. El Pais journalist Alfonso Congostrina has posted a video of voters queuing round the corner in central Barcelona. Blai Antonio, a 76-year-old retired taxi driver emerged from the polling station at the Escuela Mireia triumphant and with tears in his eyes. Pushing through a cheering crowd, he said: “The experience of being able to vote has given me a satisfaction I could never have dreamed of. It would have been impossible under Franco – although his heirs are still in power. Catalan independence is important so that we can live in a democracy, which Spain isn’t. We send all our money to the government and get crumbs in return.” Antonio said that, unlike some others, he had been able to vote in peace. “The oppressive police haven’t come here yet but we still have the whole day ahead of us and they could come and steal the ballot boxes with our votes in them. We just want to be able to vote free of the oppression of any state.” More from Stephen Burgen: Catalan government spokesman Jordi Turull has announced that 73% of polling stations have been able to open and asked for patience as “there are constant attacks on the computer system. There are several reports on social media of Spanish police firing rubber bullets at people queuing to vote in the referendum. Princeton researcher Jordi Graupera posted a video of what appears to be a member of the Guardia Civil firing into the crowd. The Spanish interior ministry has asked Catalan schools to collaborate with their operation to halt the referendum. A video of Spanish police confiscating urns in a sports hall in Sant Carles de la Rápita, Tarragona, was also posted on its Twitter page. Sam Jones, the Guardian’s Madrid correspondent, writes: Despite several reports of polling stations being closed down by Spanish police across Catalonia, the Guardian’s Sam Jones says hundreds of people are still queuing up to vote at Cervantes primary school and Escuela Mireia in Barcelona. People waiting in line to vote are cheering those who have already managed to do so. Podemos leader Pablo Iglesias has also been reacting to the intervention by Spanish police. He writes: “Bumps, shoves, old women dragged. What the PP is doing to our democracy is repugnant to me. Corrupt, hypocritical, useless. Is this your ‘victory’ Mariano Rajoy?” The Catalan president, Carles Puigdemont, has voted in Cornellà de Terri, a village in Girona province. Catalan politician Jordi Sánchez posted a picture of the moment. Stephen Burgen writes: Not every polling station has been raided. There is a big crowd at Concepció primary school in Barcelona just around the corner from Balmes school which police have already raided but no sign of police so far here. Barcelona’s mayor, Ada Colau, has tweeted her discontent about the Spanish police’s intervention in the referendum. She writes: “A cowardly president has filled our city with police. Barcelona, city of peace, is not afraid.” Enric Millo, Spain’s highest representative in Catalonia, has been speaking to reporters. He said: “The sole objective of today’s operation has been to ensure that this illegal referendum does not take place and the Spanish and Catalan people can continue to live in peace and liberty as they have these past 40 years. “The referendum has not taken place. We will not accept that a government kidnapped by a minority imposes its ideas on society. El Pais journalist Josep Cata has tweeted a photo of the first vote being cast in Sant Jaume de Frontanyà, the smallest village in Catalonia. He says local police arrived when voting opened, but did nothing to prevent people from casting their vote. Videos of Spanish police in riot gear removing urns from polling stations continue to appear on social media. Stephen Burgen, who is reporting for the Guardian today, says police have taken away the ballot box in Sant Julià de Ramis in Girona province, where the Catalan president, Carles Puigdemont, votes. Our Madrid correspondent Sam Jones is with voters in a school Barcelona. He reports: All is calm at the Escola Cervantes with Mossos hanging back but getting twitchy. The same isn’t true elsewhere in Barcelona. The scenes of Spanish national police in riot gear clearing polling stations in other schools are not going down well with the crowds. The Spanish interior minister, Juan Ignacio Zoido, has just tweeted a video of police removing urns. He says the police are enforcing their legal mandate against the “illegal referendum”. Large queues have been forming outside polling stations overnight as Catalans wait anxiously to cast their vote, but there are already reports of Spanish national police in riot gear removing people from occupied schools and taking away ballot boxes from polling stations in Barcelona. La Vanguardia correspondent Mayka Navarro just tweeted a video of Spanish police appearing to push voters back in the centre of the Catalan capital. Hello and welcome to our live coverage of referendum day in Catalonia. Spain is bracing itself for an unprecedented challenge to its territorial unity as the Catalan regional government stages an independence referendum that has been suspended by the country’s constitutional court and dealt a series of devastating blows by the central government in Madrid. The Catalan government has predicted that 60% of Catalonia’s 5.3 million eligible voters are heading to the polls in defiance of the Spanish government and constitutional court, which have declared the vote illegal. Neither the rain nor the Spanish authorities are discouraging many Catalans from turning out to try to vote. Hundreds of people have been queuing outside the polling station at the Cervantes primary school in central Barcelona since 5am. Inside are dozens of people - adults and children - who have been camped out since Friday night in the hope that their occupation will allow the school to be used a a voting centre. Joan Garcia, an agricultural engineer who’s just spent his second night there, reports that people slept well. Officers from the regional police force, the Mossos d’Esquadra, are under orders to empty polling stations and seal them off. But that’s not happening here. The police, who were greeted with a cheerful “Bom dia!” from the crowd, are coming and going but not intervening so far.The people who have gathered to vote are in good spirits despite the rain, but deadly serious about why they have come. “I’ve been here since 5.15,” said 43-year-old Mireia Estape, who lives locally. “I’m here to fight for our rights and our language and for our right to live better and to have a future.” Asked how likely it was that people would be allowed to cast their ballots, she was insistent: “We will vote today.” One man in the crowd, who did not wish to be named, said that Catalans had a right to vote. “I’m European, not African. In Africa they don’t let people vote.” He said he had come to because, “Catalans need to vote. They’re robbing us in Spain”. It would, he said, would be a great day: “Spain has lost 22 colonies. Today it’s going to lose another.” Another would-be voter was blunter about her motivation: “I don’t want to live in a fascist country.” There was a moment of panic at ten to eight, when a car moved towards the crowd. But it turned out it was carrying a ballot box that was quickly taken inside to cheers and shouts of “Votarem!” (“We will vote!”). Within 10 minutes, the organisers inside announce that voting would begin at 9am. The Mossos continued to maintain a discreet distance. Asked how he was feeling, one officer replied, with a shrug, “Well, here we are, aren’t we?”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/sep/29/talking-horses-racing-tips-newmarket-cambridgeshire-handicap","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-29T23:00:16Z","webTitle":"Talking Horses: 66-1 shot catches eye for Cambridgeshire Handicap at Newmarket","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/sep/29/talking-horses-racing-tips-newmarket-cambridgeshire-handicap","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/sep/29/talking-horses-racing-tips-newmarket-cambridgeshire-handicap","fields":{"headline":"Talking Horses: 66-1 shot catches eye for Cambridgeshire Handicap at Newmarket","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"As a testament to the enduring power of hope over experience, the Cambridgeshire Handicap at Newmarket is difficult to beat. A huge field, a specialist trip and the typical assortment of lightly raced improvers, grizzled handicappers and possible plot horses combine to make it arguably the most treacherous Flat handicap of the season – yet year after year, it keeps drawing us back. Once again, the possibilities are almost endless, and while Thundering Blue is an obvious favourite after three straight wins, he tends to race off the pace and will probably need to come though the field. Very Talented, unraced since finishing third last year off a 1lb lower mark, is interesting at around 14-1, while You’re Fired, one of the fresher horses in the field, should also outrun odds of 33-1. With a couple of firms offering eight places each-way, however, the price that really catches the eye is 66-1 about Mulligatawny (3.35). Roger Fell’s runner was an easy winner off a 3lb lower mark just four runs ago, has remained in form since, races close to the pace and could be a good match for this nine-furlong trip. Others have more scope, but he should not be priced up like a no-hoper. Tips for Saturday’s TV races Newmarket 1.50 Like many of Aidan O’Brien’s juveniles, Nelson took a couple of outings to find his feet, but he has plenty in hand on the ratings after winning a Group Three latest and can make the running if necessary, so should take this with little fuss. Haydock 2.05 With just 10 starts behind him at the age of five, Lord Of The Rock has clearly not been an easy horse to train, but he has an excellent record on testing ground which includes a win in the Spring Mile at Doncaster last year. He returned to form at York in July, has had a decent break since then and looks ready for a big run off a 4lb higher mark. Newmarket 2.20 Clemmie’s earlier win at Newmarket remains the benchmark form for juvenile fillies this season and she should move Aidan O’Brien another Group One win closer to Bobby Frankel’s all-time record, although Threading was impressive in the Lowther at York. Haydock 2.40 This race looks wide open but the consistent Confessional, who is in fine form and proven on the heavy ground, may be the answer. Newmarket 2.55 Sands Of Mali was a 14-1 chance for the Gimcrack at York but there was nothing about the time of the race or the style of his win to suggest any hint of fluke. Unfortunately and Sioux Nation will be tough opponents but Richard Fahey’s colt has form with some cut and stands out at the prices. Haydock 3.15 Ice Age’s win at Windsor in August has been franked repeatedly in recent weeks and he has a big chance on form. Stall two is not ideal, however, and Stake Acclaim, third home at Windsor and badly hampered when still running well in the Portland last time, looks too big at 16-1.

Charteris was first capped in 2004, two years after Juan-Martín Hernández, Sergio Parisse and Gethin Jenkins and the same year as Rory Best, and has won 74 caps. Tall (he is 6ft 9in) and lithe, he looks pretty much now as he did when he made his first appearance in senior rugby, for Newport in 2002, and in the last year of his contract with Bath he is looking to secure an extension. “I tried counting my pre-seasons the other day and stopped when I reached 16 because it was scary,” he says. “I am still enjoying my rugby and would like to carry on. I was injured at the end of last season and while it was disappointing to miss Wales’s summer tour, it allowed me to have a proper pre-season for the first time in a long while and I am feeling good. I was playing before the regions were formed in Wales [in 2003]. It is probably not a good sign as there are not many around now who can say that.” Charteris supplies essential experience in a generally young Bath squad. He packs down in the second row at Wasps on Sunday alongside England’s Charlie Ewels, a player 12 years his junior, as the West Country club look to recover momentum after following up victories in the opening two rounds with defeats at Northampton and, more surprisingly, at home to Newcastle last weekend when, after scoring 32 unanswered points having trailed 19-0, they succumbed to two late tries. “The defeat to Newcastle was frustrating because it was almost as if we lost the game twice,” says Charteris. “It showed that you cannot afford to give anyone in the Premiership a 19-point start. We spent a lot of energy getting back into the game and played good rugby but failed to close it out. It was not a case of thinking we had the game won. The right things were being said on the pitch but we did not quite have enough energy left and individual errors cost us.” Bath started the campaign with only their second Premiership victory at Leicester, 14 years after the first one. After defeating Saracens at home, they lost at Northampton, another ground in the east Midlands where success has been elusive in the league with just two wins in 20 years, and Wasps have lost at the Ricoh Arena only once in the last 20 months, to Harlequins two weekends ago. Bath’s form on the road cost them a place in the play-offs last season: they won three of the first four away but lost the last seven. “A difference about the Premiership now is that teams travel with confidence,” says Charteris. “One of our targets this season is to do better when we are playing away from the Recreation Ground and we travelled a lot in pre-season. Our form on the road last season was not good enough and you have to be able to play well in different environments. “We know how tough it is to win at Wasps but we go there confident that we can win and make things look a lot better again. Both teams like to play and it should be another exciting game.” The time of year is approaching when the season in Europe begins to fragment. The European competitions start in October; Bath’s first match back in the Champions Cup is at home to Benetton on 14 October and their second is the following Friday in Llanelli against the Scarlets, who won last season’s Pro12. Then clubs lose their international players for a month of autumn internationals. “Missing out on the Champions Cup last season was disappointing and having qualified there is no point in not looking to do well,” says Charteris. “We are determined to make the most of it and get out of the group. You are then three matches away and playing in those big games is what it is all about. Qualifying for the knockout stages will be demanding with Toulon and the Scarlets, who are looking really good, in our pool, but we will be going for it and there will be some good contests.” Charteris started three of Wales’s autumn internationals last season but was a replacement for most of the Six Nations. He is used to jostling for a place in the second row with Alun Wyn Jones, Jake Ball and Bradley Davies, but four different players appeared at lock in the summer Tests against Tonga and Samoa, making selection for the four matches in November and December far from clearcut. “I hope to be involved,” says Charteris. “Some young players took their chance in the summer and have started the season well so it will be tough but we will see when the squad is named. New Zealand is the big game of the autumn and with a number of Wales coaches and players on the Lions trip there, they will have learned a lot. The All Blacks have cracked on again in the Rugby Championship and are looking quality, but what happened in the summer should stand us in good stead. “In the last few years the European teams have improved, England and Ireland have done well in the last few autumns and Wales have done better. Five or six years ago there was a pretty big divide between north and south, but the gap is closing. “New Zealand are still the No1 but there is not much between the rest. We are looking for a big season. A number of the boys did well on the Lions tour and they will be confident and rested. I just want to be a part of it.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2017/sep/30/boris-johnson-caught-on-camera-reciting-kipling-in-myanmar-temple","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-29T23:00:16Z","webTitle":"Boris Johnson caught on camera reciting Kipling in Myanmar temple","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/sep/30/boris-johnson-caught-on-camera-reciting-kipling-in-myanmar-temple","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/sep/30/boris-johnson-caught-on-camera-reciting-kipling-in-myanmar-temple","fields":{"headline":"Boris Johnson caught on camera reciting Kipling in Myanmar temple","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The foreign secretary has been accused of “incredible insensitivity” after it emerged he recited part of a colonial-era Rudyard Kipling poem in front of local dignitaries while on an official visit to Myanmar in January. Boris Johnson was inside the Shwedagon Pagoda, the most sacred Buddhist site in the former capital Yangon, when he started uttering the opening verse to The Road to Mandalay, including the line: “The temple bells they say/ Come you back you English soldier.” Kipling’s poem captures the nostalgia of a retired serviceman looking back on his colonial service and a Burmese girl he kissed. Britain colonised Myanmar from 1824 to 1948 and fought three wars in the 19th century, suppressing widespread resistance. Johnson’s impromptu recital was so embarrassing that the UK ambassador to Myanmar, Andrew Patrick, was forced to stop him. The incident was captured by a film crew for Channel 4 and will form part of a documentary to be broadcast on Sunday about the fitness of the MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip to become prime minister. The previously unbroadcast footage shows the diplomat managing to halt Johnson before he could get to the line about a “Bloomin’ idol made o’ mud/ Wot they called the Great Gawd Budd” – a reference to the Buddha. The gaffe came on the first visit to Myanmar by a British foreign secretary in five years. He had taken part in a ritual involving pouring water over a golden statue of what he described as “a very big guinea pig”, when he approached a 42-tonne bell, rang it with a wooden stick and spontaneously started reciting Kipling’s poem. A visibly tense ambassador stood by as Johnson continued: “The wind is in the palm trees and the temple bells they say ...” Then Patrick reminded him: “You’re on mic,” adding: “Probably not a good idea...” “What?” Johnson replied. “The Road to Mandalay?” “No,” said the ambassador sternly. “Not appropriate.” “No?” replied Johnson looking down at his mobile phone. “Good stuff.” “It is stunning he would do this there,” said Mark Farmaner, director of the Burma Campaign UK. “There is a sensitivity about British colonialism and it is something that people in Burma are still resentful about. British colonial times were seen as a humiliation and an insult. “This shows incredible insensitivity by Boris Johnson. It shows an incredible lack of understanding especially now we are seeing the impact of Buddhist nationalism, especially in Rakine state [where Rohingya muslims have been been the subject of violent persecution].” Kipling hardly knew Myanmar at all and only travelled there for three days in his 20s, but his poems and short stories about the place helped forge the image of the country in the imagination of colonial Britain. Rushanara Ali, the Labour MP and chair of the all-party parliamentary group on democracy in Myanmar, said: “I can think of a long list of reasons why Boris Johnson isn’t fit to be prime minister. This can be added to that list.” The Foreign and Commonwealth Office declined to comment. Maung Bo Bo, a Burmese doctoral student in London whose family campaigned alongside Myanmar’s current leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, said offence could be taken because the poem talks about kissing a girl, something that would be frowned on in the context of a temple. Later in the documentary, titled Blond Ambition, Jacob Rees-Mogg describes Johnson as “a colossus on the political stage” and former international development secretary Andrew Mitchell says he is “impossible to dislike”. It captures multiple awkward moments in Johnson’s career at the Foreign Office. In Ankara in September 2016 it shows him being asked whether he would apologise for writing a crude limerick about the Turkish president which included the line that he had “sowed his wild oats with the help of a goat”. An initially shifty-looking Johnson rallied and replied with typical bluster that “nobody has seen fit to raise it”. In London last year he stood alongside former US secretary of state John Kerry and was asked about describing Hillary Clinton as looking “like a sadistic nurse in a mental hospital”. It shows him insulting European leaders in the wake of Donald Trump’s election victory as he complained about the “winge-o-rama” that greeted Trump’s win, and shows how Downing Street had to disown his remarks on Saudi Arabia in Rome – that it was puppeteering and playing proxy wars in the region. He is also seen comparing President Hollande of France to a wartime prison guard who wants to “administer punishment beatings to anybody who chooses to escape, in the manner of some world war two movie”. • This article was amended on 20 October 2017 to clarify that Yangon is the former capital of Myanmar, and on 2 November 2017 to restore part of an edited quotation."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/29/labour-nightmare-brexit-empties-coffers-corbynite-dream-public-investment","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-29T18:34:33Z","webTitle":"Brexit has made Labour's radicalism possible - but it could bury it too","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/29/labour-nightmare-brexit-empties-coffers-corbynite-dream-public-investment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/29/labour-nightmare-brexit-empties-coffers-corbynite-dream-public-investment","fields":{"headline":"Brexit has made Labour's radicalism possible - but it could bury it too","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"It’s hardly thrilling, and an unlikely bestseller, but if you were to attempt to render Britain’s current politics, especially those at play in the Labour party, as a page-turning blockbuster in the style of Robert Ludlum, it could only have one title: The Brexit Paradox. In fact, there’s enough material for a series, given the myriad paradoxes and tensions at work when it comes to Labour and Europe. The most basic is that Labour is a party whose members, activists and MPs are overwhelmingly for remain – and yet seven in 10 Labour-held seats voted leave in last year’s referendum. What’s more, the leader of this passionately pro-EU party is one of only a handful of Labour MPs with a long record of Euroscepticism: he voted against remaining in 1975, against the Maastricht treaty in 1993, against Lisbon in 2009. And yet Jeremy Corbyn’s most devoted supporters include two groups who are clearest in seeing the benefits of the EU: young people and trade unionists. Striking as all these paradoxes are, they are not the most important. The one that matters is this: Brexit has helped make the radicalism of Corbyn possible, but it also poses the greatest threat to its success. That Brexit has opened the door to the Corbyn project was powerfully explained earlier this week by my colleague Rafael Behr. He argued that the Tories had lost the right to dismiss socialist programmes as impossibilist or utopian since the most ardent Brexiteers were engaged in an impossibilist, utopian mission of their own, one anchored in ideological faith with only the weakest tether to reality. Now that wild-eyed, revolutionary talk is the idiom of Conservative cabinet ministers, it breaks no taboo when Labour also offers to upend the status quo. Through Brexit, incautious radicalism has been legitimated by the party whose raison d’etre was once to resist such things on principle. So this week John McDonnell could promise a sweeping programme of renationalisation without looking any more bold or reckless than the government wrenching us out of a set of arrangements that has brought relative peace and prosperity for 40 years. But while Brexit opens one door for Labour, it threatens to slam a heavier one in its face. I’m not referring to the obvious risk of internal division, pitting leavers against remainers. So far, the party has managed that divide quite effectively (even if it meant stifling a Brexit vote on the conference floor). No, this rift runs further, even into the inner circle of senior Labour figures wholly loyal to the leader. At the root of it is the belief, particularly associated with McDonnell, that membership of the single market would tie the hands of a Corbyn government. In this view, EU rules on competition and state aid will hold Labour back from reshaping the British economy, preventing it from renationalising rail, water, energy and the postal service. It’s this fear, above all, that underpins the leadership’s resistance to giving an open-ended commitment to remaining inside the single market. (It took a Herculean effort by shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, to get the party to accept continued membership through a transition period of up to four years.) Corbyn believes none of this should come as a surprise: after all, he raised these worries during the 2016 referendum campaign, when his stance was “remain and reform”. If he advocated a change in, say, EU state aid rules when Britain was inside the EU, why on earth would he want to comply with them once Britain had left? The message from Labour’s high command to ardent remainers is not to get hung up on specific institutional forms – such as single market membership – but rather to focus on outcomes, such as negotiating a good deal with the EU that helps British jobs. The trouble with all this is that it rests on a false premise. Last week two scholars of EU competition law published a study of precisely this question and concluded starkly that “EU law is no barrier to Labour’s economic programme”. As anyone who has travelled on a French or German train knows, public ownership is common across the continent. True, there are EU rules against monopolies – public and private – but all that would mean is that a future British Rail 2.0 might have to allow a European freight company access to UK tracks (thereby enabling rail to compete for international freight business with environmentally unfriendly planes and trucks). Of course, there are rules to navigate around, but as our EU neighbours demonstrate daily, there’s plenty of wriggle room. When Gordon Brown moved to nationalise RBS during the crash, the EU posed no obstacle. And, to take one example, British governments long subsidised the plane-maker Bombardier’s Belfast operation without the EU standing in the way. Which brings us to a crucial point. This week the United States Department of Commerce slapped a tariff on Bombardier because of that state aid – proof that even if we made a clean break from the EU and its single market, the British government would not be an island unto itself. “Socialism in one country” is a fantasy in today’s interconnected world. We could shake off the supposed shackles of Brussels, only to find ourselves still constrained by the World Trade Organisation. Indeed, one senior Labour figure notes that leaving the EU will compel us to make a trading alliance with one of the other two mighty global economic blocs: either the US or China. If we think loss of sovereignty is an issue with the EU, wait till we try our luck with Washington. “Their approach to a trade negotiation is, ‘Here’s the rules: sign here.’” Still this is not the heart of the matter. The reason why Brexit could upend Labour’s plans is more basic than that: leaving the EU will make the British economy poorer. Witness the riposte from the Institute for Fiscal Studies to Boris Johnson’s revival of the bogus £350m figure: far from bringing in money, Brexit will cost us £300m a week. Today new figures showed the weakest rate of UK economic growth since 2013. All but the most deluded Brexiteers concede that departing from the EU will hurt the economy, for a few years at the very least. Corbyn and McDonnell have big plans that will cost big money. But, thanks to Brexit, they will find less cash in the coffers, and less market willingness to lend the country any more. They will face early the shadow that has hung over every reforming Labour government: the prospect of the money running out. This is what should keep Labour’s ruling circle up at night. It’s not the EU that could turn their dreams to ashes – it’s leaving the EU that could do that. • Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/29/leader-logo-new-ukip-lion-premier-league","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-29T17:18:47Z","webTitle":"Wingnut leaders, cut-price logo.

The new Ukip looks just like Oldkip\r\n","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Hugely exciting to see Ukip has unveiled its new logo at its party conference in Torquay – it has great brand recognition. Admittedly, the brand in question is the Premier League. Whether the latter will feel moved to launch a trademark action for the near-reproduction of its image is unclear. For now, we must ask: what sort of party of the people can’t even recognise the bleeding Premier League logo when it sees it? As far as I can make out, the only change Ukip has made is giving the beast in question highlights in its mane. Either way, this is a lion desperately in need of a Minnesotan dentist. Still, on they go. Heeding the advice of its own MEPs – as well as erstwhile leader Nigel Farage and major backer Arron Banks – the party has declined to elect the far-right anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters as its new leader. Instead it has gone with Henry Bolton, a former Lib Dem, former army officer, and the preferred Farage candidate. Even by Ukip’s own malarial standards, the leadership field was eyebrow-sprainingly esoteric. There was Anne Marie; one candidate who proposes we pay dual nationals ten grand to repatriate; a couple of burqa bores; some wingnut off the London assembly who thinks sex education promotes “fringe ideologies” – someone give him a shag, please, and he might go away – and someone who wants to spend £1bn mining the asteroid belt and the moons of Saturn and Jupiter. As for Farage, he has gone west, and may even now be holed up in his Sunset Boulevard mansion, hoping some desperate screenwriter is going to hide their car in his garage. Hang on – I’m forgetting – I think one already has. Yes, I must keep checking in on production news of The Bad Boys of Brexit, the major US TV series based on Brexit backer Arron Banks’s book of the same name which was announced in the summer. According to a series of heavily briefed reports, a “major studio” was apparently poised to pay $60m (£45m) for a six-part series. If memory serves, we’re nearing the date that the publisher Iain Dale is due to fly to Los Angeles to finalise this $10m-an-episode deal for the landmark TV drama serial. That won’t make The Bad Boys of Brexit the joint-top most expensive show on US television – Game of Thrones has just announced a budget increase from $10m an episode to at least $15m for the next series – but it’s nice that they’ll be able to build a full-scale version of every north-east England referendum count venue somewhere in the Mojave desert. Or even right on one of the studio back lots in Hollywood. Face it, they can afford the real estate pretty much anywhere on that budget, even if The Rock plays Farage (at present, only Benedict Cumberbatch has been “linked” with the role). Meanwhile, Farage and Banks had already announced they would be setting up a new party if Waters won, and may yet decide to pursue a version of the idea as Brexit wears on. And yes, they have done this once this year already, with the Patriotic Alliance. It’s like when the earlier incarnation of Spinal Tap had to stop being called the Originals, because there were some other Originals. So they became the New Originals. Surely Banks should just call the latest iteration Newkip, and wait for his own trademark dispute. As far as Oldkip went, Farage was against the party going right – but not so long ago he was warning Paul Nuttall not to move it left. That way led to death too, apparently. “I guess it’s easier in life to be thought of as being nice rather than one of those unpleasant populists,” Nigel observed archly – apparently under the impression that people were starting to think Paul Nuttall looked nice, as opposed to like a factory farmer keeping a court date. It’s hard not to conclude that Ukip can’t go left or right of where Farage is at any given minute. If Waters won, Arron Banks sniffed, he hoped she’d give Ukip “a decent burial”. From the look of her, she was more the type to take it to the middle of the woods and leave it there without food or water. But we won’t find out this time. As for Bolton, the first few months of a new Ukip leader are always such a precious time. Yet despite being a longtime student of the party, even I don’t know who half the “leading lights” are any more. Ukip feels a lot like a visit to the MailOnline showbiz pages, where keeping up with the more recherché Real Housewives of Atlanta really is one for the absolute completists. Whatever happened to that Steven Woolfe, for instance – the Kipper who was until recently talked about as the next big thing, and who I watched read a bonkers self-penned poem to introduce Farage’s final press conference on the eve of the EU referendum? You remember Steven – he was the one who later ended up supposedly getting punched in Strasbourg by that other one, Mike Hookem. You remember Mike – once turned up to the European parliament looking like he’d come as Raoul Moat’s dad. Apparently he was making a point about something military, but honestly – you can’t let yourself get sucked in. So instead, you stop paying attention. In some ways, you forget Ukip is actually still there.It reminds me a lot of when Ariel Sharon was in the coma. But without getting into a full Weekend at Ariel’s analogy – I’m trying not to get sacked before Monday – Ukip has the potential to be reanimated, and to some effect. Yet for all that this takes a light-hearted view of a frequently dark-hearted party, none of it is to write them off, or imagine that the powerful anger behind their greatest success has gone away. Plenty of people thought Ukip were a joke, until they weren’t. What Waters hoped, what Banks and Farage know, and what many of us can see, is that the popular currents Ukip rode and eventually channelled to devastating effect have not evaporated. It is perfectly reasonable to think that Farage and Banks could rally those for whom Brexit is already a sellout – it was never going to solve their problems anyway - under the standard of their proposed new movement. Similarly, it is still possible that the Brexit fallout could help Ukip itself tap into the same anger – and the darkest strains of it. I strongly suspect Waters will be back. Things are unlikely to get better in the short or medium term. And for parties who are in the blame game ... well, that’s just the way they like it. • Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/2017/sep/29/bournemouth-leicester-city-match-preview","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-29T15:56:18Z","webTitle":"Bournemouth v Leicester City: match preview","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/sep/29/bournemouth-leicester-city-match-preview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/sep/29/bournemouth-leicester-city-match-preview","fields":{"headline":"Bournemouth v Leicester City: match preview","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Both managers have called for patience before a meeting between two of the league’s bottom four.

At the time, I was a 30-year-old director of a small manufacturing company in Daventry that desperately wanted to get involved with the European export market. If I wanted to jump into my car and drive around Europe demonstrating my wares, I had to apply for a carnet that allowed me into European countries on a temporary basis without having to pay any import duties on the goods in my vehicle. At every customs point, I had to join a long queue to get my entry into the next country logged and my carnet endorsed. This was torment. If one succeeded in getting an order, endless documentation ensued. By the time one finally got paid, one really wondered if it had been worth the effort. But then along came the EEC. Brilliant – no more customs, a free trade zone. Exactly what we wanted – nothing more, nothing less. I voted to come out of the EU. I do not want to come out of the EEC. It’s the U bit I object to and all the governing ambitions of a federal Europe. None of us voted for the EU – we weren’t given the opportunity. Michael Johnson Northampton Your pages chart the divisions in our society, with few pointers healing them. Clearly both main parties are as divided as the nation. Frequent references to “the will of the people” are an abdication of responsibility. Meanwhile, the exasperated public sees the root causes of the division unaddressed (Letters). Radical leadership is needed to unite the country, but is hard to perceive at the moment. Rather than repeatedly giving credence to the Brexit referendum, which highlighted the almost 50/50 split, we should be going back to the people for a solution. A referendum bill requiring a clear unequivocal decision (say 60%) is required. If necessary, this might promote a series of referendums, held every three months, until the country decides. The voters are better educated now as to the consequences, costs and benefits of their choice. We should trust them. Allowing disunity to continue will open the door to ever more extreme factions exploiting public dissatisfaction. Jon Choppin Blandford Forum Dorset I cannot agree with Will Hutton that there is an inexorable political gravity at work that is leading Britain towards a ‘’hard Brexit’’ and that there is no creative middle way (“Mrs May’s falsehoods are designed only to keep her party together’’, Comment). Certainly for Brexit to mean Brexit Britain must pull out of the single market and relinquish the four freedoms, including that of freedom of movement, so as to take control of her borders. The much-vaunted Norwegian option of remaining part of the European Economic Area so as to enable Britain to remain a member of the single market must be rejected as it would dilute Brexit to the point that it would be worse than meaningless by leading to the worst of both worlds. There is, however, another option that would allow Britain to forge a middle way and that is to broadly follow the route taken by Switzerland, which would entail Britain leaving both the EU and the EEA and rejoining the European Free Trade Association alongside Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. Efta is a looser organisation than the EU, concentrating more on the removal of trade barriers than on the overall co-ordination of economic policy.

I recall as teenager in the 1960s picking up on the pantheon of Labour leaders in my local branch in Glasgow. The settled view then was that Clement Attlee was only a little less of an embarrassment than Ramsay MacDonald (of whom some in the party at that time still nursed feelings of personal betrayal). The welfare state was apparently nothing to do with Attlee but was the single-handed achievement of Aneurin Bevan. Attlee had been the grey, bloodless figure whose retreat from the true faith had forced the radical Harold Wilson along with Bevan out of the cabinet in 1951 and had then cleared the way for the traitor Hugh Gaitskell. It was really only in the later Thatcher years that the left decided that Attlee was the best prime minister of all time. We might be very surprised to see who’s where in another 50 years. Norrie MacQueen Perth • Rachel Holmes’ article might have been selective in its research, as most articles are, but I think saying that Clement Attlee’s personal leadership qualities were hardly of the heroic kind stretched her opinions a little too far. Attlee served as a junior officer in an infantry regiment at the Dardanelles, was invalided out with dysentery, insisted that he was put off the hospital ship at Malta and was returned to his unit at Suvla Bay. He was one of the last British soldiers to leave when the evacuation became inevitable and was posted to Mesopotamia, what we now call Iraq. He was wounded there – by shellfire I think – and was sent back to the UK. He recovered and was posted back to France in the summer of 1918. Being in a situation where you are under fire and people are getting killed doesn’t make you better than others, but the experience of leadership in those sort of circumstances stays with you forever. Denis Healy was a beachmaster at the Anzio landings and poor old Harold Macmillan fought in the trenches in the first world war. Being a management trainee in one of the esoteric professions like marketing or hedgefund dealing, or even going to every demonstration that has happened since 1970, doesn’t quite prepare you for real life. It’s not an argument for a cabinet of ex-squaddies, but rather frontbench people who have experienced real life.

It advances the idea that nature could be widely prescribed by doctors as a therapy, which its supporters say would ease the burden on the NHS. The new analysis tracked people across England taking part in projects run by the Wildlife Trusts, ranging from nature walks and conservation work to the Men in Sheds project in Bolton, which makes bird tables and bug hotels. The volunteers’ wellbeing was tracked using questionnaires by researchers from the University of Essex and they found that half of the people who started with low mental wellbeing had improved after 12 weeks. Two-thirds of all the participants noticed improved wellbeing within six weeks. Some of the volunteers had experienced poor mental health and been referred to the Wildlife Trusts’ schemes by GPs, health centres and NHS trusts. The experience of wildlife, gardening and craftwork was transformational for some. “Getting out in nature makes me feel like I’ve been born again,” said one. “It has stopped me living under a duvet all day,” said another. “The evidence is loud and clear – volunteering in wild places while being supported by Wildlife Trust staff has a clear impact on people’s health,” said Dominic Higgins at the Wildlife Trusts. “It makes people feel better, happier and more connected to other people. The Department of Health should take note – our findings could help reduce the current burden on the NHS because they illustrate a new model of caring for people that does not rely solely on medication and traditional services.” Mike Rogerson at the University of Essex, who led the new research, said: “At a time when we are losing count of the crises in local- and national-level health, engagement with these volunteering activities can provide a much-needed antidote for individuals, local areas and the UK as a whole.” There is good evidence that contact with nature is beneficial for both physical and mental health, and a government assessment in 2011 estimated that the health and welfare benefits of green spaces were £30bn a year. But these benefits are rarely taken into account by decision-makers and huge numbers of green spaces have been lost to development in recent decades. In February, a committee of MPs warned that Britain’s cash-starved parks were at the tipping point of decline. “There has been extensive research on the health-damaging effects of the concrete jungle, so we should not be surprised that mental health is improved by the natural environment,” said Prof John Middleton, president of the UK Faculty of Public Health. “It is a great step forward that this research has now shown some of the benefits. Authorities should look to develop such schemes – it is cheaper than medication and social care, and the improvements to the environment made by volunteers also give us a lasting legacy for the community.” Rogerson said there are a small number of doctors, both in Europe and the US, who do prescribe nature as a remedy for mental health problems, but that it could be done much more widely: “It needs to be on the map for decision-makers – that is the only thing that is missing.” Higgins said access to wildlife-rich green spaces was important: “Those responsible for public health, planning, transport, parks and leisure need to work together to make nature more accessible to people.” The new analysis followed 139 volunteers on Wildlife Trust projects in Gloucestershire, Avon, Nottinghamshire, Tees Valley and Lancashire. “There were improvements for everybody, that is the most important thing to say,” said Rogerson. “But also the individuals who scored poorest on wellbeing from the start, then showed the greatest improvement.” At the start of the study, 39% of the participants reported low wellbeing, compared with UK average scores, but after 12 weeks of increased exposure to nature this had fallen to 19%. “It has helped my depression and agitation and helped me to wind down and make decisions about my life,” said one participant. On average, across all the volunteers there was a statistically significant improvement of 8% in wellbeing scores, which measure how people feel about themselves. Rogerson said bigger studies of the impact of nature on people’s health, with formal control groups like those used in drug trials, were the next step needed. “At the moment there is a very, very strong association, but scientifically you can’t hang your hat on it,” he said. “The evidence base has grown over the last 10 years and confidence is getting there. Now we need to go to the next level to push it over the line and give GPs the confidence that they can prescribe it.” There is a growing interest in “social prescribing”, ie non-medical ways of tackling ill health. In 2014, a groundbreaking trial showed that GPs could transform lives and slash the huge sums spent by the NHS on cold-related problems by prescribing double glazing and loft insulation for patients living in cold, damp homes."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2017/oct/01/kwame-kwei-armah-young-vic-theatre-interview","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-01T15:00:05Z","webTitle":"Kwame Kwei-Armah: ‘As a black male you’re told you can’t do this.

I’ve tried to go: yes we can’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Kwame Kwei-Armah’s imposing face has just been splashed all over the news. Last week he was appointed artistic director of Young Vic in London, one of Britain’s most prestigious theatres. It’s a great job, make no mistake. But there was something more to it than that. He is the first African-Caribbean director to run a major British theatre. Earlier this year he handed in his notice in Baltimore, where he is artistic director of the Center Stage theatre. In the US he is out on his own, too. Last year he described the situation as “almost sinful”. Today, if anything, he feels even more strongly about it. “In America, I am the only black male artistic director of a major theatre. And we’re talking about 100 top regional theatres. And in Britain, I will be the only African-Caribbean director of a major. And in Europe, I don’t know of any, which tells me that in the western world there is only one diasporic African artistic director of a major theatre, and that is what I mean by sinful.” He stops, to make it clear that he’s not bragging. “It can sound like a boast, but that is systematic inequality. I cannot believe there is only one person that can hold the reins of a major cultural institution. It doesn’t make sense. Therefore it has to be systemic.” Rarely has an appointment been greeted with such approval. Kwei-Armah’s accomplished CV is highly unusual for an artistic director. Whereas a number have been successful actors, it is almost unprecedented for artistic directors to also have a formidable record as a playwright. Kwei-Armah has proved himself in all three fields – as an actor, he played paramedic Finlay Newton in Casualty for five seasons; his plays Elmina’s Kitchen, Fix Up and Statement of Regret were all staged at the National Theatre; and in 2005, he became only the second black British playwright to have his work put on in the West End of London when Elmina’s Kitchen transferred. In 2003, he even sang on Celebrity Fame Academy. Kwei-Armah, 50, was born Ian Roberts to working-class parents from Grenada who settled in Southall, west London. In 1979, aged 12, he witnessed the Southall riots – police chasing black and Asian boys along the street with batons and shields followed by skinheads. One day, not long after, the police kicked down the family’s front door, sending his younger brother flying. They ran upstairs to his father’s bedroom, breaking open his wardrobe and ransacking the place. His father had never been in trouble – and he was not charged with anything. That was when Kwei-Armah’s mother said to young Ian: “I need you to be a lawyer.” She felt the family could only be protected if they had a foot in the establishment. But he wasn’t having any of it – he was set on a stage career, preferably as an R&amp;B singer. His father worked at the Quaker Oats factory and his mother held down three jobs (nurse, nanny and hairdresser) to put him through stage school. As a child, he did not just face racism from white people. Lighter-skinned black people told him he was too dark, his nostrils too flared, his lips too thick. Teachers told him the structure of his mouth stopped him from speaking properly. A female cousin told him that if he pinched his nose a few times a day, he could streamline it – after a few weeks he gave up. Unsurprisingly, he was soon politicised – not least by the writings of Malcolm X and the TV series Roots, about African American Alex Haley tracing his lineage back to Kunta Kinte in Gambia. At the age of 19, he started to research his own family tree, through the slave trade back to his ancestral roots in Ghana. At 21, having graduated from the Open University with a degree in African civilisation, he announced that he was no longer Ian Roberts; he was changing his name to Kwame Kwei-Armah. Kwame means “born on a Saturday” (he was actually born on a Thursday) and Kwei-Armah means “to find the way”. We meet at the Donmar Warehouse in London, where he is directing rehearsals of Ibsen’s The Lady from the Sea. He is as stylishly dressed as ever – muslin shirt, bomber jacket, tracky bottoms, huge loafers (size 12), cerebral specs, all black, set off by yellow Buddhist beads. I last interviewed Kwei-Armah 14 years ago, when he had just premiered Elmina’s Kitchen (a play set in a West Indian restaurant in Hackney that tackled his great fear – black boys who felt they had to conform to a gangster stereotype). The transition to playwright was a huge moment for him. Kwei-Armah was in his mid-30s, ebullient, great fun, puppyish in his enthusiasm. He’s still got that great roar of a laugh, but he seems different – quieter, stronger, less try-hard. The job in Baltimore was a fantastic opportunity not just to run a theatre, but to build one virtually from scratch. And there was another draw. Kwei-Armah went over in 2011 with his second wife, Michelle, and their son Iyare, then aged five (he has three children from a previous marriage): “The idea that Iyare would grow up under Obama was so intoxiating and beautiful.” But he ended up experiencing something very different – a wrecked economy, widespread poverty, people divided increasingly along racial lines, the fallout from Obama’s presidency, the rise of populism. “What I’ve seen over the years is the rise of rage; the rise of a true understanding that disparity and inequality is deeply baked into our system, and that’s for white folk, too.” Sometimes he experienced the rage first hand. He tells me a story of a train journey he took from New York to Baltimore. “I had my laptop open and was writing. A white male sat opposite me, probably in his late 50s. He was drinking and leant over and asked: ‘Are you one of those scary black men ’cause I’m afraid of black men and spiders.’ He then spilled bile for about 45 minutes. I said absolutely nothing, just going ‘OK’, trying to calm him down. In the end, he got up and put two fingers into the shape of a gun and went to my brain and said: ‘That’s what we should do with you,’ and he just went ‘BAAAAAAANG!’” I jump, shocked. “That’s the level of rage that was bubbling coming up to the election,” Kwei-Armah says. “So Trump’s victory was not a surprise for me.” Meanwhile, the Black Lives Matter movement was taking off after 17-year-old Trayvon Martin was shot in Florida and his killer, George Zimmerman, was acquitted. Kwei-Armah says it is only recently he has begun to realise what an impact the movement has had on him – personally, politically, professionally. “The day Zimmerman was released, I walked around Baltimore and for the first time in my life I saw existential angst and fear in the eyes of the black community. Mothers and fathers going: ‘I don’t know how to protect my children. I used to say, just put your hands up, don’t answer back, these are all tools that will save your life, and now I don’t know.’” At the same time, Kwei-Armah was being challenged at the theatre. “People were saying: ‘Kwame’s doing too many black plays.’ I was actually doing the same number that had been done by my predecessor, though she was white, so possibly they perceived that as an act of philanthropy and mine as an active agenda.” Rather than give in to the pressure, he went the other way, hiring 10 writers to go into the poorest areas of the city, talk to people and write plays about their experiences. The more killings there were, the more activist his theatre became. He commissioned 50 American playwrights to write plays about how the country was changing and shot them as videos. “We shot on the spot where many of the black men were killed – Michael Brown, Trayvon, Eric Garner. We’d shoot what I called Rapid Response Theatre, five-minute plays. We did it while a funeral was happening in Charleston after nine black people were killed in the church. We got shut down by the police, we got run off estates.” You seem so different, I tell Kwei-Armah, more grownup. He smiles, and says he had a lot of growing up to do in the US – and quickly. He had never run a theatre, or managed budgets and staff. “At times I felt out of my depth.” He oversaw a $32m (£24m) transformation that turned an unwelcoming space into a sophisticated complex with two additional theatres. The funny thing is, he says, he took his board over to the Young Vic in London to show what he wanted his theatre to look and feel like: warm, bustling, alive, social. He was also determined to change the demographic of the audience. Despite the fact that Baltimore is 65% African American, only 11% of the audience were. “The theatre itself was almost sending out signals saying: ‘It’s safe for you to come from the counties into the theatre.’ Our box office had bullet-proof glass, and I was like: ‘This is closed, not open, and we need to send out the signs that we are open.’” Now, 22% of the audience are African American. How did he change things? He smiles. “Event theatre. To get new people in, I needed to put on plays that made them go: ‘Oh, I get brownie points tomorrow at work having seen it.’ It was difficult to get star names to come to Baltimore, so I created plays about stars. I found a play, One Night in Miami, about Muhammad Ali and Sam Cooke. All of a sudden, people went: ‘Oh, I want to see that play about Muhammad Ali.’” It was April 2015 and they were deep into rehearsing a musical he had written about Bob Marley when Baltimore rioted after 25-year-old African American Freddie Gray died after sustaining injuries to his neck and spine in a police vehicle. “There was so much pain on the streets in Baltimore. I said I’d like to take the cast to the point of the disturbances, and sing all the songs from the show. We took a vote and all the cast said: ‘Absolutely.’ There was just a mic and some speakers and within 10 minutes about 300 people had gathered. People were dancing in the street, and drivers were beeping their cars. It was like Fame! Then the National Guard, who were on patrol, started walking towards us and I was like: ‘They’re going to shut us down.’ They came up and went: ‘Can you do Three Little Birds?’” Kwei-Armah rocks with laughter. “That will be with me all the days of my life.” I am left open-mouthed by Kwei-Armah’s stories – and his achievements. I think back to the eager-to-please young man I met on the South Bank 14 years ago. You seemed hyper then, I say; more actorly. “Yeah, I’d buy that,” he says. “I think I’ve been trying to answer a lot in my life. People go: as a black male, you can’t do this. And I think I’ve tried to go: yes, we can. That’s the box you want to put me in? Well, I’m not going to allow you to put me in that box.” Can he give an example? “Yes, my accent. I taught myself to sound like this. Really, when I’m at home I sound far more estuary. I do a lot of: ‘Yeah blud! What ya talkin ’bat?’” In other words, he says, he might have defied stereotypes by speaking the Queen’s English, but he was still allowing others to set the terms of his rebellion. “I finally went: ‘Stop seeking approval, no matter how subconscious it is. Stop! Just be!’ I think maybe that is a difference in me in the last 14 years.” So he started doing things just for himself – street theatre, ensuring that at least 50% of the plays he put on were written by women, insisting that the classics were directed by people of colour so they could never be told they lacked sufficient breadth when applying for top jobs. After the theatre’s refurbishment was complete, Kwei-Armah handed in his notice. Why? “I got a feeling in my stomach that I’d done what I came there to do. I thought if I stayed it would just be to play with the toys and for the wage.” His family thought he was bonkers. He won’t be leaving until next year, when he will replace the hugely respected David Lan, who has been at the Young Vic for 18 years. “When it was announced David was leaving, everybody was asking me if I was going to go for it. Then I met with David, and I threw my hat into the ring.” It is only three weeks since he was interviewed by a panel of the great and the good, including Stephen Daldry. How did he convince them he was the one? He grins. “I said the Young Vic is funky, and I love me some funk. Then I was fortunate enough to be offered it.” The Young Vic is not known for new writing. Will he introduce more? “Of course I’m going to do new plays. But the Royal Court does that too, so it’s finding the right new plays.” Kwei-Armah says that for all he’s changed, he’s still in touch with the 19-year-old Ian Roberts who decided it was time to find a new identity. “My 19-year-old self is the person I judge myself by. The 19-year-old Ian saw the world in a really clear fashion. I can sometimes call it pragmatism; he would have called it compromise. He saw truth without the complication of responsibility.” What would 19-year-old Ian say to him? I think there would be some disappointment. I think I’d have to explain some of the choices I’ve made. He would look at the demographic that go to theatre, and say: ‘Who are you talking to?’” What would he answer? “I’d say I’ve tried to make theatre more accessible because I believe in it as an art form. I love it, and I can bring more people to this brilliant art form.” His beloved mother died 12 years ago. Does he think she would be happy about the new job or still want him to be a lawyer? He looks on the verge of tears. “I think she would love the glass ceilingness of it. I think she would hug me and be very, very proud.” The Lady from the Sea is at the Donmar Warehouse, London, from 12 October, donmarwarehouse.com."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/02/catalonia-crisis-spain-referendum-independence","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-02T16:34:07Z","webTitle":"The crisis in Catalonia is being fed by pernicious myths on both sides | Victor Lapuente Giné","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/02/catalonia-crisis-spain-referendum-independence","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/02/catalonia-crisis-spain-referendum-independence","fields":{"headline":"The crisis in Catalonia is being fed by pernicious myths on both sides","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"How is it that a country whose economic performance, human development and democratic integrity have improved so vastly over the past four decades is now dealing with one of Europe’s worst territorial and constitutional crises? The answer isn’t the economy. Spain, and particularly Catalonia, is growing faster than most European countries. It isn’t a deep ethnolinguistic conflict either. The relationship between Catalan and Spanish speakers is exemplary. Ideas are the problem. Two pernicious myths are at the root of the current stalemate. The first, shared by Catalan separatists and the global leftwing intelligentsia alike, is that Spain’s government has historically been highly authoritarian and centralist. The second, a commonplace among Spanish unionists and right-leaning thinkers worldwide, is that hawks handle such crises better than doves do. The view of Spanish central government as an oppressor fuelled the Catalan separatist movement from the start. And this perspective has also permeated much of the international coverage of any conflict in Catalonia. But Spain was never the centralised and absolutist kingdom portrayed in, for instance, comparisons between the British and Spanish empires. Quite the contrary; as economic historians such as Regina Grafe have convincingly shown, Spain was a highly decentralised state where policies emerged as a result of bargaining between different factions. From its inception Spain was a pluralist political endeavour. Rulers from tiny Christian states, although in constant competition with each other, granted large freedoms to the settlers of the territories reconquered from the Arabs. It is no coincidence that the first example of modern parliamentarism in the history of western Europe was the Cortes of León in 1188. Spanish cities and regions enjoyed self-governing capacities unknown in other countries. They exerted a veto over central government’s policies. Both the successes and failures of modern Spain owe much to this pervasive legacy. On the one hand, the coexistence of different regional regulations and taxes made the creation of a unified economic market very difficult. On the other, territorial diversity encouraged the push and pull of the competition and cooperation that have driven the extraordinary progress of Spain ever since the restoration of democracy with the 1978 constitution. The positive spillovers of these historic freedoms go beyond the economic sphere. Spaniards have a healthily sceptical view of power. This anti-elitism can be seen in the daily (and nightly) life of any town, where people from different social classes share conversations in bars and restaurants. It can also be seen in Spain’s political life. In the past, economic hardship promoted bottom-up libertarian movements, from the anarchists to the indignados, rather than far-right authoritarian ones. Likewise, Spain is an open country that has successfully integrated millions of immigrants without giving rise to a xenophobic party; it is one of the world’s most tolerant societies towards sexual minorities. Yet instead of selling this triumph of diversity, the Spanish government has reacted to Catalan separatism with clumsily implemented aggression. As a result, Madrid has managed to appear both repressive and ineffective. Prime minister Mariano Rajoy could have allowed the Catalans to vote in a referendum that lacked basic democratic credentials and would have never been recognised by the international community. Indeed, this is what he did in 2014, when the separatists organised an illegal referendum. This time Rajoy chose not to turn a blind eye. The decision looked sound from a cold, rational perspective. If a central government hesitates before a separatist threat, let alone offers concessions, that sends a signal of weakness. But we have now reached a heated, emotional moment. Sending thousands of police officers to close polling stations created opportunities for violence. The images of elderly women bleeding after trying to cast their votes on Sunday have naturally infuriated separatists and many other Spaniards besides. And they have prompted many Catalans who were initially opposed to the referendum to change sides. Rajoy’s move could not have been more counterproductive. The political-bureaucratic elite that controls the ruling conservative Partido Popular (People’s party) has failed to understand that a modern state depends not on the monopoly of violence, but on the monopoly of legitimacy. Two characteristics make the Catalan problem particularly difficult. First, Catalan society is so evenly divided that an independent Catalonia is as improbable as the disappearance of separatism from the political agenda. Second, secessionism has stronger support among the politically influential Catalan upper-middle classes than among disadvantaged socioeconomic groups. Events in Catalonia have implications for Europe. It’s unlikely that Catalan separatism will propel similar secessionist challenges. No other separatist movement, apart from that of Scotland, has the popular and organisational support. Yet it’s likely that Spain’s internal turmoil will escalate, triggering an international crisis by forcing major diplomatic players to take sides. We are far from the incendiary secessionist tensions of former communist countries, from the Balkans to Ukraine. But we are moving in that direction. All of this feels unnecessary. But it is what happens when false narratives poison a relatively good democracy. • Victor Lapuente Giné is an associate professor of political science at the University of Gothenburg, Sweden, and a columnist for El País"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/oct/02/hitting-the-right-nerve-with-depression-the-electronic-vns-implant","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-02T05:00:22Z","webTitle":"Hitting the right nerve: the electronic neck implant to treat depression","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/02/hitting-the-right-nerve-with-depression-the-electronic-vns-implant","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/02/hitting-the-right-nerve-with-depression-the-electronic-vns-implant","fields":{"headline":"Hitting the right nerve: the electronic neck implant to treat depression","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Steve Collins is a 45-year-old unemployed architect who has been living with severe depression for 15 years. “I’m like a hermit crab hiding under rocks, crouching in dark spaces and only venturing out occasionally; there’s no light, no hope, no way in or out. I’ve been in therapy for years and must have taken at least six different antidepressant drugs. I had ECT (electroconvulsive therapy) and that literally shocked me out of it for a bit, but the depression came back – and the idea of ECT was so shocking for my family. People say: ‘Well, at least you haven’t got cancer.’ But, honestly, I’d rather have almost anything than live like this.” A new type of treatment, vagal nerve stimulation (VNS), may offer hope for people like Collins who don’t improve with conventional depression treatment. A small battery-powered device like a pacemaker is inserted under the skin in the neck, from where it emits pulses of weak electical current to stimulate part of the vagus nerve. The vagus normally monitors our vital functions; it collects information about our breathing, heart rate and joint position, and sends signals back to the brain that tell it to respond if there are fluctuations. No one fully understands how VNS works in severe depression that has been unresponsive to other treatments, admits psychiatrist Prof Hamish McAllister-Williams, of Newcastle University. “We don’t know exactly how lots of treatments work in psychiatry, including antidepressant drugs. I’m more interested in whether something works and, in the case of VNS, I’m persuaded that it does.” He cites two recent studies supporting the role of VNS, in addition to the usual treatment options of drugs, talking therapies and ECT. He says it’s likely to be a true effect, not just a placebo, because a placebo tends to kick in quickly – and wear off quickly – whereas VNS takes six months to work, but at least half of those who respond, remain well. It may be particularly effective with people like Collins, who have improved after ECT, but whose depression keeps on returning. VNS is difficult to get in the UK; funding can only be arranged if the specialist appeals to a panel that funds individual requests. McAllister-Williams knows of some areas where funding has been agreed but it remains a postcode lottery. With each device costing about £10,000 and lasting 10 years, he believes it is cost-effective compared with regular ECT that costs £1,000 per treatment, or repeated hospital admissions. “I think VNS is being underused, especially among people who have responded to ECT but who have relapsed. And we know that if you wait for more than five years before offering the treatment, it’s less likely to work.” But nothing that works is ever entirely free of side-effects, so what are the downsides? US psychiatrist Scott Aaronson is the lead author of a large, recently published five-year study, comparing the outcome for patients with treatment-resistant depression who are given standard treatment, with those given VNS. “The tolerability of the device is terrific. The main side-effect is hoarseness because the recurrent laryngeal nerve [that supplies the voice box] comes off the vagus nerve. Patients who want to sing in a choir or work in telemarketing may be bothered by the hoarseness – it sounds as if you’ve got a frog in your throat. But they can temporarily switch off the device by holding a magnet over it.” Aaronson is also unsure about the exact way VNS works but says: “My best guess is that VNS stimulates the nerves that travel back up to the brain’s limbic system [the area that controls emotion, mood and behaviour] to release more neurotransmitters [chemical messengers between nerves]. We have animal models that show increased blood flow and neurotransmitters after VNS.” And he is convinced it is worth a try when all else has failed. “If I had severe depression and needed to feel better right away, I’d get ECT because VNS takes six months to kick in. But boy, every day, I’d rather have VNS than repeated ECT.” Psychiatrist Umberto Albert, of the University of Turin, is also cautiously optimistic about VNS. “There is strong opposition to ECT in Italy, so we really don’t have anything to offer people with severe depression who have tried talking therapies and at least four antidepressant drugs. In the right patients, VNS can be effective, although they need to keep taking the drugs and be patient because it certainly takes six months until you see the effect.” The mental health charity, Mind, remains cautious: “VNS can be used to treat severe, treatment-resistant depression but Nice has issued guidance saying that there is not much evidence about how well it works or how safe it is.” They also point to other side-effects including coughing, shortness of breath, changes to heart rhythm and worsening depression or mania. “For these reasons we would suggest that VNS should only ever be used as a last resort for treatment-resistant depression, when all other treatments have failed. Anyone considering VNS should be made fully aware of the procedure and the associated side-effects and be able to give full consent to treatment.” For those – like Collins – for whom all other options have indeed been exhausted, the idea of a relatively low-risk gadget that boosts the body’s own chemicals, instead of relying on potentially toxic drugs, is certainly appealing. And this rapidly growing area of medicine called bioelectronics is being applied to a range of conditions. VNS is already approved by Nice to treat children with epilepsy who haven’t responded to standard treatments, and there is a lot of excitement about recently published work showing a positive effect in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn’s disease. So could these programmable implants one day replace medication? They are unlikely to be a panacea for all ills, but it certainly seems as if we’re going to be hearing a lot more about bioelectronics in the next few years."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/sep/30/police-say-there-were-grounds-to-suspect-edward-heath-over-child-abuse-claims","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-30T06:00:26Z","webTitle":"Police say there were grounds to suspect Edward Heath over child abuse claims","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/sep/30/police-say-there-were-grounds-to-suspect-edward-heath-over-child-abuse-claims","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/sep/30/police-say-there-were-grounds-to-suspect-edward-heath-over-child-abuse-claims","fields":{"headline":"Police say there were grounds to suspect Edward Heath over child abuse claims","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A police investigation has found there were initial grounds to suspect former prime minister Sir Edward Heath over child sexual abuse allegations. Wiltshire police will release a report into the claims against Heath next week following a two-year inquiry, and its conclusion means that if the politician had still been alive he may have been formally interviewed by detectives under criminal caution. The report will acknowledge the difficulty in assessing the validity of such historic abuse claims which date back decades and it will not reach a conclusion on whether Heath, who died in 2005, was guilty of the allegations. The threshold for reason to suspect is relatively low in the English criminal justice system. Officers reached the conclusion, at least in part, because of the similarities in accounts from several complainants who alleged they were abused by Heath. The Wiltshire force believe those accounts remain credible, and nothing has been found to undermine them by detectives. In private they have described those people as “victims”. An interview under criminal caution is a key stage in building a criminal case against a suspect, but it also offers them an opportunity to rebut claims and dispute facts. Heath was unmarried and his private life attracted speculation, some of it lurid and unfair. Heath became Conservative party leader in 1965 and later was the UK’s seventh postwar prime minister, serving from 1970 to 1974. However, supporters of the former prime minister believe the findings by police are an unfair stain on Heath’s reputation and want a fresh judge-led inquiry. Lincoln Seligman, godson of Heath, told the Guardian: “I want a judge-led review of the evidence, because that is the only way of getting to the truth. There is no other way I can see to get justice. “I think they [the police] will suggest that the witnesses they have investigated tally with each other, therefore that makes their evidence credible. We fear the stain will remain, unfairly, for years.” Wiltshire’s team also found material undermining the credibility of other people who came forward to make allegations against the former prime minister. Over 30 people contacted detectives. The allegations against Heath came from people across the country and the investigation was led by Wiltshire police in western England, because the former prime minister had a home in Salisbury. Mike Veale, the chief constable of Wiltshire, believed and will argue when the report in unveiled that the force was obliged to investigate. That need was made greater because Heath reached the very top of the British establishment and state power structure. Veale felt his team of investigators and himself were being pressured to drop the inquiry, and faced a barrage of media criticism. Detectives in the Heath inquiry, codenamed Operation Conifer, believe they have avoided the errors made by an earlier high-profile investigation into sexual abuse by the powerful, Scotland Yard’s ill-fated Operation Midland, which was castigated by an inquiry for falling for claims from a single alleged fantasist. The usual resolution for a police criminal inquiry is asking prosecutors for a decision on charging. This was not available in the Heath case as the Crown Prosecution Service will not give advice in a case where the suspect is deceased, even if it is of considerable public interest. The full report from Operation Conifer will go the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse, which is likely to consider it as part of an inquiry into whether the powerful were protected from proper criminal investigation. One former detective said he had received a claim of sexual abuse by Heath while the former prime minister was still alive. Former Scotland Yard detective chief inspector Clive Driscoll, who masterminded the breakthrough that captured Stephen Lawrence’s killers, said Wiltshire teams visited him, and he praised their professionalism: “The detectives who came to see me were dedicated, with no axe to grind, and interested only in seeking the truth.” Seligman criticised a police appeal in August 2015, which launched outside Heath’s former home. Supt Sean Memory, who went on to be the senior investigating officer leading the Heath inquiry, appealed for “victims” of the former prime minister to contact police. Seligman, who is essentially the chief spokesperson defending the reputation of the deceased prime minster, said: “If you broadcast an appeal for victims, that is what you get, whether they are victims or not.” In December 2016, Veale was stung by consistent media criticism to denounce claims the Wiltshire investigation was a fishing trip. At that time he said: “I will remain operationally independent and will not be influenced by inappropriate and unacceptable pressure from people who don’t know the detail of this case. “I will not be buckling under pressure to not investigate or to conclude the investigation prematurely.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"culture/2017/sep/29/late-night-hosts-on-trumps-tax-plan-it-only-sets-us-back-2tn","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-29T17:01:13Z","webTitle":"Late-night hosts on Trump's tax plan: 'How can I make rich people richer?'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/sep/29/late-night-hosts-on-trumps-tax-plan-it-only-sets-us-back-2tn","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2017/sep/29/late-night-hosts-on-trumps-tax-plan-it-only-sets-us-back-2tn","fields":{"headline":"Late-night hosts on Trump's tax plan: 'How can I make rich people richer?'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Late-night comics took turns to lambast Donald Trump’s tax reform plans and his lethargic response to the humanitarian crisis in Puerto Rico. “Folks have you ever woken up and said to yourself first thing in the morning ‘what can I do, even in my own small way, to make rich people richer?’” asked Stephen Colbert at the start of his monologue on Trump and taxation. “If the answer is: you’ve never done that, then you did not write Donald Trump’s tax plan,” he added. After showing a clip of Trump suggesting that the changes to tax policy would not benefit him in any way Colbert responded by doing an impression of the president. “Doing the right thing never seems to be good for Donald Trump. ‘Oh, what do people like? Racial equality and American football? How do I ruin both of those at once?’ Colbert went on to point out that based on the latest Trump tax return available to the American people, Trump would save $31m if calculated using his suggested changes to taxation. “Those are Lotto numbers,” said Colbert. “That’s not Powerball, that’s I’m in Powerball.” The comedian also focused on members of the Trump campaign using private email accounts to conduct White House matters – something the president lambasted Hillary Clinton for while on the campaign trail. “Of course, Trump has no problem with this now,” said Colbert. “I’ve not seen Trump go back on his word like this since he didn’t build a border wall, or repeal Obamacare, or give up his businesses, or release his tax return … or never play golf.” “He’s flip-flopping so much, he’s going to take a knee during the national anthem,” he added. Seth Meyers weighed in on the taxation policy too. “The only way he would raise taxes on the rich is if he could pick which rich people,” said Meyers. “‘Rosie O’Donnell – she’s going to get her taxes raised. Meryl Streep has got to pay her fair share. Everyone in the NBA except for the tall white guys.’” Trevor Noah turned his attention to the impact of hurricanes Maria and Irma on Puerto Rico, and to Trump’s response to the crisis. He picked up on Trump’s ham-fisted efforts to discuss the logistical difficulties involved in getting aid to a Caribbean island. “I know it seems like President Trump doesn’t know what he’s speaking about but that’s just because he doesn’t know how to speak,” joked Noah. “The essence of what he’s trying to say is true: that is, compared to states on the mainland it’s harder to get help to Puerto Rico.” Noah suggested that Trump should have a translator in the same way a foreign leader who doesn’t speak English would have. He went on to discuss the phenomenon of donor fatigue, which is: “It feels like there’s a new hurricane every week, but the truth is everyone still needs to help. Don’t think of it as a donation, think of it as paying Puerto Rico back for all they’ve given us: Despacito, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Jennifer Lopez.” “If you’ve ever listened to Despacito, you should give a dollar. If you’re a fan of Hamilton, give a dollar. If you’ve ever fantasized about J-Lo, give a dollar,” he joked."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"news/2017/oct/01/corrections-and-clarifications","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-01T20:00:11Z","webTitle":"Corrections and clarifications","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/oct/01/corrections-and-clarifications","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2017/oct/01/corrections-and-clarifications","fields":{"headline":"Corrections and clarifications","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"• An interview with the actor Armie Hammer referred to Armand Hammer as his Russian grandfather.

Facebook automatically converts certain character combinations into graphical emoticons: for example, if you enter “:D” it will appear as a laughing face, while “&lt;3” gives you a heart. See emojicodes.com for a full list. Laptop users can also use keyboard shortcuts to navigate around the site quickly; on Chrome for Windows, for example, pressing alt+2 takes you directly to your timeline, while alt+3 opens your friends list. The key combinations vary depending on your browser: see this page for details. Create blogpost-style notes Status updates are great, but ephemeral. If you want to post something more permanent, create a note and it will be forever visible under your user profile. To do this, you’ll need to be using a desktop browser: you’ll find “notes” under the “more” dropdown on your profile page. Click “add note” to create as many entries as you like and optionally decide who can see them. To view notes on the mobile app, simply open a user profile and tap “about”. Save interesting posts for later Facebook shares and stories have a tendency to whiz past. If you see something that you’ll want to come back to, you can easily save it for future reference. Simply tap the ellipsis at the top right of any post and select “save” from the pop-up menu. To revisit saved items, tap the menu icon at the top right of the screen and select “saved” from the list of links that appears. On a desktop browser, click the “saved” link to the left of your news feed. Create “friend lists” for privacy Don’t want to share everything with your family and work colleagues? With “friend lists” you can easily post updates that are visible only to certain people. You can create as many lists as you like, but you’ll need to use a desktop browser to do it: the friend-list link is to the left of your news feed. Once you’ve made a list, you can tap the “privacy” dropdown while creating a new post allowing you to specify who will be able to see it. Review (and censor) your activity history Facebook remembers everything you do – creepy, eh? But it means you can review your past searches and actions by simply tapping the “settings” icon at the top right of the app and opening the activity log. You can revisit old posts that you’ve previously liked or events that you went to, plus other people’s posts that you were mentioned or tagged in. If there’s something that you would prefer not to be reminded of, tap and you’ll see the option to delete it or hide it from your timeline. Nominate someone to manage your account after you die What will happen to your Facebook account after you pass away? Nominate a trusted “legacy contact” and they’ll be able to update your profile, share information with your friends and, optionally, close your account. (Don’t worry, they can’t edit your posts or read your messages.) To choose a legacy contact, open “settings” in the mobile app, then go to account settings &gt; general &gt; manage account. If you’re not the trusting sort, you can also opt to have your account quietly deleted after you die. Sync events and birthdays with your regular calendar Facebook alerts you to forthcoming events and birthdays, but it’s often more convenient to view these in your regular calendar. You can set this up easily: open Facebook in a desktop browser, go to the “events” page and scroll down; towards the bottom right of the page you’ll see two inconspicuous links for “upcoming events” and “birthdays”. Clicking these will generate a link that can import iCal, Google Calendar or Microsoft Outlook so that all your important dates are in one place. Create an account with a one-word name Facebook doesn’t normally allow single-word names such as Cher or Bono, but there’s an exception for Indonesian users who often genuinely don’t have surnames. So, if you want to ditch your surname you just have to persuade Facebook that you’re in Indonesia. This calls for a bit of technical trickery: use a VPN (such as expressvpn.com) to route your internet connection via Jakarta, then change your language to Bahasa Indonesia. Go into your account settings and you’ll find it is now possible to delete your surname. Download videos from your timeline Facebook makes it easy to download full-quality photos from your news feed. Sadly, downloading videos isn’t an option, although it can be done with third-party tools. If you’re using Chrome on the desktop, the easiest way is to install the free Social Video Downloader extension , which adds a convenient download button to embedded videos. If you’re using a mobile device (or just don’t want to install an extension), visit fbdown.net and paste in the URL of a shared video to download it automatically. Create a “story” and see who’s paying attention Facebook “stories” combine images, video and fun graphical overlays into an instant slideshow that vanishes after 24 hours. To get started, tap “your story” at the top of the home screen; then, once you’ve assembled your masterpiece, press the big arrow at the bottom to share it with the world. The trick with stories is that they can also give you a sneaky insight into who’s stalking your feed – tap the eye icon at the bottom left of the story to see who has viewed it. Post status updates via SMS Facebook’s account settings include an option to enable text messaging support, so that you can post updates and receive notifications by SMS. The idea might sound old fashioned, but in an emergency it could be a lifesaver: when you’re desperately low on battery power or have no data coverage, you can get a message to all your Facebook friends by simply texting it to 32665 (“FBOOK”). You can also text “OTP” to receive a one-time password so that you can log in if your account has been compromised. Facebook without the bloat The Facebook app is notorious for slowing down your phone and devouring your battery. One option is to access Facebook via your smartphone’s web browser or try a free, lightweight third-party client such as Facebook Lite for Android or Lite for Facebook on iOS. Facebook also publishes its own Lite app, but it’s only available in developing countries such as India, so if you want to try it you’ll need to use a VPN to spoof your location."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/sep/30/bhattacharyya-professor-fix-it-industry-wmg","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-01T04:58:21Z","webTitle":"Lord Bhattacharyya: Professor Fix-it of British industry","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/30/bhattacharyya-professor-fix-it-industry-wmg","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/sep/30/bhattacharyya-professor-fix-it-industry-wmg","fields":{"headline":"Lord Bhattacharyya: Professor Fix-it of British industry","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Lord Bhattacharyya of Moseley has been on speed-dial for prime ministers and captains of industry since Margaret Thatcher first sought his advice on how to reshape British industry with her ambitious privatisation programme. Bhattacharyya, the 77-year-old regius professor of manufacturing and chairman of Warwick university’s Manufacturing Group (WMG), is also a business adviser and close confidant of Ratan Tata, former chairman and figurehead of Tata Group, the Indian conglomerate that owns Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), Tata Steel and Tetley Tea. The manufacturing guru helped broker the 2008 deal for Tata to buy JLR from Ford and was closely involved in the 2007 acquisition of Corus to form Tata Steel Europe. While the car company has roared on to success, the steel business has struggled through headwinds caused by cheap Chinese steel and high energy costs. A deal to merge the European steel operations of Tata with ThyssenKrupp, a German rival, was announced late last month after Tata removed a significant obstacle by offloading its UK retirement fund in August. The Indian group ditched the £15bn British Steel pension scheme, inherited in the Corus deal, which threatened the survival of its UK business. Bhattacharyya believes the proposed tie-up will secure a brighter future for the steel business. “It will be better with ThyssenKrupp. Or else it will get isolated,” he says. “In Britain, the energy costs are so high, so the penalty heavy industries have to pay has to be looked at [by government].” The Remainer believes that erecting barriers to the free movement of skilled workers and imposing charges on goods flowing between Britain and the EU will inevitably have some impact. So, what does Britain need from the Brexit deal for industry to flourish? “Free movement of skilled people and no tariffs,” he says, without hesitation. The car industry is particularly sensitive to additional costs being slapped on the movement of parts and skilled workers. The carmakers are multinational operators that are used to transferring millions of components each week between their European operations without being hit with additional costs or border delays. “In my judgment, there will be a soft Brexit for car manufacturers,” Bhattacharyya says. “Because it’s not in [the UK’s EU partners’] interests to crucify us and it’s not in ours to crucify them. “I’m amused at what’s happening to this country. Most of the rest of the world wants to develop trade relationships [with Europe], and we want to be out of it. We are a small country. The Japanese didn’t come here because we are the bee’s knees. They came here because we are a gateway to Europe.” Will Tata continue to invest in Britain post-Brexit? “Yes, but they are not going to do it if the business case is not there,” he warns. As a young graduate, Bhattacharyya arrived in the UK from India in 1961 to start a one-year apprenticeship at Lucas Industries, the now-defunct West Midlands motor and aerospace manufacturer, and later completed a PhD in engineering production. He set up WMG in 1980 – at Thatcher’s request – with the aim of bridging the gap between academia and industry. He has since transformed it from one man in the university’s engineering department into a business with 625 employees and an annual turnover of £200m. WMG has more than 3,000 people in education programmes and more than 250 doctoral students. It has carved out a lucrative niche providing research and development for industrial giants such as JLR, Bosch, Airbus, Nissan and BAE Systems. Its boffins develop new battery technology, cyber-security systems, lightweight materials for the auto and aerospace sectors, and surgical procedures for the healthcare industry, among other contracts. The £200m National Automotive Innovation Centre, funded largely by the car industry, is the latest jewel in WMG’s crown. The striking glass and metal box will open at Warwick university next year and will house some of the finest minds from academia and industry, focused on advances in intelligent vehicles, electrification and lighter-weight materials. “If I went to the government for funding for it, I would spend my time in committees chasing money,” he says. “Private companies just want output.” Bhattacharyya was knighted by Tony Blair’s government in 2003 and elevated to the House of Lords in 2004. But he has friends and admirers on both sides of the aisle in Westminster and takes a pragmatic rather than tribal view of politics. “I’m a cross between intervention and independence,” he says. “I won’t support everything relying on government – you can’t have a long-term strategy based on that. It just won’t work if there’s no market pull. “When Thatcher came in, the majority of British industry was nationalised. She came up with quite a simple strategy – how can we improve the productivity of these assets so they can be privatised?” Having been a regular visitor to Japan and Germany, Bhattacharyya was ideally equipped to map out a manufacturing blueprint for the politicians in Britain. “In the 80s, the Japanese were beating the living daylights out of us,” he recalls. “For example, the Japanese government and car companies got together and said, ‘Let’s see if we can do one side of the car in one stamping.’ They did – this was in the early 1970s. At that time, [British car producers] didn’t know what was going on.” Britain’s car industry went through some dark times in the 1980s and 1990s, but has come roaring back since – thanks largely to the success of JLR and investment from overseas giants such as Nissan, Toyota, Honda, BMW (Mini) and General Motors. Bhattacharyya is optimistic that the Midlands can benefit from this resurgence and once again become a powerhouse in automotive manufacturing. Along with the Coventry and Warwickshire Local Enterprise Partnership, WMG is backing proposals to create a £120m National Battery Prototype Centre. If successful, the centre would be close to Coventry airport, and help produce electric batteries to take advantage of the forecast boom in demand for zero-emission vehicles. “It will make a huge difference to the battery industry,” Bhattacharyya adds. “At the moment, it is mainly in the hands of the Koreans. We should make Coventry a smart motor city, like Munich, Stuttgart and Michigan.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2017/sep/29/delving-deeper-into-the-bbcs-idea-of-impartiality","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-29T17:28:01Z","webTitle":"Delving deeper into the BBC’s idea of impartiality | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/sep/29/delving-deeper-into-the-bbcs-idea-of-impartiality","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2017/sep/29/delving-deeper-into-the-bbcs-idea-of-impartiality","fields":{"headline":"Delving deeper into the BBC’s idea of impartiality","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Nick Robinson’s article asserting that Nigel Lawson should be corrected but not silenced by the BBC on climate change (Silencing the disagreeable won’t work. Put them on air, 28 September) suggests that he and his colleagues are still ignoring the potential harm caused by the broadcast of misinformation to their audiences. Lord Lawson has a track record of misleading the public about climate change. His lobby group, the Global Warming Policy Foundation, was found in 2014 to have breached Charity Commission rules by promoting climate change denial. In the same year, the BBC upheld a complaint after Lord Lawson made inaccurate and misleading claims about climate change on the Today programme on Radio 4. The BBC is now considering a complaint from me and others about further false claims by Lord Lawson on Today in August. In particular, the BBC needs to recognise that his erroneous assertion that extreme weather events are not increasing in frequency or intensity endangered listeners by creating the false impression that they need not respond to the rising risks of heatwaves and flooding from heavy rainfall in the UK. The BBC should properly weigh up the rights of marginal voices like Lord Lawson to mislead its audiences about the risks they face against the rights of its audiences to receive accurate information about those risks. Bob Ward Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, LSE • Nick Robinson writes a strong defence of the probing and investigative nature of a balanced media. He extols the virtues of the BBC, which indeed offers a reasonable cross-examination of ideas. But does political coverage really offer diversity? A quick search through the profiles of the BBC’s political team and their predecessors shows a long list of privately educated, white and male journalists. It is good to see gender diversity in the current political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, but it is not surprising to see that, like Nick Robinson whom she succeeded, she is also the beneficiary of an expensive private education. A journalist’s life experiences offer foundations for their querying minds. A balanced media should be representative of all parts of our society. A case for positive discrimination for future BBC appointees in terms of educational background, gender and race is strong. Richard Bulmer Sheffield • Nick Robinson lists a number of alternative media sites – the Canary, Wings Over Scotland etc – as opposed to mainstream media such as the BBC. I wonder where he would place the Daily Mail (“Enemies of the People”) or even more so the Daily Express (“Did EU regulation mean deadly cladding was used on Grenfell Tower?”)? They are clearly historically part of mainstream media but much of their reporting seems as “alternative” as anything the New European publishes. I think Nick makes a false distinction: the real problem is that across the board, mainstream and alternative, we have almost completely lost the idea of journalism as the first draft of history. Ian Chisholm Ditchling, Sussex • Re Nick Robinson’s defence of media impartiality, I recall, when he was BBC political editor, a TV interview he had with David Cameron shortly after Cameron became PM. Cameron rolled out the Tory mantra that Gordon Brown’s Labour government had caused the global financial crisis. The camera panned to Robinson who merely nodded at this claim and made no attempt to question or dispute it. This falsity was repeated more recently by Andrew Marr in respect of his stated view that a Labour government couldn’t be trusted to manage the national economy. The context was an interview with Jeremy Corbyn on Marr’s Sunday morning show. Corbyn corrected Marr, pointing out that the global financial crisis was the direct consequence of irresponsible speculation of the US mortgage market by several US financial bodies, which collapsed as a result, and not the Labour government of the time. Marr, visibly irritated at being corrected in this way, responded with: “It doesn’t matter who caused the global financial crisis.” A remarkable response from someone claiming to be both a journalist and a historian. Dr Robert Smith High Littleton, Somerset • If there has been scepticism about BBC reporting here in Scotland, it’s as much to do with Nick Robinson’s infamous questioning of Alex Salmond in the run-up to the independence referendum as anything else. (Type “Alex Salmond Nick Robinson” in YouTube for evidence). If Robinson were ever to apologise for his own fake news we might take his views on the lack of trust in mainstream media more seriously. John Warburton Edinburgh • Silencing the “disagreeable” alternative media sites identified by Nick Robinson is a strange example of the BBC’s description of its impartiality and neutrality. Mr Robinson names seven social media “attackers” of mainstream media consisting of one anti-right, four leftwing, one pro-remain, and one far-right source. All, admittedly, anti-establishment, resulting in a full-time score of a 5-1 win to the left and one draw (52-48). Balanced reporting seems to have a problem defining “disagreeable” with such a resounding win to the left. David John Jones Swansea • Nick Robinson makes a stout defence of BBC News’s independence. The fact that he needs to do so speaks volumes, especially at a time when activists on the right and left think it’s acceptable to threaten reporters like Laura Kuenssberg, implicitly or otherwise. Although I’m often infuriated by it, I don’t think the BBC is biased. The problem seems to me to be a structural one. The BBC’s importance in explaining complex subjects is constrained by the time allocated to the main news at 6pm and 10pm. Difficult subjects get snippets without time to provide context. Political and business reporters show little understanding of economics so are unable to explain that, for example, the monthly figures they have just enthused over have a wider context that is less positive. Reporters seem reluctant to challenge politicians who are lying to us, and calling out their utterances for what they are. The population generally doesn’t stay up for Newsnight or tune in to Today. Where are we to get a proper explanation of serious subjects on the BBC? Thank goodness for Channel 4 but its audience reach isn’t great. As Robinson notes, alternative media sites are providing affirmative material for supporters of their individual causes. The responsibility on BBC News to inform and explain could not be more urgent. It has some serious thinking to do.

On early form in Malaysia, he was absolutely right to do so. The season has ebbed and flowed between the British driver and his rival Sebastian Vettel, and in Sepang on Friday it was Hamilton who struggled with a car suffering from a “fundamental” problem. Mercedes have little time to turn it round before a difficult day in practice becomes a potentially disastrous weekend. Banishing thoughts of past failures is second nature to those at the top of their sport but Hamilton will have to work hard to ensure he does not allow any sense of foreboding through his natural defence mechanism. Last year an engine failure while leading this race was a crushing blow to his championship ambitions and Nico Rosberg took the title. This year he came to Sepang on top, with a strong points lead at a circuit that should suit his Mercedes strongly over Vettel’s Ferrari. The long straights and high-speed corners echo Silverstone and Monza, where his car was dominant. When he took it out, however, Hamilton discovered not the car of the British Grand Prix but rather that of Russia and Monaco – where the setup, balance and grip had eluded him. The first practice session was run in the wet but come dry conditions in the afternoon Mercedes were presented with a mystery. Vettel was quickest, with a new lap record, and followed by his Ferrari team-mate Kimi Raikkonen. Hamilton could manage only a distant sixth, a full second and a half back and was clearly struggling for grip – losing the rear and heading across the gravel though turn seven. The timing sheets had, understandably, set alarm bells ringing. “It’s been a very difficult day,” said Hamilton. “I’ve been struggling with the car, so we have to review and try to understand where we have gone wrong with the balance. We’re hoping that we’re able to find our bearings overnight and regroup for tomorrow.” The team have previously described their car as something of a “diva”. It had proved difficult to master the reasons why it was working so well at certain tracks and so poorly at others. After Monaco they were confident they had largely solved the conundrum but Sepang has proved once again there is work to be done. The issue does not appear to be straightforward and is being taken wholly seriously by the team. “The car seems to be unbalanced and that triggers an awful lot of consequences, it was certainly one of the worst Fridays I can remember,” said the Mercedes executive director, Toto Wolff. “There is a gremlin in the car. You can compare Malaysia a little bit to Silverstone, where we have been very good. We’ve been very good in the high-speed [corners], we are not at all good in the high-speed here. There is a fundamental issue in the car that we need to find out.” The team had brought new parts to Malaysia and must examine whether they have contributed to the problem, which could not simply be narrowed to a specific set of tyres, temperature or fuel load. They were off the pace in the wet and dry and on both short and long runs, as Wolff admitted. “The lap time is reality, the stopwatch always tells the truth,” he said. “The lap time today showed that we are not quick enough.” A stable car that they can push is the goal, something Vettel already has beneath him. He had led the championship at every round until Monza but the first corner crash in Singapore, eliminating him from the race, proved hugely costly. Closing the gap to Hamilton is paramount. He knows it and has psychologically reset since the last race. “The way Singapore happened you can look at it again and again; it doesn’t matter,” he said. His demeanour mirrored that of Hamilton after this race last year – a sense of acceptance of the position and a determination to do everything within his power to continue the fight. “We have to go here, and that’s the good thing about racing, the part that I enjoy,” he said. “That’s what you fight for, you fight for every centimetre, every tenth that you can find somewhere, over a lot of laps in the race or over one lap in qualifying, to make the difference. I’m sure that, as a team, we can make that difference.” Thus far Ferrari have done just that – their revised bargeboard and floor package was working well. Their pace was impressive regardless of everybody else’s performance. Should Mercedes be unable to find what is making the difference in their garage by qualifying on Saturday morning, Vettel could be in the best possible position to ensure Hamilton endures another disappointing weekend in Malaysia."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"stage/2017/oct/03/wayne-mcgregor-autobiography-dna-dance-sadlers-wells","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-03T09:25:40Z","webTitle":"'The body is a living archive': Wayne McGregor on turning his DNA into dance","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/oct/03/wayne-mcgregor-autobiography-dna-dance-sadlers-wells","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2017/oct/03/wayne-mcgregor-autobiography-dna-dance-sadlers-wells","fields":{"headline":"'The body is a living archive': Wayne McGregor on turning his DNA into dance","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"In a shiny Airstream trailer, on the roof of his company’s new headquarters, Wayne McGregor looks across the Olympic Park in Stratford, east London. This is not your usual dance HQ. But McGregor isn’t what you’d expect from a choreographer. The resident brainbox of British dance is always questing for new territory. His work with ballet companies often attracts headlines – it’s a world new to extreme moves, music by Mark Ronson and the White Stripes, big ideas about the multiverse – but his own company is a research lab for innovation. Now, the science geek is using his own DNA, and collaborating with scientists at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, as the inspiration for a show called Autobiography. “If you’re looking for a document of my life with a narrative arc about me growing up in Stockport, you’ll be frustrated,” he grins. Instead, it’s Who Do You Think You Are? but with genes. The show began taking shape when McGregor wondered how artificial intelligence (AI) might animate his archive of 25 years’ working in dance. This led him to consider the body itself as “a living archive. Not as a nostalgia-fest but as an idea of speculative future. Each cell carries in it the whole blueprint of your life, basically.” Your genetic code tells the story of your past – and predicts possible stories of your future. Eager to learn more, McGregor tried the online DNA test 23andMe. “But that wasn’t enough – I wanted a full sequence [of his own genome].” Through researchers in Utrecht, he is accessing “three billion bits of information. As a storage system it’s absolutely enormous – 60 volumes of the Encyclopaedia Britannica. Thinking of genetics as a data-storing system, how might we be able to store dance in our genetic makeup? I’m interested to see how we can take that information and convert it into other forms.” How does data become dance? Autobiography pays tribute to the American master Merce Cunningham, a pioneer of using software to generate new choreographic material. In a programme note, Autobiography’s dramaturg, Uzma Hameed, explains: “In this piece, book-ended by a fixed beginning and end, a number of choreographic events from the 23 volumes in the ‘life library’ are selected and sequenced afresh for every performance by an algorithm based on McGregor’s genetic code. For each iteration of the piece, the computer randomly selects a different section of code from the choreographer’s genome to determine which material the audience will see, performed by which dancers and in what order. The system dictates that no individual sequence of code can be used more than once, so that no two performances can ever be alike.” It is, says McGregor, “a piece that changes every night. We can get 24,000 permutations – we don’t have that many shows! It’s a struggle for the dancers, not knowing what they’re doing [very far] in advance, but then making meaning from it. It’s a little experiment that I think speaks directly to the idea of life-writing. Life unfolds, without our having control, and we have to deal with those instances. I think that can be a really beautiful thing.” On your first encounter with a new piece by McGregor, you’ll often process the big ideas and cutting-edge tech. Only later do you twig an undertow of hope and hurt. So how personal is Autobiography? “A lot of the material we worked on was very personal stuff that I’ve not shared with people. Family things, photographs, poetry I’ve written.” But he skews away from self-revelation: “I’ve always felt that autobiographies are fictions,” he says. We’ve just whizzed around the company’s new home, the tall, lean McGregor beaming with undisguised glee, like the Willy Wonka of contemporary dance architecture. Most dance organisations squat in boxy offices and anonymous dance studios, but this high-walled space, couched in the former Olympic media centre, allowed a rethink. “All of the rules around dance studios,” McGregor says, “we need to change them a bit. We put ideas first, and then tried to keep hold of the vision, matching the amount of money we had available. It doesn’t have to be expensive, but it should be beautiful.” So there are original artworks by Josef Albers (a longtime favourite), a translucent lift that changes colour as it moves (“I spend a lot of time in the lift”), a globe of pitch-black obsidian (“It’s 70 million years old!”). There’s a periscope view of the London skyline and that beloved Airstream. “It’s about how you make rooms playful, using your perceptive facility in different ways,” the choreographer says. “It’s a space for artists to make dance in,” he asserts. McGregor’s is not the only work being made here. In a city of prohibitively expensive rehearsal spaces, the new building is a godsend – but exacts an intriguing quid pro quo. “I felt from the very beginning that it would be a failure if this building was rented out all the time to commercial partners,” he tells me. “Obviously, we have to make the maths work. But every year we invite 25 artists and their teams, and they have five weeks of rehearsal space totally free.” These include established names like Shobana Jeyasingh and Candoco, as well as rising stars. “For every week we give them, they give me back a day,” he continues. “We work with them on curating an education programme across the country. So we get real artists working in the spaces, and we get amazing artists out across the country doing 25 weeks of really interesting education work.” The new home also coincides with landmark anniversaries in McGregor’s career. His company is 25 years old – it’s no small achievement for an independent dance company to survive and thrive for so long. In 2016, he celebrated 10 years as resident choreographer at the Royal Ballet, which mounted a retrospective of his work – from 2006’s Chroma, still a banger of a ballet, to the audaciously involving Woolf Works. McGregor groans. “You’re looking back at decisions you made then with your eyes now – never pleasant!” But the experience did reinforce one key principle – that “artists are in the business of failing. You want to be working out what your next questions are – what’s important is this process of unfolding, making a series of decisions. What might you take on or counter in the next thing you’re making?” Other than Lucy Carter, his steadfast genius of a lighting designer, each McGregor piece typically involves a raft of new collaborators. “It is a conscious decision, he admits. “You want perturbers, people to upset your way of working. It has to take you somewhere new or there’s no point.” For Autobiography, colleagues include the electronic musician Jlin (“she writes super-personal, very rhythmic music which expresses something of the energy of me”), the artist Ben Cullen Williams and the artist and designer Aitor Throup. “I always start as a fan of these people, then reach out to them.” On paper, McGregor can seem detached, an ideas man only. His programme notes are famously impenetrable. But in person, he’s all fanboy enthusiasm, a long streak of fizz. This extends to his freelance gigs in fashion, art and big-budget movies. He’s due to work on Josie Rourke’s debut film, Mary Queen of Scots, and recently wrapped Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them 2. “I just love it,” he exults. “Part of the fun is trying to give people what they’ve imagined, not doing your own weird interpretation. And you get the opportunity to work with this tech which you can repurpose for your own stuff.” I first saw McGregor as a solo artist, boggling as his extended frame offered freakoid moves from another planet. Twenty-five years on, he’s still finding new territory. “I’ve still got a massive drive for projects and having access to really interesting science,” he admits. “Genetics and AI – it’s a massive field that’s going to explode over the next five years.” And in his Willy Wonka dance factory, McGregor’s ready for blast-off.

He was responding to a report in the Air Force Times that five black cadet candidates at the preparatory academy had had the words “go home nigger” written on the whiteboards outside their dorm rooms. “If you’re outraged by those words then you’re in the right place. That kind of behavior has no place in the United States air force,” Silveria said. “You should be outraged not only as an airman but as a human being.” The preparatory school, which is on the air force academy campus in Colorado Springs, enlists about 240 students – typically in their late teens – each year to train and study to attempt to be accepted as freshman cadets the following year. “These young people are supposed to bond and protect each other and the country. Who would my son have to watch out for? The enemy or the enemy?” questioned one of the cadet candidate’s mothers who posted about the incident on Facebook. That post was later taken down. Silveria said that some of the recent high-profile racist incidents in the US had influenced his decision to speak out. “We would be naive to think that we shouldn’t discuss this topic. We would also be tone deaf not to think about the backdrop of what’s going on in our country. Things like Charlottesville and Ferguson, the protests in the NFL,” he said. Officials said the academy’s security forces were investigating the incident, but that no additional information was released."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2017/oct/06/islander-by-patrick-barkham-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-06T06:30:45Z","webTitle":"Islander by Patrick Barkham review – small islands can teach us how to live","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/oct/06/islander-by-patrick-barkham-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/oct/06/islander-by-patrick-barkham-review","fields":{"headline":"Islander by Patrick Barkham review – small islands can teach us how to live","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Give or take a debatable rock or two, Britain is an archipelago of around 6,300 islands of which 132 are inhabited all the year round by humans. As Patrick Barkham writes, “We are all islanders, but some are more islander than others” – which means, I think, that those of us on the smaller islands are continually reminded of our insularity by the unforgiving fact that we need to catch a ferry or a plane before we can reach a supermarket or a hospital; while for others of us, the big islanders, an awareness of our island-ness is now mainly sentimental or political, surprising us when we catch a glimpse of white cliffs or see a film about Dunkirk. But inside many a big islander, a small islander is struggling to get out. While a good number of Britain’s small islands have been steadily losing their populations since the 19th century, a tiny number of people have been going the other way. “Island life” to the St Kildans implied a perpetual diet of seabird flesh and oats, and all the other hardships that made them keen to ship out; but to the mainland romantic it was a phrase of promise. “Life on a small island restores human dignity; the individual is not overwhelmed by his own unimportance,” wrote the importance-seeking novelist Compton Mackenzie, speaking from his experience of owning three small islands and living on another four. Barra in the Outer Hebrides became the most famous as well as the last of these island homes – it inspired the novel Whisky Galore, by which he is best remembered – but before then, there had been Capri in the Mediterranean, Syra in the Aegean, Herm and Jethou among the Channel Islands, and an anonymous island, too small to have a name, in the river Beauly to the north of Inverness. He wasn’t alone as an island lover – a “nesomane”, in John Fowles’s fancy coinage. JM Barrie, Arthur Ransome and Robert Louis Stevenson before them had all had what Barkham describes as “dalliances” with the Hebrides. Mackenzie, however, was an extreme example of the urge to possess as well as to love, a man to whom islands meant what the writer Adam Nicolson later called “I-lands”: a place that reflected and supported its owner’s personality, a mirror for the self. And as Mackenzie had a theatrical nature – he would march around his Channel Island domain in a kilt and sporran, though his paternal ancestors left Scotland in the 18th century – it may be that islands to him became especially necessary. DH Lawrence, who first met him on Capri, took Mackenzie as the inspiration for his story “The Man Who Loved Islands”, in which a wealthy young idealist acquires a series of progressively smaller and less populated seabound retreats in a vain search for a refuge from society. Eventually he dies mad and alone – the lesson being that people cannot escape themselves or their obligations as social animals. Naturally enough, Mackenzie didn’t care for the story and considered Lawrence to have betrayed their friendship. (Lawrence was used to this reaction. “I like to write when I feel spiteful,” he once wrote. “It is like having a good sneeze.”) In this book, Barkham sets out to test Lawrence’s argument that islands are “dangerously seductive places” that set up tensions between an individual’s need for liberty and his or her need of society, and, more generally, to discover what small islands offer in the present age when “the mainland or mainstream is in crisis” and “people look to the periphery for escape or inspiration”. He wonders whether the values associated with small islands – “robust self-sufficiency … or an integrated, neighbourly community” – are passé or more pertinent than ever. In short, might small islands provide a recipe for the “salvation for our epoch?” The structure that accommodates these large and hopeful questions takes the same form as Lawrence’s story and frequently intersects with Mackenzie’s island hopping. Barkham moves from the small to the smaller to the tiny: a journey to 11 islands in all, starting with the Isle of Man (57,239 hectares, population 85,000) and ending with the islet of Ray on the Essex coast (45 hectares, population 0), with Orkney, Barra, Eigg, Rathlin, Alderney, the Isles of Scilly, St Kilda, Bardsey and Osea falling in between. Other than in the case of Ray, where the author spent a night in a tent, the length of these visits isn’t clear; perhaps not long. But Barkham busies himself with meetings and interviews wherever he goes, to muster a series of lively, present-tense episodes in which he never pretends to be anything other than a question-asking outsider. Sometimes it seems to have been written for TV, with sentences such as: “To learn more about the how and the why, I drive to Kirkwall airport to catch up with … ” At other times it might be a letter to his mum: he meets “a lovely couple” and “a lovely bloke” and in the Hebrides worries that he appears to others as an “uptight Englishman”, meaning a sober one. Some of his images are memorable. “For visitors, small islands are like steam trains: a retro treat where everyone waves,” he writes of his time on Eigg. The Isles of Scilly on the TV weather map are “permanently obscured by forecasters’ bottoms”. On a bouncy voyage to them, he notices a fellow sufferer at the ship’s rail “addressing the waves with bile”. Overall, in a genre not noted for its generosity, he makes kind judgments about the people he meets and the books he reads – perhaps a little too kind, given that islands can bring out the most fanciful tendencies in a writer. “It is the boundedness of the smaller island, encompassable in a glance, walkable in one day, that relates it to the human body closer than any other geographical conformation of land,” John Fowles wrote, in a sentence of several debatable phrases. As an accomplished writer of natural history, Barkham is at his best in this book on flora and fauna, and in particular the contribution that islands have made to species development – how animals become different from their relations on the mainland, but different in similar ways. Small rodents tend to grow bigger (the Orkney vole is half as big again as the European common vole) while large mammals grow smaller. One theory posits that all mammal species are seeking a body weight of 1kg, which is thought to be the most efficient size if mammals are freed from pressures such as predation or competition. He tells us less about the impact of islands on humanity, and many interesting facts emerge. Before they were taken off their island in 1930, the residents of St Kilda were never pressed into military service and never lost anyone in battle. Residents of Scilly, having the Prince of Wales as their landlord, are forbidden plastic-framed windows. Osea, on the Blackwater estuary in Essex, was owned in the mid‑20th century by the sadistic Major Alfred “Old Bill” Allnatt, who founded the Society for the Promotion of Old English Pastimes and (perhaps believing it to be one of them) made his staff run a relay race through the island’s gorse and nettles wearing only their underwear while he pursued them “brandishing an electric pig prodder”. Is it possible to draw general lessons from such disparate places? On the one hand, the Isle of Man makes its money as a tax haven; on the other, the Northern Ireland island of Rathlin has 130 residents and hopes to earn its keep from environmental tourism. It would certainly be difficult from those two examples to imagine what such a lesson could be. Barkham takes hope from Eigg in the Inner Hebrides, which holds a special place in the hearts of nesomanes and the annals of the Scottish land reform movement as an example of successful island activism. Since a community trust bought it from the last of a series of wayward private landlords in 1997, Eigg’s population has grown from a few dozen to about 100, many of them working in what Barkham calls the creative industries as lace makers, felt artists, freelance writers and so on. Rents are cheap and the internet accessible. The island now generates its own electricity. “This triumph of David over Goliath,” Barkham reports, “has created an apparently marvellous sustainable community that seems at once industrially creative and lackadaisical, with its colourful houses, gardens filled with strawberry patches and hammocks made from old fishing nets.” According to one of Eigg’s most fervent supporters, such a scene demonstrates that “communities rooted in a local culture” may be able to “transcend the spiritual paucity of global capitalism and its veneration of consumption”. Perhaps they can. In the meantime, when the people of a small island hear a helicopter rumbling overhead, coming to take another heart attack victim to a modern hospital, they can thank God that this corrupted mainland exists. • Islander is published by Granta.

The Daily Mail reported on Thursday that a third big-screen chapter to the popular TV series had been cancelled by Warner Bros only weeks before production was due to begin, with the studio baulking at Cattrall’s demand that she would only reprise her role as Samantha Jones if it produced a number of other films she had in development. Cattrall though has denied the claims on Twitter. “Woke 2 a @MailOnline shitstorm. The only ‘DEMAND’ I ever made was that I didn’t want to do a 3rd film....&amp; that was back in 2016,” she wrote. Cattrall’s denial followed Sarah Jessica Parker’s confirmation of the film’s cancellation. “We had this beautiful, funny, heartbreaking, joyful, very relatable script and story,” she told Extra. “It’s not just disappointing that we don’t get to tell the story and have that experience, but more so for the audience that has been so vocal in wanting another movie.” Originally an HBO comedy about four Manhattan socialites, Sex and the City enjoyed a successful run on TV between 1998 and 2004. Two big-screen adaptations followed in 2008 and 2010. While neither film was well received by critics, both performed impressively at the box office, prompting calls for another instalment. In 2016, Parker said that another outing remained a possibility, either as a new series or a film, but Cattrall expressed doubts. “Everyone is doing their own thing and if it was going to happen, it would have happened by now. It would be a challenge to do a third instalment,” she told the Daily Record."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/sep/26/m-hayes-ampetyane-a-force-of-nature-for-her-people","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-25T18:00:20Z","webTitle":"The native title campaigner whose people still have no power, water or sewerage","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/sep/26/m-hayes-ampetyane-a-force-of-nature-for-her-people","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/sep/26/m-hayes-ampetyane-a-force-of-nature-for-her-people","fields":{"headline":"The native title campaigner whose people still have no power, water or sewerage","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"At a federal court hearing in Alice Springs in 1997, during the first month of a two-year trial around native title rights, an Arrernte woman named M Hayes Ampetyane spoke about wanting to build a home on her ancestral land at Irrkerlantye, a community just outside the town boundary. Ampetyane, the lead applicant in the Alice Springs native title claim, said the land at Irrkerlantye, also known as Whitegate, was her grandfather’s country, Antulye country. As a senior Antulye woman, she told the court, she had both a right and an obligation to be on that country. “Nobody can stop us from going round there,” she said. Asked if that right extended to living at Irrkerlantye, Ampetyane said: “Yes, if we get a piece of land around there … yes, we want to live there.” Living at Irrkerlantye, in a proper house with electricity and flush toilets, was a key motive for Ampetyane’s participation in the native title claim, which was granted in 1999. Her longtime friend Jane Vadiveloo, the chief executive of Children’s Ground, which works with Arrernte families to support the health and education of Indigenous children, said it was the “constant theme and message” of Ampetyane’s life. Ampetyane died this month and is referred to by her tribal name for cultural reasons. She had lived for the past eight years in a nursing home, after being diagnosed with dementia. She never got a house at Irrkerlantye. Her niece, Felicity Hayes, still lives in the community in a tin shed with water trucked in once a month by Tangentyere council. “There’s no good roads, there’s no lights, no electricity, no real toilet. It’s just like in the old days,” Hayes tells Guardian Australia. “In winter it’s really cold, in summer it’s really hot. It’s unliveable.” There was once a water pipe but the connection was cut without notice by a contractor for the Northern Territory government in 2014. It has not been reconnected. Despite Irrkerlantye’s importance to Arrernte people and its history as a campsite, it is not formally sanctioned as a community and has been deemed ineligible for basic services. “It’s really hard living out there,” says Anna-Maria Palmer, Felicity’s daughter. “If they had power and sewerage everyone would go out there. She had a lot of grandkids, my nana who passed, and great-grandkids ... It is devastating that nothing has changed. It’s sad to see things like that. There’s nobody willing to help.” Ampetyane and her brother were born on Undoolya station but returned to Alice Springs in the late 1960s after it ceased to be a prohibited area for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. By the 1990s she was a fixture at Irrkerlantye and was regularly visited by politicians who would seek her out as a senior traditional owner. “She was a well-spoken woman, she stood up for herself,” Hayes said. “It was the 1990s that we went and talked to the government during the native title claim. She went and had a lot of meetings with people and we had a lot of ministers and all the politicians come through. The United Nations as well came out to Whitegate to talk to us.” A longtime friend, Rod Moss, who lived in a house just 500 metres away from Irrkerlantye, said Ampetyane was “physically and psychologically a force”. “She was always referred to as the queen of Whitegate,” he said. “She was the final word and what she said went.” In 1994, a year after the Native Title Act came into force, Ampetyane was the lead claimant in a group of 14 traditional owners claiming native title on behalf of all Arrernte people over 166 separate parcels of crown land in and around Alice Springs. The area is known in Arrernte as Mparntwe. Between 1928 and 1965 it was a prohibited area for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, who were forced by the town’s white inhabitants to live on the fringes. The native title claim was contested by the territory government on the grounds that although Arrernte ownership once existed it had been extinguished by white settlement. The two-year hearing, from 1997 to 1999, was conducted against the background of the Howard government’s hostilities over the high court’s Wik decision, and had to be revised to account for the subsequent tightening of legislation in 1998. During the hearing a phalanx of robed court officials inspected dreaming sites in the town centre under the direction of cultural elders. “[One elder] took the judge to a tree in a concreted mall in Alice Springs,” Bryan Keon-Cohen, lead counsel for the Arrernte claimants, told Guardian Australia. “They gave evidence that that was puppy dog dreaming. It was a dingo dreaming that came in from somewhere out west, and there were the puppy dogs, three rocks, sitting against the concrete. It had survived, despite that whole area being covered in concrete … It really did reject the proposition that Arrernte culture all died out because whitefellas came and destroyed it.” The determination granted non-exclusive native title rights to 113 of the 166 claimed areas, including Irrkerlantye. It was the first time native title had been granted over an urban area and was followed by even more meetings and promises by politicians to look at granting a lease over Irrkerlantye. “It was just regular for politicians who came on either side of politics to go to Whitegate and to just sit down with her, sit down at Whitegate, talk to her about what the situation was, see the conditions that she was in,” Vadiveloo said. “They’d shake their head, say ‘This is terrible,’ and go on their merry way, never look back. It was an absolute circus.” Despite the attention, Irrkerlantye remained unchanged. With the exception of a small collection of solar panels intended to power the washing machine, it has looked the same since the 1970s. Residents slowly shifted to neighbouring town camps which had been recognised under formal lease agreements. Those camps are overcrowded, poorly maintained, and have extensive social problems, but at least they have houses, water and power. When the water was cut in 2014, Irrkerlantye’s population winnowed down to 10 people. When Moss first visited Irrkerlantye in the early 1980s, it had about 40 residents. “People were living in car bodies, in tin sheds,” he said. “If you drove through there today you would not think there were people living there. You would just think it was a place that had been abandoned or it was for animals. You would not dream of people living there.” Moss visits the community daily to see the remaining residents and feed the numerous dogs and single goat who also share the space. He has acted as an intermediary between Felicity Hayes and the territory government in the most recent attempt to secure some form of secure tenure over the land. Progress has been “glacial”. “Felicity is holding on out there,” Moss said. “All of her children would be back there tomorrow if there were facilities for the kids to be washed, fed and ready to attend school.” Hayes wrote to the chief minister, Michael Gunner, on 20 September 2016 about Irrkerlantye. On Friday, a government spokeswoman said the NT government was “considering the options”. “The Hayes family have been in correspondence with the government, however discussions have been interrupted and are due to recommence shortly,” she said. Ampetyane will be laid to rest next month. Her family will keep fighting to build her house at Irrkerlantye. “I think she needs to be recognised after all the hard work she done and what the government put her through,” Hayes says. “The NT government I think needs to recognise that Aboriginal people are the owners of the land. “There’s a lot of old people that grew up on country. I think they should all be recognised as the true Australians and want their rights.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/23/frida-the-mexican-rescue-dog-who-has-saved-more-than-52-lives","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-23T02:56:55Z","webTitle":"Frida: the Mexican rescue dog who has saved more than 52 lives","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/23/frida-the-mexican-rescue-dog-who-has-saved-more-than-52-lives","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/23/frida-the-mexican-rescue-dog-who-has-saved-more-than-52-lives","fields":{"headline":"Frida: the Mexican rescue dog who has saved more than 52 lives","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A labrador retriever has made global headlines following her rescue efforts in Mexico’s recent earthquakes. The local heroine, who goes by the name of Frida, is employed by the Mexican navy (SEMAR) to conduct search and rescue missions in the event of a natural disaster. Frida’s efforts first came to light two weeks ago when an earthquake struck the Mexican state of Oaxaca. Wearing protective goggles, a khaki harness and two pairs of booties, the seven-year-old dog managed to detect the body of a Juchitan police officer and several others under the rubble. After a magnitude 7.1 earthquake hit Mexico City on Tuesday leaving at least 250 people dead, the rescue dog and her canine colleagues were deployed to find survivors buried under the rubble. Frida’s efforts have been praised across social media, with some suggesting she replace the famous Mexican painter Diego Rivera on the 500-peso note. The office of president Enrique Peña Nieto formally recognised the labrador’s determination and bravery on Twitter on Friday morning. “This is Frida. She belongs to SEMAR and has helped save 52 lives in various natural disasters at national and international levels.” According to an article published by El Heraldo de Mexico, Frida also runs training courses for other newly recruited dogs between the ages of one and five."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/live/2017/sep/24/india-v-australia-third-one-day-international-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-24T16:06:12Z","webTitle":"India v Australia: third one-day international – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2017/sep/24/india-v-australia-third-one-day-international-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2017/sep/24/india-v-australia-third-one-day-international-live","fields":{"headline":"India v Australia: third one-day international – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"India win the series. Australia no good. So, that’s nine on the trot for the home side, their longest ODI winning streak, wrapping up this series with two rubbers still to play. Australia, meanwhile, have lost ten of their last 11 away from home. Ugly, no matter how you cut it. Very close to a big finish when the visitors got slowly back into the game after a punishing start via Rohit and Rahane. It boiled down to one moment, Smith dropping Pandya on 41 before Pandey had scored. Tough chance in the artificial light, but should have completed it. Once reprieved, the new Indian number four smashed his way to 78, only throwing it away when the finish line was within touching distance. The base laid by the openers meant Australia were always playing catch up and never had enough runs unless they took all ten wickets. At different periods all five bowlers did commendably, but the pressure wasn’t sustained for long enough. But it all comes back to runs. Not enough of them after Finch made a run-a-ball 124. Smith said as much in the post-game. As for India, they are now officially the top ranked side in the world. Fair play. Plenty of questions for Australia to answer in the final two ODIs. We’ll be back with you for them both, the next on Thursday from Bangalore. Bye for now. There it is! Pandey down the ground with one last lavish stroke, then the winning run digging a Richardson yorker down to fine leg. That’ll do, 13 balls to spare. Clinical, all told. Some final thoughts in a tic. 47th over: India 287-5 (Pandey 30, Dhoni 2) Well, Maxwell is on. Sure, why not. Two singles. Dhoni, for the most part, just happy to knock it on the head. Come on fellas, finish this off now. 46th over: India 285-5 (Pandey 29, Dhoni 1) Can’t get over this response to Dhoni. As Harsha says, cheerily, every person is on their feet. Off the mark to mid-on. Nine needed, four overs. Nine on the trot for India when they finish this off. Pandyamonium comes to an end! Tries to clear a fifth sixth over long-on, but doesn’t quite make the contact this time. But what a hand it has been. Brought up to number four and has, quite simply, won the match for his country. Crowd don’t mind though, thrilled that Pandya is gone as it means they can watch Dhoni bat for a few minutes. What a massive response! 45th over: India 283-4 (Pandya 78, Pandey 29) Boom, boom, boom, boom! I want you in my room! (Sorry, had to). Let’s go through it. Stonis the man getting punished. Pandey, slap through midwicket. Four. Pandey, pulled through midwicket. Four. Pandya, ramp over the ‘keeper. Four. Pandya, pull shot that would have travelled two or three times the length of the boundary. Four. A couple singles along the way. 18 off the over. Carnage. Nothing Australia can do. 44th over: India 265-4 (Pandya 69, Pandey 20) Twitter is still losing its mind over Pandya being elevated to four. Weird. Anyway, what a player. Demonstrated by the most immaculate on-drive off Cummins to begin the fresh over. Hardest shot in the game, and all that. A lot more than a bloke who smacks them over cow corner. Eight from it. Nearly done now, 29 to get in six overs for the series win. 43rd over: India 257-4 (Pandya 63, Pandey 18) It is Stoinis. Probably not the guy they want bowling over 43, but Smith had to push hard with his frontliners between overs 30 and 40. Pandey cuts/slaps the penultimate delivery to the cover boundary. Ensures seven come from the over. 50 partnership up in 47 balls. 42nd over: India 250-4 (Pandya 62, Pandey 12) Cummins it is. Clarke still predicting a hat-trick. A bit loose, but whatever works. He does go within a couple of inches of getting Pandya! Another inside edge that lands safely without crashing into the stumps. A lot of those tonight. Instead, four runs. He’s able to access third man twice to finish the over, which is worth seven. 250 up in the process. 41st over: India 243-4 (Pandya 55, Pandey 12) Agar pushes a couple through before throwing them up. Best available plan at this stage, mixing it up to try and force something. He can’t, other than one inside edge. Three singles added. 1-for-71 the final figures of the spinner. He was better than that though. “I can feel a hat-trick coming on!” says Clarke. He was having such a good night on the mic, too. 40th over: India 240-4 (Pandya 53, Pandey 11) NCN’s final over here, in the last of the four-men-out power play. Whatever we’re calling that in 2017. And he’s done it well, mixing up lengths, lines and speeds. But both batsmen play calmly, pushing five runs to sweepers. India need 54 from the final ten, Australia have one over left from Agar, then it’ll be up to Richarson, Stoinis and Cummins. The latter to get first crack, I’d expect. This isn’t going to the 50th over anyway, as Clarke rightly says on TV. 39th over: India 235-4 (Pandya 50, Pandey 10) Massive! Again! Pandya loves taking on Agar, by my count four times he’s taken him over the rope. He’ll be gutted, the spinner, having won the error the last ball of his previous over. Long on has been the destination of each six, this again deep into the crowd. 29 runs have been added in three overs now. Pandya 50 from 45 balls with a single to square leg. Should be matchwinning. 38th over: India 227-4 (Pandya 43, Pandey 9) Ten more runs to go with the 11 from the previous over. That cuts deep after the dropepd catch. Pandey’s turn this time, flicking NCN off the hip then taking him down the ground with ideal timing. This could be over in a hurry from here. 37th over: India 217-4 (Pandya 42, Pandey 0) Pretty good commentary from Clarke. “Will Pandya take on Agar again down the ground?” Next ball: over long-on for six! From the crease when contact is made, just a lovely swing. All muscle. Four more when Agar offers up a half-tracker. Can see what he is trying to do, darting through the gate, but Pandya is too quick and too good. Dropped! Is that the game? Smith! Pandya gets a big edge, sliced away over cover. Smith running back does just about everything right to get into position, but can only get a hand to it in the end. Fantastic from Agar to throw it up. Smith got there in time, but seemed to lose it. Either way, that was, surely the moment. The captain knows it too. 36th over: India 206-4 (Pandya 31, Pandey 0) Pandey joins to man who replaced him up the list. Wonderful from Richardson, just short of a length with a couple of cutters, then full at the stumps. One run and a wicket from the over. He’s bowled superbly in this spell. Two wickets in two overs! It is the new man Jadhav, edging Richardson with an attempted cut. No footwork there. A tiny little nick that has now really got Australia back in the game. But India, of course, have depth. And Dhoni. 35th over: India 205-3 (Pandya 30, Jadhav 2) Jadhav next, so he stays at number five. Sure that discussion will continue to generate plenty of energy. Off the mark with an inside edge! Close call. Fantastic from Agar. Kohli has holed out! Around the wicket, takes on Agar down the ground but fails to make the desired contact, Finch does the rest with a composed take about 15m in from the rope. Where did that come from?! Previous ball was declared dead when a rag came out of Agar’s pocket, the run not able to be taken. Maybe some frustration as a result of that? Well then. They have dried up the runs and got their man. Do they have enough runs to bowl out India in time from here? 34th over: India 202-2 (Kohli 28, Pandya 29) Richardson given another twist. And in keeping with the theme of the last little period, he’s tight. To the extent that a mid up nearly comes from the final ball of the over, Pandya trying to turn one into two but sent back by his skipper. Four from it. Still a fair bit of concert about Agar’s hand. He’s been off then on then off. Now, it seems, about to return to the attack. 33rd over: India 198-2 (Kohli 26, Pandya 27) Stonis’ handy spell continues. Kohli picks up a couple through the gap at cover. A trio of singles round out the over. Five from it. Under 100 the required runs now. When will Kohli decide to suck the life of it as a contest? These chases normally conclude on his terms. 32nd over: India 193-2 (Kohli 22, Pandya 26) I think we can call this a proper little comeback from Australia. Well, maybe not if they don’t find a wicket from it, but two singles here makes 13 from the last four overs. NCN did well to keep Pandya quiet. Kohli retains the strike with another single to third man. To be fair, they only need 5.6 an over to win from here, so they can afford to chill out. They can do that now at their second drinks break. 31st over: India 191-2 (Kohli 21, Pandya 25) Stoinis concedes four singles. So, that’s 11 in the last three. Or more relevance: Kohli nearly knocked over from the last ball. Inside edge that just about spills back onto the stumps. Not that you’d know from TV, Harsha more focussed on Rohit’s hitting from earlier. 30th over: India 187-2 (Kohli 19, Pandya 23) NCN replaces Cummins. Why? Might need a rest. But if not, surely still the go-to while these two threaten to make the mathematics of who bowls when irrelevant over the next half-hour or so if not dismissed? No slight on Coulter-Nile, who does his bit: three from the over. Kohli retains the strike with a glide to third man. Easy peasy, innit? 29th over: India 184-2 (Kohli 17, Pandya 22) Stoinis was taken to last time he had a crack, but makes sense for Smith to keep throwing it around, especially with Pandya enjoying Agar’s offerings so much. Does well too, four singles to the sweepers but nothing further. Big debate going on about Pandya being elevated to no. 4. Working pretty well so far here. 28th over: India 180-2 (Kohli 15, Pandya 20) Cummins in no hurry to take Kohli on, making a tweak or two before charging in. Much as it was with Agar, a repeat of his previous over as well. Does everything right then Kohli takes him down the ground with an off-drive Sachin would be proud of. Outstanding execution with mid-off up. What a player. 27th over: India 172-2 (Kohli 9, Pandya 18) Wow. Pandya has skills to take Australia down in a real hurry here. Second time he’s taken the first ball of an Agar over cow corner. This time he’s standing tall and proud when contact is made. Ten from it, the rest of the set milked to the sweepers. Perfect chasing. 26th over: India 162-2 (Kohli 7, Pandya 10) Cummins to continue. The right call. He’s been the man most likely, got to back him in to try and run through India before these two get set in the slightest. BIG SHOUT for lbw, but turned down and no review. Handscomb cruicial there waving off the referral. That was against Pandya. When Kohli gets his chance he doesn’t miss out, to the last ball of the over flicking with class to the rope. The captain is away. 25th over: India 157-2 (Kohli 3, Pandya 9) Agar launched by Pandya! The young man is away! First ball of the over, crashed into the crowd at midwicket with a fierce swing of the bat. Goodness me he’s got game this fella. Agar recovers, concedeing only singles thereafter. Nine from it, though. 24th over: India 148-2 (Kohli 2, Pandya 1) Gee, how about the roar for Pandya? On that measure, he’s only behind Kohli and Dhoni for God-like status. That hasn’t taken long for the young all-rounder. Keeps the strike with a steer to third man. Cummins is back and he’s done it! Both openers now gone and this game might be on again! It’s darted back at the right-hander, beating the bat and crashing into his front pad. Rahane misses the flick. Quick and straight, that’ll do it. No review. Two new batsmen at the crease with 146 still needed for the home side. Plenty will still need to break Australia’s way, but it isn’t yet game/series over. Not for nothing. 23rd over: India 145-1 (Rahane 68, Kohli 2) Agar being sliced and diced by Murali Kartik on the telly. He’s back into the attack now. Weird criticism, saying that he liked him when he first played Test cricket. Anyway, he’s on now, and through the set for just four singles. Nice return considering he was off the field until not long ago with a dislocated finger. Australia have a window here to get back into the game. Won’t be open for long. 22nd over: India 141-1 (Rahane 66, Kohli 0) Kohli yet to face as they crossed, Rahane adding to his boundary from before the wicket with a couple behind square. Huge roar for the captain, as always. They were showing highlights from India’s 2007 World T20 triumph earlier on the telly, it being ten years since that sliding doors (sorry) moment in our game. From it came the IPL and, well, everything that we consider normal about our game in 2017. Harsha got very excited when the shots of Dhoni taking his shirt off popped up. There it is! The sub fielder Cartwright keeps his cool when under a big top edge at midwicket, completing the catch. Harder than it looks under the lights at this time of night. Rohit just lost his way a bit over the last few overs, so not entiely surprising that he’s fallen. Was an excellent innings, especially during the first power play. 21st over: India 134-0 (Rahane 59, Rohit 71) Richo has fought back really well after Rohit literally popped him out of the stadium early on. A lesser lad would have fallen away badly from there. A couple of singles to sweepers on the posh side, nothing further. “Adam, (Addy-babes? Can I call you Addy-babes?),” asks Andrew Benton. You bloody can, mate. You bloody can. “It’s not over until the weight-conflicted person who choses to identify as a woman releases her next digital offering on Spotify. Australia still have a chance until then!” You’ve had a Sunday session, haven’t you? 20th over: India 132-0 (Rahane 58, Rohit 70) NCN to Rahane. I wonder if NCN is connected to the NBN? Was anyone beyond 2013? Still pretty angry about this. He does ever so well to keep the Indian vice-captain down the business end for the duration of the over. But then, for reasons best explained by him, he tried to bounce him to finish. Didn’t work, this track flat as they come, Rahane smacking it through the onside for four more. 19th over: India 126-0 (Rahane 54, Rohit 69) Richardson’s turn to try and create something from nothing. He doesn’t concede a boundary, so that’s commendable. Rohit tried to put him on the moon, but didn’t make enough contact, bouncing a metre of so from the rope. Outstanding work from Cummins making a nice stop at deep mid wicket. Very little reaction time after the ball bounced. A fine cricketer. Given he created the chance in the previous over, surprised he’s been taken off after just one over in his second spell, come to think of it. Some thoughts on the email from Robert Wilson. A book of his arrived in my post on Friday, and I plan to read it in the pub tonight. “Given the sporting world’s current confident assertion of its right to political comment as every NFL star past and present forms an orderly but enthusiastic queue to call President Trump an asshole, isn’t it time prominent cricketers dipped their pens in that shady ink?” (I like where this is going) “Australia would be the nation of choice, naturally. There’s something about the Oz demotic that is perfect for the task. I feel that Warner could rock a ‘’cheeto-faced shit-gibbon’’ or the more reflective Smith could manage calling him ‘’an unanchored and nihilist id’’ (obviously Lillee and Thommo should be given their heads just to see what they would come up with). Might not change much but everyone would feel better.” Kane Richardson the dark horse here. He’d protest with the best of them, I reckon. One of the growing band of Australian cricket vegans, did you know? I plan on writing about them. Another time. 18th over: India 121-0 (Rahane 51, Rohit 67) On the other side, Moeen Ali has just pumped a 54-ball century. Couple overs left in England’s (big) I won’t be offended if you chuck that on instead, as India have this won. NCN also brought back, but it doesn’t matter now. Rahane takes him off the hip to the rope and moves to a half-century. Run a ball, piece of cake. 21st time to the mark in ODIs for him. Only one other single, to the West Australian’s credit. 17th over: India 116-0 (Rahane 46, Rohit 67) Well, it is Cummins that Smith is turning to for the wicket he so desparately requires. Makes no difference though! Bang, bang! Rohit just pumps the bowler back over his head, then pulls through midwicket to split the sweepers. He’s doing as he pleases here. This is sensational batting. INJURY! Agar was diving to save the second of the two but looks to have smacked a finger out of place. Uh oh. Straight off the field. If that’s his bowling hand, no way he’ll be able to continue. Send in the part-timers. DROPPED! Oh dear! Handscomb the man. It’s low and quick. He has to go with one hand. But still: the stand-in ‘keeper has put down Rohit Sharma! The chance created and not taken. Replacing Wade as a specialist stumper, that will be a talking point following this match, make no mistake about that. It ends an eventful over, and they’re directed by the umpires to grab grab a drink. 16th over: India 106-0 (Rahane 45, Rohit 58) Marcus Stonis to replace Kane Richardson. The latter a South Australian. Wonder who he barracks for in the SANFL? A brilliant Grand Final in that competition earlier today, Sturt going back to back with a one-point win over Port Adelaide. Great stuff. Stonis does well too... until he doesn’t. Can’t drop short at his pace, Rahane punishing the mistake through midwicket again. Sounds crazy to say with just over a third of the runs collected, but we’re nearly at game over stage already. Let’s be honest with ourselves. 15th over: India 100-0 (Rahane 40, Rohit 57) Short, no good. Agar gives Rohit a chance to swing his arms and he accepts. NCN nearly cuts off the cut with a big dive, but can’t get his hand on it. Clarke says the Indian grounds are so hard, when you dive it is like concrete. Explains why he takes a while to get up. Oh, more rubbish from Agar, second time he’s fell badly short in the over, pulled by Rahane to the midwicket rope. Keeps the strike with a clip to square leg and the 100 is up for the home side to end the 15th. Run rare required south of 5.6 an over now. Doing this easy. 14th over: India 90-0 (Rahane 35, Rohit 52) Rahane fond of responding to Rohit’s huge hitting with some lovely shots of his own. He punches the first ball of this new over from high in his stance. Cut off by the sweeper, but deserved a boundary. Rohit tries to heave over mid-on to a slower ball, and it is a miscue. Lucky it doesn’t go to hand at cover. Really doesn’t need to do that. Showing over to over that he can do a lot of damage without a lot of risk. Six from the Richardson over. 13th over: India 84-0 (Rahane 31, Rohit 50) Just when I was finished writing about Agar’s useful start, keeping Rahane then Rohit cramped across five well-directed deliveries, Rohit smashes him over long on for six! In doing so the opener moves to 50 in 42 balls. Pretty much a half-volley, a clean swing through the ball. Wonderful strike. His fourth six along the way. If he’s still there at over 25 it may as well be game over. Who can Smith turn to? It has been Zampa over the last 18 months, but he isn’t in the XI tonight. 12th over: India 77-0 (Rahane 30, Rohit 44) Richardson could have dropped his bundle after a poor start, but sticks with it here. Beats Rahane outside the off-stump, against the flow of play. Three singles, Rahane keeping the strike pulling along the carpet. 11th over: India 74-0 (Rahane 28, Rohit 43) “If India bat 45 overs this is game over,” says Clarke as Agar enters the attack. The spinner will need to put on a clinic here to get his side back into it. Won’t happen in this first one, five of the six deliveries balls scored off without any risk. Perfect batting for the circumstances. Well set up for Kohli, too. Grinds them better than most/any. 10th over: India 68-0 (Rahane 26, Rohit 39) Last over of the power play and they are not missing out! Rahane’s turn now, though. After watching Rohit explode, he’s into it with three boundaries in an over. The first is an ugly swipe, but it matters little with the field up. The second is clever, coming up to Stonis and clipping off the hip with fine leg up. Ideal timing. The third the best of the lot, finding a gap through backward point with a cut played with his knees bent to such an extent that he’s nearly on the ground when the contact is made. Just about the first ten overs. Can transfer into accumulation mode from an excellent base. 9th over: India 55-0 (Rahane 14, Rohit 38) HUGE! Richardson has been PUT OUT OF THE GROUND. That sure is something. Rohit has charged and made room, the bowler obliging by dropping short. The swing is perfectly timed - he’s picked it and popped it literally out of the stadium at square leg! Not a small grandstand either. “I don’t hit my driver that far!,” says Clarke. “It must have gone 120 metres.” Joyous one-day batting. To be fair to Richardson, he fights back into the over with some well-directed changes of pace. 8th over: India 42-0 (Rahane 13, Rohit 30) “It’s a sign of the times isn’t it,” Clarke says on the TV. Ten years ago 293 on the board would win 9/10 games, he says. Now? It’s just not enough. “They really needed 340.” He’s spot on, that hyperinflation in no small way starting during this corresponding series four years ago. Come to think about it, one of the first things I wrote about of this caper. There in one innings, Rohit his 16 sixes. Not so again this over though, Stonis into the attack and immediately putting the brakes on. Four from it via singles. Having a good series with the ball, he is. Has a big job tonight. 7th over: India 42-0 (Rahane 10, Rohit 29) Richardson’s turn at the bowling crease. Good change. Oh and he’s nearly got Rohit! The book will read four runs, but that was a flay with less control off the front foot. At backward point Maxwell is diving to his left and got a hand to it - an excellent effort. Still, the runs keep flowing. And again! Richardson cannot drop short to this man right now. He rocks back and plunders to the midwicket rope. Only two men out in this power play, Rohit can help himself there. In total control here. 6th over: India 34-0 (Rahane 10, Rohit 21) Rohit again, on that’s a better shot than the previous over, clipping with timing and class when NCN strays ever so slightly. Barely swung the bat. Gorgeous batting. And goes big again! Second over on the trot, swings through the line to a length delivery and lofts it over the long-off rope! Superb shot. A nice old dent being put into this. Australia urgently need to get rid of Rohit or this could get ugly on the evidence of the last couple of overs. 11 from the over. 5th over: India 23-0 (Rahane 10, Rohit 10) BIG! Rohit has looked ropey so far, but not here, flogging a pull hook well into the crowd over square leg. That’ll help get the blood pumping for the opener. Watching the replay, he really got underneath it, getting it into the second tier of the stand! Cop that. Right from the over, both of them getting their teeth into this chase now. 4th over: India 15-0 (Rahane 9, Rohit 3) Taken them three and a half overs of this power play, but India have their first boundary. It’s stand and deliver stuff from Rahane, who came down to meet the Coulter-Nile length delivery, slapping over cover. Singles then exchanged, Rohit’s less convincing off an inside edge. Leg bye to finish it. 3rd over: India 8-0 (Rahane 4, Rohit 2) Cummins hitting the deck hard here, Rahane picking out the ring fielders on the off-side, playing from the crease. Hmm, some controversy mid-over. Smith was lobbing the ball to the fielder at mid-on when the ball was essentially dead. But it went over his head, Stonis not picking it up at all. The umpires consult and agree that the Indians can’t add runs in that situation. I’m not so sure about that. Anyway, it’s over. Rahane again scores off the final ball of the over, pushing to the onside. One from it. Don’t underestimate how close they came to replacing Wade with Handscomb for the Second Test in Bangladesh a couple of weeks ago. I was covering that tour, and it was a close run thing until the day before the match. Wade kept really well there, but the modern game - red ball or white - demands your stumper is doing a job with the bat as well. Simply put, since returning to the Test team in November, he hasn’t. 2nd over: India 7-0 (Rahane 3, Rohit 2) It is NCN starting off as well. Bit of hoop, Rohit edging to third man along the ground. Squared up, though. Much improved bowler, Coulter-Nile. Wouldn’t be surprised if he is a big part of the World Cup defence a couple of years from now. Handscomb getting nice and active early on with the gloves, prompting a chat on the telly about him replacing Wade. The latter’s international career must be hanging by the proverbial thread. Back to the here and now: after talking up the paid, the bowler sprays one down legside and the ‘keeper can’t glove it. Couple added. Rahane keeps the strike with a single. Steady. 1st over: India 2-0 (Rahane 1, Rohit 1) No risks to begin, Cummins on the spot well in the 140s kph. Rahane uses that pace to get off the mark down to third man. Rohit does likewise to keep the strike behind square to end the set. We have live coverage from Bristol as well, England well on their way to a massive total against West Indies. Vish currently on the OBO tools for that one. Righto. Players are out on the field. Big job ahead of Australia’s trio of quicks Pat Cummins, Nathan Coulter-Nile and Kane Richardson. Or, Cummo, NCN and Richo as I’ll probably end up referring to them at some stage. Rohit, Rahane and Virat ahead of them in the first instance. 293 the target. PLAY! The defence. “You know against India you have to take ten wickets.” The words of Aaron Finch, who did his bit with a punishing ton, but with the middle order unable to go on with it in the final ten overs - a crime in modern ODI cricket - that’s the reality for Australia now. There’s no way they will restrict India if they bat the distance; not on this track, not with the experience the hosts have chasing down anything. So wickets it must be. Adam Collins with you here to see how it all shakes out in Indore, with thanks to JP Howcroft for the first innings. We’re about 20 minutes away from all that. Can Australia stay in the series? Probably not, but I plan to have a good time finding out. What do you think? Let me know. I take both the old money and the new. What promised to be a fill-your-boots runfest turned into a surprisingly interesting Australian innings. David Warner’s run-a-ball 42 set the tone early but it was Aaron Finch’s muscular 124 that did the damage. When Finch was in full flight it looked as though 350 was a gettable total but once he holed out to deep midwicket Australia slumped from 224-1 to 293-6 in 12 overs. Steve Smith looked set for more than his 63 while everyone else that followed struggled for timing. The pitch looks immaculate but it was apparent as the day wore on that it is two-paced and difficult to start on. That is expected to change under lights against Australia’s quicker bowlers, so changes of pace have to be the order of the evening. Those changes of pace made India’s three seamers all excellent in their own ways and although the pair of spinners took some tap at different times both showed grit to hang in there and take crucial wickets. Adam Collins will see you through India’s run chase and Virat Kohli will bat knowing his side just has its nose in front at the halfway mark. 50th over: Australia 293-6 (Stoinis 27, Agar 8) Not the best final over from the otherwise excellent Bumrah. A couple of wides and a couple in Agar’s slot enable Australia to add a little gloss to the scoreboard. 49th over: Australia 281-6 (Stoinis 24, Agar 2) Kumar’s final over full of well executed yorkers is spoiled by one delivery that slips out of his hand in his delivery stride. He’s fortunate to see it called a dead ball, not a no-ball and just five runs from the over sees Bhuvneshwar finish with 0-52 bowling with the new ball and then at the death on a very flat pitch. 48th over: Australia 276-6 (Stoinis 21, Agar 0) Bumrah’s changes of pace are making him so difficult to score off. His slower ball is a floaty off-cutter but his quicker one is sharp and angled into the right-hander. He has 2-40 from his nine overs. Australia have imploded. This is one of those catches that used to be ‘the best catch in the world’ and is now standard fare. Pandey takes Handscomb’s drive on the long-off boundary, overbalances but throws the ball up before he crosses the rope, returns to the field of play and completes the dismissal. Magical stuff. 47th over: Australia 272-5 (Stoinis 18, Handscomb 2) Better for Australia courtesy of a couple of Kumar wides and a a remarkable straight driven four from Stoinis that was little more than the batsman digging out a yorker. Still frustrating at this stage to see Handscomb swing and miss at the final couple of deliveries. 46th over: Australia 263-5 (Stoinis 12, Handscomb 1) Remember, Australia were cruising at 224-1 but since Finch holed out it’s been an ugly collapse. Four runs and the wicket from Bumrah’s over. Top stuff. Brilliant from Bumrah. He returns to the attack with a dot ball, a leg-bye, then a slower ball off-cutter that is too good for Head’s mighty swipe. The wheels falling off for Australia. 45th over: Australia 259-4 (Head 4, Stoinis 11) Pace to see us home now with Bhuvneshwar Kumar returning to the attack for the first of his three remaining overs. From his second delivery there’s an LBW Review but Stoinis was hit outside the line so the umpire’s original not out call stands. It’s a terrific over full of yorkers and varying lines and lengths from Kumar that yields only four runs. India have fought back superbly. 44th over: Australia 255-4 (Head 3, Stoinis 9) Both these men are powerful hitters and can get the scoreboard moving at pace with little effort. And Stoinis does exactly that with what appeared to be a gentle push for six over long off. It was a decent over from Kuldeep though, with just that one hit beating the field. 43rd over: Australia 245-4 (Head 1, Stoinis 1) Two new batsmen at the crease now and a likely 350ish has become a battle to make 300. Credit to India and their young spinners for hanging in when little was on offer. This horror run from Australia also goes to show how difficult this wicket can be to score on early in an innings. It’s a road once the batsman’s set, but even Finch looked scratchy until he was 40 or so. The collapse continues with Maxwell’s ugly innings brought to a close. Chahal threw the ball wide of off stump, Maxwell - hatless it must be added - chased after it like a dog snapping its jaws at a treat, but he can’t reach far enough and Dhoni completes the formalities. 42nd over: Australia 243-3 (Maxwell 5, Head 0) Kuldeep makes it spin at both ends and again he offers a line outside off stump that the batsmen find awkward getting away. After a fifth over of frustration in a row Smith throws his bat at the final delivery. He doesn’t pick the wrong ‘un though and slices a drive that’s claimed safely at long off by Bumrah. Australia losing their way here in Indore. 41st over: Australia 236-2 (Smith 60, Maxwell 3) Chahal returns for his ninth over and he sends down a lovely over - again just two off it. The bowler tossing up his leggies outside off, making him an awkward prospect to slog. The momentum has just ebbed away from this innings since Finch’s dismissal - Maxwell three from nine deliveries has yet to get his eye in. 40th over: Australia 234-2 (Smith 59, Maxwell 2) Four overs of spin still to be bowled at some point, but not right now as Bumrah comes into the attack. He bowls four dot balls in a very tidy over too, conceding just two runs while Maxwell struggles to find his timing. 39th over: Australia 232-2 (Smith 58, Maxwell 1) The wicket ball, by the way, was the fastest of Kuldeep’s spell, so it wasn’t just a tired batsman holing out, the bowler played his part in the dismissal. Reward for persistence. Pandya completes his 10 overs with figures of 1/58 following another excellent over. He beat Maxwell with a short ball and had no luck with a thick outside edge for four from Smith to conclude the over. Pick of the bowlers today by some margin. 38th over: Australia 224-2 (Smith 51, Maxwell 0) That was a super knock fro Aaron Finch, exactly the innings his captain was imploring his side to produce during the week. Glenn Maxwell has been promoted to number four, this could be fun! Kuldeep continues his penance and he’s finally rewarded for it; Finch slapping a brutal slog sweep into the safe hands of deep midwicket. 37th over: Australia 221-1 (Finch 122, Smith 50) Pandya’s figures haven’t been hammered too badly, which is a testament to his variety. Once again he sends down an over without conceding a boundary, which is no mean feat. There are enough singles in there for skipper Smith to reach his 50 though - his 19th in ODIs. 36th over: Australia 216-1 (Finch 120, Smith 47) The final drinks break of the innings has been taken, so it’s all slog no grog from hereon in. Kuldeep is the poor sucker with the ball in his hand and he has the misfortune of watching Finch biff him back over his head for six. Seventh Horcrux emails in: What in the name of baggy greens is this ODI? The mean match of a weird series and we’re given a belter on a ground I wouldn’t trust with a national match. Should I blame the curator or the players for not being extraordinary enough? Nevermind me. Just woke up, grumpy. I think Nirvana put it most poetically with the phrase ‘Radio Friendly Unit Shifter’. 35th over: Australia 206-1 (Finch 113, Smith 45) Pandya continues his role of cannon fodder and Australia bringing up the 200 in an over featuring a meaty swipe for four by Finch who is now in T20 mode. Poor bloke’s probably cream crackered and just wants an ice bath and a tall mango lassi. Finch’s eighth ODI ton, by the way, is the second-most by any non-Test player. Behind Ireland’s Will Porterfield. That is a lovely stat. 34th over: Australia 197-1 (Finch 107, Smith 44) Kuldeep continues and after Smith milks a single Finch sweeps hard for four to bring up his century! Terrific batting from the opener who came into the game after a calf strain, lacked timing for his first 40 or so runs and then shifted through the gears. Speaking of which, Finch celebrates his ton by opening his shoulders and carting Kuldeep unceremoniously over long on. That was a full blooded whomp! 33rd over: Australia 186-1 (Finch 97, Smith 43) Pandya back into the attack and he’s looked as likely as anyone today with his changes of pace and variety of slower balls. He concedes only three runs as the fatiguing Finch nears his century. Looks like Glenn Maxwell is padded up to come in at the fall of the next wicket. Excellent. 32nd over: Australia 183-1 (Finch 95, Smith 42) Kuldeep backed in by his skipper despite Finch’s aggression and he delivers a tidy over in return. This has ceased to be a contest between bat and ball, and simply an exercise in accumulation. Can Australia bash enough to keep India’s runfest later on at bay? 31st over: Australia 180-1 (Finch 93, Smith 40) A trademark wristy four from Smith sets up another good over for Australia off Chahal. This partnership now worth more than 100 and it’s come at a run-a-ball. 30th over: Australia 171-1 (Finch 91, Smith 34) Australia have built an excellent platform out there and another straight six from Finch keeps the momentum going. Kuldeep beat Finch in the flight and the stump mic picked up an ‘Oh no” but so short are the boundaries it didn’t matter. The opener took no chances with the next delivery, muscling a straight drive all along the turf for four much safer runs. If the logic of doubling the 30-over score still stands, Australia are on for something massive. 29th over: Australia 160-1 (Finch 80, Smith 33) Chahal the latest bowling change for India and three dot balls in a row suggest a big shot might be on its way - and it comes - a brutal pull from Finch from a delivery just a fraction short that scoots away for four. 28th over: Australia 153-1 (Finch 75, Smith 32) Kuldeep wasn’t out of the attack for long and he almost gets Finch with a sweep that just lobs over short fine leg. Business as usual aside from that scare with the scoreboard ticking over nicely. 27th over: Australia 146-1 (Finch 73, Smith 27) Kumar and Bumrah in tandem as Kohli turns to his strike bowlers to break the partnership. There’s nothing happening out there for seam or spin though with Australia steadily accumulating runs. Finch aims a rare play and miss at one outside off stump but regathers his composure to loft an overpitched floater back over the bowler’s head for six imperious runs. Shot of the day. Head still, economy of moving parts, maximum result. 26th over: Australia 137-1 (Finch 66, Smith 25) Bumrah back into the attack and just two runs come from the opener’s bowling. 25th over: Australia 135-1 (Finch 65, Smith 24) Aaron Finch is feeling the heat out there, as you might expect from almost two hours of batting in searing heat containing plenty of quick singles. Bhuvneshwar is back into the attack, by the way, and his gun-barrel straight deliveries go for three singles and a two. 24th over: Australia 130-1 (Finch 61, Smith 23) Kuldeep Yadav doesn’t look like replicating his hat-trick heroics of the other day. Both batsmen are milking singles on the on-side at will, with Brad Hogg on commentary (no mean left-arm wrist spinner himself) suggesting Kuldeep’s line is too straight. 23rd over: Australia 126-1 (Finch 59, Smith 21) Pandya relieves Chahal but he can’t stem the flow of runs with Smith making that exaggerated leg-side flick of his for four and Finch taking a giant step down the track and crunching a cover drive of the highest order. So it is Stuie, but it needs to be. This pitch is expected to improve as the night goes on, with 300 a minimum expected score. 22nd over: Australia 117-1 (Finch 55, Smith 16) Kuldeep Yadav comes on for Pandya and the faintest bottom edge from a tickled sweep earns Finch another boundary. Tough job now for India’s young pair of spinners on a flat pitch offering no assistance against two set batsmen. 21st over: Australia 110-1 (Finch 50, Smith 14) Two boundaries from the over, brings up Finch’s 50. The first one is a cute glance to the fine leg fence. It was almost cut off by the Indian fielder but ultimately thrown over the fence in a despairing dive. The second is a drilled four straight back over the bowler’s head. Finch looking the goods now after a scratchy start. 20th over: Australia 102-1 (Finch 42, Smith 14) Pandya earns the edge of Finch’s bat but there’s no slip and four runs is the result. It was an expansive drive from Finch who missed his timing by some distance. The Victorian hasn’t looked fluent so far but he’s accumulated 40 and rotated the strike nicely. Hundred up for Australia. 19th over: Australia 95-1 (Finch 36, Smith 13) Chahal keeps pushing Finch onto the back foot but the batsman is watchful and not at risk of losing his wicket. Smith by contrast is immediately on the front foot, stepping down the wicket and driving well through midwicket for four. 18th over: Australia 90-1 (Finch 35, Smith 9) Australia begin the over on 87, their danger number, if confirmation bias is to be believed. Although as far as sporting curses go it’s not a patch on Mayo’s in the GAA which continued into its 66th year last week. Australia move past 87, but only by three in a tight Pandya over. 17th over: Australia 87-1 (Finch 33, Smith 8) There’s that big shot from Finch - and he clears the long on fence with ease! That was the second delivery of Chahal’s over; the first was a nervy inside-edge into the on-side. The rest of the over safely dealt with. 16th over: Australia 79-1 (Finch 26, Smith 7) Pandya again getting joy from his quick offbreaks, beating Finch this time but not snaring the outside edge. Finch just getting a little bogged down out there. He might need his skipper to nurse him away from a reckless shot or two. Time for a drinks break, and some Bowlology gold. 15th over: Australia 76-1 (Finch 25, Smith 5) Chahal is causing the two right-handers to study the ball right onto the face of the bat. Watchful over after the mayhem of the previous one. 14th over: Australia 74-1 (Finch 24, Smith 4) That was a ripping delivery from Pandya, a genuine fast offbreak. He ripper his fingers around that ball and it gripped on a length and beat the outside edge of a set batsman. He was coming from around the wicket too, so any away movement was going to feel accentuated. Top, top bowling. Smith’s off the mark with those heavy hands of his through the leg-side. Huge unexpected wicket for India! Warner was moving through the gears and after punching a four through extra cover off Pandya, the bowler extracts his revenge, ripping one through Warner’s defences and sending the bails flying in the air. 13th over: Australia 66-0 (Warner 38, Finch 24) Chahal’s second over has Warner moving up a gear. A reverse sweep first up fails to connect, but two from the next delivery precedes a clean straight six, the first maximum of the game. Finch tries the same shot but can only muscle the ball to long on. 11 from a productive over for Australia. 12th over: Australia 55-0 (Warner 28, Finch 23) Hardik Pandya ensures pace continues at one end and he continues India’s policy of denying Finch and Warner any width, cramping them up whenever possible. Australia’s sharp running means the scoreboard continues to tick over. 11th over: Australia 52-0 (Warner 26, Finch 22) The first bowling change sees leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal come into the attack. Warner does his best to get off strike first ball but in his haste invites his partner into run out territory with Kohli hitting directly. The third umpire shows Finch just making his ground. There’s not a heap of turn or bounce early but Australia’s openers are circumspect nonetheless. 10th over: Australia 49-0 (Warner 24, Finch 22) Bumrah will also be given a five-over spell and his fifth over is more impressive than Kumar’s, restricting Australia to pinched singles. One of those pinched singles turns out to be worth three runs though, courtesy of some sloppy backing up leading to a couple of handy overthrows. Indore is apparently “the selfie capital of India,” according to the TV commentary. You’re welcome. 9th over: Australia 43-0 (Warner 21, Finch 19) That’s more like it! Back to back fours to welcome Kumar’s fifth over. The first was a tickle off his legs, the second a beautiful cover drive with textbook raised ftont elbow. 8th over: Australia 35-0 (Warner 13, Finch 19) Australia still not imposing themselves on this contest with any force. Warner almost runs himself into trouble with a quick single and then a Finch lofted drive comes off the inside half of his bat and reaches the fine-leg boundary rather than long on. It may well be this pitch is more two-paced that we expected and it deserves due care and attention. Still, India will be happy with the run-rate so far. 7th over: Australia 26-0 (Warner 11, Finch 12) Australia’s openers still keeping their powder dry, respecting anything sent down on a decent line and length. On a surface this good and a ground this small, time getting in at the crease like this cannot be wasted. This pair need to cash in. 6th over: Australia 24-0 (Warner 10, Finch 11) There’s no swing, no seam movement, and just the odd delivery keeping low out there, otherwise it is a road. Which makes Bumrah’s ability to beat Finch’s outside edge especially impressive. Just one from the over. 5th over: Australia 23-0 (Warner 10, Finch 10) Australia getting into their work now after a watchful start. Warner works his first boundary after Kumar strays onto his pads. Clearly Smith not a ‘Tails Never Fails’ man. 4th over: Australia 17-0 (Warner 4, Finch 10) Bumrah continues and he offers the first big scoring opportunity to Finch but the opener swings and misses at a long hop outside off stump. Bumrah readjusts superbly and forces a thick edge that squirts away for the first four of the day. Cricket, eh? Good ball goes for four, rank one gets a play-and-miss ‘ooh’ from the field. Four more for Finch later in the over, more conventionally this time, riding a short of a length delivery to the extra-cover fence with gorgeous timing. That was a very good sign for Australia. Finch barely hit that and could not have timed it sweeter. 3rd over: Australia 7-0 (Warner 3, Finch 2) Kumar continues to Warner and beats him with one that keeps surprisingly low. It forces a change of approach from the bowler, sending him around the wicket with the field changing accordingly - no slips but two catchers in front of square on either side of the wicket. Not a lot happening thereafter, straight bowling, straigh batting. Mike Hussey on commentary suggesting it might be better to bat under lights with the ball likely to come onto the bat quicker than it is at the moment. He then comments on a TV graphic showing three-quarters of the boundaries under 60m from the stumps. Plenty of runs on this postage stamp if you get your eye in. 2nd over: Australia 6-0 (Warner 2, Finch 2) Jasprit Bumrah with his own new ball, sending it down with his right arm, over the wicket. He’s straight to Finch, who gets off strike with a single, and targeting Warner’s outside edge, which he beats with the third delivery of the over. Australia circumspect; India right on the money early on. Nip and tuck. It’s a small sample size, but India haven’t lost an ODI at Indore, in four previous attempts. 1st over: Australia 3-0 (Warner 1, Finch 1) Bhuvneshwar Kumar opens the bowling for India, over the wicket, shaping the ball into the left-handed Warner. It’s the one that goes the other way that did for Warner in Kolkata and it almost accounts for him again, fencing at one outside his off stump that flies just wide of the diving gully. Warner was on the walk to Kumar, attempting to negate the swing. To Finch the line is stump-to-stump, a plan signposted by the short midwicket, who fails to stop the Victorian getting off the mark with a single. The two sides are out for the national anthems. Indore has turned out in force here at the Holkar Cricket Stadium, the joint is rocking. It is an unforgiving venue for the players. The glare on the field is like a spotlight being shone from the heavens. If you were a fast bowler and your captain fielded first after winning the toss you’d give him a very filthy look indeed. The best batting pitch of the series is what has been presented by the Holkar Cricket Stadium curator. “An absolute belter” according to Michael Clarke. Faced with such a flat deck Australia will be delighted to have won the toss and not be sentenced to fielding once again in the burning heat and stifling humidity. With such a deep batting line up the visitors will expect to post a total in excess of 300. India are unchanged: Big selection news for Australia with two changes: Aaron Finch and Peter Handscomb come in for Hilton Cartwright and Matthew Wade. And yes, that does mean Handscomb will take the gloves. Could this be a glimpse into the future of Australia cricket? Scoring runs has not been easy for Australia this series so far but they will have a golden opportunity to put that right today in Indore. Evening all, and welcome to live OBO coverage of Australia’s third ODI of what is quite literally a bilateral series with India. We’re in Indore for this one, a place where Australia must win to keep alive their hopes of winning this five-match revenue raising exercise. I’m later than usual to the keyboard today, so that’s enough preamble for now. I’m sure there’ll be more ambling as we go through the 50 overs. As always, if you want to join in I would be delighted to share your comments, spark conversation and generally keep interest in a series inconveniently timed with the business end of the football seasons here in Australia. Jonathan will be here shortly. In the meantime, have a read of where Steve Smith believes Australia must improve."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/sep/23/anglican-ministers-targeted-by-anti-marriage-equality-emails-dean-says","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-22T22:12:15Z","webTitle":"Anglican ministers targeted by anti-marriage equality emails, dean says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/sep/23/anglican-ministers-targeted-by-anti-marriage-equality-emails-dean-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/sep/23/anglican-ministers-targeted-by-anti-marriage-equality-emails-dean-says","fields":{"headline":"Anglican ministers targeted by anti-marriage equality emails, dean says","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Anglican dean of Darwin has said he believes Christian ministers are being targeted by unauthorised anti-marriage equality emails “full of homophobic dog whistles”. An email received by the dean, titled A Unique Opportunity, contains links to research incorrectly claiming children are harmed by same-sex marriage and videos that say marriage equality has led to a push for “group marriage and incestuous marriage” to be legalised overseas. Rev Keith Joseph has submitted a complaint to the Australian Electoral Commission that the email had “no authorisation and no contact details even if you follow the links”. It was sent on 21 September after new requirements for campaign material to be authorised came into force on 14 September. The AEC chief legal officer, Paul Pirani, responded to Joseph on Friday that it had written to the registered owner of the website seeking “urgent action” to include authorisation details. Joseph told Guardian Australia the email linked to “discredited” research and misleading claims that marriage equality would lead to homosexuality and the break-up of traditional marriages. “This material is at the milder end but it is pushing an agenda that is not about the conduct of the [same-sex marriage] plebiscite, it raises peripheral issues ... such as claims that homosexuality is a bad or dangerous thing,” he said. The vast majority of studies show children with LGBTI parents are no worse off than those with heterosexual parents, including a survey of academic literature by the Australian Institute of Family Studies. The email links to a series of videos which claim that legalising same-sex marriage will be “at least as harmful” as the legalisation of no-fault divorce in 1975 and led overseas to “children being indoctrinated from kindergarten to accept homosexuality and same-sex marriage” and pushes to legalise “group marriage and incestuous marriage” Another video features testimony from “former gay activist James Parker” about how he married an Australian woman and learned that his previous “committed, eroticised same-sex relationship [did] not have the same components as a marriage”. Parker claims that it is “cruel” to say homosexual and heterosexual relationships are equal and perpetuating that “lie” causes injustice to same-sex-attracted people. In response to the complaint Pirani said the safeguards law only provides powers for the AEC to examine “matters that mislead a person in how they actually complete the survey response”. Joseph said the debate in the same-sex marriage survey is doing “intense” damage to friends and parishioners and “in at least a couple of cases the stress is leading to mental health issues”. Joseph said he had not signed up for the material, and he feared it was being sent to every Christian minister in Australia. The Anglican diocese of Sydney has taken a leading role in the no campaign but the Melbourne archbishop and head of the church in Australia, Philip Freier, has said the survey was an issue of conscience. Joseph said he believed the postal survey related to civil marriage, meaning it was “a matter for the state”. “Given the state guarantees the equality of all citizens and marriage is a social good, I think it should be available to all,” he said. “Religions won’t have to sign onto it or do it, so churches can hold onto their own practices.” Joseph said that the Anglican church was split on the issue, and cited polling showing that about half or more of Christians support marriage equality. “To assume the church as a whole is in favour [of the no campaign] is erroneous.” Joseph also criticised the Australian Christian Lobby director, Lyle Shelton, for a comment he made in 2013 that a new “stolen generation” would come about “because of the use of technology to sever a child from its biological parent in order that same-sex couples could realise their desire to have children”. Shelton defended the comment as recently as Wednesday last week. “Their stuff on the stolen generation is nauseating,” Joseph said. “Living up here in the Northern Territory we know about the stolen generation, and this is not it. “Kids were taken forcefully away from parents, whereas all the evidence is kids in same-sex households are fine. “To make that equation is offensive to Aboriginal Australians and is just false and it brings the church into disrepute.” Joseph said the postal survey was a “daft idea” and that people in the “religious right who wanted [it] ... should have known it would bring out this kind of trouble. “There’s no way it’s going to improve reputation of the church, it’s just stupid.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/19/who-is-new-zealands-new-prime-minister-a-profile-of-jacinda-ardern","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-19T06:16:58Z","webTitle":"Who is New Zealand's new prime minister?

Here is his statement in full: “The speech made by the US president in his maiden address on the UN arena in the prevailing serious circumstances, in which the situation on the Korean peninsula has been rendered tense as never before and is inching closer to a touch-and-go state, is arousing worldwide concern. Shaping the general idea of what he would say, I expected he would make stereotyped, prepared remarks a little from what he used to utter in his office on the spur of the moment as he had to speak on the world’s biggest official diplomatic stage. But, far from making any remarks of any persuasive power that can be viewed to be helpful in diffusion tension, he made unprecedented rude nonsense no one has ever heard from any of his predecessors. A frightened dog barks louder. I’d like to advise Trump to exercise prudence in selecting words and be considerate of whom he speaks to when making a speech in front of the world. The mentally deranged behaviour of the US president openly expressing on the UN arena the unethical will to “totally destroy” a sovereign state, beyond the boundary of threats and regime change or overturn of social system, makes even those with normal thinking faculty think about discretion and composure. His remarks remind me of such words as “political layman” and “political heretic” which were in vogue in reference to Trump during his presidential election campaign. After taking office Trump has rendered the world restless through threats and blackmail against all countries in the world. He is unfit to hold the prerogative of supreme command of a country, and he is surely a rogue and a gangster fond of playing with fire, rather than a politician. His remarks which described the US option through straightforward expression of his will have convinced me, rather than frightening or stopping me, that the path I chose is correct and that it is the one I have to follow to the last. Now that Trump has denied the existence of and insulted me and my country in front of the eyes of the world and made the most ferocious declaration of war in history that he would destroy the DPRK, we will consider with seriousness exercising a corresponding, highest level of hard-line countermeasure in history. Action is the best option in treating the dotard* who, hard of hearing, is uttering only what he wants to say. As a man representing the DPRK and on behalf of the dignity and honor of my state and people and on my own, I will make the man holding the prerogative of the supreme command in the US pay dearly for his speech calling for totally destroying the DPRK. This is not a rhetorical expression loved by Trump. I am now thinking hard about what response he could have expected when he allowed such eccentric words to trip off his tongue. Whatever Trump might have expected, he will face results beyond his expectation. I will surely and definitely tame the mentally deranged US dotard with fire.” *An old person, especially one who has become weak or senile"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/22/listen-up-australians-its-time-to-turn-down-the-volume","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-22T00:49:13Z","webTitle":"Listen up, Australians: it’s time to turn down the volume | Johanna Leggatt","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/22/listen-up-australians-its-time-to-turn-down-the-volume","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/22/listen-up-australians-its-time-to-turn-down-the-volume","fields":{"headline":"Listen up, Australians: it’s time to turn down the volume","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"I was in a Paris restaurant a few years back, one of those quaint little brasseries that make you weak at the knees, when it occurred to me that something was off. The food and wine were delicious, the company was second to none (I was dining alone), but the vibe was different somehow. Then it twigged. It was quiet. As in: library quiet. The place was full of diners and the tables were packed in tightly together, but the only noise was a delightful backdrop of voices murmuring, glasses clinking and spoons gently lapping at bowls. Plenty of people were talking, mind you, it was just that they were talking quietly because they wanted to make sure their companions could hear them. If I were to reach for an elaborate simile, I would say that the restaurant was like daybreak in England, where the first sounds of the morning are the gentle rousing of songbirds rather than the sound of squawking galahs. Australians, to continue the bird parallel, are squawkers, and my hometown of Melbourne, with its proliferation of tiny bars that echo like shipping containers, is full of them. That’s right. Regal, cosmopolitan Melbourne, the Paris-of-the-Antipodes, is a noisy, raucous place, which often makes going out for a drink or dinner akin to a shouting match as you struggle to be heard above the din of other people’s work dramas. When I was younger, I looked forward to adopting a certain curmudgeonly bearing as I aged. I fancied myself as the kind of person who would complain about noisy music to po-faced bartenders, pulling plugs on amps, hushing exuberant pub singers at curfew hour. But my main bone of contention with dining out these days – apart from the apotheosis of chefs, wooden boards as plates, and the existence of foam – is other people. Let me be more specific: Australians congregating in public spaces. It’s not just in bars either. The mobile phone, that great liberator of repressed id, has a lot to answer for. Or rather, its owners do. Am I the only one who thinks, barring an emergency, it’s not OK to take a phone call on public transport to talk loudly about your terrible Tinder date, why your mother needs to learn once and for all to respect your boundaries, and who again, remind me, is picking up the kids? And why is it the people with the least to say are always the ones saying it the loudest? I can still remember sitting opposite a woman on a tram who was talking loudly on her phone about her boyfriend’s sexual proclivities. I looked at her for a long time, hoping to catch her eye, to prompt some degree of self-awareness. Nothing. If I think back to that restaurant in Paris, and other restaurants I visited during my trip, what struck me was that while conversation was important to the diners, the shared space of the restaurant was equally respected. Australians are less enamoured of a sense of occasion. We are suspicious of formality and inherently distrust seriousness. We will happily queue for restaurants, but would rather share food and dine at communal tables than take part in anything as ludicrous as three courses with matched wines, a dress code and ambient music, lest we look like giant wankers. And, of course, our loudness has a lot to do with actual space. Compared to Europe, we have a tonne of it, even our capital cities seem capacious compared to the big cities of the world. This acreage is a boon, but it has inured us to the notion of a shared public space and the need to rein ourselves in so we don’t take up too much of it. So a bit of a rewrite of the national character is called for. Australians are often referred to as a laconic bunch. Dry as the desert, egalitarian to a T and straight shooters from birth. But let’s add another descriptor to our suite of national characteristics: loud as hell. We blame Americans for being a rowdy, talkative bunch, but as anyone who has ever tried to be heard in a small bar or sit in quiet on public transport will attest, we like to make our lives known to others. Tinder dates and all. It’s time to lower the decibel level.

In recent weeks, though, nearly all seem to have vanished following a police operation. Local residents are mystified as to where they’ve gone. The Salt Lake City police chief, Mike Brown, said he had visited parks and the Jordan river, which threads its way to the Great Salt Lake and has homeless camps dotted along its banks, but he hadn’t seen an influx from downtown. Sgt Brandon Shearer has been up in a police helicopter looking for camps and seemed equally perplexed when asked where the people had gone. “I don’t know,” he said. “That’s a good question.” Advocates, for their part, fear a humanitarian crisis is brewing. The unfolding drama is all the more remarkable considering that several years ago, national media reports published claims by Utah that it had “won the war” on homelessness there, at least when it came to housing those who had been outside the longest. Jon Stewart ran a laudatory piece titled “The homeless homed”. But the picture wasn’t quite that simple. While the country’s most prominent homeless crises are in coastal cities – New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles – the mountain-ringed capital of the Mormon church has also long struggled to house or, in the view of some, has politely ignored its homeless population. The Republican legislature in Utah is fond of the philosophy of pulling yourself up by your bootstraps, and struggling not-for-profit groups pick up the slack when it comes to homelessness funding. Rather than ending homelessness, the city in fact housed a subset of its homeless residents, an important step but only an intermediary one in its alleviation efforts. Since then, as rents have risen and the minimum wage has remained stagnant, more and more families have found themselves on the street. A count last year found about 2,200 people in the region in total on any one night. In recent months, Salt Lake City has been convulsed by the situation around the downtown shelter, called the Road Home, located in a onetime warehouse district now host to high-end condos and shops. Even though officials say most of those living there are blameless – forced there by economic circumstances, mental health issues or opioid addictions – the area has been prone to violence. Police shot a teenager wielding a metal broomstick handle last year, and there were three unrelated killings in July and early August, one involving an unprovoked attack on a homeless man with a paving stone. As a result, in mid-August, Utah flooded the area with law enforcement officers as part of a two-year, $67m public-safety operation. “You throw 150 cops in there, it’s going to ruin the party,” Brown, the police chief, said dryly. Cue the abrupt dispersal of many of the downtown homeless residents to parts unknown. More than 1,200 people have been arrested, over half on drug charges, according to police, but 900 were later released to the streets. Officials leading the operation pledged to provide help for homeless residents in the form of treatment, housing and jobs. But in the weeks after the launch, municipal and state officials could only line up 37 treatment beds. One theory holds that the former inhabitants of the area left the state, another that they somehow found homes, yet another that they dispersed into various neighborhoods. “It’s not doing what they want,” said Brema Jones, a homeless woman sitting with her 71-year-old mother and two friends at the edge of Pioneer Park, two blocks from the shelter, as wind whipped the branches beneath the darkening sky. “It’s not helping druggies, not getting them into rehab. Everybody is spreading out.” Homeless people leaving a major jail have been reported as far afield as the airport and empty fields on the west side of the city. “The rhetoric from the mayor and policy workers was ‘We’re trying to help,’” said a west side activist, Michael Clara. “Well, you should help them downtown. Don’t scatter them and then try to help.” An outreach worker with Volunteers of America, Ethan Sellers, who is based at the main downtown library, said he had struggled to address the fears of those with schizophrenia. “You’re trying to help them understand they’re not under attack.” Advocates and community activists are anxious about the months to come. Few of the people arrested and then released have returned to the Road Home shelter, and the freezing winter weather is approaching. The long term impact of the sweep is not year clear. Pamela Atkinson, an acclaimed local homeless advocate, said that while some of the inhabitants had left the state, others “of my homeless friends” have started to return to the shelter. “Now it’s safer, they’ve come back.” “They’ve cleaned the place up,” said Zach Curry, who has been homeless for 10 years, and was hanging out by the shelter listening to a battered portable CD player. “People were committing suicide on drugs left and right. It was getting a bad rep for Salt Lake City.” He thinks the continuing police presence is challenging, “but it’s got to be done. That’s what a lot of us think about it.” While observers continue to wonder what has become of the population who lived around the Road Home until only last month, the state is transforming the physical landscape there, even though it plans eventually shutter the shelter and open three smaller ones in the region. Any homeless people who want to return are welcomed back – but there are now 10ft high chain link fences and floodlights that at night render the shelter akin to a high-security border crossing. Or perhaps a prison. While officials describe part of a recently blocked off street in front of the shelter as a “safe space” where vulnerable, drug-free people can get help, social workers have taken to calling it “the yard”.

Sara Thornton, chair of the National Police Chiefs’ Council, said the cuts come at a time of unprecedented threat, with Britain having suffered five attacks in the past six months, with more feared. Thornton said: “In response to this significant threat, the government is increasing the money it spends on terrorism from £11.7bn to £15.1bn but only about £700m per annum is spent on policing. And the allocation of this budget for policing is set to be cut by 7.2% in the next three years. When the volume and nature of a threat is growing alarmingly, that is a real concern.” Thornton’s comments came one week after an attempt to kill rush-hour commuters on a tube train in Parsons Green, west London. Thirty people were injured and deaths were avoided only because those behind the attack made errors constructing their bomb. She said that terror attacks place extra demands not just on counter-terrorism officers but the whole policing system, which is already overstretched. After the bombing of the Manchester Arena in May that claimed 22 lives, three-quarters of the resources deployed in response came from everyday policing. Thornton said: “With officer numbers at 1985 levels, crime up 10% in the last year and police work becoming ever more complex, this additional pressure is not sustainable. The current flat cash settlement for forces announced in 2015 is no longer enough.” The Conservatives cut funding to police and officer numbers after they came into power in 2010 with the then home secretary, Theresa May, ignoring protests and claiming crime had fallen despite the cuts. But recent attacks have made police chiefs more determined to fight back and press for extra funding, given what is expected to be an enduring and potentially escalating terrorist threat. Thornton said: “Experts tell us that the spate of attacks in the UK and Europe are a shift not a spike in the threat, which will take 20 or 30 years to eliminate. This new normality necessitates an open-minded dialogue with government about how we respond; and our resources have got to be part of the conversation.” Thornton, once described as the favourite police chief of David Cameron, said the funding squeeze risked damaging neighbourhood policing and the trust necessary for people to give officers information to catch terrorists. Thornton said: “Fewer officers and police community support officers will cut off the intelligence that is so crucial to preventing attacks. Withdrawal from communities risks undermining their trust in us at a time when we need people to have the confidence to share information with us. “Police chiefs will do all they can to protect the public from terrorism. We will make choices about what we prioritise and where we invest. Some of these choices may be difficult and unpalatable to the public but we can make them if necessary.” Thornton is a former chief constable of the Thames Valley force and was a candidate to be commissioner of the Metropolitan police, but lost out to Cressida Dick. The Home Office said: “The government will do what it takes to keep families, communities and our country safe. That is why we are increasing funding for counter-terrorism by £3.4bn and the home secretary announced £24m in extra support for [counter-terrorism] policing in addition to the £707m already committed for this year. “We have also protected overall police funding in real terms since 2015 and we are sensitive to the pressures on police forces across the country. We are engaging with them on the demands they are currently facing.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2017/sep/21/facebook-adverts-congress-russia-trump-us-election","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-21T20:16:11Z","webTitle":"Facebook to give Congress thousands of ads bought by Russians during election","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/sep/21/facebook-adverts-congress-russia-trump-us-election","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/sep/21/facebook-adverts-congress-russia-trump-us-election","fields":{"headline":"Facebook to give Congress thousands of ads bought by Russians during election","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Facebook will provide to Congress the contents of 3,000 advertisements purchased by Russians during the 2016 US presidential race, Mark Zuckerberg announced on Thursday, following weeks of scrutiny surrounding the social network’s potential role in influencing elections. The CEO said in a Facebook live video that the company would provide the controversial ads to government officials to support investigations in the US and as part of the social media company’s renewed efforts to protect the “integrity” of elections around the world. “I wish I could tell you we’re going to be able to stop all interference, but that just wouldn’t be realistic,” Zuckerberg said. “There will always be bad actors.” Early Friday, Donald Trump attacked the scrutiny of Russian adverts on Facebook, tweeting that the “Russia hoax continues” and repeated his criticism of the media’s coverage of the presidential race. On Thursday, Facebook’s general counsel Colin Stretch said in a statement: “After an extensive legal and policy review, today we are announcing that we will also share these ads with congressional investigators. We believe it is vitally important that government authorities have the information they need to deliver to the public a full assessment of what happened in the 2016 election.” Facebook disclosed earlier this month that an influence operation that appeared to be based in Russia had purchased $100,000 in ads to promote divisive political and social messages in a two-year period. The adverts had spread controversial views on topics such as immigration, LGBT rights and race and had promoted 470 “inauthentic” pages and accounts that Facebook later suspended, according to the company. Facebook has said it was cooperating with related federal investigations, and the revelations have lended credence to the findings of US intelligence officials that Russia was involved in influencing the 2016 presidential election. Concerns about the role of political ads on Facebook have not been limited to the US. A series of Conservative party attack ads in the UK were sent to voters in a key marginal constituency and relied on dummy Facebook accounts, the Guardian reported earlier this year. The announcement comes one day after 20 Democratic senators and representatives wrote to the Federal Election Commission to urge it “develop new guidance” for advertising platforms “to prevent illicit foreign spending in US elections”. In his speech, Zuckerberg said Facebook would also create a “new standard” for transparency in political advertising so advertisers must disclose which page paid for an ad and so that the public can visit advertisers’ pages and see the ads they’re currently running to any audience on the site. The CEO said the company had also been working to ensure the integrity of the forthcoming German election and had taken action against thousands of fake accounts. “I don’t want anyone to use our tools to undermine democracy,” he said, but later added that Facebook would never be able to catch all “bad content” in the system. “Freedom means you don’t have to ask permission first, and that by default you can say what you want.” The acknowledgment of Facebook’s possible role in affecting the elections is a major shift from the CEO’s initial statements on the subject. Zuckerberg had previously said that the idea that “fake news” on Facebook had played a role in the election of Donald Trump was “a pretty crazy idea”. Facebook’s sales teams, however, have touted the company’s ability to “significantly shift voter intent” through ads. Facebook has also faced repeated backlashes for its moderation and censorship of content amid global conflicts. As Myanmar’s military is facing international accusations of engaging in “ethnic cleansing” of the Rohingya Muslim minority, it was revealed this week that Facebook designated a Rohingya insurgent group a “dangerous organization” and ordered moderators to delete any content “by or praising” it. Facebook also faced criticisms this month following revelations that the company allowed advertisers to target users interested in the topics of “Jew hater” and “How to burn Jews”. The company has since announced policy changes meant to tighten controls on ad tools."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/sep/21/gareth-barry-ryan-giggs-appearance-record-west-bromwich-albion","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-21T21:41:00Z","webTitle":"Gareth Barry aims to carry on after passing Ryan Giggs appearance record","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/sep/21/gareth-barry-ryan-giggs-appearance-record-west-bromwich-albion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/sep/21/gareth-barry-ryan-giggs-appearance-record-west-bromwich-albion","fields":{"headline":"Gareth Barry aims to carry on after passing Ryan Giggs appearance record","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"If Gareth Barry was beginning to feel frazzled by a morning of media commitments at The Hawthorns, the message that popped up on Phil Neville’s iPad brought home the reason all this was happening. Neville was interviewing his former England team-mate for television and Barry was genuinely touched to be shown a recorded offer of congratulations from Ryan Giggs, who is only a vague acquaintance but had made contact to acknowledge the passing-on of his Premier League appearance record. The handover will be formalised on Monday when Barry starts for West Bromwich Albion at Arsenal, making his 633rd top-flight outing and confirming his place in the modern history books. “I’m not going to argue with Ryan about trophies and things like that,” Barry says in response to some light ribbing from Giggs about the difficulty of their respective achievements. “It was lovely to hear from him. I’m aware he’s played in the old First Division before and collected a few more appearances than the 633. I’m also aware the Premier League started in 1992 and records existed before that too. I’m not here to say I’m top of the tree in English football history.” Giggs played 672 league games in all; it is commendable self-awareness from Barry in an era when it sometimes feels less-recent history is too readily bulldozed but there is no taking away what the 36-year-old has accomplished since making his Aston Villa debut on 2 May 1998. Barry has been metronomic throughout his career, lauded by those who know him for his steadiness on the pitch and off it, and it is striking to hear that another milestone Giggs passed has not escaped his attention. He is yet to feel himself slowing up, self-doubt only fleetingly rearing its head on the back of the occasional frustrating result; could he, too, carry on to the end of his fourth decade? “It’s definitely a possibility,” comes the reply. “I was 32 when I signed for Everton and Roberto Martínez said: ‘With your style of game you can play until you’re 40.’ I’m sitting there laughing at him but he was deadly serious. I still laughed. It’s still going to be tough but for a manager to tell me that four or five years ago was a good compliment.” Barry often appears inscrutable but nobody can apply themselves for this long, with such an unspectacular but relentless form of excellence, without something raging within. There were whispers of late-career interest from Major League Soccer but that was never for him. Nor was the prospect of a slow fade at Everton, his rejection of a contract extension in the summer in favour of a more prominent role under Tony Pulis coming as a disappointment to Ronald Koeman but embodying his addiction to the battle. “I didn’t really enjoy the last three or four months at Everton sitting on the bench,” he says. “Part of me thought staying there would be an easier way to end your career. Less pressure on you, you’re not going to be starting games, less expected of you. But the other part said: ‘It’s too easy to go down that road, come to another challenge.’ It might be tougher but I didn’t want to fizzle out. I could still have got enough appearances to achieve this record but I wanted that one last major challenge.” There have been many of those and, when the time comes for a valediction, he may at last find time to luxuriate among the videos and clippings his mother, Linda, diligently curates back home in Hastings. He remembers being replaced by Edin Dzeko on the biggest occasion of all, with Manchester City 2-1 down to QPR on the final day of the 2011-12 season, and sitting next to James Milner on the bench with the pair fretting they had blown the title. The rest is history but Barry prefers to focus on the present day and, again like Giggs, has found yoga useful in prolonging his career. “As a player who’s been around a while you’ve got an old school mentality,” he says. “When somebody mentioned yoga for the first time I just looked at it and thought: ‘This isn’t for me, it’s for an older woman down at the health club trying to get supple.’ But I thought: ‘No, I can see the benefits there, I’ve got to embrace it.’ It can be hard work sometimes but you come away feeling much better. I’ve gone with things like that rather than saying I’ve never done it or needed to do it.” It has helped Barry since he left Villa eight years ago and as many as “six, seven or eight” of his current team-mates join in. Aside from a remarkably lean physique that has hardly gained fat since his teens, that is as far as the obvious secrets to his longevity go. Barry still enjoys a pint after matches with his family and expects to do the same at Arsenal; there is no hair shirt, no particular asceticism, and perhaps that has been as big a factor as any other. In almost two decades, he does not think much about his approach has changed. “One of my strengths is focusing on football, and even in the summer I try not to switch off too much,” he says. That level of attention is harder to attain for those coming through now, he believes. Barry does not use Twitter but that puts him among the minority nowadays and he fears social media adds an extra level of complexity to footballers’ development. “When I was growing up as a teenager I didn’t have to worry about any of that,” he says. “Now as a player you’ve just got to be on your toes all the time. You just go to fill your car up and there will be somebody wanting to film you, trying to do something silly like that. If you go into a shopping centre there are social media and cameras everywhere and if you’re doing the wrong thing you’re ultimately going to get found out. “So it’s important you’re living your life right and it’s hard for a young player. Sometimes you want to experience life but ultimately you’ve got to make sacrifices and choose the right road.” Had things worked out differently for Barry, he might even have been outstripping Giggs while wearing an Arsenal shirt. Arsène Wenger said on Thursday he had hoped to sign Barry from Villa in 2009 and the player says there were “a couple of conversations with representatives”. There was interest before Barry left City for Everton, too. “It would have been good to work under him but that didn’t happen,” he says but there is no suggestion of regret. The knowledge that a career such as his will be far more difficult to come by for today’s youngsters, too often squeezed out by the bigger clubs, makes gratefulness a stronger theme. “I’m immensely proud to get there,” he says of his record. “Whether it will stay around for long I don’t know. It’s certainly harder for younger players to break through now like I did. There’s a lot more rotation in terms of selections. So it may be tough to beat and the longer I can go it will be tougher as well.” It will also become more likely that, sooner than he may have imagined, Giggs finds himself fronting another video of goodwill."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2017/sep/21/embarassment-fa-martin-glenn-contradict-lawyers-sampson-investigation","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-21T19:13:34Z","webTitle":"Embarrassment for FA as Glenn contradicts lawyers about Sampson investigation","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/sep/21/embarassment-fa-martin-glenn-contradict-lawyers-sampson-investigation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/sep/21/embarassment-fa-martin-glenn-contradict-lawyers-sampson-investigation","fields":{"headline":"Embarrassment for FA as Glenn contradicts lawyers about Sampson investigation","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Martin Glenn, the Football Association’s heavily criticised chief executive, faces further embarrassment after admitting the organisation deliberately chose a black woman to investigate the Mark Sampson race allegations – without apparently realising the FA’s lawyers had already sent a letter to the Guardian warning such a claim was “plainly false”. Glenn, one of the executives most under scrutiny after Sampson’s sudden sacking on Wednesday, promised he would offer a personal apology to Eni Aluko and Drew Spence if the controversial and reopened independent inquiry found that the now‑deposed England women’s manager had made racial comments to the two players. However, Glenn also went on to say he had made it a condition to have a woman who is not white in charge of the inquiry, without appearing to realise that the FA’s solicitors, Farrer &amp; Co, had written to the Guardian on 25 August to say that any suggestion that it had deliberately chosen a black woman would be inaccurate and construed as a personal attack. “That suggestion is plainly false and categorically rejected,” it read. In an even more strongly worded letter, the same legal firm followed that up on Thursday by saying that the colour of Katharine Newton’s skin had been “utterly irrelevant” in the selection process and only an issue for those who did not understand, or wished to undermine, the investigation. Yet the FA’s inability to get its stories straight resurfaced when Glenn agreed to face the Guardian’s questions about the criticisms of the initial internal review – carried out by the FA’s technical director, Dan Ashworth, and the human resources director, Rachel Brace – in the face of criticism from the Professional Footballers’ Association that it was “not a genuine search for the truth” and “a sham which was not designed to establish the truth but intended to protect Mark Sampson”. Glenn defended his colleagues but admitted he was still not fully satisfied at the end of the initial review and said he had brought in Newton – whom he referred to as “Kate” – because he had decided the second investigation could not be overseen by a white person. “I wasn’t certain that two white people [Ashworth and Brace] – two middle-aged‑ish white people – doing the inquiry may have seen some of the shades of the issue that Eni was trying to get at. So, quite deliberately, I said: ‘I want an independent look at this and, to be blunt about it, I want it to be an employment expert, I want it to be female and I’d like it to be of a different ethnicity to us,’ in case we were missing things and in case the way we had done the inquiry may not have made people of a different ethnicity comfortable to speak up.” That, according to Glenn, was “above and beyond what normally would have been done. I feel good about doing that. You can pick holes but I’m not going to get into a ‘he said, she said’ about why some things were raised. You can deal only with complaints that get raised, not total hearsay. It was a full investigation.” Glenn and his top-level colleagues, in particular Ashworth and the chairman, Greg Clarke, are under scrutiny after Sampson’s dismissal and being forced to admit they had never fully looked into the safeguarding investigation surrounding a complaint about his behaviour and relationship with players at Bristol Academy, his previous job. With the FA still under pressure to resolve the escalating story involving Aluko and Spence, Newton’s investigation has led to criticism from, among others, Kick It Out, the PFA and Women in Football. Glenn, however, appeared to indicate that Spence was at fault for not coming forward earlier. “If someone has had something said to them, the thing you would expect them to do is raise a complaint. The specifics of that complaint could then be dealt with. If you worked your whole life on hearsay, you’d never be able to run a classroom let alone the Football Association.” Spence, then 22 and on her first England camp, chose not to make a complaint about an alleged incident at the China Cup in 2015 because she feared it would end her international career almost before it had begun. Instead, it was Aluko who raised it with the authorities. Yet, over two inquiries, Spence was never asked to corroborate whether it was true that Sampson had upset her, a mixed-race player, by asking how many times she had been arrested. Newton did not interview any of the other players who were present but has agreed to meet Spence on Friday after the player submitted a statement backing Aluko’s version of events. Aluko alleges separately that Sampson told her to be careful her Nigerian relatives did not bring Ebola to a game at Wembley. Sampson has always denied all the claims, and continues to do so, but Newton is now under considerable pressure to interview the three players – Jill Scott, Jo Potter and Izzy Christiansen – who were in the relevant meeting with Spence. “It could very well be the case that Mark said some crass things,” Glenn said. “I don’t know, you won’t know and I suspect no one will know. If it’s true that he has made inappropriate comments to Eni Aluko and Drew Spence I will apologise. He doesn’t need to – but I will apologise on behalf of the FA because we don’t operate the ship like that. “But is there evidence of systematic racial bias, or bullying, in that national team? Absolutely not. Two inquiries have shown that. We’ll finish the work after she [Newton] has spoken to Drew. But it’s not one [a culture] of systematic bias. I have to apply the principles of natural justice to this. “Of course people like Eni have rights that need to be respected. So, too, does the FA. So, too, does the management. So, too, do the support staff.” When it was put to him again that there were obvious holes in the investigation process, Glenn said: “I disagree with you on just about every count. I’ve worked in big organisations where inquiries into this kind of thing have gone on. I’m very comfortable. We did the internal inquiry with the head of HR and Dan Ashworth, both of whom have got a value set I totally respect. In terms of the question ‘is there any evidence of systematic wrongdoing?’ clearly not.” He added: “I respect your opinion, I just disagree on the substantive and I’m happy on the Eni Aluko issue. We’ll keep an open mind and my opinion will change as the facts change. I’ll see what the final conclusions of Kate’s inquiry are and, as things stand, I’m very happy to defend what we have done.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/21/mexico-city-earthquake-frida-sofia-enrique-rebsamen-school","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-21T23:44:35Z","webTitle":"Frida Sofía, age 12: the Mexico City quake 'survivor' who was never there","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/21/mexico-city-earthquake-frida-sofia-enrique-rebsamen-school","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/21/mexico-city-earthquake-frida-sofia-enrique-rebsamen-school","fields":{"headline":"Frida Sofía, age 12: the Mexico City quake 'survivor' who was never there","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The story captivated a country still reeling from catastrophe: rescue workers were labouring round the clock to free a 12-year-old girl who had miraculously survived Mexico’s devastating earthquake, but remained trapped in the ruins of her school. Television channels broadcast breathless updates describing how the rescuers were inching closer to the cavity where Frida Sofía was buried alive. Naval officers leading the rescue effort told reporters that she had been seen to wiggle her fingers, that she had taken shelter under a granite table and was in contact with schoolmates. But on Thursday, hope turned to heartache – and then anger – as the story fell apart: there was no student named Frida Sofía; there was no girl trapped in the ruins of Enrique Rebsámen school. After two days when it seemed that a rescue could come at any moment, the navy assistant secretary, Enrique Sarmiento, abruptly announced that all the school’s children had been accounted for. “We want to emphasize that we have no knowledge about the report that emerged with the name of a girl,” Sarmiento added. “We do not believe – we are sure – it was not a reality.” The announcement came just hours after a different navy official had told El Financiero TV that rescue workers were in contact with the girl. The revelation that there never was a Frida Sofía infuriated many Mexicans, who felt they’d been fed a false narrative of hope by press and public officials. “People are angry,” said Esteban Illades, editor of the Mexican magazine Nexos. “Frida was the story.” Online, many vented anger at the authorities. But they also targeted the media – especially the broadcasting giant Televisa. Some compared the episode to the story of Monchito, a nine-year-boy who was the focus of a massive rescue attempt from the rubble of Mexico City’s devastating 1985 earthquake, but turned out not to have existed. Televisa anchors also expressed frustration: “The federal government always told us there was a girl and they were about to rescue her. Now they changed their version. Outrageous,” tweeted anchor Carlos Loret de Mola. During the rescue, soldiers and marines with specialised equipment such as heat sensors and sensitive microphones searched the school site for signs of life – and claimed to have found Frida Sofía. Rescue workers were said to be feeding her milk down plastic tubes. But then the discrepancies started to emerge: no distraught family members came to the school; none of the surviving staff or students knew anyone of that name. Late on Wednesday, cheers broke out at the site of the ruined school as a rumour spread that two students had been saved. But soon after, a group of volunteer first responders known as the Moles – famed for burrowing through rubble – left the school saying there had been a difference of opinion with naval officials who had taken over the rescue effort. In the end, that effort was unnecessary. The anger prompted by the episode was the product of widespread disgust with public officials and media outlets which are routinely accused of fudging statistics and downplaying Mexico’s problems. “We already have extremely low levels of interpersonal and institutional trust,” said Rodolfo Soriano-Nuñez, a sociologist in Mexico City."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/22/older-workers-new-skills-bbc-millennials-mentor-generation-gap","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-22T05:00:38Z","webTitle":"Yes, older workers need new skills – but they need respect more | Gaby Hinsliff \r\n\r\n","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/22/older-workers-new-skills-bbc-millennials-mentor-generation-gap","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/22/older-workers-new-skills-bbc-millennials-mentor-generation-gap","fields":{"headline":"Yes, older workers need new skills – but they need respect more","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Old dogs, meet new tricks. The BBC’s director of radio and education, James Purnell, didn’t put it quite so bluntly. But that’s more or less the gist of his announcement that from next month senior managers will be “reverse mentored” by twentysomethings who can help them understand what millennials like. Since the short answer to this question is “not the BBC”, it’s easy to grasp why he might have acted. The Beeb is fighting a losing battle with Netflix and YouTube for younger viewers’ attention while new rivals such as Facebook’s venture into original programming are emerging all the time. The BBC has already been ticked off by Ofcom for being “overly focused on middle-aged, middle-class audiences”, not very good at portraying minority groups and lacking in “edgy content”. With apologies to all those middle-aged viewers already struggling to find anything to watch of an evening, the consensus is that it needs to get more down with the kids. Hence this plan to turn traditional mentoring – which normally involves a successful silverback graciously passing on their accumulated wisdom to young hopefuls – on its head. And the BBC is not alone. The idea that the old have much to learn from the young, as well as vice versa, is increasingly gaining traction in corporate life. Big companies, from the consultancy firm Ernst &amp; Young to the American retailer Target, have used reverse mentoring for everything from helping older workers to master new IT to spreading new thinking and gently challenging outdated working practices (no, it’s not weird for men to want to go part-time when they have kids; yes, people can be perfectly productive while working from home). As early retirement becomes a thing of the past, reverse mentoring is seen as a way of helping older workers stay in the game for longer and easing the friction between generations. Watch the Conservative party’s current painful efforts to get its head around what younger voters want, and you get some inkling of why it might be necessary. Yet the very suggestion of being babysat by some youngster with one eye on your job will doubtless infuriate some. At best, the implication that the middle-aged are out of touch is faintly insulting; at worst, it sounds like the beginning of being put out to grass. Given how so many older workers are currently treated by their employers, such suspicions are hardly surprising. “They say that 50 is the new 40, but to the world of work – my kind of work anyway – 50 may as well be 60 or 70 or 80. As a matter of urgency, I need to get younger, not older. It’s a question of survival.” So says Kate Reddy, the heroine of Allison Pearson’s new novel How Hard Can It Be?, of her return to the City after a career break. The book is the long-awaited sequel to I Don’t Know How She Does It, Pearson’s noughties novel about a high-flying City mother torn between work and home. It finds our now middle-aged heroine staring down the barrel of the menopause and regretting her decision at the end of the first novel to quit banking and spend more time with her children. It may have seemed the best way to save her sanity at the time, but now the kids are grumpy teenagers, her husband isn’t earning and the mortgage needs paying. So Kate lies about her age, falsifies her CV and just about scrapes back into the City in a position several rungs below her old one, where she worries constantly about giving herself away by her cultural references and seethes at taking orders from a condescending younger man whose job she could do rather better than he can. If the first Kate Reddy novel sold millions by tapping into exhausted women’s fantasies about giving up work, this one taps into a different but equally powerful fantasy; the burning desire of older women who have taken a career break to be given a second chance, and the longing not to be written off or rendered invisible. Funny as it’s intended to be, there is anger pulsing beneath the book’s surface, and it’s an anger shared by many underappreciated fiftysomethings in the workplace. For, like the first book, this one is a fictionalised account of a very real problem. When Pearson’s first book came out, sexism in the City was all over the headlines, thanks to a string of lurid employment tribunal cases. But now it’s ageism that increasingly keeps the lawyers busy, in an industry where, traditionally, traders who hadn’t made enough money to retire in their early 40s were seen as having failed. Even outside the notoriously dog-eat-dog world of the Square Mile, meanwhile, a study carried out for the last Labour government by the peer Baroness Altmann identified a tacit consensus in corporate life that men were no longer considered for career progression over 55, while women were deemed to have reached their professional sell-by date a decade earlier – although even that would be pushing it in the aggressively youthful culture pervading many of the BBC’s new tech industry rivals. In Silicon Valley, Purnell himself would be considered rather long in the tooth at 47. No wonder so many veterans in the tech industry admit to constantly looking over their shoulders, intensifying their gym regime, even sneaking in a little cosmetic surgery. It’s professionally dangerous not to conform to the youthful, fresh-out-of-college vibe associated with start-ups, or to demonstrate too much battle-hardened experience when arguing that this week’s crazy blue-sky idea won’t actually work. Nobody can afford to be seen as intellectually staid or conservative in an industry that prides itself on being constantly disruptive, innovative, bursting with youthful impatience; “move fast, break things” is not a mantra for anyone old enough to start questioning the value of breaking everything. As the technological revolution gathers pace, the over-40s in many other industries will probably have to adjust to the same rapid, sometimes bewildering, pace of change. Reverse mentoring is probably a damn sight kinder than some of the alternatives for those struggling to adjust – and done with tact, generosity and open minds on both sides, it could be part of the solution. But it’s not a substitute for treating the over-50s with the respect they deserve, and it won’t reach its full potential unless employers first gain their older workers’ trust. If old dogs sometimes growl, it may only be because they have good memories."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/21/entire-towns-in-mexico-flattened-as-scale-of-earthquake-damage-emerges","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-21T18:17:49Z","webTitle":"Entire towns in Mexico flattened as scale of earthquake damage emerges","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/21/entire-towns-in-mexico-flattened-as-scale-of-earthquake-damage-emerges","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/21/entire-towns-in-mexico-flattened-as-scale-of-earthquake-damage-emerges","fields":{"headline":"Entire towns in Mexico flattened as scale of earthquake damage emerges","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Hopes that rescuers will find more survivors trapped beneath collapsed buildings in central Mexico were fading on Thursday, as the scale of the devastation wreaked by the country’s deadliest earthquake for a generation started to become clear. The death toll from Tuesday’s 7.1 magnitude quake rose to 282, including at least 137 in the capital, and was almost certainly set to rise as rescue workers continue to search the precarious ruins amid the threat of aftershocks, collapsing rubble and gas leaks. Parts of Mexico City – which is built on a drained lakebed – were devastated in the quake which struck 32 years to the day after the country’s deadliest earthquake killed thousands and laid waste to the capital. But details of the destruction outside the capital are only now starting to emerge, with reports of entire towns flattened and thousands of people left homeless. Directly south of Mexico City in Morelos state, the death toll stands at 73. The damage was especially acute in the municipality of Jojutla, where houses were reduced to rubble. “Jojutla is damaged badly, but there are communities that have suffered the same or worse,” said Óscar Cruz, a spokesman with the local Catholic diocese, who added all 89 Catholic parishes in the state suffered damage. “What’s tragic is that the damage is worst in the poorest pueblos.” The office of president Enrique Peña Nieto said there were also 73 deaths in Morelos state, 43 in Puebla, 13 in the State of Mexico, six in Guerrero and one in Oaxaca. In Puebla state, authorities have declared a state of “extraordinary emergency” in 112 municipalities – equivalent to 51% of the region. At least 1,700 homes have been declared uninhabitable and should be demolished over coming months, according to the state governor. The number could well rise after experts finish more exhaustive inspections. In Metepec, a quaint colonial town, almost every house and business has suffered structural damage, raising fears among residents that the rebuild could take years. Calls for urgent help and supplies in towns and communities outside the capital continue to be posted on social networks as official rescue and relief efforts struggle to cope with the widespread destruction. Hopes that survivors could still be found were boosted by round-the-clock coverage of the navy-led search for a 12-year-old girl believed to be trapped under a collapsed school in the south of Mexico City. In the hours after the quake struck, 11 children were rescued from the Enrique Rebsámen school, but 21 children and five adults have been found dead so far. For two days, the country was captivated by the story of the girl, identified as Frida Sofía, as TV networks and authorities repeatedly reported that her rescue was imminent. But as the hours passed without progress, confusion and anger mounted amid contradictory reports from the scene; critics accused the country’s main broadcasters of peddling false hope and neglecting the rest of the quake’s victims. On Thursday the navy announced that in fact there was no child under the rubble, but the rescue mission would continue as an adult survivor could still be trapped. There was also growing anger at alleged attempts by the armed forces, which have taken over many of the rescue operations initially led by volunteers, and had started to raze collapsed buildings less than 72 hours after the earthquake – prompting fears that they could destroy buildings where survivors remained trapped. In the trendy La Roma neighbourhood, the navy reportedly shut down a rescue operation in an office block on Thursday morning in order to start bulldozing the unstable structure from which 24 survivors had been pulled free. The sobbing mother of one young woman trapped inside told Televisa “I will not let the navy bulldoze this building when my daughter and other people are still trapped inside and could be alive.” Reports of clashes between volunteer rescue workers and the armed forces are also surfacing across the capital. “The army has a history of imposing brutal triage rules for natural disasters which dates back to the 1985 earthquake,” said public policy analyst Rodolfo Soriano Nuñez. “They might get away with this arrogant approach in Oaxaca or Chiapas, but not in Mexico City.” As cracks started to show in what has been until now lauded as a unified national response, extraordinary tales of survival continue to lift spirits. Ashley Skoch, 29, was lying in bed watching TV on the sixth floor of a seven-storey apartment block in La Condesa that was toppled by the tremor. Skoch, from Seattle, arrived in the city a few hours before the earthquake struck to visit a friend who had lived in the building for two years. She jumped up and ducked at the foot of the bed as the walls began to crack and the building “slid down like a layer cake”, she told the Guardian. It almost certainly saved her life. “When I came to, my head was bleeding, a giant pillar had fallen onto the bed but I wasn’t trapped and could move my body. I was in shock but I put on my pants, grabbed my backpack and laptop and got myself out of the rubble and sat down.” Nearby construction workers rushed to the scene of the collapsed building and used a crane to lift her to the ground. By this time, Skoch could barely stand, so a man carried her down the road and tried to stop the bleeding until an ambulance arrived and took her to a clinic, from where she was able to contact her friend. Skoch sustained a compound fracture to the spine, but should make a full recovery. “I feel lucky, but can’t make sense of why I survived when so many others died or are still missing.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/sep/22/womens-super-league-1-new-season-expectations","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-22T07:00:40Z","webTitle":"Women's Super League kick-off: great expectations bring extra pressure | Paul MacInnes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/sep/22/womens-super-league-1-new-season-expectations","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/sep/22/womens-super-league-1-new-season-expectations","fields":{"headline":"Women's Super League kick-off: great expectations bring extra pressure","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The Great Hall at Wembley Stadium is full of the best of the Women’s Super League. They are mooching around, waiting to pass from one camera set-up to the next. Dressed in full kit they will pose for pictures, conduct interviews and record those odd video snippets that illustrate the lineups on TV. It is busy but also expectant, like being backstage before the start of the headline act. The Super League begins on Friday with an air of expectation. A new calendar, known as the winter season, will be the first in sync with its male equivalent till May. The 10 clubs in the top division, WSL 1, will compete for the title and Champions League qualification, as well as to avoid relegation. Players have been recruited from Europe and they will join home nations players better known by the public than any of their predecessors. More than four million watched England’s European Championship semi-final against Holland. There is the hope, but also the pressure, of bringing more of that attention to the domestic game. Steph Houghton, the England and Manchester City captain, lifted the WSL1 trophy in its last summer season. She raised the Continental Cup and FA Women’s Cup to boot, for a clean sweep of domestic titles. She accepts her challenge is not just on the pitch but to get more people to watch her play; on TV, but more importantly in the stadium. “For four million people to watch us against Holland was fantastic news,” she says. “You’re in a bit of a bubble when you’re at the Euros. Then you get back and speak to people you’ve never met before and they say: ‘Well done. We stayed up and watched you.’ I usually say: ‘Well, come and watch us in person, it’s a bit different.’ Over the past few years, especially at City, the crowds have increased. People come and then they bring friends who bring their friends. “The technical ability of the girls, how much they love the game and really wear their hearts on their sleeves, that’s quite refreshing for a lot of people. The aim of the WSL has always been to try to get better every single year, whether that’s the standard, the people coming to watch us, or the consistency of fixtures, which we probably missed out on the last few years. I’m really excited about the new season.” City Women played in front of an average crowd of 2,249 last season. The team’s needs are fully met by the lavish facilities of Manchester’s Etihad Campus. Houghton reflects on how far removed it is from her roots as a Sunderland youth player – “my dad had to pay subs for us and I used to get hand-me-down kits. I’d never have imagined the life that I live now” – but such a disparity remains between the haves and the have-nots in the WSL. The average league attendance in 2016 was 1,128 and three clubs had their crowds shrink. Four clubs are fully professional: City, Chelsea, Arsenal and Liverpool. New plans from the FA aim to create an entirely professional division by this time next year. It will be another step change and one that will be beyond some clubs and put undue strain on the finances of others. Even Arsenal are feeling status envy with the rise of City and Chelsea. Arsenal, perennial Cup winners when it was the most prestigious tournament in the women’s game, have fallen back in the WSL era. The manager, Pedro Martínez Losa, has looked to rectify this in the summer, signing Vivianne Miedema, who scored against England in the semi-final and twice in the final at the Euros for Holland, to play up front alongside the Golden Boot winner, Jodie Taylor. In defence they have added Sweden’s Jessica Samuelsson and re-signed the German centre-half Josephine Henning from Lyon. In the middle will be the enduring figure of Jordan Nobbs, her dynamism made her one of England’s outstanding players this summer. “I’m lucky enough to have been in a successful Arsenal team and third is disappointing for us,” she says. “We want to be winning trophies this year and we need to be winning them, so we’ve also brought winners into our squad. Our frontline is frightening so Pedro has got a tough ask of fitting them all in. At the moment our competitive side is definitely at its fullest. Hopefully, that’s going to help with our performance.” Nobbs, like Houghton, has hopes for the broader success of the women’s game but she retains perspective about the size of the challenge in transforming it from a minor sport to one that can maintain the attention of the mainstream. “It’s the responsibility of us as players, our clubs and the media,” she says. “The more we get them working together, pushing our games, showing our games, being good role models. We all need to encourage that. The more the media can push our game, and push us in a good light, then it’s going to be better for us. “To be honest if I look back seven years I would never have said we’d be where we are today. So it’s a tough ask but I’ve learned that anything can happen.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"culture/ng-interactive/2017/sep/24/simone-lia-on-lost-items","type":"interactive","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-24T07:00:38Z","webTitle":"Simone Lia on lost items","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/ng-interactive/2017/sep/24/simone-lia-on-lost-items","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/ng-interactive/2017/sep/24/simone-lia-on-lost-items","fields":{"headline":"Simone Lia on lost items","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/sep/22/eric-abetz-abbott-incident-foretaste-marriage-debate-violence","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-22T02:33:22Z","webTitle":"'Disgraceful': Malcolm Turnbull condemns alleged head-butt on Abbott","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/sep/22/eric-abetz-abbott-incident-foretaste-marriage-debate-violence","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/sep/22/eric-abetz-abbott-incident-foretaste-marriage-debate-violence","fields":{"headline":"'Disgraceful': Malcolm Turnbull condemns alleged head-butt on Abbott","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Malcolm Turnbull has condemned an alleged head-butt of Tony Abbott by a marriage equality supporter but says the incident is one of “a relatively small number” of such cases in the postal survey campaign. Speaking to 3AW Radio on Friday, Turnbull said it was “a disgraceful incident” and urged calm after what he said amounted to an assault of the former prime minister. “Any violence coming into our political life is absolutely to be condemned,” he said. The Tasmanian senator Eric Abetz has claimed that the alleged incident is a “harbinger” of more violence, despite conceding it is not indicative of the yes campaign generally. Marriage equality supporters have been quick to condemn the incident and denounce political violence but opponents have used it to rally against same-sex marriage. Turnbull said Australia had a tradition of respectful political debate “sometimes with strong views expressed, but without violence”. “This is one of a number, a relatively small number of incidents, but any one is one too many.” Turnbull said “of course” the incident did not undermine the yes case generally, but campaigners should recognise that if they used violent or abusive language or engaged in “violent conduct”, they were not helping their case. He urged everyone participating in the marriage equality debate to “exercise calm and restraint” and said that “overwhelmingly” Australians had engaged in the debate respectfully. At a media conference in Hobart on Friday, Abbott said Australia had “come to a pretty sorry pass” if you could not oppose same-sex marriage without being head-butted. “This is one of the many reasons I say we should think long and hard before going down this path,” he said. Abbott said there was “no doubt there has been some ugliness as part of this debate, but I regret to say that nearly all of it seems to becoming from one side and that is the people who tell us that love is love”. In the past two weeks there have been reports that a Burnie cafe was threatened with arson, a 14-year-old Dubbo girl received a death threat and Kevin Rudd’s godson was bashed, all for supporting marriage equality. On Friday Abetz told ABC News Breakfast the incident highlighted “the ugliness of the yes campaign” and demonstrated that the slogan “love is love” was “unfortunately shown in practice to be intolerance, not wanting people to be able to have their point of view”. Abetz said Abbott had a swollen lip “for a short while” but “was in very fine form” at dinner later that evening. “He will continue to campaign for the no vote, unabated.” Asked if the incident was out of character with the yes campaign, Abetz conceded: “I think we can all agree with that.” But he said intolerance in the debate had “overwhelmingly been one-way traffic”. “[This] is just a bit of a foretaste of what will come should the yes campaigners feel even more empowered in the event that they were successful with the vote ... This is just a bit of a harbinger of what is likely to occur.” The Australian Marriage Equality co-chair Alex Greenwich said the Equality Campaign “condemns the violence against Tony Abbott that has been reported”. “There is never a place for violence or abuse. Marriage equality is about respect and dignity for every Australian. There is no room for any disrespect either physical or verbal in this national debate.” Greenwich said the yes campaign “has always and will continue to call for respect and everyone involved in this debate to act in a respectful and dignified way”. The Tasmanians United for Marriage Equality spokesman, Rodney Croome, urged yes and no supporters “to act with respect and restraint because, when this postal survey is over, we will still have to live together, side by side, as Australians”. Croome condemned the alleged attack as “beneath contempt” but said the yes campaign could not be “judged on the basis of the delinquency of one person whose only link to the yes campaign was wearing a badge”. Abbott first told the story to Steve Price and the Sky News host Andrew Bolt on Melbourne’s 3AW radio on Thursday. “I was walking from the Mercury office across that docks area, that beautiful docks area in Hobart, towards my hotel,” Abbott said. “A fellow sung out at me, ‘Hey Tony!’ I turned around, there was a chap wearing a vote yes badge. He says, ‘I wanna shake your hand.’ I went over to shake his hand and then he head-butted me. “Now he wasn’t very good at it, I’ve got to say, but he did make contact. The only damage was a very, very slightly swollen lip. “I was with a member of my staff [who] briefly grappled with this guy, and he then ran off swearing his head off.” A spokesman for Abbott said the staffer present had “sought to restrain the perpetrator after he assaulted Mr Abbott”. “The Australian federal police were notified as soon as the incident occurred and both he and Mr Abbott have given statements to Tasmania police.” Turnbull said it was “very important that the assailant is identified and charged”. At a media conference, a police commander, Tony Cerritelli, said the alleged attacker was described as about 40 years old, of medium build, between five feet nine inches and five feet 11 inches tall, with “short, spiky, sandy-strawberry” coloured hair and nose and ear piercings. He was said to be wearing a black leather jacket, possibly an army green-coloured shirt, and a “vote yes” badge. He was probably with another man who was not involved in the attack. Cerritelli said police were investigating whether there was CCTV footage. The Hobart docks area is covered by several cameras. Asked if he expected an arrest by the end of the day, he said: “I’m very confident that we will have a resolution.” The commander said detectives had contacted Abbott had last night after becoming aware of the alleged assault via the media. Abbott then made a police statement. He was unclear if the attack had been reported to the Australian federal police before Tasmania police contacted the former prime minister. “We treat this type of event as any other event … while it is a high-profile matter, we need to make sure the evidentiary requirements and procedural requirements are adhered to,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/live/2017/sep/21/facebook-congress-russia-ads-the-politics-minute","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-21T21:52:25Z","webTitle":"Facebook gets friendlier with Congress on Russia ads | The Minute","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2017/sep/21/facebook-congress-russia-ads-the-politics-minute","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/live/2017/sep/21/facebook-congress-russia-ads-the-politics-minute","fields":{"headline":"Facebook gets friendlier with Congress on Russia ads","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Facebook will provide to Congress the contents of 3,000 advertisements purchased by Russians during the 2016 US presidential race, says Mark Zuckerberg, amid scrutiny of the social network’s potential role in influencing elections.

In some cases there were things that I did that until someone brought it up, I said, ‘Gosh, I didn’t realize that was a mistake, I’m sorry about that.’ But to watch some of the personal attacks, questioning my integrity, questioning what my intentions were, I think were really over the top. – Sean Spicer, who lied about Trump’s inauguration crowd A new analysis shared exclusively with the Guardian has found that 80% of nominations for top jobs in the Trump administration have gone to men – putting Trump on track to assemble the most male-dominated federal government in nearly a quarter-century.

Prime minister Roosevelt Skerrit said on Thursday afternoon it was a “miracle” the death toll wasn’t in the hundreds. He said Dominica “is going to need all the help the world has to offer”. Hartley Henry, an adviser to the prime minister, said there had been a “tremendous loss of housing and public buildings”. Tourism minister Robert Tonge said the island’s capital, Roseau, still had severe flooding. He said the hospital and a community center both lost roofs. One of two airports serving the country is out of action; the other is expected to be working in the coming days. An estimated 95% of the roofs were blown off in some towns, including Mahaut and Portsmouth. There are at least nine communities that no one has any information about because they’re cut off and most communications are down in the country. Puerto Rico As of Thursday afternoon, the electricity service was completely out, the water system was shut off to 70% of customers, and the telecommunications infrastructure was barely functioning. Governor Ricardo Rossello said the only known death was a man struck by a piece of wood blown by the wind, but the death toll was expected to rise as reports come in from outlying areas. The White House on Thursday morning declared Puerto Rico “a major disaster” zone and ordered federal assistance to be directed to dozens of municipalities in the territory. To check on residents of Puerto Rico, you can reach Puerto Rico’s Federal Affairs Administration at 1-202-778-0710 or maria1@prfaa.pr.gov Turks and Caicos Residents were preparing for Maria to hit the islands on Thursday. All travel to and from the islands has been suspended and lines of communication are expected to be lost within the next 12 hours. “Right now, Turks and Caicos is in recovery mode from Hurricane Irma. We are not stable enough to cope with even a mild storm. There is lots of loose debris from Irma, which poses a huge risk,” said Sophie Newstead, press secretary for Hurricane Irma Relief Turks and Caicos (HIRTAC), one of the relief charities working on the islands. The damage caused by Hurricane Irma is preventing relief agencies like Hirtac from accessing areas most affected by the storm, including South Caicos, where some areas are almost totally destroyed. Local supermarkets are providing free meals to residents, and teams of local volunteers are assisting in clean-up efforts and helping preparations for Maria. Virgin Islands The British and the US Virgin Islands were still reeling from the impact of Hurricane Irma when Maria passed through. The White House has declared the US Virgin Islands a disaster zone and ordered assistance be sent there. At the BVI National Emergency Operations Center, the consensus was that the region had been lucky. On Wednesday, the island’s premier, Orlando Smith, said: “Last night we were fortunate, thank God, that the effects of Hurricane Maria were not nearly as severe as Hurricane Irma. There were very high gusts, but as far as I can determine, there was not a lot of more damage over the territory as a whole, and so far no major casualties have been reported, either. There were large storm surges on the western end of the islands but on the whole we have been lucky.” Montserrat As of Wednesday afternoon, electricity was out across the island and only essential vehicles were allowed on the roads, many of which were blocked by downed trees and power lines. Government offices in Montserrat will open on Friday and teachers are due in school that day to prepare for the resumption of classes the following Monday. Updates are being posted on the government’s official media Facebook page Guadeloupe At least two people died and two were missing on the French island. “Almost all the banana plantations on the island have been affected,” prime minister Edouard Philippe said after an inter-ministerial meeting. “Production has totally stopped.” St Kitts &amp; Nevis The eye of Hurricane Maria passed to the south of the islands on Monday and heavy winds damaged homes and businesses. Citizens had a national cleanup day on Wednesday to work through the debris. The airport is open as normal. “We are deeply appreciative that again we have been spared the third hurricane in succession,” said prime minister Timothy Harris. Dominican Republic The president of the hotel association in the Dominican Republic says Hurricane Maria did not inflict any damage to the county’s tourism infrastructure. Joel Santos said that assessment includes Punta Cana on the eastern tip of the country. That was the area closest to the eye when the storm passed on its way toward the Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands to the north. The government evacuated more than 4,000 tourists to the capital of Santo Domingo. The meteorological service said on Thursday that rain from the storm will continue in the Dominican Republic for the next two days for a total of around 19in."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2017/sep/24/what-happened-by-hillary-rodham-clinton-digested-read","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-24T16:00:49Z","webTitle":"What Happened by Hillary Rodham Clinton – digested read","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/sep/24/what-happened-by-hillary-rodham-clinton-digested-read","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/sep/24/what-happened-by-hillary-rodham-clinton-digested-read","fields":{"headline":"What Happened by Hillary Rodham Clinton – digested read","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"What happened? I wish I knew for certain. What I can say is that I absolutely gave it my best shot and that I couldn’t have had a wiser team around me. When I shed a tear as I waited in line at President Trump’s inauguration, it wasn’t for me. It was also for all the people in America who would have to live with that man as their leader. I won’t deny that the six months since I lost the election have been some of the toughest of my life. But I’ve gotten by a day at a time thanks to the love of my husband, Bill, the support of close friends, such as Sheryl Sandberg, and the knowledge that I won the popular vote. I’ve learned to concentrate on taking pleasure from the little things. Like my daily yoga practice and buying a farm in upstate New York. In particular I find alternate breathing through each nostril helps me centre myself. It sounds hard but it gets easier with practice: you breathe in through one nostril in one of your homes, then get in the car and breathe in through the other in another. Friends have asked me why I did it, why I agreed to run for president. To tell the truth, I had no option. I knew that many people didn’t like me. And I knew that it would be hard to defend Barack Obama’s desperately poor record in office. But I had to do it. All my life I’ve never wanted to do anything other than serve my country. And be president. And in a way I am president because I did win the popular vote. Yet unfortunately, even though I won, I lost. And I take full responsibility for everything that went wrong apart from those things that were other people’s fault. When I think back on my campaign I can’t think of anything I would have done differently apart from those things that I might have done differently. Everything from the two stylists who did my hair every morning while I was eating scrambled egg whites to ringing Bill at night to tell him how much I loved him and was grateful for his support was just perfect. We also had the best ever campaign slogan in Stronger Together. I loved that slogan because it said everything I wanted to say. Though maybe it should have been Together Stronger. Just as we are together stronger, we are also stronger together. Now let me tell you a little bit about me. I’m a woman. I know many people found that hard to accept. But I’m proud of being a woman. More than being a woman, I am also a Mom, a wife, a daughter and a grandmother. There’s nothing I adore more than being a Mom. Apart from being a wife, a daughter and a grandmother. There’s also nothing I adore more than being a grandmother. Apart from … (can someone edit this bit for me as my stylist has just turned up). It was an honour and privilege to serve the American people by meeting them out on the campaign trail. Perhaps I should have heeded my team’s advice and not stopped so long to talk to people. But when I see a poor black girl crying in the rain because she’s been told to wait for hours to see me, my heart just yearns to reach out. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not blaming anyone but me for losing the presidency. Even though I did win the popular vote. Did I mention that? And yes, I can’t deny that it was a bit bone-headed of me to use my private email for state business, but it was a mistake anyone could have made if they hadn’t read the rules. Besides, none of them were in the least incriminating; 20,000 were to my assistant asking her to use the fax machine as I couldn’t cope with email. And the other 10,000 were to Bill telling him how much I loved him and that I wasn’t still angry about Monica. Yes, losing the election was all on me. But don’t forget the Russians; they were in it up to their neck. As was James Comey the head of the FBI. But I can do no more. My race is run. All that is left to me is to gently weep bitter tears of sorrow while praying for the future of American democracy under that complete orange slimeball douchebag. Breathe in through alternate nostrils. And relax.

Kimmel is rapidly emerging as the unlikely leader of the counter-crusade to save the ACA, widely known as Obamacare, from Republican efforts to repeal and replace the health insurance system. After Kimmel accused Bill Cassidy, a Republican from Louisiana, of having “lied to my face” about his position on healthcare, Cassidy, a medical doctor who worked in a public hospital with low-income and uninsured patients, went public to say Kimmel did not understand the bill. But Kimmel, joking that he did not want to turn their war of words into a“Kanye-and-Taylor-Swift-type situation”, refused to back down. “Which part don’t I understand?” Kimmel countered, in a 10-minute rebuttal. “The part where you cut $243bn dollars from federal healthcare assistance? Am I not understanding the part where states would let insurance companies price you out of coverage for having pre-existing conditions? “Could it be, Senator Cassidy, that the problem is that I do understand and you got caught with your G-O-Penis out? Is that possible?” Cassidy, and his co-author, Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, are rallying Republican senators around a last-gasp effort to repeal the ACA and replace it with legislation that largely shifts money away from states that opted to expand Medicaid coverage to states where Republican governors refused to do so. Republican leaders in the Senate have announced that they will push for a vote early next week, although full details and implications of the bill are not clear. Unlike many of his fellow late-night hosts, including Stephen Colbert, Samantha Bee and Trevor Noah, who feast off the chaos and controversy in a Trump-era Washington, Kimmel had been considered less likely to dive into the political fray. But as host of the Academy Awards in February, Kimmel trained a blistering opening monologue on Trump. And in May, he revealed in a tearful speech that his son, Billy, had been born with a heart defect and nearly died. Kimmel said that thanks to the top-of-the-line healthcare, his surgery was successful. In that 13-minute May speech, Kimmel implored Republicans to back off their effort to repeal Barack Obama’s healthcare law, which has helped nearly 20 million Americans gain health insurance. “We were brought up to believe that we live in the greatest country in the world, but until a few years ago, millions and millions of us had no access to health insurance at all,” Kimmel said. “Before 2014, if you were born with congenital heart disease like my son was, there was a good chance you’d never be able to get health insurance because you had a pre-existing condition. You were born with a pre-existing condition. And if your parents didn’t have medical insurance, you might not live long enough to even get denied because of a pre-existing condition.” Cassidy heard Kimmel’s plea to Republicans – who were deliberating over an earlier version of ACA repeal – and established what he called “Jimmy Kimmel test” – that no family should be denied medical care because they could not afford it. “Does it pass the Jimmy Kimmel test?” Cassidy told reporters on Capitol Hill when pressed on the details of the Republican healthcare plan. On CNN, Cassidy referred specifically to Kimmel’s son’s medical history: “Will a child born with a congenital heart disease get everything she or he would need in the first year of life?” Cassidy then appeared on Kimmel’s show and agreed that he would apply the Jimmy Kimmel test. But Cassidy ended up voting in favor of a doomed effort that would have repealed parts of the healthcare law. Two months after that legislation failed, falling one vote short in the Senate, Cassidy has helped revive Republicans seven-year campaign to dismantle the healthcare law in time for one last try before the vehicle to repeal it on a party-line vote expires at the end of the month. As their effort started to gain momentum on Capitol Hill this week, Kimmel again stepped in with another lengthy monologue on Tuesday. “We want quality, affordable healthcare. Dozens of other countries figured it out. So instead of jamming this horrible bill down our throats, go pitch in and be a part of that. I’m sure they could use a guy with your medical background,” Kimmel said. “And if not, stop using my name, OK? Because I don’t want my name on it. There’s a new Jimmy Kimmel test for you. It’s called the lie-detector test. You’re welcome to stop by the studio and take it anytime.” Cassidy responded to Kimmel on Wednesday and said: “I’m sorry he does not understand … Everybody fears change,” Cassidy said. “Even if it’s worse to better, they don’t want change.” And on Capitol Hill, Graham, Cassidy’s co-sponsor, lost his patience when a reporter pointed out that states would be able to opt out of covering pre-existing conditions. “Where are you getting this garbage? Where are you getting this garbage?” Graham told NBC News. “That’s complete garbage.” Graham said Kimmel “heard some liberal talking points” about the bill and “bought it hook, line and sinker”. In a sign of Kimmel’s impact on the debate, Donald Trump defended Cassidy and the bill on Twitter. The president called Cassidy a “class act” and said he wouldn’t lie. “Senator (Doctor) Bill Cassidy is a class act who really cares about people and their health(care), he doesn’t lie – just wants to help people!” Trump tweeted. The president also said he would not sign Graham-Cassidy into law if it did not protect people with pre-existing conditions from being charged more by insurers. But analysts and fact checkers have repeatedly disputed this assessment, largely siding with Kimmel. In the debate over who might lose insurance protections, the Associated Press fact checker reported, “the TV guy is the hardest to refute”. As the healthcare debate ticks closer to the 30 September deadline, Kimmel’s impact is uncertain. In an August interview, Kimmel said he thought his advocacy had swayed some viewers – but he doubted whether it changed any hearts or minds on Capitol Hill given how narrowly the bill failed in July. “I think it made a big impact on American citizens,” Kimmel told the Hollywood Reporter. “I’m not sure, based on how our so-called leaders voted, whether it made a big impact on the Senate or House.” Kimmel on Wednesday implored viewers who were concerned about losing healthcare under the latest repeal attempt to call one of several Republican senators who have not publicly made up their minds on the legislation. Karina Peterson, a spokeswoman for Alaska senator Lisa Murkowski, who could determine the fate of the bill, said she did not have any numbers to share on the number of calls her office had received. But she said: “It’s fair to say people are very engaged on the issue of healthcare.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/22/tories-dup-hurricane-boris-johnson-theresa-may-caribbean","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-22T10:30:22Z","webTitle":"The Tories found £1bn for the DUP.

But they won’t help our hurricane-hit islands","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Hurricane Maria is fast approaching the British territory of Turks and Caicos, while thousands of people in British overseas territories continue to struggle with Hurricane Irma’s fallout. They have yet to hear the government’s long-term plan to provide the support and funds they will need to rebuild their communities. These are national disasters in British territories, but the government is not living up to its responsibility for dealing with the outcomes, as it would for a disaster on British soil. The Tories found £1bn for the DUP. But for those who have had their homes destroyed and their world turned upside down, resources are supposedly scanty. The government should be finding seed funding from across Whitehall and using it to leverage extra private investment. And it should finally be helping these territories to diversify their economies away from tax havens for corporations and the super-rich. Instead, Boris Johnson and Theresa May chose last week to use this opportunity to once again attack the UK’s aid budget. They said they were frustrated that Britain cannot spend aid ringfenced for the poorest countries on wealthier British overseas territories. The foreign secretary and prime minister know that repurposing the 0.7% of our gross national income that we spend on official development assistance (ODA) towards British territories would have a detrimental impact. It would divert crucial aid that is currently saving millions of lives in conflict and crisis situations, helping millions of children attend school, combatting curable diseases and tackling gender-based violence. Their proposal would take vital support away from some of the world’s most vulnerable and deprived people, and threaten the stability of some of the most fragile countries. And it would undermine international development assistance as we know it, subverting its central principle to support the world’s poorest countries. It would make a mockery of the UK’s hard-earned reputation as a global leader in international development. The right-wing media and Tory politicians peddle the myth that the ODA rules defy common sense, imposed on us by international institutions. But these rules are robust. They make sure aid goes where it’s most needed and that citizens in donor countries can trust that their taxes aren’t being misused. The rules have been agreed internationally and updated over many years, and are based on experience of what works. And the UK, as a significant global donor, has played a key role in shaping what they look like. This week Guy Hewitt, the Barbados high commissioner, reminded us that international development assistance is far from perfect, and that more support is needed for small islands. But this is very different from the dangerous argument put forward by Johnson and May. They know that ripping up the rulebook is a promise they can’t deliver. As for Priti Patel, the secretary of state for international development has never actually articulated what specifically she disagrees with in the existing rules, or what she would seek to change. The government must rule out lobbying for development assistance to be spent on wealthy countries or in British territory. Instead of treating Irma and aid rules as political footballs and making more promises to the British public that can’t be kept, it is time to get on with the business of governing properly: they must present an ambitious, resourced plan for the overseas territories’ recovery, but without re-purposing ODA. Last week we heard harrowing accounts from people in Anguilla and the British Virgin Islands asking where the support was from the British government – a government that has the responsibility for protecting these territories. As Hurricane Maria starts to hit British territories, and will possibly affect the same, already battered, countries, the government must quickly go beyond the initial emergency response and find the long-term resources needed – without threatening to take it away from the poorest and most vulnerable parts of the world. Labour has promised to fight for the spirit, as well as the letter, of our 0.7% pledge, and we will continue to do so. If the Tories abandon the essence of that pledge, history will judge them accordingly. • Kate Osamor is shadow secretary of state for international development"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"technology/2017/sep/21/instagram-death-threat-facebook-olivia-solon","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-21T21:04:07Z","webTitle":"Instagram uses 'I will rape you' post as Facebook ad in latest algorithm mishap","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/sep/21/instagram-death-threat-facebook-olivia-solon","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/sep/21/instagram-death-threat-facebook-olivia-solon","fields":{"headline":"Instagram uses 'I will rape you' post as Facebook ad in latest algorithm mishap","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Instagram used a user’s image which included the text “I will rape you before I kill you, you filthy whore!” to advertise its service on Facebook, the latest example of social media algorithms boosting offensive content. Guardian reporter Olivia Solon recently discovered that Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, made an advertisement out of a photo she had posted of a violent threat she received in an email, which said “Olivia, you fucking bitch!!!!!!!” and “I Will Rape You”. Instagram selected the screenshot, which she posted nearly a year ago, to advertise the photo-sharing platform to Solon’s sister this week, with the message, “See Olivia Solon’s photo and posts from friends on Instagram”. The ad has surfaced at a time when Facebook is facing intense scrutiny over the ethical failings of its algorithms and advertising tools. Last week, ProPublica reported that Facebook was allowing advertisers to target users interested in the topic of “Jew hater” and “How to burn Jews” – categories that the social media site had automatically created. Journalists were able to pay $30 to target “promoted posts” to the antisemitic groups. Others quickly discovered that there was a range of bigoted and derogatory terms that Facebook allowed for ad targeting and that Google and Twitter had similar problems. Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg issued a mea culpa on Wednesday and said the company was changing its policies as a result. Facebook disabled the targeting system that created the offensive categories, and Sandberg said the site would only allow targeting options reviewed by humans in the future. It’s unclear why Instagram chose to highlight Solon’s hate mail to friends on Facebook. When she posted the screenshot last year, she wrote: “This is an email I received this afternoon. Sadly this is all too common for women on the internet. I am sure this is just an idiot rather than any kind of credible threat but it’s still pretty vile.” The photo received three likes and more than a dozen sympathetic comments. It’s possible that Instagram’s algorithm considered it an “engaging” post because of the number of responses. But given existing technology that can analyze words embedded in images, it’s unclear if Instagram has any systems in place that would detect the violent and abusive text and flag it as an inappropriate choice for an ad. An Instagram spokesperson apologized and claimed that the image was not used in a “paid promotion”. “We are sorry this happened – it’s not the experience we want someone to have,” the statement said. “This notification post was surfaced as part of an effort to encourage engagement on Instagram. Posts are generally received by a small percentage of a person’s Facebook friends.” The spokesperson said these types of posts were designed to motivate people who aren’t on Instagram or hadn’t been on the site recently to visit the platform by showing them content from their friends. The company did not answer questions about how widely the post was shared, but said it would have surfaced to some of Solon’s Facebook friends. Facebook’s algorithms have long faced backlash for inadvertently causing its users pain and harm. In 2014, the company was forced to apologize over its “Year in Review” clips, which created an automated series of posts that highlighted hurtful memories of deceased loved ones and tragic incidents – posts that presumably had a lot of “engagement”. The company’s “On This Day” nostalgia feature, which resurfaces old posts, has faced similar criticisms. Facebook also admitted this month that an influence operation probably based in Russia bought $100,000 worth of ads to promote divisive political messages. On Wednesday, 20 Democratic senators and representatives urged the Federal Election Commission to “develop new guidance for advertising platforms on how to prevent illicit foreign spending in US elections”. Last week, Facebook was also mocked after it sent a ProPublica reporter behind the “Jew hater” investigation an automated email suggesting that she buy an ad to promote her story that exposed Facebook’s embarrassing ad practices."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/sep/25/fighting-the-flu-can-be-a-matter-of-life-and-death-so-what-more-can-we-do","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-24T18:00:00Z","webTitle":"Fighting the flu can be a matter of life and death – so what more can we do?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/sep/25/fighting-the-flu-can-be-a-matter-of-life-and-death-so-what-more-can-we-do","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/sep/25/fighting-the-flu-can-be-a-matter-of-life-and-death-so-what-more-can-we-do","fields":{"headline":"Fighting the flu can be a matter of life and death – so what more can we do?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"As Australia endures one of its worst flu seasons in more than a decade, questions are being raised about how the public can be better prepared and what can be done to protect the most vulnerable. At least 170,000 influenza cases have been confirmed this season, almost two-and-a-half times more than in 2016. The federal health department logged 72 flu-related deaths by Thursday, including that of eight-year-old Rosie Andersen in Melbourne. Experts say Australia is on track for a record number of confirmed cases. Sarah Hawthorn, from the regional town of Cobram in northern Victoria, remains in a critical condition in hospital after contracting the flu late in her pregnancy. After giving birth to a healthy boy, she was placed in an induced coma. Despite tragic cases such as these, the spike in flu cases is a pattern that plays out globally every 10 to 15 years. The difficulty with influenza viruses is that different viruses circulate the population each year that may not be covered by current flu vaccines, and those viruses that are covered can mutate, a phenomenon known as viral drift, making the vaccinations against them less effective. Vaccines also remain effective for only one season. Unlike other vaccines that are more than 95% effective at protecting against a specific disease when a full dose is administered – for example, the chickenpox and polio ones – the flu vaccine is, on average, only 40% protective, although this varies depending on the flu strain. By comparison, staying home from work when suffering the flu, hand-washing, and covering one’s mouth when coughing and sneezing protects against spreading the disease 68% of the time. Leading infectious diseases expert Dr Peter Collignon has called for better identification of patients suffering bacterial infections secondary to the influenza virus. Collignon, a professor of microbiology and a medical doctor, who has worked with the World Health Organisation and as a government adviser, says the rise in the number of cases could also be because laboratory tests to diagnose influenza are improving almost every year. But he says the current peak in cases should not come as a surprise. “The strain we are predominantly seeing this year is influenza A strain H3N2, and this is the same strain that hit last winter in the UK and other European centres and caused problems there,” Collignon says. “What they found in those countries was that the vaccine for H3N2 basically didn’t work and was zero per cent effective for those over 65. So maybe you could say it was predictable we would see similar issues in Australia this season. “The thing is, yes, influenza knocks a lot of people around but most recover, have only mild infections, and some don’t even suffer symptoms. Basically, we need a better vaccine, but that’s tricky because it’s a difficult virus that changes all of the time.” Given the vaccine’s lack of efficacy and mutations of flu strains, Collignon says more research and funding needs to be directed towards identifying those most at risk of dying once they have the flu. While it is well known that pregnant women, those over the age of 65 or in nursing homes, children under five and those with chronic conditions such as heart or lung disease are more susceptible to the flu, Collignon says monitoring these groups alone will not necessarily allow doctors to pinpoint those at risk of death. “The majority of people die not of the influenza but due to secondary bacterial infections,” he says. “Of the children who die after contracting the flu, they find golden staph as a complication in a lot of them. One of the things the flu perversely does is set up the throat to become ripe for bacterial infection. Death seems to especially affect those who got sick, got better, then got sick again.” This is important because these bacterial infections can usually be treated with antibiotics. But routinely treating people with antibiotics without knowing if they have had a bacterial infection, can lead to antibiotic resistance, Collignon says. “Only 1 or 2% of those with flu get these secondary infections, so we must get better at identifying them and identifying them early,” he says. “That’s where we need more research, and education, so that parents know if their child gets sick for a few days from the flu, then seems to get better and then worse, they should get their child treated.” In the case of influenza-related deaths, hospitals should record the course of illness and whether the symptoms seemed to improve for a time, he says. He emphasises the importance of those in higher-risk groups getting the vaccine, including pregnant women, who can get immunised for free under the national immunisation program. “Even 30% or 40% protection against going to hospital is better than nothing,” Collignon says. Australia’s health minister, Greg Hunt, has asked the chief medical officer, Professor Brendan Murphy, to ensure that all aged care workers are properly vaccinated. There is no mandatory requirement for this at present. “I will work with the medical authorities, healthcare workers and the aged care providers on how we can make it compulsory for those working in aged care facilities,” Hunt says. “We cannot continue to have a situation where people whose immunity is already low are at risk from others who may be infected.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}
