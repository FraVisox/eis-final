Guardian readers affected by the banking fiasco have been writing in to share their experiences. Matt from South Wales is on holiday in the Canary Islands and has been unable to pay for goods and services: I arrived on Saturday for a five-night break and this has totally ruined my holiday. My card was declined in a restaurant I went to and I had to walk 50 mins back to my hotel as I didn’t have enough money to pay for a taxi. I tried to contact TSB via email and on the phone but after waiting for 40 minutes I couldn’t wait any longer. I feel for everyone that’s having these problems and I can’t wait to get home to speak to someone in person. They are not keeping their customers updated and they will lose a lot of customers due to this terrible service. How can we trust them after this?” Jules Hawkins, 54, who owns a Bristol-based leather lingerie brand, Lux Tenebrae, has been unable to pay her staff: I’m going to have to pay them out of my First Direct personal account, which will look to HMRC like I’m paying myself a huge amount of money when I eventually manage to reimburse myself. My staff don’t have TSB accounts so why should they have to bear the brunt of this mess by going overdrawn and having to wait to claim back? It’s the end of the month and they have rent and bills to pay. Also, are my automated payments still going out? Did I just pay my tax? Don’t even get me started on trying to input my end-of-year tax return. Angela from Kent is concerned about her upcoming holiday: We are going away on Saturday and can’t transfer money from our savings to buy holiday clothes and travel money. We didn’t bother trying to contact TSB as their phone call waiting time is more than an hour! Mark, 54, from Birmingham was left on hold for three hours after seeing his account was showing in US dollars: My account is showing £40k in arrears against my mortgage and the whole account shows in dollars. I can live with all of that but yesterday my son couldn’t eat as I couldn’t transfer funds to his Parent Pay account. Everybody can have issues but the true measure is how you rectify them. TSB’s contingency has been very poorly thought out and will undoubtedly cost them long-term loyal customers. Jos is on a low income, with no credit cards or savings accounts and is unable to use his debit card: I have £3.14 in my pocket, my wife is disabled and we can’t shop for food. I’ve been able to see my account details twice on the app since Sunday – both times the balance was wrong with credits and debits to the account missing. I have been particularly infuriated by TSB’s claims of “intermittent” problems, which is entirely untrue. Sue Capener, 69, is disabled and lives on her own in Liverpool. She was expecting her online food shop to be delivered but her order was cancelled because of a declined payment: I usually get a shop in on Monday but TSB wouldn’t release the funds. I can’t go out and I have no family to help me. Instead I’m sitting here answering calls about my bills not getting paid. Thankfully my four chihuahuas have enough food for the moment. I also saw the man next door and he was able to get me a loaf of bread from the shop but I’m getting stressed out and I’m at breaking point to be honest. Samantha from Doncaster logged into her account on Monday only to find the account she was looking at was not her own: I could see I had £200 more than I should have. After logging off and then on again I could see the transactions were completely different to mine – one was for WHSmith. I’ve never shopped there in my life. By the evening my accounts had vanished. My council tax was due and they called saying the payment had bounced. Thankfully, when I told them I was with TSB they were fine about it. Luckily I took cash out on Friday but it is disgusting! All I can do is hope that someone is not looking at my account like I was looking at theirs. I tried to call TSB and got an automated person speaking and then the phone went dead. Andrew, a 44-year-old financial company director from Selby has had enough and is looking at moving his accounts: Both my current account and savings accounts are held with TSB and not having access to these funds is both frustrating and very disappointing. Having been a loyal customer for more than 15 years, despite various campaigns from other banks offering better products and services, this latest problem is the final straw and I’ve completed the paperwork to move my accounts to First Direct. I’m optimistic there won’t be any problems with the switch."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/apr/28/childrens-and-teens-roundup-best-new-picture-books-and-novels","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-28T08:00:09Z","webTitle":"Children’s and teens roundup: the best new picture books and novels","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/28/childrens-and-teens-roundup-best-new-picture-books-and-novels","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/apr/28/childrens-and-teens-roundup-best-new-picture-books-and-novels","fields":{"headline":"Children’s and teens roundup: the best new picture books and novels","bodyText":"Unusual titles for eight to 12 are blooming this spring, including Julie Hunt and Dale Newman’s KidGlovz (Allen &amp; Unwin), an Australian graphic novel in the vein of Brian Selznick’s The Invention of Hugo Cabret. KidGlovz is a child prodigy, starved by his showman “uncle” to keep him small. After he is kidnapped and his hand injured, he is abandoned as useless. Can KidGlovz and his friend, the thief Shoestring, survive alone in the wintry mountains – and has Kid lost his heart’s music along with his fingers? Though less nuanced than Selznick’s work, this meandering adventure, with its thought-bubbled, pencil-shaded illustrations, has memorable charm. There is more unconventional storytelling in Kwame Alexander’s verse novel Rebound (Andersen), a prequel to his Newbery-winning The Crossover, which features comic strip daydreams as well as poetry. Chronicling 12-year-old Charlie Bell’s grief at the loss of his father, his banishment to his grandparents’ house and his developing love of basketball, Alexander effortlessly marries rap rhythms with plaintive, passionate and deceptively simple verse. More straightforwardly told, though just as moving, is Boy 87 (Pushkin) by Ele Fountain. This is the story of Shif, a clever, competitive 14-year-old who finds himself summarily imprisoned in a desert camp by the military “giffa”. After losing his dear friend in an attempt to cross the border, he must adapt to hostile new surroundings, and he faces a dangerous, desperate journey to find refuge. Full of tension, fear, heartbreak and hope, it conveys both the bitterness of having family, home and identity stolen away piecemeal, and a courageous determination to survive. For teenagers, Elizabeth Acevedo’s debut The Poet X (Electric Monkey) delivers powerful, finely crafted verse, each poem-chapter blending elegantly with the next. Xiomara, daughter of Dominican parents living in Harlem, is allowed almost no freedom by her devout mother, though she still attracts the attention – often unwanted, occasionally exciting – of men. The most important thing about Xiomara, though, is her unique voice, which she sets free in her poetry. Readers will yearn to finish this verse novel in a single sitting, but its echoes will remain with them much longer. A distinctive voice also narrates The Territory – Truth (Firefly), the culmination of Sarah Govett’s gripping trilogy set in a climate-changed Britain in which only teenagers who pass a rigorous exam earn a place in the safety of the Territory. Noa and her exiled crew have information that could undermine the authorities – but can they break through the gun-turreted electric fence? Dystopian YA is frequently cliche-prone, but Govett’s humorous, unflinching handling of plot and character, particularly her irrepressible protagonist, makes this feel vivid and fresh; the scene in which the rebels force themselves to torture a Territory employee is particularly thought-provoking. A blingy gold cover draws the eye to Juno Dawson’s Clean (Quercus), the foul-mouthed, in-yer-face account of Lexi, a super-rich party girl gone off the rails, and her effortful journey towards kicking her heroin habit. Set in a plush rehab facility, Dawson’s latest novel mingles pitch-perfect pop-culture references with the layers of lies and self-justification in which the addict’s mind wreathes itself; it’s compulsively readable, hilarious and filled with uncomfortable truths. For those who like Chosen One fantasy with a difference, Nnedi Okorafor’s sequel to What Sunny Saw in the Flames, Sunny and the Mysteries of Osisi (Cassava Republic), features Sunny Nwazue, a black albino girl born in New York, and a new member of the magical secret society the Leopard People. Now living in Nigeria, Sunny must balance the demands of school and family with the Leopard People’s strict rules, while learning to read the magical Nsibidi script and attempting to vanquish the wicked spirit Ekwensu once and for all. Okorafor’s storytelling is detailed and absorbing, full of monsters and big consequences for losing control. There’s a treat in store for five- to eight-year-old readers from Katherine Woodfine, author of The Sinclair’s Mysteries: a brief, highly readable story about the inventor of haute couture, Rose Bertin, Rose’s Dress of Dreams (Barrington Stoke). Illustrated by Kate Pankhurst of Fantastically Great Women fame, this pink-clad paean to design and dressmaking as artistic rebellion is the perfect book for any child for whom devising costumes is the deepest form of thought and creativity. Several collections of kid-friendly experiments have been published recently, but Mr Shaha’s Recipes for Wonder (Scribe) knocks most into a cocked hat. From a catapult constructed from a Pringles tube to the chemistry of a microwave cupcake, Alom Shaha first dangles an enticing activity, then meticulously – and thrillingly – details the scientific principles behind its operation. Emily Robertson’s glorious illustrations add to the book’s bursting, irresistible sense of excitement. Children with a yen for animal investigations, and stamina enough for a slightly longer read, will delight in Sarah Todd Taylor’s Max the Detective Cat: The Disappearing Diva (Nosy Crow). Pampered puss Maximilian didn’t plan on becoming head mouser at the Theatre Royal – but soon discovers a flair for theatre life and nosing out why famous diva Madame Emerald is behaving so oddly. Full of humour, period detail and deft characterisation, the story is given still more charm by Nicola Kinnear’s expressive illustrations. In picture books, Caldecott-winner Dan Santat revisits Humpty Dumpty in After the Fall (Andersen), a tender, wryly funny look at trauma and recovery from the perspective of the world’s most famous egg. Humpty is afraid of heights – what will it take to spur him to the top of the wall again? Santat’s new conclusion is both logical and breathtaking. From Elephantom author Ross Collins, Colour My Days (Barrington Stoke) looks at first like a colouring book awaiting the crayon; turn the pages, however, to see Emmy and Jeff and their surroundings brought to life by a succession of colours. Each hue boasts its own distinct character, and the story is saturated with gentle, involving wit. Finally, Morag Hood addresses the question “what’s in a name?” in the superlative comedy The Steves (Two Hoots), a brightly coloured battle between two puffins with the same name who sling outrageous insults in their quest to determine who the best Steve really is. Watch out for a warm eventual reconciliation – and a final sting in the tail."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"technology/2018/apr/25/google-gmail-new-ai-confidential-mode-features-smart-replies-greater-offline-access-expiring-emails-improved-safety-features-headline-redesign","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-25T11:04:17Z","webTitle":"Gmail set for 'entire rewrite' in biggest overhaul for five years","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/25/google-gmail-new-ai-confidential-mode-features-smart-replies-greater-offline-access-expiring-emails-improved-safety-features-headline-redesign","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/apr/25/google-gmail-new-ai-confidential-mode-features-smart-replies-greater-offline-access-expiring-emails-improved-safety-features-headline-redesign","fields":{"headline":"Gmail set for 'entire rewrite' in biggest overhaul for five years","bodyText":"Google is implementing the biggest overhaul of its popular Gmail webmail service in five years, bringing a new look, advanced AI-powered features and improved privacy. Two years in the making, the redesign is intended to help Google better compete with Microsoft’s Outlook on the business side and modernise consumer email by bringing features from its Inbox email client into the main Gmail experience. “This is an entire rewrite of our flagship, most-used product,” said Jacob Bank, product manager lead for Gmail, which 1.4 billion people use each month. For consumers, headline features include the ability to snooze emails, as you would with an alarm clock, until a specified time or date, and what Google calls “nudge”, which displays messages with quick reminders that you haven’t responded to certain messages so that “nothing slips through the cracks”. The smart reply feature, found within Google’s Gmail app on smartphones that suggests quick reply phrases based on the content of the email, will also be rolled out to the web. Google said its new AI-powered features required Gmail to be underpinned by its self-developed Tensor processing chips, and that it had also restructured email storage databases, unifying three duelling systems for syncing messages across devices as part of the overhaul. Cosmetic changes also bring Gmail in line with Office, placing Google’s calendar, tasks and note-taking services within the same page as emails and alongside existing instant messaging options. Google has also improved Gmail’s phishing protection, with new, more dominant warnings about suspicious emails, and a new “confidential mode” that allows users to send emails with expiration dates, prevent the forwarding, copying, downloading or printing of emails and revoke previously sent emails. Emailers can also dictate that recipients have to input a one-time password to read certain messages, in an attempt to ensure that only the intended recipient receives the information. How this will work between Gmail and other email systems such as Microsoft’s Outlook.com or similar remains to be seen, but recent high-profile corporate data breaches have increased the company’s desire to lock down email. While many of the new features will be rolled out to the consumer version of Gmail first, it’s clear that Google’s approach for its email service has changed from consumer-centric to business-centric as it pushes its commercial G Suite products to business. Google is accelerating its efforts to poach business from Microsoft’s dominant Office system of email and apps, using Google Docs, Gmail, calendar and Hangouts instant messaging systems. Analysts estimate G Suite generated about $2bn in revenue last year, 10 times behind Office. One of the things holding G Suite back for businesses has been limited offline capabilities. Gmail now offers up to 90 days of emails offline, allowing users to search, write and manage messages without internet access in the browser. The changes to Gmail will roll out over the next few weeks with consumers able to opt into the new look by selecting the “Try the new Gmail” option under settings once it is available. Changes to the G Suite system will require system administrators to turn on options before they are available to workers using the Google tools.

I won’t use the murderer’s name. These men want us to use their names. The women were Geneviève Bergeron, Hélène Colgan, Nathalie Croteau, Barbara Daigneault, Anne-Marie Edward, Maud Haviernick, Maryse Laganière, Maryse Leclair, Anne-Marie Lemay, Sonia Pelletier, Michèle Richard, Annie St-Arneault, Annie Turcotte and Barbara Klucznik-Widajewicz. They were pioneers – paving a path for themselves and other women in male-dominated fields, facing sexism every day, proving anyone who thinks that women can’t do maths wrong with each successful semester. That is why they were murdered. Reporter Shelley Page, then just 24, was sent to the scene. In a soul-searching piece written on the 25th anniversary of the massacre, Page reflected: “Looking back, I fear I sanitised the event of its feminist anger then infantilised and diminished the victims.” She remembers respected Canadian journalists refusing to admit that the massacre was an act of violence against women. She describes her editors’ worry that, as a woman, she wouldn’t be objective in her reporting. She recalls racing around trying to find details to humanise the murderer; she critiques the media’s drive to find any reason besides misogyny for the tragedy. On Monday night, a man who apparently claims to be part of the “incel rebellion” allegedly rented a van and drove along a 2km stretch of pavement on Toronto’s Yonge Street. “Incels” are an online community of “involuntarily celibate” men who hate women. The attack killed 10 people, predominantly women, and injured at least 13 more. Moments before the violence, the killer appears to have posted to Facebook about overthrowing “Chads” (good-looking, promiscuous men) and “Stacys” (women who sleep with Chads). He also praised the Isla Vista murderer: a misogynist who, in 2014, released a 137-page manifesto before going on a stabbing and shooting spree in California. I use the phrase “appears to have posted”, because, although both Facebook and the lead homicide investigator on the case have confirmed that the post appeared on the killer’s Facebook page, it is possible that in the immediate aftermath of the massacre a troll hacked his account, posted the text, then backdated it. I know this is possible, because, though it seems unlikely, this explanation has been widely proffered as a caution not to start banging feminist drums. While unfounded rumours that the attacker was a jihadist mushroomed across social media, the significance of his apparent affiliation with an online misogynist group has been shushed and spun out of focus. Almost 30 years after the École Polytechnique massacre, we must continue to find any reason for violent misogyny besides violent misogyny. It’s vital that we keep feminist analysis central to the conversation surrounding the Yonge Street massacre. Why, when men tell us that hatred for women is the root of their violence, don’t we believe them? The École Polytechnique murderer, the Isla Vista murderer, the Yonge Street killer: these were misogynists by their own evidence. If we refuse to look for the common denominator, if these events are always going to be framed in terms of the perpetrator’s mental health or childhood trauma (which, yes, I know, are also often factors), then we can’t confront the radicalisation at the root of it all. Talking about the violent misogyny that is likely behind the Yonge Street massacre means delving into an online world that is so stupid and facile that it’s difficult to take seriously. Here goes: incels are men who can’t get laid. They semi-ironically beatify the Isla Vista murderer. They believe that women are only interested in men who are rich and good-looking. They call women “roasties” because all that sex with Chads has made their labia look like roast beef. Roasties let Chads slap them around the bedroom while they act unattainable and pure to poor, short, weak-chinned incels. (The fact that this ideology is easily disproven by, you know, looking out a window and seeing men of all sizes, shapes and levels of attractiveness hand-in-hand with their partners does not seem to intrude on the incels’ fervour.) There’s a jokey, ironic-or-is-it tone to incel boards, a tone that Angela Nagle analyses productively in her book Kill All Normies. Sometimes, the posters themselves don’t seem to know whether they’re being serious or not. Incel boards have reacted to the Yonge Street massacre in different ways, but incels.me has users declaring the date of the attack “an absolutely glorious day”, celebrating the death of D’Amico, and hoping that there’s more violence to come. These spaces are puerile, yet they normalise violent misogyny and have the potential to radicalise socially isolated or vulnerable men. Some of the users are in it for the lulz; some of them are not joking. The latter become the Umpqua Community College murderer, the Isla Vista murderer, the Yonge Street killer. There’s a pattern here, and we can’t keep ignoring it. In the weeks to come we’ll learn more about the killer’s mental health, about his childhood, his education, his work, his social relationships. These are important windows on to the tragedy. But if involvement in misogynistic online communities is indeed part of the picture here, we need to resist any narrative that would push this into the background. Hatred of women is not a mental illness; it is a widespread and dangerous social problem. It is a problem we need to address before more people die. • Emer O’Toole is assistant professor of Irish performance studies at Concordia University, in Canada"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"news/2018/apr/25/anzac-dawn-service-at-villers-bretonneux-pomp-patriotism-and-plastic-ponchos","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-25T10:36:26Z","webTitle":"Anzac dawn service at Villers-Bretonneux: pomp, patriotism and plastic ponchos | David Marr","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/apr/25/anzac-dawn-service-at-villers-bretonneux-pomp-patriotism-and-plastic-ponchos","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2018/apr/25/anzac-dawn-service-at-villers-bretonneux-pomp-patriotism-and-plastic-ponchos","fields":{"headline":"Anzac dawn service at Villers-Bretonneux: pomp, patriotism and plastic ponchos","bodyText":"At the Last Post we dug out our ponchos. The rain had held off for hours but first the bugler and then the padre brought it down. Our discomfort was complete. Only one umbrella rose above the congregation at the dawn service at Villers-Bretonneux. It sheltered the Prince of Wales. That’s royalty. The rules for everyone else were terribly strict. We handed our our umbrellas in at the gate. But not HRH and, edging in for a little shelter, were Malcolm Turnbull on one side and Édouard Philippe, the prime minister of France, on the other. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning And when the shower passed after a few minutes – roughly when Senator Derryn Hinch was laying his wreath – there rose from the ground the absolutely authentic stench of blood and bone. Dawn services are indestructible. We know what they are about: speeches, music and wreaths. And suffering together in the open is so much part of it all: showing we, too, can endure even if only a cold, wet morning in northern France. As they say in the theatre world: it’s a long sit. The Prince of Wales had appeared like a ghost out of the shadows at 4.45am. He has grown old waiting and looks more than ever like his Mountbatten cousins. He performs his chores with perfect goodwill but his face has the look of a man a little distracted, perhaps by matters of state. Everyone with an iPhone knew sunup was still two hours away. What a great director could do with that time in such a setting and with such a purpose. Trim the speeches. Coordinate them so we don’t get three or four descriptions of the battle that – in Australian eyes – turned the war around. And can we, please, do something on solemn occasions like this about the petty rules of politeness? How many times must Turnbull be announced at the microphone as “the Hon” and “MP”. Give us a break: he’s simply “the prime minister Malcolm Turnbull”. He was enjoying himself. There’s a particularly mischievous grin he has and a way of rocking on his toes that signalled he was having the time of his life chatting to HRH and HE the PM of the French republic. Perhaps moments like these make being prime minister bearable for Turnbull. Up to his elbows in the grubby brawls of his party he can take heart that soon enough there will be another guard of honour to inspect and another chance to chat man to man with the leader of a nation two or three times our size. They are his people. A note on cold weather dress for politicians. Power flows to those who seem least prepared against the elements. HRH’s heavy overcoat betrayed his age. Tony Abbott cut an unfortunate figure in a plastic poncho. But Philippe was dressed as if he were sauntering through the rooms of the Élysée. What brings the crowd here? Patriotism and celebration but perhaps also to wonder whether any of this, in the end, will do the trick. Hardly anyone in this crowd would have been alive the last time Europe mobilised against itself. But can these ceremonies, these monuments and museums, save us from another war? “Please remain in your seats,” ordered Major General Mark Kelly AO DSC as hundreds of wreaths were laid in the rain. This commemoration went on and on as every name of every family and organisation was carefully announced and yet more flowers were brought forward. But up in the stands the ranks began to break. It was perhaps the worst insurrection in these parts since the British 5th Army broke in the face of Ludendorff’s advance in 1918. “Remain in your seats,” begged the general again but the crowd had made up its mind. The sun was up and the rain was coming down again. It was time for breakfast, time to find somewhere dry and warm. Leaving the official party in the lurch, the crowd headed for the buses, reclaiming their umbrellas on the way."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business-to-business/2018/may/01/mary-portas-decision-making-doesnt-have-to-be-alpha-male","type":"article","sectionId":"business-to-business","sectionName":"Business to business","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-01T08:54:34Z","webTitle":"The Apprentice​ is just the most hideous show on TV, says Mary Portas","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business-to-business/2018/may/01/mary-portas-decision-making-doesnt-have-to-be-alpha-male","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business-to-business/2018/may/01/mary-portas-decision-making-doesnt-have-to-be-alpha-male","fields":{"headline":"The Apprentice​ is just the most hideous show on TV, says Mary Portas","bodyText":"Mary Portas has certainly met a lot of leaders. She’s worked with brands including John Lewis, Harvey Nichols and Harrods, and even had a short stint advising David Cameron’s government on high-street retail. But it’s not dealing with the big cheeses that she finds toughest. “The toughest business decisions centre around people and when things aren’t working, and how you deal with that,” she says. “The first thing I say is: ‘Look this is not going to be a great conversation, but I think we are going to need to separate.’ That way they are not sitting there with their heart beating, thinking.” She’s less than impressed by big bosses who want to stamp their authority on to organisations or who bully their colleagues. “Tough business decisions don’t have to be alpha [male]; you don’t have to be ball-breaking,” she says. Portas says “bad alpha culture” is corrosive to workplaces and is the antithesis of a culture where creativity is key. For her, one TV show exemplifies all that is wrong: “If you take something like The Apprentice, which is just the most hideous show on TV,” says Portas, “it’s all based on how you can belittle each other. It’s all based on who’s going to be the one with the biggest balls and the loudest mouth – not the person who’s got there in the most creative way.” Portas believes individuality is essential to a happy and productive workplace. “You don’t have to put on a different persona,” she says. “The most important thing in life is connecting with who you truly are. Why do we have to put on a face that is a ‘work face’? Why don’t we bring our whole selves to work?” One business leader Portas does admire is the late Anita Roddick, founder of The Body Shop. She reminisces about how she regularly visited Roddick’s store on weekends as a teenager. She also says it “breaks her heart” how the company fared following its sale to L’Oreal, when, she says, they “put systems in place” and “took the soul out of it”. Portas says Roddick had a vision and belief, which she maintained in spite of what the critics said about her. “Look at what Anita Roddick did. She was talking about all the issues that are major now – sustainability, looking after our planet and animals, how we live – all in the 1970s! She grew that business to more than a thousand shops with a vision. Everyone called her bonkers, but she wasn’t bonkers, was she?” According to Portas, large companies tend to struggle to be creative because decision making is carried out by committees, and this stifles creative leadership. “Whenever I speak to chief executives, or whenever I speak to people who are on the board, I say they need to understand that creative leadership is vital. You need to have just a few people who make those decisions – if they get it wrong, you’ll know soon enough. Bureaucracy and boards, where so many people have to make decisions – it just kills creativity.” Given that Portas hates committees, it’s perhaps no surprise that her time spent working with David Cameron’s government – she was asked to come up with proposals to reinvigorate the high street – didn’t come to much. The passionate, creative visionary was soon clashing with calculating politicians, and recalls one particular meeting. “I was doing my high street report, and I was having this real debate with a minister. He said: ‘You’re too emotional.’ And I thought: ‘What the hell does that mean? What, I’m emotional about the high street and communities?’” Following the submission of her report, the government provided a total of £1.2m to 12 towns, dubbed “Portas Pilots”. However, the scheme failed to generate any real growth or substantial change.

It could be a symbol for the secret emotional pain that exists alongside the male aggression and male adventure that is effectively using it as fuel, maybe calling to mind Philoctetes, the warrior in the Iliad, abandoned by his comrades on the remote island of Lemnos before the Trojan war because of a noxious suppurating wound and yet rescued because his magical bow is needed. It is an intimate and boldly transgressive drama from the white South African director John Trengove, about circumcision and initiation rituals. Kwanda (Niza Jay Ncoyini) is a Xhosa city kid from Johannesburg whose father, Khwalo (Gabriel Mini), thinks he is getting a little too pampered. So he arranges for his son to have the traditional circumcision – not in a hospital, but on a remote mountain, a retreat with other young “initiates” who will be cut and then live in huts for the week or so that it will take their wounds to heal, bonding, and promising never to speak again about what they have experienced. They will be under the disciplinarian control of elders or mentors who are effectively volunteers, eagerly taking time away from their own dull jobs to administer this traditional rite of passage – and maybe relive something they have come to think of as the most intensely real experience of their lives. Xolani (Nakhane Touré) is Kwanda’s mentor – but it becomes clear that, far from being calmly at ease with his own supposed mature masculinity, as someone who has himself gone through this ritual, Xolani is deeply conflicted. This mountain is the only place where he can have sex with another mentor, the more macho Vija (Bongile Mantsai), who is married with children. These men have known each other since boyhood, and coming out here for this ritual is almost a kind of “Brokeback” holiday for their otherwise unexpressed sexualities. The film even suggests obliquely that there is a natural way of soothing the young initiates’ raw wounds which has become a key undiscussed initiation in itself. Moreover, Kwanda himself is gay, wishes to be open about it and is impatient with this ritualised denial. He tells Xolani that he himself is the real man, not these supposed elders whose rituals are regressive and avoidant – a way of retreating from actual manhood. Even without these complicating factors, the spectacle of circumcision is startling. The boys are wrapped in traditional blankets. When the doctor comes with his blades, they are curtly told to “Spread!”, and when the act itself is performed, they are expected to bear the agony stoically, and to cry out in a kind of triumph: “I am a man!” The film challenges the audience’s instincts – if we have chosen this moment to feel that it is a legitimised cycle of abuse, then we might also remember that male circumcision is a tradition well rooted in the white cultures of Europe and North America. It is, incidentally, impossible to miss the slight but distinct resemblance to US campus fraternity associations with their submissive “pledges”. As Xolani, Touré’s performance has a kind of pointed introspection. The opening sequence shows that his job as a fork-lift driver in a warehouse is something he does competently enough, but it has nothing like the intensity of this ritual, or the sense of status and prestige. He is not married, and does not appear to have a relationship. His feelings about all this are not easily readable – but perhaps no more inscrutable than Mantsai’s more boisterous and conventionally settled Vija, who has a family, and appears to take this licensed break from heterosexuality less seriously – or at any rate, less seriously as long as there is no prospect of these pleasures being taken away from him. Kwanda’s candour has opened up a new kind of tension between these secret lovers. He has, in fact, provided them with an initiation more painful, more authentic, than anything they suffered as teenagers. “Coming of age” is usually a syrupy Hollywood genre, and it’s bracing to find it given such an unsentimental expression – and to see that it applies not only to adolescents, but to adults, too."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"media/2018/apr/25/comcast-launches-rival-22bn-sky-takeover-bid","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-25T15:59:09Z","webTitle":"Comcast launches rival £22bn Sky takeover bid","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/apr/25/comcast-launches-rival-22bn-sky-takeover-bid","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2018/apr/25/comcast-launches-rival-22bn-sky-takeover-bid","fields":{"headline":"Comcast launches rival £22bn Sky takeover bid","bodyText":"Comcast has gatecrashed Rupert Murdoch’s takeover of Sky with a rival £22bn offer, sparking a bidding war for Britain’s biggest pay-TV broadcaster. The media and telecoms company, which owns NBC Universal and is the largest cable operator in the US, has made an all-cash offer of £12.50 a share, a 16% premium on the offer from Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox, which values Sky at about £19bn. Fox owns 39% of Sky and submitted its bid to take full control in December 2016 but the deal has been delayed by regulatory issues. Comcast has made its move on Sky after having an offer for 21st Century Fox’s entertainment assets, which include Sky and the Deadpool and X-Men Hollywood studio 20th Century Fox, spurned by Murdoch last year. Murdoch agreed a $66bn (£47bn) sale to rival Disney that is being scrutinised by US regulators, as Fox’s own deal for Sky continues to be investigated by the UK competition regulator over issues including media plurality concerns. The UK takeover panel ruled this month that after Disney completes its Fox deal it must make a full takeover bid for Sky, even if the competition regulator quashes Murdoch’s attempt to buy the 61% he does not already own. Comcast, which has 1,300 employees in the UK in subsidiaries including the production company behind Downton Abbey, made a number of pledges such as keeping Sky’s HQ in Osterley, south-west London, and guaranteeing the editorial independence and funding of Sky News for at least 10 years. “We are determined to be responsible and trusted owners of Sky,” Brian Roberts, the chair and chief executive of Comcast, said. “We understand and appreciate the value of news and are committed to protecting the important role that Sky News plays in providing a high-quality impartial news service. Any news organisation needs to have independence and be protected to do its job. You want there to be independence.” The company also said it would not look to acquire a majority interest in any UK newspaper for at least five years, a shot at the Sun and the Times owner Murdoch, whose takeover bid is being scrutinised over concerns that taking over Sky News would give him too much control of UK news media. This month Disney “expressed an interest” in buying Sky News – regardless of whether its takeover of Fox and Sky is successful – in an attempt to help solve the plurality issue that is slowing up Murdoch’s bid and see off Comcast. Comcast said it would prefer to take full control of Sky but it would be “happy at 50.1% and 100% and anywhere in between”. However, Roberts said he did not expect Fox or Disney to want to remain a minority shareholder. “My own opinion is there is unlikely to be a large minority shareholder,” he said. “The most likely scenario when it is done, more likely than not, is that we would end up with most, if not all, the shares. But we are comfortable either way.” Comcast would need approval from 82% of Sky’s non-Fox shareholders to achieve a 50% controlling stake.While 21st Century Fox said it remained committed to its offer for Sky and was “considering its options”, meaning potentially raising its bid, analysts believe Murdoch has to clear any offer increase with Disney. “Murdoch is out of this now, there is another kingmaker in Disney; he will pick up the phone and solicit a higher bid as Fox is now worth a lot more in total,” Alex DeGroote, a media analyst at Cenkos Securities, said. Under the terms of their agreement Fox has “broad parameters” to increase debt or buy or sell assets without breaking its deal with Disney. But in “certain instances” Fox cannot act without Disney’s approval. In addition, Disney cannot make its own direct bid for Sky without the written consent of Fox. Sky’s independent board, which had told shareholders to accept Murdoch’s offer, has withdrawn that recommendation in light of Comcast’s higher bid. “The independent committee is mindful of its fiduciary duties and has consistently sought to maximise value for all shareholders,” Sky said. Comcast said its offer was warmly received by Sky. Disney, which has called Sky a “crown jewel”, is keen on the broadcaster’s streaming and on-demand service, Sky Now, as it seeks to compete with Netflix. “In reality, this is likely to be about what Disney is willing to pay for Sky as Disney will be the buyer of the Fox assets,” Ian Whittaker, an analyst at Liberum, said. “We think that Fox/Disney will counterbid. Ownership of Sky would seem central if Disney wanted to expand its plans to build a direct to consumer network in North America into Europe as it would give Disney the number one pay-TV operator in the UK, Germany and Italy.” With Sky’s share price trading at about £13.50, up more than 3% on Wednesday, DeGroote criticised Comcast’s offer and said he expected a bidding war to ensue. “It’s derisory, far too low, bids for Sky must start at a minimum of £15-plus, putting its value at over £27bn,” he says. “Sky’s independent directors can’t accept Comcast’s offer, I don’t know any Sky shareholders that would now entertain a £12.50 offer, it is not plausible.” DeGroote believes Comcast’s formal offer could spark further bidders to emerge. “This will bring into play a number of parties that have not yet shown their hand, such as potentially Netflix and AT&amp;T, depending on the outcome of its Time Warner deal,” he said. “An investment memorandum will be distributed involving everyone: Amazon, Google, Apple – they will all be encouraged to take a look.” Comcast said taking over Sky would result in savings of $500m annually “with only limited impact on headcount expected”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/may/18/the-making-of-a-massacre-and-canned-laughter-podcasts-of-the-week","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-18T05:13:34Z","webTitle":"The Making of a Massacre and canned laughter – podcasts of the week","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/may/18/the-making-of-a-massacre-and-canned-laughter-podcasts-of-the-week","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/may/18/the-making-of-a-massacre-and-canned-laughter-podcasts-of-the-week","fields":{"headline":"The Making of a Massacre and canned laughter – podcasts of the week","bodyText":"The Making of a Massacre Podcast Pulitzer prize-winning journalist Ginger Thompson’s highly anticipated podcast adapted from her Propublica oral history about the mass killings in the small Mexican town of Allende lives up to the hype.

From the opening, Gilbertson’s dogged approach had me hooked, and it was clear she would go to whatever lengths possible to try and answer that central question. Throughout the series, Gilbertson’s storytelling is supported by illuminating interviews and Andrew Eapen’s hauntingly beautiful score. Equal parts enlightening and exasperating, Repeat is a necessary dive into the lengths to which police departments will go to protect their own.

They haven’t had sex in 14 months and four days. This is their last-ditch attempt, and they’re doing it in public, addressing the audience directly. The pillows are ready on the floor in a room resembling a pink, fluffy womb (designed by Fly Davis), the wine is cooled, the music cheesy. This couple still find each other attractive and make each other laugh. So why aren’t they doing it? Last November, as the #MeToo movement gathered pace, Rachel Mars and Nat Tarrab bravely offered a dispatch from the frontline of gender politics in Roller. Now Anthony Neilson uses one couple to consider the male reaction to #MeToo. It is billed as satire, but although often laugh-out-loud funny and well-meaning, it’s pretty toothless. Jimmy brings to mind those commentators who muse about whether women speaking out on sexual harassment may be killing romance. Or those men who have been making calls apologising for past behaviour for fear that they may be called out. Like Jimmy, they want “things to be all right again”. Basically, as they always were. Until pretty recently, most theatre was about men; one of the problems with The Prudes is that it is mostly all about Jimmy. That’s no criticism of Jonjo O’Neill, who plays him with a sly mix of little-boy hurt and charm. But there is something trite in the set-up: essentially, Jess (the estimable Sophie Russell) has made him impotent because he found out about something that happened to her. They have agreed not to share what it was with us, but he does anyway. He appropriates her story. There’s been much talk around #MeToo about women as victims but, like some male commentators, it’s Jimmy who claims victimhood. One of the best parts of the play is when Jess talks about her seven-year-old niece’s need to keep hearing the story of Goldilocks and understands that all women have learned how to live with the bears marauding in the woods and play bear-tamer. Masturbation, pornography and fantasy are all raised but not fully explored, and there’s not enough about consent (for men as well as women), or indeed equal pay and opportunity. The #MeToo movement is not just about what happens in the bedroom, but The Prudes never gets beyond it. • At the Royal Court, London, until 2 June.

Nadhim Zahawi, the children and families minister, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that the affair could be resolved by early May. “I think the focus has to be Windrush. The home secretary has said look, we’ve set up a taskforce, in two weeks we’ll have dealt with all the Windrush cases including compensation. I think that has to be the focus,” Zahawi said. The tightness of the timetable is bound to be raised with Rudd later on Wednesday. There are no details yet of compensation, which would have to cover everything from legal costs to missed flights and the emotional loss of being unable to attend family events such as funerals and weddings, although the home secretary is expected to provide more information to the home affairs committee on Wednesday morning. In the Commons on Monday, Rudd said she was so impressed with the work of immigration staff at Croydon that the process could be speedily completed. She said: “Although I made a statement last week that said that, from the point of getting information, we hope to deliver the outcome within two weeks, I am reassured that most of the cases – small numbers for now – are being turned round very quickly indeed. “The approach that I have asked for, which is for the people who are working on this taskforce to lean in and to assist with the problem, has absolutely been acted on.” However, MPs have been inundated with new claimants. The Labour MP David Lammy, who has led the campaign in the Commons, said nine previously unknown people had come forward to him in the first part of Tuesday. It is also becoming clear that a growing number, potentially hundreds, of people who came from the Commonwealth have faced extreme difficulty in regularising their status. There will be considerable confusion over the question of who qualifies as a Windrush case. Rudd pledged that all Commonwealth arrivals before 1988 would have access to the hotline for dealing with such cases. There are also anxieties over the hotline itself and how the Home Office will treat people who come forward to the taskforce set up to handle members of the Windrush generation and their children who have never regularised their immigration status, if they cannot meet the new, lower, standards of proof. Although Rudd has tried to reassure them they will be safe, there is no clarity over what happens to data from anyone subsequently rejected for citizenship or indefinite leave to remain. Lammy is pressing for a broad exemption to be applied, short of an amnesty but covering people from a particular generation. But Zahawi said people who were in the UK illegally should not be here. He was responding to reports that Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, had proposed an amnesty at Tuesday’s cabinet meeting as a way of dealing swiftly with the Windrush scandal. “The question assumes that illegal immigrants should have the same status as people over here legally whether they are of immigrant stock or are British-born and bred, and I think that’s wrong,” said Zahawi. “Actually, most of your listeners including myself and my parents and other immigrants, will think if you’re here illegally and working illegally then you really shouldn’t be here.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2018/apr/25/the-writer-review-almeida-romola-garai-sexual-revolution","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-25T11:03:56Z","webTitle":"The Writer review – Romola Garai blazes into the battlefield of desire","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/apr/25/the-writer-review-almeida-romola-garai-sexual-revolution","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/apr/25/the-writer-review-almeida-romola-garai-sexual-revolution","fields":{"headline":"The Writer review – Romola Garai blazes into the battlefield of desire","bodyText":"Ella Hickson struck gold with her last play, Oil (2016), which spanned 150 years of female history. Her new play may look at first like a Pirandellian box of tricks but is no less ambitious in its attempt to address the purpose of art, the nature of gender and the need for the mythic in a society governed by fixed, male-determined rules. Playful and impassioned, it keeps one riveted for two uninterrupted hours. It starts with a bruising encounter between two figures in a deserted theatre. The woman (Lara Rossi) is an angry 24 year old who detests the hidebound conventions of modern drama and whose driving ambition is to “dismantle capitalism and overturn the patriarchy”. The man (Samuel West) is a part of the theatrical establishment governed by a cautious pragmatism. The woman’s view of theatre as a sacred space with a political purpose is met with a mixture of amused condescension and a vain attempt to co-opt her fire and fury. It sets the tone for much of the ensuing action. But Hickson immediately asks what we are watching: real people, or characters created by the Writer (Romola Garai) and manipulated by the Director (Michael Gould)? Without giving too much away, what we see over the following four scenes is an extension of the initial debate. Garai’s Writer is a fervent idealist wrestling with the compromises demanded in her personal life by her boyfriend and in her professional life by her director. This leads her into a quest for a more tribal way of living and a rejection of the polarised fixities of gender. Above all, the play is asking a big question: do we need new theatrical forms to reflect a society in the midst of a sexual revolution? Hickson’s approach is witty, clever and keeps the ground shifting under one’s feet – Rossi’s character attacks the kind of play that introduces real-life babies only for Hickson’s to do precisely that. But while Rossi questions the power of “old white guys” to set the critical rules, I still have two reservations. Hickson portrays the two key men in the play – the Writer’s boyfriend and director – as implacable materialists: she seems to deny the possibility that men can unite with women in overthrowing the existing order. And in placing so much stress on the solitary anguish of the Writer, Hickson is in danger of endorsing the privileged despair of the lucky few. But this is a play about big issues, and Blanche McIntyre’s superbly inventive production and Anna Fleischle’s ingenious design reinforce the point that Hickson’s play practises what it preaches: it adopts precisely the provocative, non-naturalistic form it is asking for. Garai is also a wonderfully credible mix of the tentative and the assured and nothing in the play is better than her realisation that, in her sex life, she has achieved the domination she deplores in men. Rossi also captures perfectly the blazing intensity required in the opening scene and both West and Gould, who hovers on the edge of the action like a puppet-master, convey the male desire for control. In the end this is a play about a Writer’s desire to change the world and it leaves us urgently debating whether theatre itself is a potential instrument of revolution or a bastion of the status quo.

When not providing big, bland, blustery, stadium-rock productions for Coldplay and U2, he was collaborating with such cutting-edge mavericks as Andrea Corr, Jools Holland, Natalie Imbruglia, Belinda Carlisle and Dido. His “song-based” albums, both solo and with the likes of David Byrne, were becoming tasteful, characterless and anaemic. The wonderfully perverse producer-conceptualist who had transformed Bowie, invented ambient music and shaped no wave seemed to have turned into a rather dull hack. However, it turns out that Eno never actually stopped making interesting ambient records – it’s just that they only got played at conceptual art exhibitions. This six-CD set assembles some of them: from a discordant, doom-laden, 20-minute dronefest for a gallery in Venice in 1985 to a glittering 21-minute soundscape recorded for an installation in Kazakhstan last year. This might be music that is superficially clean and minimal but, at its best, you’ll hear the toil and effort underneath the seemingly frictionless surfaces – like looking at the surface of a geometric Malevich or Mondrian painting and seeing the thick, irregular, textured layers of oil on canvas. Lightness, composed for a St Petersburg museum in 1997, is an appealing series of soft, dissonant but slowly resolving drones and swooping sounds. 77 Million Paintings, a 44-minute piece designed for a 2006 Tokyo exhibition, is an immersive mix of gamelan bell tones and heavily treated vocals. The Making Space CD from 2010, recorded with guitarist Leo Abrahams, sometimes veers close to blandness, but tracks such as Light Legs (featuring an endlessly arpeggiated glockenspiel-like sound) and the haunting Hopeful Timean Intersect are exquisite. Sometimes the laziness resurfaces. Thanks to the apps that Eno himself helped to develop, you can now create this kind of ambient music on your phone, with algorithms turning your choices into generative soundscapes. Some of these pieces, particularly the rather lazy-sounding final CD, Music for Future Installations, sound as if they were made on an iPhone and took less time to write than they do to listen to. This month’s other picks Finnish pianist Iiro Rantala plays in myriad settings (string quartets, jazz trios, tango bands, solo versions of John Lennon songs, etc): his album Mozart, Bernstein, Lennon teams him up with the Deutsche Kammerphilharmonie. The interpretations are adventurous but it’s the originals that hit home – the percussive minimalism of Freedom, the sparkling Pekka Pohjola, and a lyrical tribute to pianist Esbjörn Svensson. Trio HLK are an Edinburgh-based trio for piano, drums and eight-string guitar, and their debut LP Standard Time sees them joined by percussionist Evelyn Glennie and saxophonist Steve Lehmann. They take fragments of jazz standards and turn them into angular modernist miniatures, with Glennie’s junkyard percussion and minimalist marimbas playing a key role."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"us-news/shortcuts/2018/apr/25/the-art-of-the-feel-why-trump-is-master-of-the-awkward-greeting","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-25T13:52:13Z","webTitle":"The art of the feel: why Trump is master of the awkward greeting","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/shortcuts/2018/apr/25/the-art-of-the-feel-why-trump-is-master-of-the-awkward-greeting","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/shortcuts/2018/apr/25/the-art-of-the-feel-why-trump-is-master-of-the-awkward-greeting","fields":{"headline":"The art of the feel: why Trump is master of the awkward greeting","bodyText":"Wherever he goes, or whoever visits him, Donald Trump’s handshake style makes headlines. Following the latest awkward incarnation while the US president was meeting his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron, we have analysed five of his key handshake techniques. The ‘to me, to you, to me’ tussle Trump approaches a handshake like an arm wrestle. Clasp the hand, then pull sharply in, to leave the recipient off-balance. He has even used it while sitting down. Japanese prime minister Shinzō Abe was visibly bemused after being subjected to a 19-second Trump handshake that he was unable to pull away from. Justin Trudeau is one of the few to have effectively combatted it. The Canadian prime minister clutched the top of Trump’s right arm with his left hand to brace himself against the inevitable tug. Macron and the dandruff If he can’t intimidate with a rough handshake, pointing out an imperfection is another tactic the US president employs. With Macron – who has form in besting the Trump-shake – Trump brushed what he said was dandruff off the French leader’s shoulder, while telling photographers: “We have to make him perfect.” Macron maintained a dignified silence. Perhaps the dandruff incident is slightly preferable to a previous Trump-Macron encounter in Paris, when Trump spent more than 30 seconds with Macron in his grip (eventually wife Brigitte was pulled into the clutch, too). The ‘No thank you, ma’am’ A Trump refusal to shake hands also speaks volumes. In one of the more excruciating diplomatic moments of his presidency, Trump simply refused to shake hands with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, even when invited to by photographers. I wanna hold your hand In contrast to his hands-off approach with Merkel, Trump was notoriously hands-on with Theresa May. Anxious to make a good impression as the British prime minister became the first foreign leader to visit the new president in the White House, he was photographed holding hands with her as they descended some steps. On Macron’s US trip this week, he once again repeated the hand-holding trick. The pinkie dance The one hand Trump seems to have a less firm grip with is the first lady’s. Video has repeatedly appeared to show Melania declining or being slow to grasp her husband’s hand in public. This week Trump developed a new move – the pinkie dance. He repeatedly twitched at Melania with his little finger to encourage her to hold his hand – much as you might when posing with a reluctant child embarrassed to be seen out with the family."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/blog/2018/apr/25/talking-horses-paul-townend-eyes-swift-punchestown-redemption","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-25T08:29:09Z","webTitle":"Talking Horses: Paul Townend eyes swift Punchestown redemption","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/apr/25/talking-horses-paul-townend-eyes-swift-punchestown-redemption","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2018/apr/25/talking-horses-paul-townend-eyes-swift-punchestown-redemption","fields":{"headline":"Talking Horses: Paul Townend eyes swift Punchestown redemption","bodyText":"Wednesday’s best bets, by Chris Cook There was some loose talk around the racecourse on Tuesday that Paul Townend might not want to come back and ride there again this week, in light of what he did on Al Boum Photo. But that wouldn’t be very jockey-like and, on reflection, I think getting straight back on the horse is the healthiest and most likely thing for him to do. After all, his four booked rides for day two at Punchestown include two that are expected to start favourite. Indeed, he’d have a pretty serious chance of instant redemption if he can win the Punchestown Gold Cup aboard Killultagh Vic and perhaps that’s the outcome we should all be cheering for, bearing in mind the tortures he will have suffered since. But punters and tipsters must be hard-nosed about such things and I’d rather be against Killultagh Vic after his disappointing show at Cheltenham, which may itself have been a consequence of his Leopardstown fall. Road To Respect has an obvious chance but this does not feel like a race in which anyone should be taking 9-4. After Tuesday’s action, it doesn’t feel like anything could ever be 9-4 … So I’ll take an interest in Bellshill (5.30) at 5-1, despite the memory of his heartbreaking defeat in the Irish National, when he couldn’t keep a straight line over the last. He was giving lumps of weight away to everything else that finished in the first seven and put up an awesome performance, for all that he came away with just fifth place. He needs to be over that race in order to run well here, which can’t be taken for granted. But this is just his third run of the season and I’ll take a chance, encouraging myself with the memory of his two previous Grade One wins at this festival, in 2015 and 2016. It’s great to have racing back at Epsom for another year and I’ve napped Contango (3.55) in the City And Suburban, for which 11-2 is available. He comes from the Andrew Balding yard that has won this race twice in the past three years and has a useful record on the card as a whole. Contango won his first three starts last year and was then turned over on Shergar Cup day, which has happened to many a good horse. It might be said that he went for home a bit early that day, having been stepped up to a mile and a half. This step back in trip is probably the right thing to do and I expect more from him this year. Native Fighter (3.20) looks pretty big at 16-1 for the Great Metropolitan, even allowing for being 3lb out of the handicap. An ex-German colt, he is going the right way for local trainer Simon Dow, winning his last two at Kempton in the style of a horse who would appreciate the stiffer test of a turf track. I don’t quite get the market enthusiasm for Crossed Baton in the Blue Riband Trial, much as I love John Gosden. Surely Aidan O’Brien’s James Cook (2.45) is the better prospect and the more enticing option at 3-1. It was a respectable maiden that he won at Leopardstown in October and he is a brother to Found, after all. O’Brien has been getting among the winners and I think this one should be favourite."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/apr/26/classic-youtube-best-sports-clips-zamboni-snooker-bryan-habana","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-26T09:03:09Z","webTitle":"Zamboni dreams, an unlikely pot and the best of Bryan Habana | Classic YouTube","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/26/classic-youtube-best-sports-clips-zamboni-snooker-bryan-habana","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/apr/26/classic-youtube-best-sports-clips-zamboni-snooker-bryan-habana","fields":{"headline":"Zamboni dreams, an unlikely pot and the best of Bryan Habana","bodyText":"1) Bryan Habana announced his retirement from rugby this week.

For me, it’s the first orange tip. While butterflies that hibernate as adults have been flying for a while, the orange tip is usually the first species to emerge from a chrysalis. Last spring I complained that I didn’t see my first in Norfolk until 2 April. This year it was 19 April. Other spring butterflies, from the holly blue to the increasingly scarce dingy skipper, are at least a week later than average. The orange tip is one of our most accessible butterflies because its caterpillars lay their eggs on ubiquitous garlic mustard or cuckoo flower. The latter likes damp places; the former likes hedges. If you inspect these attractive “weeds” you’ll see the female orange tip (without orange tips but with an attractive dappled green underside) laying eggs – bright orange pin-heads. The camouflaged (and cannibalistic) caterpillars lie along the seed pods of garlic mustard in June. Sadly their chrysalises are too often destroyed by “tidy” gardening. So a friend of mine searches for the chrysalises near their foodplant and stores them in his conservatory to guarantee more joy next spring."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/apr/30/fresh-lords-defeat-for-government-makes-no-deal-less-likely","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-30T16:32:12Z","webTitle":"Fresh Lords Brexit defeat for government makes 'no deal' less likely","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/apr/30/fresh-lords-defeat-for-government-makes-no-deal-less-likely","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/apr/30/fresh-lords-defeat-for-government-makes-no-deal-less-likely","fields":{"headline":"Fresh Lords Brexit defeat for government makes 'no deal' less likely","bodyText":"The government has suffered a heavy defeat on a crucial Lords vote that could pave the way for parliament to send ministers back to the Brussels negotiations if MPs vote down Theresa May’s Brexit deal. Labour said the amendment, which is the seventh Lords defeat for the government on the EU withdrawal bill, would effectively prevent Britain crashing out of the EU with no deal. The cross-party amendment was supported by 19 Tory rebels, winning by a majority of 91. Ministers have previously warned that should parliament vote down the deal agreed by negotiators, Britain would leave the bloc with no agreement. The amendment, led by former Tory minister Douglas Hogg, would change that scenario, meaning parliament could alter it and ask the government to reopen EU talks. The measure is designed to enhance Conservative MP Dominic Grieve’s amendment to the EU withdrawal bill, guaranteeing MPs a vote on the final deal, which won a shock victory in the Commons in December. Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, called the vote “a hugely significant moment in the fight to ensure parliament has a proper role in the Brexit negotiations and that we avoid a no-deal situation”. The leader of the Liberal Democrats in the Lords, Dick Newby, said the amendment “puts parliament in the driving seat”. Rebel Tory sources have said they hope to attract cross-party support in the Commons for the plan, giving remainers the confidence to vote against a damaging Brexit deal without the fear that it will trigger a “no deal” outcome where the consequences would be worse. During the debate, Hogg told peers the clause was “designed to ensure that the future of our country is determined by parliament and not by ministers”. He said a choice between accepting the terms or crashing out of the EU would not be a genuine choice. “This is not regaining control. To act in such a manner would be to impose ministerial decisions on parliament by coercion,” he said, calling it “an elective dictatorship of a particularly flagrant kind”. Echoing Margaret Thatcher, under whom he said he was “privileged to serve”, Hogg said his response was: “No, no no!” He called the referendum vote “at the very best an interim decision” and said the public could not have predicted the terms of the UK’s departure. Lib Dem peer Lord Roberts said he was deeply concerned about the sweeping powers of the government, likening it to the 1933 Enabling Act conferring absolute power on Adolf Hitler. “Perhaps I’m seeing threats that do not exist, but they are there, they are possible,” he said. However, the former Tory leader Michael Howard made a scathing speech about the amendment, saying it could precipitate a constitutional crisis. He said: “[The House of Commons] is not a negotiating body; it has never taken that role, I don’t believe it wants that role and I don’t believe it should have that role ... it would immeasurably weaken the government’s negotiating position with the EU and would I believe make our government and our country a laughing stock.” Later in the debate, the Brexit-backing Green party peer Jenny Jones said she had come to the House of Lords prepared to vote for the amendment on the basis of parliamentary sovereignty, but said she had been put off by the speeches of pro-remain peers. “Quite honestly, the speeches in favour have turned me against them,” she said. “There is clearly more of an agenda than control of the process.” Speaking after the vote, Lord Callanan, a minister in the Department for Exiting the European Union, said the amendment would “weaken the UK’s hand in our negotiations with the EU by giving parliament unprecedented powers to instruct the government to do anything with regard to the negotiations – including trying to keep the UK in the EU indefinitely”. The government also lost a vote on a cross-party amendment led by Labour peer John Monks, which would give parliament even greater powers over the Brexit negotiations, though Lords sources played down the significance of the victory. Peers voted to back the amendment by 270 to 233. The amendment calls on ministers to seek parliamentary approval for their phase two negotiating mandate – similar to the process that exists at the EU level, where leaders of the EU27 approve the mandate of Michel Barnier’s negotiating team. Brexiters have said it fundamentally undermines the government. Writing for the Sun, the Brexit secretary, David Davis, said: “Firstly, the amendment tries to secure a vote for parliament before the negotiations have concluded. This is, quite frankly, nonsensical – because nothing in this negotiation is agreed until everything is agreed. “Second, it demands specific votes by artificial deadlines which, if not met, would give parliament the power to micromanage the government on how to carry out these negotiations.” Davis said the change would give the EU commission “a clear incentive to delay the negotiations or present unacceptable propositions”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/30/egypt-crackdown-fake-weather-reports-meteorological-association","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-30T12:33:05Z","webTitle":"Rain of terror: Egypt to crack down on 'fake' weather reports","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/30/egypt-crackdown-fake-weather-reports-meteorological-association","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/30/egypt-crackdown-fake-weather-reports-meteorological-association","fields":{"headline":"Rain of terror: Egypt to crack down on 'fake' weather reports","bodyText":"Donald Trump may routinely rail against the “fake news media”, but Egypt is going one better by cracking down on “fake” weather reports. The head of the Egyptian Meteorological Authority has said it is the only government body authorised to make predictions about the country’s weather, and is preparing a draft law to ban unauthorised forecasts. Ahmed Abdel-Al, the EMA chairman, said during a television interview that the bill seeks to punish anyone “talking about meteorology, or anyone using a weather forecasting device without our consent, or anyone who raises confusion about the weather”. The EMA is Egypt’s primary, if not sole, source of domestic information on the country’s weather patterns. Egypt’s media is under increasing pressure, with frequent accusations of fake news levelled at reporters and outlets, even those reporting in favour of the state. But false reports about the weather are rare, except perhaps for the annual repetition of doctored photos showing snow covering the pyramids and sphinx of Giza. Weather reports have occasionally become political, however, such as when Egypt’s interior ministry claimed in 2015 that flooding in the coastal city of Alexandria was caused not by infrastructural failings, but by members of the banned Muslim Brotherhood blocking drains with cement. Timothy Kaldas, of the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy thinktank, said: “Regardless of whether or not this proposed law affects anything, it reflects the government’s view that it has a right to regulate any and all information, even information that should be a product of apolitical scientific analysis.” In March, Egypt’s public prosecution office set up a hotline for citizens to report incidents of fake news in the media. The Egyptian parliament also approved an anti-cybercrime law, giving authorities the right to shut down or block any websites that “endanger” the Egyptian economy or national security. Egypt has blocked at least 497 websites since May 2017, according to the Association of Freedom of Thought and Expression. The country has experienced some unusual and extreme weather in recent weeks, including heavy rainfall and fierce sandstorms. Residents of New Cairo, one of the capital’s wealthier suburbs, were sent into a panic after poor infrastructure coupled with heavy rain turned streets into rivers. Officials from Egypt’s Administrative Control Authority were accused of being unprepared for the conditions, and were reportedly suspended and referred to public prosecutors."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/apr/30/garbine-muguruza-athlete-feminine-tennis-wimbledon-interview","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-30T11:28:03Z","webTitle":"Garbiñe Muguruza: ‘For some people it’s hard to allow an athlete to be feminine’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/30/garbine-muguruza-athlete-feminine-tennis-wimbledon-interview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/apr/30/garbine-muguruza-athlete-feminine-tennis-wimbledon-interview","fields":{"headline":"Garbiñe Muguruza: ‘For some people it’s hard to allow an athlete to be feminine’","bodyText":"“Words like ‘feminine’ and ‘fighter’ can go together,” Garbiñe Muguruza says with charming force on a cold but sun-kissed morning in Madrid. “You can be feminine and you can say, ‘I really want to beat her. But I don’t want to look like a little monster in the corner.’ I want to take this wall down which says you are one thing or the other. If you are a feminine athlete people say: ‘Oh, she wants to be a model or she’s not concentrating.’ No. We are concentrating.” Muguruza, the reigning Wimbledon champion and world No 3, is a formidable competitor who is proud she beat Serena and Venus Williams in the finals of the two grand slam tournaments she has won so far. In a ridiculously stylish hotel she is also relaxed and refreshingly forthright. “It’s a delicate thing because for some people it’s very hard to allow an athlete to be feminine. For me it’s easy. I want to fight on court but I also want to wear something I like. You can be angry and competitive and a fighter and you can also be nice and wear something by Stella McCartney. I feel good in that and it’s important for your esteem because you’ve got to be resilient. I’m a tennis player, and that’s my priority. I like fashion but I would never want to be a model. I don’t want to forget what I’m good at because as soon as you do you’re screwed.” The 24-year-old Spaniard, who was born in Venezuela, smiles at that blunt truth as the clay court season gathers pace with the Madrid Open starting on Sunday. And when Muguruza tells me about being invited to the Oscars in March, she ensures that the most telling line is one where her concern for ordinary woman is obvious. “I wore black,” she says, in honour of the #MeToo movement against sexual assault and harassment, “but it wasn’t like the Golden Globes where everybody wore black. It’s a problem that was quiet before but it was there all the time. It got more exposure because the women who spoke out are famous and it’s Hollywood. If an Oscar winner speaks about it then it goes everywhere. But if the waitress says this has happened to her nobody really listens.” The impact of that last sentence is powerful – and Muguruza nods calmly. “It’s everywhere.” Hollywood, obviously, is not the real world but did she enjoy the Oscars? “At the beginning I was like, ‘What the hell am I doing here? I’m not part of this world.’ You see all these glam celebrities and it’s a place to just be good-looking. It was also long, like a six-hour ceremony, but I had fun. I went to a Vanity Fair party and met [the basketball great] Kobe Bryant. Normally it’s not my kind of thing to take the phone out and say, ‘Can we take a picture?’ But this was Kobe and he’d just won an Oscar [for Best Animated Short]. He was very nice and let me hold the Oscar and it was so heavy. But he was so calm, I was impressed.” Muguruza also met Billie Jean King, whose defeat of Bobby Riggs in 1973 has been turned into a Hollywood film. “I want to see it because I heard it’s good,” Muguruza says of Battle of the Sexes, which captures the way King took on Riggs and sexism. “But, usually, when I watch a movie I want to see Fast and Furious or the Expendables. I just want to chill out, turn up the volume and stare at the screen.” She laughs at her terrible taste in movies before acknowledging the debt all female tennis players owe to King and another pioneer for equality in Venus Williams. Women now receive the same pay as men in grand slam tournaments. “I speak to other athletes and they don’t have the impact, the money and equality we have. It’s getting better and better in tennis and hopefully it can soon be completely equal in all tournaments. But in other sports it’s not like that.” Muguruza won £2.2m after beating Venus Williams in the Wimbledon final last year but the tennis circuit, particularly for lower-ranked players, is testing. “Tennis is very lonely,” she stresses, “especially when you are younger and don’t have family around. It can just be you and your coach in China. But everybody is in the same situation. You have to be a young old lady – that’s how I call myself sometimes. You have incredible moments and very bad moments when you are alone. You miss your family but tennis just lasts for a short period. You make sacrifices but I don’t miss having a young life. I’m happy and very privileged.” Four years ago, at the French Open, Muguruza’s full power was revealed for the first time when she gave Serena Williams the worst beating of her illustrious career in the second round. “It was an incredible match nobody was expecting. If you told me before I was going to win 6-2, 6-2 I would be surprised. But I never stopped believing I could beat anybody – even if Serena is one of the best players in history. She was one of the women I watched on TV as a kid.” In 2016 Muguruza won her first grand slam, at Roland Garros, when she again beat Williams in straight sets in the final. “I was nervous because I had made the 2015 Wimbledon final but it only matters that Serena won. Yeah, I played well but who cares about the loser? So in the French I was like, ‘I don’t want to lose again.’ I was also motivated because beating a Williams sister has extra value. If you win a grand slam by beating them it feels more important. It was an explosion of happiness.” Last year was much more difficult in Paris when, in the fourth round, she lost against the local favourite Kristina Mladenovic. Muguruza’s errors were cheered and she left the court visibly upset. “The crowd was very involved and with her. It’s normal. But I had tears in the press conference and showed people how athletes feel. Some people were surprised but I’m like: ‘Come on, I’ve been three hours on court and it’s emotional. That’s what everybody does in the locker room but you don’t see them.’ It was good in the end because I expressed myself and showed I am human. The French Open will always be the most special tournament to me. It was my first grand slam and the tournament I wanted to win when I was little.” Winning Wimbledon was thrilling last year. “I was emotional because when I lost to Serena in 2015 I didn’t know if I’d get another chance as grass is unpredictable. So to beat Venus and win it two years later? I was like: ‘Whew!’” Muguruza, who jokes about her serious salsa dancing, was mortified at the Wimbledon dinner. “People had told me, ‘There’s a ball and you can dance.’ I’m like, ‘Oh my God I’m going to dance with Roger Federer? Yes, I’m ready for that.’ Then someone told me there’s not a dance since 1992. ‘What?’” Muguruza opens her eyes in horror before smiling. “A ball for Wimbledon is serious, elegant, classy. You can’t do the conga but I was ready for everything!” She has a chance of winning both the French Open and Wimbledon again this year – because she clearly raises her game in major tournaments. Her recent tour win in Monterrey gave her a sixth WTA title – but there was a time when her four tournament wins included two grand slams. Her inconsistency almost amuses her. “Everybody asks about Eastbourne before Wimbledon last year. What a disaster. I lost 6-1, 6-0 [against Barbora Strycova] and then won Wimbledon. What is this? But I had played a very good Birmingham tournament and I ran to Eastbourne and it was a crazy day. I played awful and she played good. I was like, ‘OK, nobody saw this match.’ Everybody loves that. ‘You lost 6-1, 6-0 and then you win Wimbledon? What happened?’ Nothing. It was just a bad day. I’m happy to not have any WTA titles but to have one grand slam.” Beyond her drive to win the most important titles, Muguruza’s rounded attitude means she has begun to explore her interest in fashion design. “My mum and I always talk about it because her dream was to be a designer. Of course I’m always wearing sports clothes so, even more, I want to wear high heels. I’ve now started to do some designs. I take my tablet when I’m travelling and I look at magazines and make notes. Then I design the way I like. “It’s good to escape because since I was very young everything has been tennis, tennis, tennis. Now I have more perspective and space in my head. I take a few hours to do something fun for myself. It’s healthy. So when the time is right it will be OK for me to close this chapter on tennis. I’ll probably have a family and do something related to fashion.” Her ease in front of the camera is obvious when she slips into the hotel garden for the photo shoot, but Muguruza is fiercely competitive and says: “I also fear the end because tennis is a life. I’m happiest when I win. You enjoy not knowing if you’re going to win and you can love hating the court.” Muguruza, a feminine fighter and a champion, breaks into a helpless smile. “When you shake hands, and think, ‘Yes, I won,’ that’s such a good feeling. All the hours of training feel worth it. So the best moment is when it’s over and you’ve won.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/30/juventus-almost-in-seventh-heaven-as-napoli-title-bid-comes-undone","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-30T11:48:54Z","webTitle":"Juventus almost in seventh heaven as Napoli title bid comes undone | Paolo Bandini","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/30/juventus-almost-in-seventh-heaven-as-napoli-title-bid-comes-undone","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/30/juventus-almost-in-seventh-heaven-as-napoli-title-bid-comes-undone","fields":{"headline":"Juventus almost in seventh heaven as Napoli title bid comes undone","bodyText":"Fino alla fine.

There was a moment on Saturday when Juve’s season appeared to be unravelling. One week after losing at home to Napoli, the champions found themselves a goal down away at 10-man Inter in the Derby d’Italia. There were fewer than five minutes left, and anything less than a win would grant the Partenopei an opportunity to overtake them at the top. In no way did a comeback feel inevitable. If anything, Juventus looked broken. They had blown an early lead despite playing with a one-man advantage from the 17th minute. Matias Vecino was initially booked for his stamp on Mario Mandzukic but then, rightly, sent off after a VAR review. Juventus were 1-0 up when it happened. But rather than press their advantage, they let Inter back into the game. Mauro Icardi was granted freedom of the penalty area to head home an equaliser from a free-kick. Then Andrea Barzagli bundled in an own goal. Before our eyes, history was unravelling. After six consecutive league titles, the Bianconeri were coming apart at the seams. And then, suddenly, they weren’t. In the 87th minute, Juan Cuadrado breezed past a stumbling Davide Santon and fired the ball across goal. It deflected off Milan Skriniar and into the far corner. Before the game could even reach injury time, Juventus scored again: Gonzalo Higuaín heading home a Paulo Dybala free-kick from close range. Not for the first time this season, Massimiliano Allegri was made to look like a prophet. He had cut a defiant, if angry, figure in the wake of defeat by Napoli, reminding reporters “in football, everything can change in a minute”. Persuading players to internalise that concept has perhaps been his greatest success at Juventus. This season alone, we have seen this team conjure victories out of nowhere on multiple occasions. It is enough to think about how Higuaín and Dybala turned a Champions League tie on its head against Tottenham at Wembley, or how the younger forward conjured three points out of nowhere after Juventus were utterly outplayed by Lazio in Rome. For all of this team’s mental fortitude, however, Saturday’s victory can only be viewed through the prism of two diabolical decisions – one by Luciano Spalletti, and another by match officials. The Inter manager withdrew Icardi to send on Santon with five minutes remaining. The full-back lost Cuadrado on the equaliser, but just as damaging was the shift in Inter’s approach. For so long, their 10 men had carried the game to Juventus. Now, with their chief scoring threat withdrawn, they invited their opponents on. “The substitutions were wrong,” acknowledged Spalletti afterwards. He knows the implications are severe. Defeat, combined with wins for both Rome clubs, left Inter four points outside the Champions League places with three games left. Failure to qualify might cost him his job, and could also spell the end of Icardi at Inter as well. The striker was a picture of impotent desolation as he watched the final act from the bench. Even so, Spalletti could justifiably lament that his team had been hard done by. The disparity was glaring between the decision to send off Vecino and the failure to punish Miralem Pjanic for what looked like an evident second yellow card offence when the score was 1-1. The Juventus midfielder clattered into Rafinha knee-and-elbow-first, just yards from referee Daniele Orsato. Here, there would be no VAR review. A technology that was introduced in part as an antidote to late-season polemics has instead simply added a fresh layer. VAR would play its part, too, in the crucial second act of this weekend’s drama. The Scudetto race was still very much alive as Napoli arrived to face Fiorentina at the Stadio Artemio Franchi. A win for the visitors could cut the gap back down to one point, and Juventus still had a daunting away fixture to come against Roma. But then Kalidou Koulibaly was sent off after five minutes. A hero one week earlier, when he scored Napoli’s winner in Turin, the defender was guilty here of a clumsy challenge on Giovanni Simeone as the Fiorentina forward dashed into the box. Initially, the referee gave a penalty and a yellow card. After consulting the replay, those became a free-kick and a red. Unlike Inter, Napoli were unable to keep up the fight with 10 men. Maurizio Sarri’s decision to immediately withdraw Jorginho ought to be questioned, as the player most capable of exerting control and slowing the game down, but a team that had already been showing signs of exhaustion in recent weeks was perhaps always doomed under the circumstances. Simeone put them to the sword with a brilliant hat-trick – the first of his career. So much for the naïve hope of some Napoli fans that Fiorentina, whose hatred of Juventus burns brightly, might somehow stand aside. The Viola have their own season objectives to pursue, with a place in Europe still achievable, and there was no note of dissent from the stands as they revelled in this win. Sarri refused to discuss referees or VAR afterwards. The decision to send off Koulibaly was correct, the defender denying a clear scoring opportunity, but reporters nevertheless tried and failed to draw the Napoli manager by contrasting with Pjanic. None of which could stop fans from seething. A spectacular, improbable and endlessly entertaining title race appears to have arrived at a premature close. Juventus can now afford to lose at Roma and still claim a seventh consecutive Scudetto as long as they win at home against Bologna – who sit comfortably in mid-table – and a Verona team who will almost certainly have been relegated before they meet on the final weekend. Allegri will no doubt remind his players that the narrative can still change, that titles can just as easily be thrown away in a minute as they can be won. But after six consecutive Scudetti, they might not even need to be told. Talking points • Chievo are most certainly not Liverpool, but it feels necessary to observe that Roma won by a margin that would suffice to see them through to the Champions League semi-finals if they could reproduce it on Wednesday. There has been less good news with Diego Perotti unlikely to recover from his ankle sprain, and Kevin Strootman doubtful with rib damage. • Defeat dropped Chievo into the relegation zone, where they join Verona, who lost 3-1 at home to Spal. Unlike their neighbours, the Flying Donkeys do at least still have hope. Only three points separate them, in 18th, from Udinese in 14th. • The Europa League chase is similarly tight, Atalanta and Sampdoria cruising to big home victories while Milan ended their six-game winless run."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/may/01/gay-marriage-cake-ashers-bakery-northern-ireland-uk-supreme-court","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-01T05:00:33Z","webTitle":"Gay marriage cake row reaches UK's supreme court in Belfast","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/01/gay-marriage-cake-ashers-bakery-northern-ireland-uk-supreme-court","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/may/01/gay-marriage-cake-ashers-bakery-northern-ireland-uk-supreme-court","fields":{"headline":"Gay marriage cake row reaches UK's supreme court in Belfast","bodyText":"A bakery run by evangelical Christians is to launch a fresh attempt to overturn a £500 award made against it for refusing to bake a cake promoting same-sex marriage. Ashers bakery, which has branches in Northern Ireland and is financially supported by the Christian Institute, is taking its claim to the supreme court on Tuesday, which is sitting in Belfast this week. The firm has twice been found to have discriminated on the grounds of sexual orientation after it cancelled an order by a gay activist in 2014 for a cake decorated with the slogan: “Support gay marriage”. Gareth Lee had specified the motto for an event to mark International Day Against Homophobia. Same-sex marriage is not legally recognised in Northern Ireland. When Ashers refused to bake the cake, which was to have depicted the Sesame Street characters Bert and Ernie, Lee sued. His case against the family-owned bakery has been supported by the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland. Lee, a volunteer member of the LGBT advocacy group Queer Space, told the initial hearing in 2015 that the refusal made him “feel I’m not worthy, a lesser person and to me that was wrong”. The firm maintained it was a response to the message, not the customer. Lee’s order occurred shortly after the Democratic Unionist party used its power of veto in the Northern Ireland assembly to block moves to make same-sex marriage legal in the province. The region is the only part of the UK where gay marriage is still not recognised in law. Theresa May has said the issue is one for the devolved assembly at Stormont; there is no power-sharing executive. Five supreme court justices will hear the appeal in Belfast: the president, Lady Hale, the deputy president, Lord Mance, Lord Kerr, Lord Hodge and Lady Black. This is the first week that the supreme court has sat in Northern Ireland. The case has aroused international interest. The US supreme court is considering a similar claim from a gay couple who were refused a wedding cake by a bakery in Colorado in 2012. Delivering judgment in the court of appeal on the Ashers case in 2016, Northern Ireland’s lord chief justice, Sir Declan Morgan, said: “The supplier may provide the particular service to all or to none but not to a selection of customers based on prohibited grounds. “In the present case, the appellants might elect not to provide a service that involves any religious or political message. What they may not do is provide a service that only reflects their own political or religious message in relation to sexual orientation.” At an earlier hearing in a county court, Daniel McArthur, general manager of Ashers Baking Company, explained why the family-run firm turned down Lee’s request for the cake. “We happily serve everyone but we cannot promote a cause that goes against what the Bible says about marriage. We have tried to be guided in our actions by our Christian beliefs,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/may/09/ireland-abortion-referendum-divides-county-roscommon","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-09T04:00:37Z","webTitle":"Abortion question divides rural Ireland as referendum looms","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/09/ireland-abortion-referendum-divides-county-roscommon","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/09/ireland-abortion-referendum-divides-county-roscommon","fields":{"headline":"Abortion question divides rural Ireland as referendum looms","bodyText":"There are far more than three billboards outside Roscommon, and their opposing messages indicate an intensifying battle for undecided voters in the historic referendum on abortion this month. On the roads into this quiet town in the middle of rural Ireland, it is impossible to miss the laminated placards fixed to lamp-posts. Some have one from each camp, vying for the attention of passersby in a polarised campaign in which voters have to make a binary choice between yes and no. A few hoardings have been torn down in the night, in a sign of strongly held beliefs. But mostly, the people of Roscommon are holding their views close, unwilling to discuss with each other – let alone a stranger – where they will place their cross on 25 May. Three years after Ireland, where historically the Catholic church has been the undisputed moral authority, became the first state in the world to endorse same-sex marriage in a popular vote, people are going to the polls again. This time, the Irish are being asked whether they want to repeal the eighth amendment – a clause in the constitution that protects “the right to life of the unborn”. The amendment means legal abortion is impossible in Ireland, even in cases of rape or fatal foetal abnormality, although about 3,500 women travel to the UK each year for terminations and another 2,000 illegally order abortion pills online. The referendum, along with public opinion surveys that indicate a majority in favour of repeal, is a measure of how far Ireland has changed within a generation or so. But Roscommon-South Leitrim, the only one of 43 constituencies to vote against same-sex marriage, albeit by a slim margin, may again buck the trend. David Molloy, a local businessman, said: “There are very deeply held feelings here, it’s a small, tight community. “The issue of abortion is very much at the core of Catholic belief. Even though there will be people here who have had abortions or know someone who has had an abortion, it would never be spoken about.” In a campaign in which the generational divide is seen as significant, the county has one of the oldest age profiles in Ireland, largely a result of young people leaving to find work or go to university. It has also seen a remarkable influx of immigrants in the past two decades: Brazilians recruited to work in the meat industry, eastern Europeans, and a smattering of families fleeing the war in Syria. The changes have been striking. Once, the Catholic church was the only religious show in town; now there are more than a dozen Christian denominations, including a Nigerian and a Brazilian church. In nearby Ballaghaderreen, plans last year to convert a historic convent into a mosque caused a row. Paul Healy, the editor of Roscommon People, a local paper and website, said: “There are dozens of different nationalities in the local school – a complete transformation from a generation ago.” According to Molloy, cultural and social changes include tacit acceptance of things once seen as scandalous: couples living together and children born outside marriage, and “even one or two” gay partnerships. “The influence of the church has taken a massive knock, partly as a result of the [child sexual] abuse scandals, and the cover-ups, but also because my generation are less deferential and more questioning. And then there’s the internet,” he said. Even so, the town’s imposing Sacred Heart church, decorated with mosaics inspired by Botticelli and Michelangelo, still attracts a relatively healthy congregation on Sunday mornings, although many pews are sparsely filled. Father John Cullen, Sacred Heart’s priest for just over a year, was reluctant to be drawn on the voting intentions of his congregation. “My understanding is that people are still trying to form an opinion,” he said with a revealing uncertainty, while firmly restating the church’s right to life doctrine. According to Healy, “there isn’t the stomach for battle in the church that there was 10 or 15 years ago. There’s no sense of fire and fury. I think the no side is probably resigned to defeat, though it’s not a done deal, and there is certainly a hidden minority of people whose voices are not being heard”. In Ballaghaderreen last weekend, a dozen yes campaigners in hi-vis jackets were taking the case for repeal door to door. By and large, they were received courteously, with residents fairly evenly split between yes, no and undecided. Doireann Markham, one of the canvassers, said she was reasonably happy with the reception, “but I’m aware that typical [County] Roscommon discretion makes it very hard to call”. “Nationally, the wind is blowing towards a yes vote. But there is a wide expectation that Roscommon will vote no. We’re fighting an uphill battle, but it’s a national referendum, so every single vote counts,” she said. Her impression was that as many as 40% of voters in the county had yet to make up their minds – double the figure from a recent national poll for the Irish Times. “There is absolutely everything to play for,” Markham said. One issue that campaigners on both sides have come up against is the government’s stated intention to follow a vote for repeal with legislation allowing abortion on demand up to the 12th week of pregnancy. “People on the doorstep are definitely worried about the 12-week issue,” said Mary McDermott, a yes campaigner in Roscommon. Sile Quinlan, campaigning for a no vote in Sligo, said: “When you explain to people that repeal will be followed by abortion on demand, they are very surprised and shocked. There’s definitely a feeling that it’s a step too far.” The proposed legislation would give Ireland a more liberal abortion law than the UK. Quinlan tells voters that one in 19 pregnancies in Ireland ends in abortion, whereas in the UK the figure is one in five. “We look at Britain and we can see what the potential future is. When you ask people how they’d feel if Ireland was to move in that direction, there’s a very clear message that people don’t want to follow the UK,” she said. She is “not particularly religious” and voted in favour of same-sex marriage three years ago. But repeal would mean “handing all power over to politicians to decide” on the subsequent legislation, and Quinlan feels that many people such as her – she was adopted after a crisis pregnancy – and those with disabilities would not be born. She insisted there was strong support for a no vote and the media, seen as favourable to repeal, was not listening. “Many ordinary people feel that an equal voice has not been given to those who want to retain the eighth amendment,” Quinlan said. In Roscommon, few people were willing to share their opinions. One exception was Denny Fehily, 65, a regular churchgoer and volunteer at the town’s museum. “I think Roscommon will vote against repeal. There just aren’t that many young people and this is a generational thing. But I’m voting yes and so are all my family. Young people are going to go to England [for abortions] one way or another. It’s happening – we can’t ignore it,” Fehily said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/2018/may/07/true-cost-of-eating-meat-environment-health-animal-welfare","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-07T05:00:40Z","webTitle":"What is the true cost of eating meat?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/may/07/true-cost-of-eating-meat-environment-health-animal-welfare","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2018/may/07/true-cost-of-eating-meat-environment-health-animal-welfare","fields":{"headline":"What is the true cost of eating meat?","bodyText":"What are the economics of meat? Food and farming is one of the biggest economic sectors in the world. We are no longer in the 14th century, when as much as 76% of the population worked in agriculture – but farming still employs more than 26% of all workers globally. And that does not include the people who work along the meat supply chain: the slaughterers, packagers, retailers and chefs. In 2016, the world’s meat production was estimated at 317m metric tons, and that is expected to continue to grow. Figures for the value of the global meat industry vary wildly from $90bn to as much as $741bn. Although the number of people directly employed by farming is currently less than 2% in the UK, the food chain now includes the agribusiness companies, the retailers, and the entertainment sector. According to the UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, in 2014 the food and drink manufacturing sector contributed £27bn to the economy, and employed 3.8 million people. It is not simple to separate out the contribution that meat production makes to this – particularly globally. The UN Food and Agriculture Organisation states that livestock is about 40% of the global value of agricultural output and supports the livelihoods and food security of almost a 1.3 billion people. What about its cultural and social importance? Cooked meat may have been partially responsible for the large brains that characterise Homo sapiens and have put humans where we are now. Cooking made calories from meat (and from vegetables) easier to consume and absorb than in a raw form. And the domestication of certain animals – along with the domestication of wild grains and vegetables – marked the beginning of human agricultural history in the “fertile crescent”. Throughout human history the hunting and farming of meat has been part of our stories and mythologies and some of our legal and religious systems; the fatted calf for the prodigal son; the medieval forest laws that created areas where no one but English royalty could hunt; the sacrifical sheep to mark the beginning of Eid Al-Adha; even the roasted wild boars consumed at the end of every adventure by Asterix and Obelix. But is meat still crucial to human life? Some argue that, just because we’ve always eaten meat, that doesn’t mean we always have to. If we can get all the dietary nutrients and protein that we need elsewhere, should we? How has meat production changed? The old-fashioned vision of a mixed farm with wheat and chickens and pigs still exists. More than half of the farms in the US, for example, were small enough in 2012 to have sales of less than $10,000 dollars. But the 20th century saw the application of the principles of the industrial revolution to agriculture - how could inputs be minimised and profits be maximised? The result was the factory farm, first for chickens, then pigs, and more recently cattle. Producers discovered that animals could be kept inside, and fed grain, and could be bred to grow more quickly and get fatter in the right places. Since 1925, the average days to market for a US chicken has been reduced from 112 to 48, while its weight has ballooned from a market weight of 2.5 pounds to 6.2. Pig and cattle farming has followed suit. Sows are held in gestation crates for up to four weeks once they are pregnant, and then put into farrowing crates once they’ve had their piglets to prevent them accidentally crushing their young. Industrially reared pigs spend their lives in indoor pens. Cattle farming is now being similarly streamlined, with cows in the last few months of their lives being fattened in feedlots with no access to grass and sometimes no shelter. What is the environmental impact of our current farming model? It is extremely difficult to separate out the different impacts of different farming models and types. Many measurements look at agricultural impact without making a distinction between arable v livestock, or industrial v small farms. However, the following information begins to indicate the scale of the problem. Water use An influential study in 2010 of the water footprints for meat estimated that while vegetables had a footprint of about 322 litres per kg, and fruits drank up 962, meat was far more thirsty: chicken came in at 4,325l/kg, pork at 5,988l/kg, sheep/goat meat at 8,763l/kg, and beef at a stupendous 15,415l/kg. Some non-meat products were also pretty eye-watering: nuts came in at 9,063l/kg. To put these figures into context: the planet faces growing water constraints as our freshwater reservoirs and aquifers dry up. On some estimates farming accounts for about 70% of water used in the world today, but a 2013 study found that it uses up to 92% of our freshwater, with nearly one-third of that related to animal products. Water pollution Farms contribute to water pollution in a range of ways: some of those are associated more closely with arable farming, and some with livestock, but it’s worth remembering that one-third of the world’s grain is now fed to animals. The FAO believes that the livestock sector, which is growing and intensifying faster than crop production, has “serious implications” for water quality. The types of water pollution include: nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus from fertilisers and animal excreta); pesticides; sediment; organic matter (oxygen demanding substances such as plant matter and livestock excreta); pathogens (E coli etc); metals (selenium etc) and emerging pollutants (drug residues, hormones and feed additives). The impacts are wide-reaching. Eutrophication is caused by excesses of nutrients and organic matter (animal faeces, leftover feed and crop residues) – which cause algae and plants to grow excessively and use up all the oxygen in the body of wate at the expense of other species. A review in 2015 identified 415 coastal bodies already suffering these problems. Pesticide pollution can kill weeds and insects away from the agricultural area, with impacts that may be felt all the way up the food chain. And although scientists do not yet have full data on the connection between antibiotic use in animals and rising levels of antibiotic resistance in the human population, water pollution by antibiotics (which continue to have an active life even after going through the animal and into the water) is definitely in the frame. Land use and deforestation Livestock is the world’s largest user of land resources, says the FAO, “with grazing land and cropland dedicated to the production of feed representing almost 80% of all agricultural land. Feed crops are grown in one-third of total cropland, while the total land area occupied by pasture is equivalent to 26% of the ice-free terrestrial surface”. Climate change It’s hard to work out exactly what quantity of greenhouse gases (GHG) is emitted by the meat industry from farm to fork; carbon emissions are not officially counted along entire chains in that way, and so a number of complicated studies and calculations have attempted to fill the gap. According to the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, agriculture, forestry and other land use accounts for 24% of greenhouse gases. Attempts to pick out the role of animal farming within that have come up with a huge range of numbers, from 6-32%: the difference, according to the Meat Atlas, “depends on the basis of measurement”. Should it just be livestock, or should it include a whole lot of other factors? Different models of farming have different levels of emissions: this has generated an energetic discussion around extensive versus intensive farming, and regenerative farming – a model that aims to combine technologies and techniques to regenerate soils and biodiversity levels while also sequestrating carbon. What about the giant companies that dominate the sector? A 2017 landmark studyfound that the top three meat firms – JBS, Cargill and Tyson – emitted more greenhouse gases in 2016 than all of France. What next? Some argue that veganism is the only sane way forward. A study last year showed, for example, that if all Americans substituted beans for beef, the country would be close to meeting the greenhouse gas goals agreed by Barack Obama. But there are some alternatives. Reducing the amount of meat you eat while improving its quality is advocated by many environmental groups. But where do you find this meat? The organic movement was founded on the pioneering work of Sir Alfred Howard. It is still relatively small - in Europe 5.7% of agricultural land is managed organically - but influential. There are other agricultural models, such as biodynamic farming and permaculture. More recently some innovators have been fusing technology with environmental principles in the form of agroforestry, silvopasture, conservation farming, or regenerative agriculture to create farming methods which all encompass carbon sequestration, high biodiversity and good animal welfare. A recent study showed that managed grazing (a technique which involves moving cows around to graze) is an effective way to sequester carbon. However, while organic and biodynamic meats have labels, regenerative farming, as yet, does not - so you need to investigate your farmer yourself. Further reading The UN Food and Agricultural Organisation has a huge collection of data, and has also published some crucial reports on this issue, including the groundbreaking Livestock’s long shadow.

Akinmusire has lately been composing more and working with string quartets and genre-bending singers such as Theo Bleckmann and Cold Specks. But this gig with regulars Sam Harris (piano), Harish Raghavan (bass) and Justin Brown (drums) was the kind of scalding real-time fusion of haunting themes and collective jazz improv only possible for players who can read each other like books, and anticipate the coming pages, too. Alternations of low-volume lyrical delicacy and fierce drama characterised the show, with the undemonstrative Akinmusire initially exhaling a sensuous trumpet melody of long, swerving tones and ringing high sounds against Harris’s slow piano vamp. The reverie ended without warning in a percussive acceleration to a fast, blustery postbop melody hounded by Harris’s now slamming chordwork, and a long Akinmusire improvisation of tumbling uptempo descents and plaintive, early-Miles cries that seemed to hang in a parallel dimension to the onrushing rhythm. The trumpeter’s unaccompanied, glowing pure high notes and languid purrs were gradually floated on to a two-chord hook and a rustling cymbals groove. The band explored bowed-bass harmonies and piano arpeggios while the leader retired to the shadows; and a brightly perky melodic dance for Akinmusire and Harris showed how attuned to each other’s thinking they remain. Akinmusire’s ducking, diving Trumpet Sketch closed the set, its cryptic morse-code melody steadily loosening under pressure from an exhilaratingly unshackled Justin Brown until the band’s sound blurred into an ecstatically ferocious drone. “I’m just having fun with my best friends,” Akinmusire had earlier declared in one of his few announcements. That much was unmistakable, and a thrillingly high-end level of fun it undoubtedly was. •Ambrose Akinmusire is at Ronnie Scott’s, London, on 30 April.

For most of its life, television would frantically chase cinema’s tail. Film was always where the money was. It was where the biggest stars were, and all the strongest storytelling. Television was just a poor relation, a dumb box that sat in the corner of the room squawking at idiots. But then things changed. Slowly, television started making bolder decisions. It started aping cinema’s production values. First-class writers came to see the benefit of longer-form narrative. Movie stars began to appear on television shows, and those shows quickly became career-defining highlights. And, as of last week, cinema has started to chase television’s tail. Because Avengers: Infinity War is almost definitely going to become the biggest movie of all time. And what is Avengers: Infinity War if not a really expensive episode of television? Stick with me. Viewed in a vacuum, Infinity War is meaningless. As a standalone film, it’s a mess. Characters pop up for one scene and then vanish again completely. Nobody has any meaningful screen time. The antagonist swans about with an entirely unearned sense of motivation. And there’s no emotional weight to the ending. It’s just a lot of stuff happening to people we’ve barely met. We may as well be watching it happen to extras. But, with 10 years of context behind it, Infinity War is deeply impressive. We’ve watched these characters grow and change and their relationships evolve in several ways. Infinity War contains a moment – it’s far too brief to be called a scene – between two characters who haven’t seen each other for years. We know their history and their motivations, their thwarted desires and their realisation that they’ll probably never get what they both want. And they communicate all this with a look and maybe two lines of dialogue. The film can’t linger any longer than that, because there’s a superhuman testicle-chinned alien trying to murder them all, but it nevertheless counts as one of the most touching moments in the entire movie. The reason this moment feels earned at all is because we’ve spent enough time with the characters to grasp the complexity of their shorthand. Until now, this sort of thing has only happened on television. Take something like Breaking Bad. In one of the final episodes, Walter White calls his wife a “stupid bitch”. On its own it’s a moment of simple cruelty, but the knowledge of everything that’s gone before adds layer upon layer of meaning. This happens again and again throughout Infinity War, because it’s just an episode of television. Things that happened in previous episodes pay off here, and things that are set up here will pay off in upcoming episodes. There’s a reason why the Russo brothers were chosen to direct Infinity War, and that’s because they have enough television experience to satisfactorily keep all the balls in the air. If these films were self-contained, standalone affairs, you might want someone with more flair for dialogue or inventive visuals. But the Russo brothers are perfect for this job, because this job is simply about moving the story along. It’s a Gold Blend advert with a talking racoon in it. In fact, come next year, I’m expecting people to cool on Infinity War. By the time the impact of the spectacle has worn off a little, we’ll come to see it as nothing more than a piece-moving episode that only exists to set up the series finale that is Avengers 4. If it was an episode of Lost, Infinity War would be something like What They Died For; fine on its own, but designed to get the characters to where they need to be in order to make the final episode go off with a bang. Of course, by becoming an episode of television, Infinity War falls prey to many of television’s flaws – we know which actors still have films on their contracts, which removes the permanence from some of the movie’s events – but that doesn’t really matter in the big scheme of things. Because movies might be copying television now, but it’s television that we still pay £10 an episode to watch. Maybe Marvel has just discovered the future."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"small-business-network/2018/may/09/how-bereaved-parents-became-accidental-world-leaders-in-3d-printing","type":"article","sectionId":"small-business-network","sectionName":"Guardian Small Business Network","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-09T06:30:40Z","webTitle":"How bereaved parents became 'accidental world leaders' in 3D printing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2018/may/09/how-bereaved-parents-became-accidental-world-leaders-in-3d-printing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/small-business-network/2018/may/09/how-bereaved-parents-became-accidental-world-leaders-in-3d-printing","fields":{"headline":"How bereaved parents became 'accidental world leaders' in 3D printing","bodyText":"Naveed and Samiya Parvez built a business so that other families wouldn’t have to suffer what they did. The couple set up healthcare service Andiamo following the death of their nine-year-old son, Diamo. Diamo had cerebral palsy and relied on braces and splints, known as orthoses, to support and protect his body. The process of getting fitted for orthoses caused Diamo and his family so much distress that Naveed and Samiya became determined to find an alternative. The method involved making a plaster of paris mould of the area of the body requiring a brace. Diamo, who died from complications in 2012, required orthoses for his hands, back, hips and ankles. Appointments and fittings for the braces took place in different locations and were conducted by different medical teams. Most of the time the braces didn’t fit him properly, which put Diamo and his family in a perpetual cycle of going back for re-fittings. “If he didn’t have [orthoses] it meant, because he couldn’t control his body or sit upright, he couldn’t be fed properly or fit in his wheelchair, which meant he couldn’t go to school and we couldn’t leave the house. All these massive knock on effects, all for what is pretty simplistically a piece of plastic,” says Naveed. The procedure for being measured for orthoses was a harrowing experience for Diamo. Naveed had to restrain him to keep him still while cold plaster was wrapped around him – a process that takes an hour. “He went blue in the face screaming when they did this to him. You’re pinning a child down who is non-communicative,” he says. “You’d be horrified doing that to an adult – doing that to a kid who has no idea what is happening to them is even worse.” It would then take three to six months for the orthoses to be created on the NHS, by which point Diamo would have grown, so the fit was rarely a good one. The family also tried private healthcare services, which could create the orthoses within six weeks, but used the same plaster cast process and so were just as unreliable in terms of fit. Private treatment was also prohibitively expensive, with one brace, which would be outgrown within nine months, costing around £5,000. Naveed had the idea for the business a year after Diamo died. He was at a tech conference watching a demo of 3D-printed replacement parts for steam engines. He had been aware of 3D printing, but the technology was not developed enough to be a viable option during Diamo’s lifetime. “I realised [the technology] had moved on massively,” he says. He and Samiya consulted experts and researched 3D printing, scanning and materials science, and 12 months later created the first prototypes for orthoses. Their London-based business uses 3D scanning and printing to measure and produce orthoses for children and young adults who are unable to use their limbs, or can’t control their posture. “3D printing experts started coming to us and saying ‘We’ve never seen what you’ve done before,’” says Naveed. “We had Google ringing us up for advice. That’s when we realised that this tiny little team with this crazy idea had suddenly become a world leader by accident.” The measurement process involves moving a handheld 3D scanner over the body for about a minute. The scan is much more accurate than a plaster cast – and the whole process is even fun, according to Naveed: “Kids love it. Either they want to watch what’s going on, because it’s cool and interesting, or they’re watching a cartoon on their tablet while we quickly scan them, and they’re just completely oblivious.” The 3D-printed orthosis is lighter and less cumbersome than a traditional brace, is ready within a week, and costs approximately £1,500. Since Andiamo launched, other companies offering 3D-printed orthoses have emerged, such as Plus Medica, but Naveed says Andiamo is the only service of its type focused on paediatrics. “We designed the whole process around the family’s experience,” says Naveed. After getting by on grants and small amounts of sponsorship from the likes of Dell and IBM, Andiamo recently received £1.7m in funding from NCL Technology Ventures, Alfabeat investments and WeWork, $500,000 (£367,000) of which they received for being a finalist at the WeWork Creator awards. A report by Industry Arc, a specialist market research company, estimates that the global custom-made-orthotics market is growing at 7.3% each year, and will be worth £2.7bn by 2020. Naveed and Samiya, who currently have 30 patients and have delivered 160 orthoses to date, now plan to expand. “Our goal is to see at least another 100 new patients in the next 18 months,” says Naveed. Orthoses have broad applications across the medical world, such as in healing complex fractures, so Andiamo’s potential is huge. Naveed and Samiya hope to treat 15 million children over the next 10 years. “We couldn’t really think of a better way of remembering Diamo than being able to create a legacy that means that no other child or family has to go through what we did,” says Naveed. “That bloody-mindedness just pushed us through.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"healthcare-network/2018/may/01/decade-health-social-care-uk-10-charts-lord-ara-darzi","type":"article","sectionId":"healthcare-network","sectionName":"Healthcare Professionals Network","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-01T09:07:06Z","webTitle":"The last decade of health and social care in England – in 10 charts | Lord Ara Darzi","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2018/may/01/decade-health-social-care-uk-10-charts-lord-ara-darzi","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/healthcare-network/2018/may/01/decade-health-social-care-uk-10-charts-lord-ara-darzi","fields":{"headline":"The last decade of health and social care in England – in 10 charts","bodyText":"This year is one of anniversaries. It’s 70 years since the NHS was created and 10 years since my last review of the service, which focused on the quality of healthcare. It seems, therefore, like the perfect moment to step back and reflect on where we find ourselves today. With this in mind, I recently launched another review, commissioned by the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) and with analytical support from management consultancy Carnall Farrar. The review aims to assess the progress we have made and the challenges we face in the future. Telling the story of the last decade in the NHS, our interim findings are both interesting and important. Quality has improved It is impossible to pick up a newspaper without seeing a story about the crisis in the NHS. But behind the headlines resides a fascinating story. Despite the gloom – and ever rising numbers of patients – the quality of care has improved, from cancer to trauma, stroke to diabetes, mental health to maternity. 1. Despite higher numbers of stroke patients, mortality rates have gone down 2. Cancer survival rates have improved – albeit from a low base Yet we must not get complacent. There is still too much variation in the quality of care: the distance between the best and the rest remains far too wide. And in too many areas – cancer and mental health services, in particular – progress has been from a low base while other countries perform significantly better. High quality care for all is still not a reality. Focusing on patient safety has paid off In the wake of a number of high profile patient safety controversies in recent years, the health secretary has rightly made patient safety a priority. This would appear to be paying off: harm free care is increasingly the norm, instances of pressure ulcers are down, and most healthcare-associated infections are falling. While we can still do better, we have made progress. 3. Harm free care is increasingly the norm Rationing has returned If quality has been maintained or improved, the same is not true for access to services. In the NHS, the timeliness of everything from ambulance response times, to A&amp;E waiting times, to getting a GP appointment has deteriorated. But the most shocking example is in social care where, despite a significant increase in the number of people in need of care, there has been a decline in the number of people accessing the support they need, with a corresponding rise in informal care. 4. The proportion of patients waiting for more than four hours in A&amp;E has increased 5. The number of people stuck in hospital beds (delayed transfers of care) has increased 6. There has been a steep decline in the number of people receiving state funded adult social care Public satisfaction is declining Patient satisfaction in the NHS has held up well over the last decade but public satisfaction has started to fall. Just 57% of the population is satisfied with the NHS – down 6% since 2016 – and just 23% are satisfied with social care, according to King’s Fund analysis of the 2017 British Social Attitudes survey. This is probably partly a reflection of ongoing media coverage of the so-called crisis in health and care. 7. Public satisfaction with the NHS has started to fall The most austere decade It has been a decade of austerity for healthcare: the service has had to make do with slower funding growth – or cuts in the case of social care – despite a growing and ageing population. This has put huge pressure on the frontline. 8. In real terms, NHS funding growth has been the lowest on record since 2010 The NHS has, somewhat successfully, tried to manage this through increased efficiency 9. NHS efficiency has been significantly higher than in other periods The NHS has tried to manage this slow-down in funding growth by delivering “more for less”. This has – to some degree – been successful: efficiency in the NHS is higher than its historic rate, achieved by holding down costs – such as staff pay – and by reforming the way the service works – particularly a focus on prevention, and the integration of health and social care. Running out of road However, there is growing evidence that the sources of efficiency the NHS has relied on over the last decade are unlikely to yield the scale of gains needed in the future. The most significant of these is staff pay, which will rightly start to grow again after seven years of the public sector pay gap. Another source of efficiency has been the reduction in the amount of money paid to hospitals for each procedure they undertake, which is now resulting in significant deficits. 10. Net staff satisfaction with pay and rising inflation has put an end to the public sector pay cap A long-term funding and reform plan The pressures we have seen in health and care over the last decade – in particular, an ageing and growing population – will continue over the years to come. But the 2020s will also be a decade of opportunity, with technology opening up exciting new possibilities for human health. However, the health and care system can only run if it is able to walk. In its current state, we risk the opportunities of the 2020s passing us by. The time has come for the government to abandon austerity and put forward a long-term funding plan for health and social care. But money alone will not be enough; we will need a bold reform plan for the NHS and social care to be fit for the 21st century. With this is mind, we turn our attentions to the future in the form of detailed funding and reform plan, which will be published in the coming months. On its 70th birthday, the gift the NHS needs most is a pragmatic plan to secure it for future generations.

It was Pound who introduced him to vorticism, the short-lived British avant garde modernist movement created by artist and writer Wyndham Lewis as a reaction to the dominance of landscape and figurative art. Equally frustrated by the representative nature of photography, Langdon Coburn immediately sensed the liberating potential of the vorticist dynamic of geometric shapes and cubist fragmentation. In the Shape of Light, Langdon Coburn’s “vortographs”, blurred geometric arrangements of light and shadow, made using a set of mirrors to fragment the subject in an almost kaleidoscopic way, set the tone for an epic exhibition that traces the history of photography as experiment. Here, portraiture, landscape and documentary give way to abstractions – created either by manipulations of light and chemicals or by distorting or fragmenting the actual world. The result is a kind of mirror-history of the medium’s relationship to documentary and abstract art. Spread over 12 rooms, Shape of Light is also a history of innovation, in which the darkroom and the studio are more akin to the laboratory. The early-to-mid-century masters of light and form are all present: Brassaï, Edward Steichen, Paul Strand, Alfred Stieglitz, their embrace of abstraction a kind of compliment to their more traditional documentary work. Their often stark monochrome photographs are contrasted with the formalist paintings of Braque and Kandinsky as well as the shiny curves of a gold Brancusi sculpture, Maiastra (1911), which Steichen must surely have been aware of when he made his oddly mystical study, Bird in Space, 15 years later. It is instructive, too, to see an image from Germaine Krull’s still-undervalued series Métal (1928), a hymn to the angularity and materiality of steel, and to contrast it with the cleaner lines of Margaret Bourke-White’s ground-level view of the NBC Transmission Tower (1934). In a room entitled New Vision, the work of the great self-taught Hungarian modernist, László Moholy-Nagy, inevitably dominates. His painting K VII (1922), a minimalist arrangement of lines and blocks of colour, is echoed in an untitled photograph by him from the same year and, much later, in Mondrian’s supremely ordered arrangement of colour and form, Composition C (No 111) With Red, Yellow, Blue from 1935. Similarly in the following two rooms, the restlessly innovative imagination of Man Ray makes its presence felt. One of his mysterious rayographs from 1922 is an early example of camera-less photography made by placing everyday objects directly on to photosensitised paper and exposing them to light. Both artists cast a long shadow: Moholy-Nagy in his architectural understanding of scale, angle and detail, and his subversion of the same; Man Ray in his seemingly instinctive grasp of photography as an essentially surrealist medium, capable of bending the real out of shape in astonishing ways. Bafflingly, though, there is not a trace of one of photography’s great female pioneers, Berenice Abbott, who made formally brilliant architectural photographs of modernist New York as well as pioneering scientific images of great beauty – including what she called her “rayograms-in-motion” – that surely deserved inclusion here. In a show that tends towards the cerebral, it is a relief to encounter some more tactile nudes by Brassaï and Imogen Cunningham, in which the curves and surfaces of the female body retain a palpable sensuality. Bill Brandt’s distorted female forms, though, seem a little too forced in comparison. All three of the aforementioned artists could have featured in room eight, which is titled Surface and Texture. It begins with three images from Brassaï’s Graffiti series, in which he photographed anonymous carvings and etchings made on the walls of Paris, some recognisably representational, some abstract, all seeming to hark back to older forms of expression such as cave drawings. More intriguing still are Aaron Siskind’s photographs of cracked, peeling paint on weathered surfaces, which possess a tangible sense of materiality and a tonal quality that speaks of time passing and, with it, the slow, inexorable decay of buildings, objects and those who created them. This is an exhibition that demands a constant attentiveness to detail and, as such, will repay a second or even third visit. The sheer amount of work on display is at times overwhelming and here and there the endless riffs on angular shapes, circles and patterns of light began to blur into a long series of slight variations on a single brilliant idea. In this context, Lewis Baltz’s almost blank minimalism is a much-needed breathing space. His evocation of the banality of postwar suburban American architecture – grey concrete surfaces in small frames – has a social, even political, undertow in that it draws attention in its deadpan way to the spread of these soulless environments. This is the mundane made abstract. The final room is given over to contemporary abstraction and, perhaps inevitably, reflects the dilemma of current photographic practice in our profligate image culture. Both Maya Rochat and Daisuke Yokota, in their differing ways, subject their images to intense, almost destructive, transformative techniques using chemicals, heat, paint and, in Daisuke’s case, constant rephotographing, reprinting and rescanning. The visceral nature of their approach both degrades and heightens the photographic image and, by extension, the very idea of photography as a recording medium. The end results are images that are, among other things, traces of a process that is akin to improvisational music insofar as it allows, even thrives on, spontaneity and accident. London-based Antony Cairns produces traces of a different kind, his shadow-images of London at night emanating an almost ghostly atmosphere that is both Ballardian and oddly Victorian. His e-ink screens encapsulated in Perspex frames are shown in a large grid, each one a glimpse of a cityscape, indistinct yet recognisable, familiar yet unknowable. The ghosts of photography’s past haunt these images: the monochrome textures and shadowlands of Strand, Stieglitz, Steichen and Brassaï – the flaneurs and psychogeographers of another time who sensed the medium’s singular possibilities, not just to reflect the real, but to transform it into another kind of abstract art.

He had bought a house, so I moved in with him. He has spent a lot on renovating the house, and we are very comfortable and happy there – albeit that I don’t own any of it. I am in my 30s, and have the means to buy a place myself and ideally that is what I would have liked to do before I moved in with my partner. I have spent more than a decade paying rent at various houses while deciding where to settle down and I really don’t want to be paying rent any more as I feel like it’s throwing money into the wind. However, my partner expects me to pay him rent. We haven’t discussed details of how much yet, but it will be in the hundreds per month – and because I see that this relationship will probably be a lasting one (I know he sounds like a bastard, but he’s a really nice guy) – this is not viable in the long term. I would prefer to pay him monthly, and get something in return – like a percentage of the house or something. Basically I’d like some security that I’m not wasting my money. AN A If you move in with someone and the house is only in that person’s name, you usually have no rights to own any of it unless you can prove that you have contributed to the deposit or mortgage payments or you have made some other financial commitment – such as paying for renovations – and it was agreed that you would own a share of the home. The fact that your partner is talking in terms of charging you rent rather than suggesting you share the cost of the mortgage and other bills makes it very clear that he doesn’t want you to have any claims on the property. So, no, I don’t think that you’ll be able to get anything in return for paying him monthly rent unless he agrees that you will (which I very much doubt). However, as your partner has decided to treat you as a lodger, it seems only fair that you get a room to call your own in exchange for the rent you pay. When discussing how much you have to pay, it would be worth pointing out that any rent above £7,500 a year (£625 a month) is taxable whereas simply splitting the bills wouldn’t be."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"politics/2018/apr/30/amber-rudd-resignation-ministers-rally-round-theresa-may","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-30T09:32:23Z","webTitle":"Ministers rally round Theresa May after Amber Rudd resigns","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/apr/30/amber-rudd-resignation-ministers-rally-round-theresa-may","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/apr/30/amber-rudd-resignation-ministers-rally-round-theresa-may","fields":{"headline":"Ministers rally round Theresa May after Amber Rudd resigns","bodyText":"Ministers have moved swiftly to try to protect Theresa May after the resignation of Amber Rudd, insisting the home secretary only stood down because she inadvertently misled MPs, not because of the wider Windrush migration scandal. As the prime minister announced Sajid Javid would replace Rudd, the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, rejected the idea that May was facing pressure over her own position. “This is about sorting out a problem,” he told Sky News. “The prime minister has apologised to these people, and we’re going to get on with the job of fixing it.” The home secretary announced her resignation on Sunday after a series of revelations in the Guardian about problems faced by Windrush-generation residents culminated in a leak on Friday that appeared to show she was aware of targets for removing people who were in the country illegally. The pressure increased on Sunday afternoon as the Guardian revealed that in a leaked 2017 letter to May, Rudd had told the prime minister of her intention to increase deportations by 10% – seemingly at odds with her recent denials that she was aware of deportation targets. Rudd was facing a bruising appearance in the House of Commons on Monday, having to explain again why she told the home affairs select committee last week that she did not know of any deportation targets. Grayling denied that May would herself have known about the targets when she was home secretary for six years. “You’re talking about operational targets, on the ground, in individual teams,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “Ministers don’t see what’s happening in every corner of their department all the time.” Grayling dismissed Labour’s demand that the prime minister should appear before MPs herself on Monday to explain events: “She’s going to be back in the House of Commons on Wednesday. The opposition will have the opportunity to question her then.” Grayling said Rudd had spoken “in good faith” and had stepped down because “she had inadvertently misled parliament, that she should have known a bit more about the issue of targets”. He told Sky: “It doesn’t often happen in politics, and people criticise when it doesn’t happen. What we’ve got here is a former home secretary who acted on principle.” Grayling insisted Rudd’s departure had nothing to do with the wider issue of members of the Windrush generation of arrivals from the Caribbean being wrongly targeted by immigration authorities, or with the hostile environment immigration policy initiated by May when she was home secretary. “The Windrush issue is something we all regret,” he said. “It’s a mistake, the government’s apologised, the prime minister has apologised, the former home secretary apologised for it. That isn’t the issue that led to her resignation. The issue is about her inadvertently misleading the house in good faith.” Asked on Today who was to blame for Windrush, Grayling said it had been “a circumstance of people who didn’t have the requisite records, who had every right to be here, and the system was not simply geared up to deal with that rather unusual circumstance”. The shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, disputed this, and said May also should come to the Commons to explain herself to MPs. “Fundamentally, the reason [Rudd] had to resign was because of the Windrush fiasco,” Abbott told the Today programme. “Somebody had to take responsibility. It happened on her watch, therefore I think it’s right she has resigned.” On May addressing MPs, Abbott said: “In the first instance we’d like to know if she herself knew about the targets and would therefore be in a position to say whether Amber Rudd misled the house. “More fundamentally, we want to talk to her about the aspects of the so-called hostile environment, which she was responsible for and led to the Windrush fiasco.” In her resignation letter to the prime minister, published hours after the latest leak, Rudd said she had “become aware of information provided to my office which makes mention of targets. I should have been aware of this, and I take full responsibility that I was not.” May replied that she believed Rudd had given her evidence “in good faith”, but she could “understand why, now you have had a chance to review the advice that you have received on this issue, you have made the decision you have made, and taken responsibility for inadvertently misleading the home affairs select committee”. May said Rudd had led her department with “great integrity, compassion and selflessness – notwithstanding the personal and political challenges you have faced during this period”. The process that led to Rudd’s departure began on Wednesday when the Labour MP Yvette Cooper challenged her repeatedly at the home affairs select committee about removals targets, prompting Rudd to insist “that’s not how we operate”. Former ministerial colleagues paid tribute to Rudd and expressed hope she would return. The health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, said Rudd would “be missed until she is back, which she will be”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/may/01/penny-wong-says-labor-will-try-and-undo-abbotts-legacy-on-climate-policy","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-30T18:00:18Z","webTitle":"Penny Wong says Labor will try and undo Abbott's legacy on climate policy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/may/01/penny-wong-says-labor-will-try-and-undo-abbotts-legacy-on-climate-policy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/may/01/penny-wong-says-labor-will-try-and-undo-abbotts-legacy-on-climate-policy","fields":{"headline":"Penny Wong says Labor will try and undo Abbott's legacy on climate policy","bodyText":"The shadow foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, says Labor will beef up international approaches to combating climate change, including with work in the Pacific and with Asean countries, in an effort to restore lost credibility as a consequence of repealing the carbon price. Wong will use a speech to a climate conference in Melbourne on Tuesday to commit Labor to reinstituting the position of climate change ambassador, and broadening Australia’s work in the Pacific through the Council of Regional Organisations of the Pacific, the Pacific Islands Forum, the Pacific Community (formerly the South Pacific Commission) and the secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Program. The shadow foreign minister will argue Australia, if it wants to be a serious international player on global warming, needs to demonstrate constructive internationalism. According to speaking notes circulated in advance, Wong will argue regional partnerships are particularly important “whether they are Pacific island states facing catastrophic consequences from rising sea levels or Asian archipelagic and riverine delta states facing recurrent inundation of crop lands”. Wong will say that, if Bill Shorten wins the next election, Labor will be looking for opportunities to work with organisations including the Asian Development Bank, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, the secretariat of the UNFCC and the Green Climate Fund, “or other nations that wish to contribute of climate change mitigation and adaptation programs in our region”. As well as creating an ambassadorial post with a international climate change focus, Wong will commit a future Labor government to “rebuilding” the technical and professional skills of the Department of Foreign Affairs. She will note that Australia’s foreign officials are highly proficient and dedicated “but they are spread thin, with virtually no redundancy in the system”. “Not only have the numbers of DFAT officers posted abroad been cut over the past two decades but, more significantly, core skills have been lost”. Wong will say that if the world is to limit global warming to two degrees, “constructive internationalists need to build the coalitions to achieve that, and to develop the evidence-based policies that are the key to concerted action”. She will argue that Australian officials in the decade after Kevin Rudd ratified the Kyoto protocol “built up a valuable reputation across all the technical areas of climate policy, from carbon pricing mechanisms and accounting regimes to forests and land use”. “We were respected for the ability of our specialists to bring a sound evidence base to the development of globally effective policy to underpin credible, durable and effective international agreements”. “That’s what [Tony] Abbott and [Malcolm] Turnbull have given up. And as with so many of their policies – the constant hacking at the aid budget for instance – they have diminished Australia’s influence and voice in the world.” Wong will argue the Abbott government’s decision to repeal the carbon price after the 2013 election damaged Australia’s international reputation as a country willing to pursue positive action to mitigate the risks of climate change. “Before prime minister Abbott was elected, Australia had been building a growing reputation as a forward-thinking and serious contributor to global climate change policy, due principally to the excellent work done by senior Australian officials and our diplomats,” she will say. “We need to restore Australia’s credibility and reputation as a creative, collaborative and energetic member of the community of nations that actually want to get on with reducing carbon pollution, designing and implementing global targets, and staying within the two degree limit – as we can and must if we are to meet our international obligations.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/blog/2018/apr/30/talking-horses-salisbury-on-as-chester-jumps-ship-to-join-sky-sports-horse-racing-tips","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-30T10:31:08Z","webTitle":"Talking Horses: Salisbury on as Chester jumps ship to join Sky Sports","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/apr/30/talking-horses-salisbury-on-as-chester-jumps-ship-to-join-sky-sports-horse-racing-tips","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2018/apr/30/talking-horses-salisbury-on-as-chester-jumps-ship-to-join-sky-sports-horse-racing-tips","fields":{"headline":"Talking Horses: Salisbury on as Chester jumps ship to join Sky Sports","bodyText":"The good news for Racing UK this morning is that the meeting at Salisbury has passed an 8am inspection and should proceed as planned, as it has escaped the rain affecting many parts of the country and none is expected before the meeting opens as 2pm. The bad news, however, is that two of its tracks – Chester and Bangor – will jump ship in March next year to join their big rivals At The Races, which will by then have been rebranded as Sky Sports Racing. If Chester cannot quite be called a jewel in the Racing UK crown, it is very much at the top of the second tier and it is also one of the most popular courses in the country in terms of its attendance. Confirmation that Sky Sports Racing will launch by the end of the year will be a live topic of conversation throughout the day, which has a full programme of five meetings including the ever-popular Windsor this evening. Windsor’s going remains good – “it looks like we’re going to be lucky with the weather” the track said on Twitter earlier today – but the ground will remain heavy at Salisbury, where there are a handful of horses scattered around the card with proven form on deep going. Beyeh (4.45) is certainly one of those, and while a 10-year-old mare is a somewhat unusual choice as the best bet of the day, she does have plenty to recommend her. She is a recent winner for one thing, although that was over hurdles at Fakenham and Mick Appleby’s mare is running on the Flat for the first time since October 2014 today. But her handicap mark has dropped significantly in the interim and she will race today off 54, the same mark off which she was an easy winner on heavy ground back in 2012. That was, admittedly, a long time ago, but Beyeh’s recent win showed she still has enough talent to get her head in front and Appleby may have found her an ideal opportunity to resume winning ways on the Flat. She is quite strong in the market this morning too, which is also encouraging, and a big run looks likely at around odds of 9-2. Glory Of Paris (2.30) is another leading contender with form on this ground, while Muscika (4.05) could run well at a decent price in the sprint handicap at Thirsk. Tivoli (3.15) stands out on the card at Wolverhampton, while Brockey Rise (5.10) and Flowing Clarets (6.10) are both worth an interest at Windsor later."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"society/2018/apr/30/woman-with-aspergers-ejected-from-cinema-for-laughing-at-western","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-30T12:51:57Z","webTitle":"BFI apologises after woman with Asperger's ejected from cinema","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/apr/30/woman-with-aspergers-ejected-from-cinema-for-laughing-at-western","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/apr/30/woman-with-aspergers-ejected-from-cinema-for-laughing-at-western","fields":{"headline":"BFI apologises after woman with Asperger's ejected from cinema","bodyText":"The British Film Institute has apologised after staff forcibly removed a woman with Asperger syndrome from the cinema in what onlookers described as a “disgusting” sign of “naked intolerance”. Tamsin Parker, 25, an artist and animator, was watching a screening at the BFI’s cinema on London’s South Bank of her favourite film – the spaghetti western The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, directed by Sergio Leone – with two friends. She was asked to leave for laughing too loudly. Parker’s mother, Lydia Parker, said some members of the audience applauded as she was removed: “[My daughter] said ‘I am autistic’ and a man said: ‘You’re retarded.’ Another man, who called her a bitch [for laughing], was thrown out, but only after she was.” Her mother added: “She was completely humiliated and it ruined her birthday.” The BFI released a statement saying it was sorry and had got it wrong in a “challenging and complex situation”. “We are taking this situation extremely seriously and this morning we have been investigating further ... We can and must do better in accommodating all the needs of our customers and we will be addressing what additional provisions and staff training we can put in place,” the institute said. Parker’s mother, who is speaking to a lawyer about what happened, said: “It would be nice to arrange a screening for Tamsin and her friends. The manager did not seem very apologetic at the time.” Parker was eager to see the BFI screening and has watched the film eight times, according to her mother, who went to collect her daughter after she was thrown out. “She was in floods of tears ... she was really scared,” her mother said. Lydia Parker, a theatre director, said it had been heartening to see messages of support on Twitter. The story has been shared widely on social media, with people voicing concern. One cinemagoer, Lloyd Shepherd, expressed his disgust after the incident. “She’d been laughing very loudly, but at moments which were supposed to be funny. Some people complained. She was dragged out shouting: ‘I’m sorry, I have Asperger’s.’ She was incredibly upset,” he said. He said some people applauded her removal while others were upset, with a large number leaving. “I am shaking with anger. That poor, poor woman. Just a little bit of empathy and everything would have been fine. Such naked intolerance. In the middle of London. Disgusting,” Shepherd said. Other witnesses tweeted: Parker’s sister, Sabrina Parker, tweeted that she had taken her sibling home to watch the rest of the movie. “Thank you for sharing this ... we’re horrified that they would treat her so badly,” she wrote. “Obviously she’s still very upset. It’s her favourite movie and it was her 25th birthday celebration.” The National Autistic Society said many autistic people felt venues were not autism-friendly enough, which is why it runs the autism friendly award to encourage businesses to be more accessible. The charity added that it works with cinemas and theatres to hold autism-friendly screenings. Jane Harris, the NAS’s director of external affairs, said the incident was shocking and a colleague was at the screening, “along with others who were equally distressed by what they had witnessed”. “It’s great to hear that so many audience members were sympathetic, but this incident shows just how far we have to go for autistic people to get the understanding they deserve,” she added. Harris said the NAS would be reaching out to the BFI to discuss ways to improve its staff members’ understanding of autism."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/apr/30/james-brokenshire-key-may-ally-returns-to-cabinet","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-30T10:30:25Z","webTitle":"James Brokenshire: key May ally returns to cabinet","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/apr/30/james-brokenshire-key-may-ally-returns-to-cabinet","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/apr/30/james-brokenshire-key-may-ally-returns-to-cabinet","fields":{"headline":"James Brokenshire: key May ally returns to cabinet","bodyText":"James Brokenshire’s return to the cabinet as housing and communities secretary just under four months after he left the government for health reasons fulfils his hope at the time that it was a temporary departure. The long-time ally of Theresa May stepped down as Northern Ireland secretary in January, saying it was to allow him to receive treatment for a lung lesion. It later emerged that Brokenshire had part of his right lung removed during cancer-related surgery. He has since talked about the importance of seeking early diagnosis and treatment for the illness. The MP for Old Bexley and Sidcup was back in parliament a month after the surgery, and with his recovery from the operation seemingly secure, it is little surprise to see Brokenshire back in government as part of May’s forced reshuffle following Amber Rudd’s departure. Her role as home secretary has been taken by Sajid Javid, whose communities role has, in turn, gone to Brokenshire. Having been in parliament since 2005, Brokenshire might have even expected to replace Rudd were it not for the fact it would have meant his possible prior knowledge of the Windrush crisis and immigration removal targets would have come under scrutiny. He spent two years from 2014 as an immigration minister, when May was home secretary, and four years before that as a more junior Home Office minister. He even pre-dated May in covering the area, spending four years from 2006 as a junior shadow home affairs minister. Brokenshire’s main moment in the limelight came shortly after he became an immigration minister: he lambasted the “wealthy metropolitan elite” for increasing immigration by employing overseas staff. The comments forced David Cameron to explain the immigration status of his family’s Nepalese nanny. Brokenshire’s close association with May saw him brought into the cabinet when she became prime minister, taking over the difficult brief of Northern Ireland secretary. He tried to resurrect the Northern Ireland power-sharing assembly, which collapsed in the wake of a scandal over money wasted on a renewable heating scheme. Here, Brokenshire was generally viewed as diligent and on top of his brief, if unexciting. His new brief is arguably just as precarious. In January, the department had its name changed from the Department for Communities and Local Government to the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government. This emphasised the government’s desperation to tackle the housing crisis, and May has since made a major speech on the issue. However, there is a sense that little has been achieved under Javid. Brokenshire must also get to grips with the aftermath of the Grenfell Tower fire, over which the government faces intense pressure from Labour and supporters of victims to rehouse those affected and sort out the wider problem of flammable cladding on other high-rise blocks."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/apr/30/avengers-infinity-war-star-wars-the-force-awakens-first-weekend-record-us-box-office","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-30T11:41:13Z","webTitle":"Avengers: Infinity War blasts Star Wars: The Force Awakens' first-weekend record at US box office","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/apr/30/avengers-infinity-war-star-wars-the-force-awakens-first-weekend-record-us-box-office","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/apr/30/avengers-infinity-war-star-wars-the-force-awakens-first-weekend-record-us-box-office","fields":{"headline":"Avengers: Infinity War blasts Star Wars: The Force Awakens' first-weekend record at US box office","bodyText":"Marvel’s new superhero movie Avengers: Infinity War has overhauled Star Wars: The Force Awakens’ opening-weekend record at the US box office, earning an estimated total of $258.2m since its release on Friday, almost $11m ahead of The Force Awakens’ total in 2015. Infinity War has also broken the record for a first weekend at the global box office as it posted a total of $640.9m, trouncing the previous best of $541.9m set by The Fate of the Furious in 2017. Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for box office tracker comScore, said: “Marvel methodically created the perfect blueprint for the success of Avengers: Infinity War over the past year by delivering four great films in a row in the run up to this monumental weekend. Having all these great characters in one perfectly presented popcorn movie made it a pop culture phenomenon – the very definition of ‘must see’ cinema.” On its way to dethroning Star Wars: The Force Awakens as the highest-earning opening film in the US and Canada, Infinity War recorded the highest-ever take for a Saturday ($83m) and Sunday ($61m). Box-office projections had suggested the film would reach $235m, and so was always on course to outdo all previous Marvel films, whose previous first-weekend record holder was The Avengers with $207m in 2012. Six of the top 10 highest opening films, however, are Marvel superhero movies, including Black Panther, Avengers: Age of Ultron and Iron Man 3. Outside the US, Infinity War scored a number of records across the world, including scoring biggest-ever opening weekend totals in the Philippines, Korea, Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia. The UK was the largest-earning territory behind the US, with $42.2m, though the film failed to overtake Spectre or The Force Awakens. Infinity War has still to open in two other major markets, Russia and China. Dergarabedian adds: “The results make total sense. The international marketplace is a key influencer on the content of and point of view of all Marvel movies.” Top 10 opening-weekend grossers at the US box office 1.

When I was a kid, it was Pokémon; when my stepson was little, it was Minecraft; now, of course, it is Fortnite, a colourful, battle royal-style shooter that’s currently so popular that pop star Drake and footballer Dele Alli are fans. When children get into things, they tend to do so quite intensely. (The concerningly detailed diagrams of the insides of Egyptian pyramids that I drew when I was nine are testament to that.) There is nothing wrong with a kid getting so into Fortnite that she wants to play it all the time; it’s just passion. Naturally we shouldn’t let them play it all the time, in the same way as we’d probably step in to prevent a 10-year-old watching six episodes of Stranger Things in a row. But there is nothing sinister about the current obsession with Fortnite, or with the game itself. Unlike some of the games that become YouTube-driven school crazes, it’s both appropriate for the age range and a very good game. Nonetheless, widespread parental concern has prompted the culture secretary to respond in the Daily Telegraph. “Too much screen time could have a damaging impact on our children’s lives,” Matt Hancock told the paper. “Whether it’s social media or video games, children should enjoy them safely and as part of a lifestyle that includes exercise and socialising in the real world. We’re looking at what more could be done in this area alongside game publishers, developers and other agencies to promote safety and support parents.” These remarks have, predictably if unfairly, been repackaged by both the Telegraph and the Daily Mail as an assertion that games themselves are in some way inherently dangerous to children (spoiler: they’re not). “Addictive online shooter games such as Fortnite have ‘damaging impact’ on the lives of children, warns culture secretary” is an especially creative interpretation of Hancock’s perfectly reasonable comments. What he was actually talking about was screen time. It is obvious to everyone that kids sometimes want to spend so long on phones and consoles that it can interfere with a healthy balance of other activities. This problem is not video-game-specific: actually, as a parent and a gamer, I would rather my kid spent a couple of hours having fun and hanging out with his friends in Fortnite than watching endless unmoderated garbage on YouTube, or scrolling mindlessly through Instagram memes. There are some problems, however, that are specific to video games. There is still a lack of awareness among parents who sometimes end up buying games that are age-inappropriate; I had to enlighten a parent just last week who thought that the 18 sticker meant simply that the game was difficult. Loot boxes, meanwhile, are an insidious invention that encourages players to pay real money for a chance at getting a virtual item; these have been likened to gambling, and several countries, including Belgium, are considering making them illegal. Other games, particularly those played on smartphones and tablets, and which bill themselves as free, are designed to extract money and attention from players with countdown timers and “streak” mechanics that encourage you to come back several times a day, or spend money to speed up progress. These kinds of brain-hacks can be used for good in apps that help people form new fitness habits or learn a language, but in games, they can often be exploitative – especially when it comes to kids. Rather than one-off purchases, the online economy values people’s sustained attention, encouraging genuinely insidious ways of keeping people hooked on services, apps and games. It’s the same principle that has turned Facebook a bit evil. If games publishers don’t wish to justify the the concern that popular games often attract, they would do well to veer away from these social-media-style practices and prioritise a fun – and safe – experience for players. Happily, Fortnite is not a game that parents need to be overly worried about: like the majority of video games out there, its monetisation is transparent, fair and far from exploitative. As long as reasonable screen-time restrictions are in place, it’s not going to harm anyone. The best thing that parents can do is be aware of what kids are playing – so instead of panicking, why not join in?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/live/2018/may/02/roma-v-liverpool-champions-league-semi-final-second-leg-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-02T21:04:45Z","webTitle":"Roma 4-2 Liverpool (agg: 6-7): Champions League semi-final – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2018/may/02/roma-v-liverpool-champions-league-semi-final-second-leg-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2018/may/02/roma-v-liverpool-champions-league-semi-final-second-leg-live","fields":{"headline":"Roma 4-2 Liverpool (agg: 6-7): Champions League semi-final – as it happened","bodyText":"There can be no doubt that Liverpool deserve to be in the final. They’ve scored so many goals, they’ve seen off Manchester City and they’ve outdone the team that put out Barcelona. Mind you, Roma will argue they should have had two penalties in the second half tonight and it will concern Jurgen Klopp that Liverpool ended up conceding four goals against a team they outplayed for much of the tie. That will be a big worry before they face Real Madrid and Cristiano Ronaldo, who will surely have taken note of some of the defending here. But Madrid will have concerns of their own, chiefly that red swarm of an attack, with Sadio Mane flying, Roberto Firmino scheming and Mohamed Salah inspiring. If nothing else it should be a fabulous, free-scoring final. But that’s all from me tonight. I’ll leave you with Daniel Taylor’s on-the-whistle match report. Enjoy! “Boring” James Milner is asked if he’ll have a glass of red wine tonight. “Maybe for a few of the boys. You know me, maybe I’ll stretch myself to a glass of ribena or something.” James Milner speaks! “I don’t know what to say. We know how to make it interesting, don’t we? Brilliant football first half. Second half they put pressure on us, they’re a fantastic team. We need to do better. The penalty was a bit harsh and the first goal was a bit ridiculous. You can do that 1000 times and it’s not going to happen again. But to get to a Champions League final, nobody said that was easy and we’ve beaten some good teams. It was all about getting the job done and we’ve done that, no matter how difficult we made it.” Steven Gerrard speaks! “I don’t really remember much about the final I lost but I do remember Istanbul changed my life. When you deliver the Champions League trophy for your club it’s a life-changing experience and these lads can do it.” Andy Robertson says a few more words. “You look back at what I was doing last season, fighting for our lives at Hull. Unfortunately we fell short. We’ll enjoy Kiev. It’s all leading up to that game. We’ll go in as underdogs but sometimes that can be a good thing.” “Oh Andy, Andy! Andy, Andy, Andy, Andy Robertson!” chant the Liverpool fans. Admit it, you never thought Andy Robertson would be in a Champions League final. But here he is. “What a thing to be involved in,” the left-back says. “The lads and our fans deserve it. We’ll have a great day in Kiev regardless of the result. It’s hard when you come and defend a lead. You need to remember you’re defending that lead to make that final.” “Madrid in the final, it won’t be easy, a fantastic team,” Jordan Henderson says. “But we’ll go there with confidence and give it everything.” Gini Wijnaldum, who scored his first away goal for Liverpool, explains that he was standing unmarked and headed the ball past the goalkeeper. More when we have it. Jordan Henderson speaks! “We never do it the easy way unfortunately. Amazing effort. We knew it would be tough. We did well, scored some good goals. Overall I thought we handled the situation well apart from maybe the last 10 minutes of the second half, conceding two goals. We need to stop that.” Appreciative applause greets the final whistle, the Roma fans recognising the effort from their side. It was too little, too late from Roma, who have paid for shocking defending across both legs in the end. Down 5-2 after being battered at Anfield, they made it too difficult for themselves and Liverpool, despite losing on the night, are through to the final. It’s not like the visiting fans care about their team’s dodgy defending. They’re in their first Champions League final since 2007! The Liverpool players are celebrating in front of their fans. Jurgen Klopp is on the pitch, beaming as he embraces the injured Adam Lallana. The German has taken this proud club back to the European football’s top table. Liverpool will play Real Madrid in the European Cup final on 26 May! Nainggolan smashes it down the middle! But there’s surely no time for another. 90 min+3: A long ball into the area. Under tries to get round Klavan. It hits Klavan on the arm and a penalty’s awarded! Harsh! 90 min+2: Nathaniel Clyne replaces Trent Alexander-Arnold, eating up more time. Ring of Fire is blaring out from the away end. 90 min+1: Solanke has been booked. There will only be three added minutes. I challenge Liverpool to concede again. 90 min: Fazio’s offside from Florenzi’s free-kick. Why? 89 min: Milner fouls Schick on the right. Roma will load the box. 87 min: Dominic Solanke replaces Roberto Firmino. Nainggolan lets a pass from Kolarov run across his body and then he makes sweet contact with the ball, drilling a low shot into the bottom-right corner from 20 yards! Roma need two more goals! Is it still on? 84 min: Robertson fouls Florenzi, prompting Manolas to charge across to confront the left-back. Manolas is booked and takes a while to cool down. 83 min: Ragnar Klavan replaces the excellent Sadio Mane. Liverpool will switch to three at the back to see themselves over the line. 80 min: Dzeko is so persistent. He breaks through on the left and, from an angle, screws a low shot towards the far corner. Karius fumbles his save and he’s relieved to see Lovren hack the ball clear a few yards from the line. Liverpool have not defended well in the second half. Cristiano Ronaldo must be looking forward to playing them. 79 min: Dzeko sends a snapshot just wide. It’s not happening for Roma. The Liverpool fans are sounding triumphant. 78 min: “As this match passes the 75-minute mark, that old saying comes to mind,” says Peter Oh. “When in Rome...park the bus!!!” 75 min: Stephan El Shaarawy limps off, Mirko Antonucci replacing him. 71 min: Gonalons blasts over from 20 yards. I suspect Roma are done here. It might have been different if that penalty had been given for the Alexander-Arnold handball, but they probably had to score during that spell. 69 min: Liverpool threaten at last, Salah slipping a pass through to Firmino, whose shot’s saved by the feet of Alisson. Roma make their final change, Maxime Gonalons replacing Daniele De Rossi. 67 min: Dzeko has another sighter, turning the ball over after a pass from Nainggolan. 66 min: Dzeko seizes on a loose ball and finds Kolarov on the left. Kolarov zips a low cross into the middle and Karius manages to divert it away from the Roma forwards. Liverpool hastily scramble the ball clear, but Roma aren’t done yet. De Rossi chests the ball down and then he lofts it over the top to Dzeko, who’s onside. He takes it in his stride and shoots wide. That was a good chance. Liverpool are making this more stressful than it needs to be. 63 min: Nainggolan trundles down the right and his deflected cross runs to Dzeko. He turns it into the middle and Schick almost bundles it in. The ball runs to El Shaarawy after an almighty scramble and he blasts a volley goalwards from a few yards out, only for Alexander-Arnold to deflect it over. A replay shows that Alexander-Arnold handled it. That should have been a penalty. Roma should have had two since half-time. 61 min: Mane heads wide from close range. He was offside, though. 60 min: This was almost it. De Rossi lifts a lovely ball over the top. Under somehow volleys it goalwards, but Karius plunges down to save and hold the shot. 59 min: Roma are trying to quicken the pace. You sense they need a third sooner rather than later, though, just to make Liverpool think a bit. Liverpool’s position is still commanding, even though their fans will be panicking again. 56 min: The free-kick’s on the left corner of the Liverpool area. Kolarov lifts it to the far post and Dzeko heads over. 55 min: Liverpool won’t stop attacking. Salah finds Robertson overlapping on the left, but the left-back’s inviting low cross zips all the way across the face of goal. Up the other end, Dzeko’s barged over by Alexander-Arnold on the edge of the area. 54 min: I think El Shaarawy’s effort was Roma’s first shot on target. Dzeko’s goal was their second. 53 min: Cengiz Under replaces Lorenzo Pellegrini. A mistake from El Shaarawy to dart down the left, cut inside and aim for the far corner with his right foot. Karius only manages to push the ball straight to Dzeko - he might have done better - and the Bosnian controls well before lifting a shot into the net. It’s not over yet. 49 min: All of a sudden Dzeko’s through on goal. He skips round Karius, who brings him down. But the flag’s up for offside. He looked onside actually. 47 min: El Shaarawy finds Dzeko in the area. Van Dijk steps in to concede a corner. Schick meets the corner, but Karius claims his header. 46 min: Liverpool, 45 minutes, from the European Cup final get the ball rolling again. “Shout out to Karius who still gets a lot of undue stick but along with Van Dijk has had a big stabilising effect on the defence and never gets much credit for how aggressive and assertive he is at coming out to deal with crosses,” Richard South says. “He doesn’t hide and he’s made some great claims and relieved pressure, it’d be nice to see him get a bit of acknowledgment; I mean, he’s far from perfect but my days is he ever an upgrade on Mignolet!” “Nobody played Wijnaldum onside!” Andrew Swift points out. “The ball was played back in by Dzeko, not a Liverpool player. Offside was never a question.” It looks like it was Federico Fazio who played Gini Wijnaldum onside for the second goal. Roma have defended so badly. If Liverpool don’t go through they have to build a statue of Sir Alex Ferguson outside Anfield. Roma need four goals just to force extra-time. 45 min: Pellegrini blooters the free-kick into the Tiber. 44 min: Lovren leans into El Shaarawy deep on the left, just outside the Liverpool area, and earns a booking. 42 min: Florenzi has a sight of goal, 15 yards out, but he slashes well wide. 41 min: A replay shows it was a bit of a dive from El Shaarawy, who tried to fool the referee into thinking Alexander-Arnold fouled him. 40 min: El Shaarawy tumbles in the area. No penalty. 35 min: De Shaarawy shimmies to earn a yard of space on the left. His tame shot from 20 yards takes a deflection off Milner and spins past Karius, who’s grateful to see it hit the left post and bounce to safety. Milner’s having a strange night. 34 min: What must Barcelona be thinking, though? 32 min: I’m going to turn over to Secret Life Of The Zoo on Channel 4 for a bit. Let me know if anything happens, yeah? 29 min: A throw from the right finds Firmino, who flicks the ball through to Salah. De Rossi desperately pushes the ball behind. Roma are creaking badly. Can this really be the team that stunned Barcelona? Here’s the thing: Liverpool have made them look second rate. 28 min: That should surely see Liverpool safely through. Their fans can start thinking about how to get to Kiev. Roma will do well not to totally collapse from here. Milner’s corner looks like it will lead to nothing. It’s headed high into the air. But when it drops, Dzeko only succeeds in inadvertently heading it back towards his own goal. Wijnaldum, played onside by Florenzi, has the simple task of nodding the ball past Alisson! What a soft goal. Roma need four more just to force extra-time. 25 min: Liverpool attack for the first time in a while, Robertson brilliantly surging down the left, away from Schick and charging past Florenzi before cutting the ball back to Mane. He looks certain to score his second, only for Alisson to turn his close-range shot behind for a corner! 24 min: Alexander-Arnold’s down for a moment. Kolarov stood on his right foot. Ouch. He’s okay, though. 23 min: Karius claims a high cross, relieving some pressure. Good, assertive goalkeeping. Liverpool don’t need to panic. It’s hard to see them failing to score again. 20 min: Kolarov’s corner is headed away. “This has extra time written all over it,” says Jim Denvir. 19 min: Dzeko turns and feeds Kolarov. Lovren turns the Serbian’s cross behind. 17 min: James Milner was unlucky to see that crash off him and end up in the Liverpool net. But it was the shaky defending from Liverpool that makes you think they’ll struggle against Real Madrid in the final. Well, assuming they get there. But you have to wonder what Ronaldo would do to this defence. 16 min: The Roma fans have livened up again. The whistles are back. Mane curls one wide from 20 yards, earning jeers from the crowd. Florenzi charges down the right and whips a deep cross to the far post. El Shaarawy rises above Alexander-Arnold and heads it into the six-yard box. Lovren, who’s prone to an error, strikes his clearance straight against Milner and the ball rebounds into the net, Karius unable to do anything about it! Oh dear! What misfortune! Roma are back in it. 14 min: Van Dijk masterfully wins the ball of Dzeko and sets off on the break. Liverpool have so much space. The ball eventually comes to Salah on the right. He cuts inside and tries to bend one with his left foot from 20 yards. But it’s straight at Alisson. 13 min: “SAAAAAAADIO OLIMPICOOOOOOOO!!!” says Peter Oh. 11 min: Roma look for a swift response, Dzeko making a nuisance of himself again. He can’t get a shot away, though. They might not recover from that awful error from Nainggolan. 10 min: Liverpool almost break through again, with Roma stunned, but the ball runs away from Salah in the area and Alisson gathers. Under little pressure near the halfway line, Radja Nainggolan scuffs a dismal pass inside to Roberto Firmino. Mistake. Roma are exposed and Firmino bursts forward, bides his time and then releases Mane to his left. Mane, who was wasteful last week, takes a touch and then lashes a left-footed shot past Alisson! What a start for Liverpool! Their fans go crazy and Roma need four goals now! 8 min: A huge roar from the Liverpool end, where the fans reckon their team should have a penalty, Manolas laying his hands on Mane’s back. The Senegalese goes down but play goes on. That looked risky from Manolas. 6 min: Roma’s direct approach is causing problems. Another long ball gives Dzeko a chance to use his muscular frame. He shakes off Robertson but the ball won’t come down for him to shoot. He’s forced a bit wide and there’s no one to convert his cross in the middle. Roma keep coming, though, and soon Florenzi’s whistling a shot just wide from 25 yards. This has been a good start from the Italians.”Can I express my surprise that Fazio is playing in a Champions League semi final,” says John Turnbridge. “In his time at Spurs he never seemed capable of tying his own shoe laces.” 5 min: De Rossi clobbers Salah in the middle, kneeing him up the backside. He apologises to his former team-mate. That’s nice of him. I’m sure it was heartfelt. Unlike the foul. 4 min: The corner leads to another piece of jittery Liverpool defending, but they eventually get the ball to safety. Roma fancy themselves here. 3 min: Kolarov slides a pass down the left and El Shaarawy muscles Alexander-Arnold off the ball. He plays it back to Kolarov, whose cross is deflected behind for a corner. 2 min: If the Roma fans think this is over, they’re hiding it well. What an atmosphere. Liverpool will need ear plugs if Roma score early. Peep! Roma, in dark red, get the game underway. They’re kicking from right to left and they’re on the attack straight away, pumping the ball into the Liverpool area. There’s a brief spell of panic before Mane cuts out Dzeko’s pass. Liverpool, by the way, are in white shirts and black shorts. And they’re under pressure. Roma go direct again, El Shaarawy hooking a ball into the middle, Dzeko heading wide of the left post! Liverpool have been warned. Here come the teams! We’ve already had some incredible games in this season’s Champions League and we could be in for another one tonight. It’s Roma, it’s Liverpool, it’s the Stadio Olimpico, and it’s about to begin. Roma have a three-goal deficit to chase. Liverpool have a 5-2 lead to protect. Expect drama. Jurgen Klopp speaks! “I am as happy as you can be before the game. I want to be happy after the game. We did what we had to do and now we can start. You see the line-up of Roma. We win at home with a good result and it is clear the opponent wants to strike back. It is always clear we have to work again. We are here not to defend the three-goal lead, we are here to win a football game. Why should we change that? We know we have to defend with all we have but we will play football as well. Tonight we have to take both halves. It is going to be a very intense start and we have to be ready.” Roma, of course, haven’t been in the final since 1984. The Stadio Olimpico’s filling up and the atmosphere is building. Liverpool will need to keep their heads in this din. I was at the Barcelona game and could barely hear myself think. The Liverpool team emerges for the warm-up. The whistles from the home fans are ear-splitting. Future Rangers manager - or prospective Rangers manager - Steven Gerrard is in the BT studio. He’s asked about Jurgen Klopp’s No2, Zeljko Buvac, stepping away from Liverpool and insists that it won’t be an issue tonight. Maybe Gerrard could link up with Buvac at Arsenal, eh? More of your emails! “Liverpool are an utterly different animal from the Sevilla final,” Ian Copestake says. “Keeping Moreno on the sidelines so he can watch how returning players should play for their current side not their previous one is a vital difference.” “Looking at Liverpool’s bench, do they even make a substitution today?” says Isaac Griffith. “My friend Sally is already writing Madrid off, let alone Roma, and thinks her team Liverpool have their name on the trophy,” Stephen Yoxall says. “The stars certainly seem to be aligning for them but Roma are yet to concede at home, and if they do make it, as is likely, Madrid are no mugs at this level. Either way, tonight and the final promise to be great games. The tournament is so open nowadays. Is defending a lost art in the modern game?” “That is my ideal line-up,” Marie Meyer says. “But the bench...terrifying. Please, starting XI: safety first!” Roma have switched from a back three to a back four. Juan Jesus drops to the bench, as does Cengiz Under, and Kevin Strootman is injured. Lorenzo Pellegrini, Patrick Schick and Stephan El Shaarawy come into an attacking team. Liverpool had a few injury worries but Trent Alexander-Arnold, Jordan Henderson and Sadio Mane are fit to start. That means there’s only one change from the first leg, Gini Wijnaldum replacing the desperately unfortunate Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, who’s out for the season and the World Cup with a knee injury. Roma: Alisson; Florenzi; Manolas, Fazio, Kolarov; De Rossi, Pellegrini, Nainggolan; Schick, Dzeko, El Shaarawy. Subs: Skorupski, Juan, Under, Gonalons, Gerson, Peres, Antonucci. Liverpool: Karius; Alexander-Arnold, Lovren, Van Dijk, Robertson; Henderson, Milner, Wijnaldum; Salah, Firmino, Mane. Subs: Mignolet, Clyne, Klavan, Moreno, Ings, Solanke, Woodburn. Referee: Damir Skomina (Slovenia). Jurgen Klopp: a positive man. You’d want to play for him, wouldn’t you? It sounds like the security outside the Stadio Olimpico is very heavy. The buildup has been dominated by safety concerns, with Liverpool fans warned to be careful on their way to the ground. What a shame we have to think of these things. It’s only football. We have our first emailer. “Klopp has learned his lesson from Europa meltdown vs Sevilla,” says Brandon Dwonch. “Going to play counter. MOTM, Gini. He solidifies his role in midfield for next season. 2-2.” Pre-match reading Hello. I watched last week’s first leg with a couple of Liverpool fans. When it was over they both frowned and sighed and huffed. They both wore concerned expressions and, if you hadn’t seen the game, you would have thought that Liverpool had just been tonked 10-0. “Look on the bright side,” I said, hoping to cheer them up. “You probably would have taken 5-2 at kick-off.” True story. A real doozy. Haven’t made up a bit of it. And although we could spend the next few paragraphs focusing on a very insightful and sensitive comment by yours truly, the point here is that the game did actually go pretty well for Liverpool. They scored five goals! Mohamed Salah ripped his former team to shreds! Roberto Firmino is a genius! Sadio Mane showed terrific mentality to get over a couple of dismal misses early on! They’ve already beaten Manchester City! They’re managed by Jurgen Klopp! They haven’t won the league for a few years – can anyone remember how long it’s been? – but they’re on the brink of their first European Cup final since 2007! Everything’s coming up Liverpool! Or is it? Because when I asked another Liverpool fan how he was feeling on Monday night, he turned a very deep shade of green. I appealed to his sense of logic and reason but he wasn’t having any of it. He lived through Crystanbul, man. He’s seen things. He knows what this team can be like on a bad day. We all remember the second half in Seville and the late collapse at the Hawthorns the other day. We’ve all seen Loris Karius play football and we watched in awe as Roma, who can play some serious stuff when the mood takes them, pulled off an incredible comeback against Barcelona in their quarter-final. Another 3-0 win would have the Stadio Olimpico in a state of ecstasy again. In this year of shocks, is it so outlandish to think that Eusebio Di Francesco’s side, who haven’t conceded a home goal in the Champions League this season, have got it in them? You never know. But surely this is totally ridiculous. Liverpool were 5-0 up in the first leg. They still won 5-2 despite a late wobble. They’re the highest scoring team in the competition and they have James Milner, assist machine. Oh, and Salah. Roma will be terrified whenever the Egyptian ... king ... has the ball. Basically, if Liverpool fail to join Real Madrid in the Kiev on 26 May, they should change their name to Manchester United Reserves. Kick-off: 7.45pm BST, 8.45pm in Rome."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"science/2018/may/02/stephen-hawkings-final-theory-sheds-light-on-the-multiverse","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-02T14:39:23Z","webTitle":"Stephen Hawking's final theory sheds light on the multiverse","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/may/02/stephen-hawkings-final-theory-sheds-light-on-the-multiverse","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2018/may/02/stephen-hawkings-final-theory-sheds-light-on-the-multiverse","fields":{"headline":"Stephen Hawking's final theory sheds light on the multiverse","bodyText":"Reality may be made up of multiple universes, but each one may not be so different to our own, according to Stephen Hawking’s final theory of the cosmos. The work, completed only weeks before the physicist’s death in March, paints a simpler picture of the past 13.8 billion years than many previous theories have proposed. Published on Wednesday in the Journal of High Energy Physics, the new work is the result of a long collaboration with Thomas Hertog, a Belgian physicist at the Catholic University of Leuven. “We sat on this one for a very long time,” Hertog said. “I do believe he was really fond of it.” Hertog travelled to Cambridge to work on the theory with Hawking and towards the end, communication became very difficult, he said. “I always had the impression that he never wanted to quit and, in a way, this was Hawking. He never showed any sign of wanting to quit.” “It was never said between us that this would be the last paper. I personally felt this might be the conclusion of our journey, but I never told him.” Modern physics has more than one theory of how the universe came to be, but one of the most popular ideas is that the big bang was followed by repeated bursts of ‘cosmic inflation’ which created an endless number of ‘pocket universes’ that are now scattered throughout space. “The usual theory of eternal inflation predicts that globally our universe is like an infinite fractal, with a mosaic of different pocket universes separated by an inflating ocean,” Hawking said last autumn. But in the latest work, Hawking and Hertog challenge that view. Instead of space being filled with pocket universes where radically different laws of physics apply, these alternate universes may not actually vary that much from one another. While the consequences of the proposal may not be obvious, the theory may provide some comfort to physicists who wonder how, given all the hostile variations thought possible, we find ourselves in a universe well-suited to life. “In the old theory there were all sorts of universes: some were empty, others were full of matter, some expanded too fast, others were too short-lived. There was huge variation,” said Hertog. “The mystery was why do we live in this special universe where everything is nicely balanced in order for complexity and life to emerge?” “This paper takes one step towards explaining that mysterious fine tuning,” Hertog added. “It reduces the multiverse down to a more manageable set of universes which all look alike. Stephen would say that, theoretically, it’s almost like the universe had to be like this. It gives us hope that we can arrive at a fully predictive framework of cosmology.” The new theory takes work that Hawking and the US physicist James Hartle published in the 1980s and updates it with the more powerful, modern mathematical techniques used in string theory. In string theory, reality is described through the interactions of one-dimensional objects known as cosmic strings. “Stephen himself said that this work was the area he was most proud of,” said Malcolm Perry, a colleague of Hawking’s at Cambridge University. The new paper will not be the last to bear Hawking’s name, however. With Andrew Strominger at Harvard, Perry has written at least two papers with Hawking on black holes which are still being readied for publication. Hawking, who rose to fame on the back of his bestselling book, A Brief History of Time, died on 14 March, aged 76, at his home in Cambridge. His ashes will be interred at Westminster Abbey near the grave of Sir Isaac Newton during a thanksgiving service later this year. Hertog believes that his work with Hawking is one small step towards a theory of our cosmic origins that physicists could ultimately test. If the universe has evolved as the theory predicts, he says, it may have left a telltale signature on gravitational waves, or the so-called cosmic microwave background, the radiation that was released at the birth of the universe. “There may be clues in those signals as to whether or not we are on the right tracks,” he said. ”I’m reasonably hopeful that both further observations and further work on the theory will eventually enable us to test our models of the big bang,” Hertog added. “We are not doing this for Platonic pleasure. Though it is fun.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2018/may/02/elderly-couple-face-losing-home-as-interest-only-loan-crisis-bites","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-05T23:02:21Z","webTitle":"As the interest-only mortgage crisis hits, here’s how you can avoid the heartache","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/may/02/elderly-couple-face-losing-home-as-interest-only-loan-crisis-bites","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2018/may/02/elderly-couple-face-losing-home-as-interest-only-loan-crisis-bites","fields":{"headline":"As the interest-only mortgage crisis hits, here’s how you can avoid the heartache","bodyText":"Len and Val Fitzgerald won’t be the last people to find themselves staring down the possibility of losing their home. The couple, from Eastbourne in East Sussex, found themselves in the spotlight last week in a case which highlights the crisis involving Britain’s interest-only mortgages after it emerged Santander had launched repossession proceedings against them, even though they never missed a mortgage repayment. They are far from alone. There are about 1.67m interest-only mortgages outstanding in the UK. But while the Fitzgeralds face the prospect of being thrown “out into the street” according to their MP Stephen Lloyd, there are things that others can do to stave off this threat. The wider problem There have been numerous warnings about interest-only mortgages in recent years. Just weeks ago, the main UK regulator the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said it was “very concerned that a significant number of interest-only customers may not be able to repay the capital at the end of the mortgage and be at risk of losing their homes”. With this type of mortgage, the borrower agrees to pay off the interest each month but makes no capital repayments. Borrowers are expected to make sure they have an investment plan in place – usually an endowment policy – to pay off the debt at the end of the term. Some people face a shortfall because their investment has underperformed, while others never set anything up. In 2013 the FCA revealed that about 1.3 million homeowners faced an average shortfall of more than £71,000. However, the situation may have improved or worsened since then.This year alone, an estimated 85,000 interest-only mortgages are due to mature, and Lloyd said: “I am sure there are tens of thousands of other families potentially facing the same desperate situation [as the couple] in the coming years, which is unacceptable.” So what are the options? When someone with a maturing interest-only mortgage is unable to repay the capital but doesn’t want to sell their home, their lender will sometimes agree to extend the term of the mortgage while switching the loan to a repayment basis. But for many people, the maths on this won’t work because, as they will be paying back capital each month as well as interest, their repayments will be a lot higher. The FCA gives the example of someone whose 25-year, £125,000 interest-only mortgage is about to mature. They have been paying £313 a month, but even if their lender allows the term to be extended by 10 years and switched to repayment, they may find they can’t afford the new monthly payment, which in this example would be £1,208, assuming a 3% interest rate. Also, as is the case with the Fitzgeralds, the borrower’s age may be a big factor. One in nine of all interest-only mortgage-holders are 65-plus. Some lenders have a maximum age at the end of the term – for example, NatWest’s is 70. David Hollingworth at mortgage broker London &amp; Country says that if a homeowner is coming up against their lender’s age limit, this may shorten the mortgage term to such a degree that it means the payments would be unaffordable. However, he adds that some lenders have upped their maximum age, while others will consider lending into retirement. For example, in July 2016, Nationwide increased its maximum age for mortgage maturity from 75 to 85. But there are limits on its largesse: only retirement income can be used when calculating affordability, the maximum loan is £150,000, and the loan must be no more than 60% of the value of the borrower’s home. That and other restrictions mean that deals of this type won’t be open to everyone. Could equity release help? For those in a similar situation to the Fitzgeralds, equity release might be a solution. This is a way to get cash out of a property without the need to move home. Typically there are no monthly repayments. Leading providers include Aviva, Legal &amp; General, More 2 Life and Just. The number of people raiding the equity in their home to pay off their interest-only mortgage is thought to have gone up sharply. Specialist firm Key Retirement says it is finding that 21% of people signing up for equity release are using at least some of the cash to clear a home loan. The most common equity release schemes are mortgage-based products secured against your home and repaid when you die or go into long-term care. These are known as “lifetime mortgages”. Dean Mirfin at Key Retirement says: “Typically, the most a homeowner can raise via equity release is 55% of the value of their property, but this would naturally depend on factors such as the type of property, their age and health.” Some people with maturing interest-only mortgages won’t be eligible because their loan-to-value – the size of the mortgage in relation to its worth – will be too high. This is likely to be the case with the Fitzgeralds, whose Santander mortgage appears to be around 70% of their property’s value. Other options The good news is that there are a growing number of specialist products aimed at older people, including those coming to the end of an interest-only mortgage deal. There is the 55+ Mortgage from retirement specialist Hodge Lifetime, which, as the name suggests, is exclusively for over-55s, and is a standard mortgage where you pay the interest on the loan each month and retain 100% ownership of your property. Notably, the maximum term is up to the youngest borrower’s 95th birthday. The maximum loan-to-value on this deal is 60%. Similarly, Shawbrook Bank has the 55 Plus Interest-Only Mortgage. With this, the main income earner must be aged between 55-75 at the outset and have a minimum income of £16,500 a year, and must not be older than 85 at the end of the term, and there are minimum property value and minimum equity requirements. Family building society has a deal called Retirement Lifestyle Booster, a 10-year interest-only mortgage repaid with a lump sum at the end. With this, you can borrow up to 25% of the value of your property and use it, for example, to repay your existing mortgage. The youngest borrower must be at least 60 at the time of the application. ‘It’s a hell of a situation to be in’ The Fitzgeralds are in a bad position after remortgaging on to an eight-year interest-only mortgage in late 2007. Santander said the parties had originally agreed that when the loan ended the couple would sell the property to pay back the capital - but shortly before that date they decided they wanted to extend the term. Santander says that once a customer reaches 75 it is unable to lend beyond that point. Len Fitzgerald, 77, told his local paper he and his wife had called on Santander to extend the mortgage until they were 85, adding: “We hardly sleep. It’s a hell of a situation to be in.” The couple are said to owe around £180,000 (their remortgage was for £178,500) on a property estimated to be worth between £250,000 and worth up to £260,000. So if they sold the house, that would leave them with only £80,000, which would not be enough to buy another home in the area. It would arguably give them a decent pot of cash that they could use to rent a property. It’s not clear yet what will happen to the couple: a court date was set for the end of April, but Santander said it had agreed to a six-month breathing space to allow discussions to continue."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"society/2018/may/03/what-time-will-the-local-election-results-be-announced","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-03T05:21:51Z","webTitle":"When will the English local election results be announced?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/may/03/what-time-will-the-local-election-results-be-announced","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/may/03/what-time-will-the-local-election-results-be-announced","fields":{"headline":"When will the English local election results be announced?","bodyText":"10pm The polls close. With the majority of councils counting overnight, early signs of how the election has gone for the main parties should emerge within hours, while a handful of councils are waiting to declare results until Friday daytime. 11.45pm The television coverage starts in earnest, with Huw Edwards anchoring the BBC’s offering alongside political editor Laura Kuenssberg and polling guru John Curtice. Political guests will appear throughout the night, including from around 20 outside broadcasts around the country. Robert Peston will lead ITV’s big digital operation, outside its main news bulletins, from around 30 counts across the UK. 1am The first results will start to emerge, with Sunderland (safe for Labour, despite some local scandals) likely to be fastest to declare. It has announced its result first in six of the last seven general elections, so has a reputation to uphold. Safe Tory council Broxbourne will be snapping at its heels. Swindon, held by the Conservatives since 2004, will be the first Labour-Tory bellwether council to declare. Labour insiders believe that it is the one they need to win if they are going to return to government. Just four seats would do it. Jeremy Corbyn, who has visited five times in the last six months, will be watching closely. 1.30am The first sign that there could be a “mural effect” for Labour, with voters concerned about antisemitism, will come as the Prestwich wards in Bury declare. In 2016 there was a significant “Livingstone effect” as Labour did less well in seats with large Jewish populations than they might otherwise have been led to expect. 2am Wandsworth – the first of the Tory “crown jewels” councils – will declare. Labour will be waiting nervously to see how many gains they make in what was Margaret Thatcher’s favourite council. If they take it, it’s looking like a good night. But many party insiders are concerned they’ve raised expectations too high. Dan Jarvis, the MP for Barnsley Central, should walk the Sheffield mayoral election, which will prompt mixed reactions from the Labour leader’s office. While they’ll be happy to win the mayoralty the first time it is up for grabs, they may wish the party had been successful in its attempt to block the moderate from staying on as an MP. The big question here is whether the Tories manage to hang on in Trafford, which they hold by a single seat, to retain their speck of blue in a sea of red. Corbyn launched his local election campaign there to great fanfare but has been playing down expectations ever since. Theresa May visited earlier this week to shore up support. 2.30am If Labour take Westminster then they’re in for a stunning night in the capital – the council hasn’t been held by the party since its formation and they would need to win the ward in which Buckingham Palace sits to take it. More likely is that they’ll make gains, but that the Tories will hang on, albeit with a bloody nose. 3am Tower Hamlets will be the first of the mayoral results in the capital – and the only one in which there is any sort of question mark over a Labour win. There is difficult history here, and the police will be keeping a close eye on the polling booths, although a split in the former Tower Hamlets First party may make it easier for Labour’s John Biggs to hang on. The Tories took over control of Plymouth after the defection of three Ukip councillors originally elected in 2014, but a switch back to traditional Labour-voting habits, now that the eurosceptic party is in decline, could be enough to see Corbyn’s party take back the council. A big prize in a traditional marginal. 4am Top of Labour’s target list is Barnet in north London, which the Tories held with a majority of one until last month, when the borough fell under no overall control. Labour is expected to win, but the party faces a major hurdle in the form of the antisemitism row: the borough has the largest Jewish population in the UK. If Labour doesn’t take it, it will be a blow for Corbyn’s electoral chances. The Tories had a strong lead in Richmond-upon-Thames last time and it will be tough for the Lib Dems to dislodge them even in Vince Cable’s own backyard. But here it’s more Brexit than bins. The huge Remain vote – more than 70% of the electorate voted to stay in the EU – could result in a Lib Dem revival. 5am All eyes will be on Kensington and Chelsea – the most unpredictable result in the country – in the wake of Labour’s surprise general election win and the Grenfell tower disaster. On paper it looks like an almost insurmountable challenge for Labour, but many believe that the Conservative council’s poor handling of the tragedy could change things. Expect Labour to return big majorities in safe wards in the north of the borough, while the Tories’ grip on the true-blue south will keep them in power. The result in Thurrock should provide the best test of whether Ukip still has any electoral clout. In January all 17 Ukip councillors on the Essex council quit en masse to form a new group, denouncing the “bitter reality” of party politics. The Tories, who already control the council, are the likely beneficiaries. North-east Lincolnshire, where Ukip are defending a handful of seats, is another one to watch. 8am As voters sit down for breakfast, the spin machines of the main parties will go into action. The Tory party chairman, Brandon Lewis, is expected to battle it out on the airwaves with Labour’s elections chief Andrew Gwynne. However, with 50 of the 150 councils still to start counting, the struggle to set the narrative for these elections will go on for hours."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/may/06/shape-of-lights-100-years-photography-abstract-art-tate-modern-review","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-06T07:00:16Z","webTitle":"Shape of Light: 100 Years of Photography and Abstract Art review – interminable","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/may/06/shape-of-lights-100-years-photography-abstract-art-tate-modern-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/may/06/shape-of-lights-100-years-photography-abstract-art-tate-modern-review","fields":{"headline":"Shape of Light: 100 Years of Photography and Abstract Art review – interminable","bodyText":"Here are three ways to make an abstract photograph, courtesy of the enormous Shape of Light show at Tate Modern. Take a picture of a slab of concrete in crazy closeup. Photograph beer bottle caps arranged on a dark surface so they resemble an array of shining dots. Crouch at the foot of some very tall trees and point your lens directly upwards, so that the uppermost leaves appear like dark smudges against a pale expanse. Work only, and always, in black and white. So far, this is what might be called the alienation approach, which seems remarkably similar to the classic “guess the mystery object” quiz, in which some household utensil such as an egg whisk is colossally enlarged or shot from an unfamiliar angle. Thus what seems to be a gleaming abstract sculpture is, in fact, a bare thigh shot by Bill Brandt from below. That blizzard of sci-fi circles hurtling towards you from outer space in Peter Keetman’s photograph turns out to be dozens of steel pipes photographed end-on. And Brett Weston’s delicate web of branches, as fine as a Japanese watercolour, is actually a closeup of cracks in dry mud. Window panes, roof tiles, steel struts, elaborate urban graffiti: all are ready, if obvious, sources for the photographer aiming to find the abstract in the figurative. So is almost anything that comes in multiples: grooves on an LP, towers of glass tiles, sheaves of drainpipes, crisscrossing wires, puddles on a rainy day. You can probably imagine all this without even seeing the respective images, which is at least one problem with this interminable exhibition. Another is the project. This looks clear enough on paper – the first British show to explore the relationship between abstraction in painting and photography – but turns out to be the opposite in practice. The opening gallery looks promising, with paintings by Kandinsky, Braque and Wyndham Lewis alongside surprisingly craven photographic imitations. Pierre Dubreuil attempts a cubist photograph by scattering copies of the same shot of a train all over the floor, then calling this chaotic heap Picasso Interpretation. Alvin Langdon Coburn tries to reprise vorticism with his so-called Vortograph, working up a kaleidoscopic image using crudely conspicuous mirrors. Marta Hoepffner’s collage, made by placing stencils on photographic paper and then exposing them to light, is no more than a weak pastiche of early painterly abstraction. The giveaway is in the title: Homage to Kandinsky. But painting rapidly disappears after this, except where the curators have for some misguided reason decided to include a single canvas – by Juan Miró, or Jackson Pollock, or Bridget Riley – among dozens of photographs that want to look exactly like it. Leaving aside the naked plagiarism, the paintings knock every other image off the wall. There are arguments to be had about the definition of abstraction from the start. Is Edward Steichen’s exquisite sepia photograph of brick buildings in New York, circa 1922, in any meaningful sense abstract? Or Paul Strand’s 1916 china bowls? Or Alexander Rodchenko’s 1925 sequence of black balconies, photographed from far below soaring up the image? They all put light, form and composition first, but so does many a pictorial photograph from almost a century ago. We might say that Margaret Bourke-White’s fabulous shot of the NBC transmission tower, look-ing up through its intricate metal structures, looks a bit abstract; but only because of its insistent geometry, which belongs to the tower in any case. And what about Alfred Stieglitz’s mackerel skies from 1927? Clouds, whether painted by Constable or photographed by Stieglitz, may seem inherently abstract, atmospheric phenomena describing nothing but themselves. But of course they can look very like a camel, as Hamlet says. And what’s more, Stieglitz’s Equivalents, as he called them, are very clearly images of clouds and nothing but. He spoke of them as an objective correlative for his state of mind; they are surely more romantic than abstract. But hold on to these early photographs, so potent and beautiful. For what follows is a tide of academic exercises, science projects, technical and visual experiments, with only the occasional triumph and a quite startling degree of repetition. The curators can’t show you one shot of a stairwell from down below – there have to be two or three; they can’t give you one textile closeup – they have to give you tapestry, corduroy, knitting, fishnet, and so on and on. This is counterproductive, undermining the originality of almost every photograph and throwing the emphasis straight back on figuration. Shape of Light takes an ardent interest in method; the chemigram, for instance, made without a camera, in full light, by manipulating chemicals on photographic paper. The ideal artist to represent the chemigram would surely have been August Strindberg, writer-painter-photographer, whose attempts to capture the night sky are among the most beautiful abstract images ever made. But he’s not here. Or the luminogram, made by directing light on photosensitive paper. The great Hungarian artist László Moholy-Nagy would have been the man, but he is here for bird’s-eye views of the modern city. Instead, you get endless spots, dots, triangles, loops, sparkler-twirls and squiggles. Stencils, collages, multiple exposures, distressed negatives, photographs that record the change of light in the darkroom, cut-outs, collotypes, E-ink images: how they are made is too often more interesting than the images themselves. And as the show builds to a long sequence of conceptual photographs from the past 30 years, interrogating the nature and status of photography, and so forth, it is significant that by far the most visually arresting images – in which invisible radioactivity is rendered eerily visible – are by a painter, Sigmar Polke. What is abstraction: that is the underlying question. With painting, there are so many answers, from suprematism, constructivism and cubism to abstract expressionism, op art and minimalism onwards to Frank Stella, Cy Twombly and Howard Hodgkin. With photography, at least according to this exhibition, the answer is so often technical process. Of course there are some remarkable images here; how could there not be, given the presence of Brassaï, Steichen, Kertész and Man Ray (although not, alas, his egg whisk)? But the show treats even their works as little more than examples. And so it goes on, a glum trudge through gallery after gallery of instances by the hundred, until the eye ceases to take them in, rebelling against the visual boredom. Shape of Light is at Tate Modern, London, until 14 October"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2018/may/03/whats-happening-where-you-are-on-polling-day","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-03T06:40:58Z","webTitle":"What's happening where you are on polling day?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/may/03/whats-happening-where-you-are-on-polling-day","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/may/03/whats-happening-where-you-are-on-polling-day","fields":{"headline":"What's happening where you are on polling day?","bodyText":"As local elections take place in parts of England we want you to show us what’s happening on the ground.

Often, we don’t even know what we don’t even know. Many people are sure they understand parliamentary process, how a customs union works, or what goes on in schools, but when put on the spot find such things curiously hard to explain. What happens at a bill’s second reading? When would a person sit their Sats? These sound like pub quiz questions, but are surprisingly helpful in putting news in its proper context or simply understanding how the country ticks. To say that How Britain Really Works fills in some of these gaps runs the risk of making it sound dull when it’s a wry, readable, even whimsical book. (Sometimes a bit too whimsical; the conceit of using the footnotes to add funny human stories rather than reference facts wears pretty thin.) Stig Abell’s aim was to come up with a modern, adult version of those children’s encyclopedias a pre-Google generation grew up dipping in and out of, a sort of Schott’s Miscellany of Britain. But while there’s an endearingly old-fashioned air to the idea of a book containing actual facts, rather than grand provocative theories about Britishness, it takes on an interestingly new light in an era of fake news. The combination of people who don’t know what they don’t know – and so may be dangerously overconfident about their ability to tell truth from fiction in the context of the type of political mendacity seen during the referendum campaign – along with a torrent of highly plausible, maliciously misleading information on social media, has not been a happy one. This book pulls off the difficult trick of being a potted primer to deeper issues behind the news – from economics and politics via health policy to how the media works – without being patronising or assuming too much knowledge. It doesn’t dig deep on any topic, dispatching two centuries of British political history in not much more than half a chapter, and current affairs junkies won’t find much in it that they genuinely didn’t know (or perhaps more accurately, didn’t think they knew). And since it’s written from the carefully even-handed viewpoint of a classic centrist dad, it’s not one for the radical in your life, either. But what is there is cleverly chosen and nicely put together, and it’s rather soothing to read something that isn’t angrily trying to sell you a big idea and then cherrypicking its facts to suit the polemic. If Abell has a grand theory of Britishness, it would be that it’s all a bit of an agreeable muddle; a series of polite fictions and happy or unhappy accidents that produce something that defies easy labelling. Oddly enough, it is a pretty good description in some ways of Abell himself, whose journalistic career spans high and lowbrow and has taken him from gamekeeper to poacher (he went from running the Press Complaints Commission to working as managing editor of the Sun, which brought him in after the phone-hacking scandal as it tried to show it was cleaning up its act, before becoming editor of the Times Literary Supplement). The sharpest chapter is perhaps the one on education. After a pithy analysis of how schools in the UK compare with those in the countries the UK is always lambasted for lagging behind – mainly the exam factories of Korea, Singapore and Japan – and of current challenges for education, Abell reaches his own uncompromising prescription: whack VAT on private schools, scrap grammars, abolish GCSEs in favour of one final exam at 18 and bring back maintenance grants for poorer university students. Elsewhere, he is rather more tentative. Abell had a ringside seat on the Leveson inquiry, having testified before it while at the PCC, and the chapter on the media is fascinating and more emotional than the rest of the book. He was clearly going through something of a dark night of the soul at this point; during the inquiry he describes himself as “coming apart at the seams: working, going home to two young children, punching holes in doors with mute frustration” – so much so that his wife booked him an appointment with a psychiatrist, which he missed. But many readers will feel he still doesn’t address the perceived cosiness of the relationship between press and regulator, or the woeful inability of the media to police itself. This slightly evasive quality is apparent elsewhere, particularly in the chapter endings which, with a few exceptions, elegantly avoid drawing much in the way of conclusions. Yet the book remains a smart execution of an idea that is more important than it sounds – in a world convulsed by polarising ideologies and white-hot feelings, there is a lot to be said for writing that is cool and fact-based and, indeed, for having a rough idea of what you’re talking about.

It makes no mention of the special committee that I set up under Terry Burns to reduce the size of the house. Its proposals included a permanent cap on numbers, and new members being appointed for only limited periods. Most significantly, these proposals were accepted without division by the Lords following a debate in December. Since then the prime minister has responded. Contrary to what you suggest, she has agreed that a reduction in numbers is necessary and that she herself will follow a path of moderation. No longer will holding particular office, political or non-political, give an automatic entitlement to membership. The days of mass appointments of Tony Blair and David Cameron are over. We are working to reduce the size of the house but without the advantage of legislation. The government has made it clear (as would any government) that, with Brexit taking up so much time in parliament, it would be ludicrous to add a House of Lords Reform Act into the mix. Those proposing their own pet schemes of reform that require primary legislation will be disappointed. It would be better, rather than railing against the Lords, if we could agree that the practical way forward would be to make progress on reducing numbers. That would be to the benefit of everyone, whatever their view. Norman Fowler The Lord Speaker, House of Lords • Your editorial on the bloated second chamber notes: “It remains a ludicrous anachronism for any democracy that its upper house is wholly unelected … The appointment system is too often a way of rewarding political time servers and donors.” Our research backs this up. The house hosts 184 ex-MPs, 26 ex-MEPs, 11 ex-MSPs, eight ex-Welsh AMs, six ex-London AMs, 11 ex-MLAs and 39 current or ex-council leaders, as of April last year. And in the centenary year of women’s suffrage, we must note it is also grossly unrepresentative. Just 26% of peers are women, while there is not a single member under the age of 40. Despite frequent claims of “independence”, it is a hyper-partisan house: 78% of Conservative peers failed to vote against the government once in 2016/17, while the average Labour peer voted against the government in 90% of votes in that year. All this on top of the rolling expenses scandals we see in the unaccountable chamber. It is absolutely time for an overhaul in this private members’ club. From couch-potato peers to lobby-fodder lords, we need real reform now – not tinkering around the edges. Darren Hughes Chief executive, Electoral Reform Society • Hold up! It is at times like these that we need the Lords to hold incumbent governments to account, as they are so brilliantly doing over Brexit. To my mind they have no axes to grind, rarely have whips to obey, and are in a position to declare themselves free to decide for the good of the people of the country, rather than the good of their party. I sometimes think there is more wisdom in the head of one lord than the whole of a political party. The way the Commons has operated recently, without this failsafe, the people could be walked all over. Be careful what you wish for. Rob Parrish Starcross, Devon • May I remind Liam Fox that the House of Lords is a revising chamber (Liam Fox accuses Lords of trying to block EU exit, 1 May) and has every right to propose amendments to Commons legislation. This is British democracy at work. If Mr Fox is so sure of the “will of the British people”, perhaps he’d like to support the campaign for the People’s Vote.

Today, according to the judge of a children’s books prize, novelists are eschewing adventure stories for “claustrophobic” domestic dramas and creating “a depressing children’s literary landscape” in the process. Author Philip Womack and his fellow judges read 60 books to come up with the shortlist for the Branford Boase award, which rewards children’s authors at the start of their careers and has honoured names from Meg Rosoff to Mal Peet in the past. According to Womack, at least a third of the submissions this year had a “very similar narrative: there’s an ill child at home, who notices something odd, and is probably imagining it, but not telling the reader. They’re all in the first person, all in the present tense, all of a type,” he said. “There are some adventure stories around today, but they tend not to be debuts. Most of these stories tend to be so enclosed, so claustrophobic, so depressing and formulaic. It seems to me to be rather a worrying new trend,” he said. “While each had its own merits, it became clear that there was a formula, and – which is my own opinion, and not necessarily that of the other panellists – it does make for a rather depressing children’s literary landscape.” His fellow judge Julia Eccleshare, co-founder of the award and children’s director of the Hay festival, expressed a similar view, pointing to the “huge predominance” of domestic dramas submitted for the prize. “Children’s adventure it seems has become internal, the setting no longer the outside world but frequently the family, with narrative tension and action arising from issues such as mental health and individual trauma,” she said. Writing in the Bookseller magazine, Eccleshare said the increasing lack of freedom for children to be outside alone in real life correlates to a dwindling of fictional adventure stories, which this year “seemed almost to have disappeared from new novels”. The £1,000 Branford Boase prize, for the most promising book for seven-year-olds and upwards, steered away from small-scale domestic stories in its shortlist, going for adventures like Yaba Badoe’s A Jigsaw of Fire and Stars, in which a girl who is washed ashore in a treasure chest grows up to join the circus, and Sharon Cohen’s The Starman and Me, pitched as “ET meets Stig of the Dump”. For Womack, small-scale dramas, focusing on illness or disability, can be done well – he pointed to titles including Mark Haddon’s The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time, and RJ Palacio’s Wonder – but “in order to write this kind of narrative you need to be very skilful and I just think the problem is that publishers and authors maybe imagine that if you give a character an illness, they will be sympathetic”. “It’s become a trope – something people do because they think that’s what a book should be,” he said. What authors should be doing instead, he argued, is presenting readers with “worlds the child can explore”. “I do worry it is a general societal trend – more inwards, more restrictive of the child’s movements, more focused on the self … The narrative itself becomes very closed and incremental and slow because you’re limited by what the child can see,” he said. Eccleshare described the domestic dramas as “a new kind of adventure which depends on interaction rather than action”. “Today’s fictional children are being faced with problems that have no such simple resolution. Many deal with things going wrong in families: family breakdown, accidents, deaths, mental health problems from depression and addiction to borderline personality disorders, all of which it will be impossible for a child to resolve as the issues are insurmountable,” she said. Children’s bookseller Tamara Macfarlane, of the shop Tales on Moon Lane, attributed the shift in emphasis to a wider focus on mental health. “There has been a shift towards more internal narratives and exploring the internal journey,” she said. “It’s a tricky one to handle. In most of the great children’s books, the first thing you do is get rid of the parents so the children can have an adventure. I hope it’s not a reflection of the claustrophobic nature of the times, with everything being a bit over-monitored and over-measured and over-controlled, and the lack of freedom children have now in terms of getting out of the house and escaping.” The winner of the 2018 Branford Boase prize will be announced on 4 July at a ceremony in London.

On the face of it, Wednesday’s Brexit sub-committee meeting provided little in the way of enlightenment. Downing Street once again deferred a decision over which of two customs proposals the UK will take into the next phase of negotiations with the EU. Even if the cabinet does eventually decide between the hi-tech “maximum facilitation” model or the highly integrated new customs partnership (NCP) approach, the EU remains deeply sceptical that either will prove satisfactory. But postponing the painful choice, or finding another way to fudge it, will no longer be enough for Theresa May. The one lasting legacy of Wednesday’s focus on customs has been to cast doubt on her government’s overall compromise approach to Brexit. What the Europeans have dismissed as the UK’s “have-cake-and-eat-it” fantasy is now under withering attack by Tory Eurosceptics too. The target of their attack is the NCP approach still favoured by May and the Treasury. The idea of this plan, first outlined in August, is that post-Brexit Britain can avoid introducing friction at the EU border while at the same time creating enough flexibility to strike new trade deals with other countries. It would do this by acting as if Britain were still in the existing customs union, but crucially allowing imports bound purely for UK customers to qualify for a rebate if there was a gap between the EU tariff rate and any reduction agreed under new trade deals. Americans cars arriving at Southampton, for example, would still be subject to the 10% EU import duty, but UK showrooms might claw this back if the government succeeded in striking its desired new trade deal with the US. More importantly, British car exports sent to Europe via Dover would not be held up by having to prove where their component parts came from – the so-called rules of origin test – because everything from outside Europe would have passed through the same common external tariff regime. The problem is that delays at customs are not just caused by tariffs and rules of origin tests. A big factor in smoothing trade flows is standardising product safety standards and other regulations too. To maintain truly frictionless trade with Europe the UK would also need to abide by the rules of the single market. Where the critics agree is that this would be impossible to do without effectively being a member of the single market and the customs union. Jacob Rees-Mogg’s European Research Group (ERG) regards this as a sellout and a betrayal of the referendum result. The EU views anything less than explicit membership as an attempt at cherry picking and would force the UK to submit to the supervision of its courts and regulators too. In fact, the more scrutiny it comes under, the closer the NCP looks to the partial customs union approach now favoured by Labour and a number of backbench Tory rebels. Instead of providing a halfway house a customs partnership could quickly prove to be the very softest of Brexits. The only alternative would be the “highly streamlined” technological approach designed to provide “maximum facilitation” of trade, but not promising to avoid controls entirely. The ERG says this is a price worth paying to maintain freedom from EU rules and a more unfettered ability to strike independent trade deals. The cabinet hardliners argue that if this proves unsatisfactory to the Irish government and collapses the talks, so be it – it would be the EU choosing to erect border controls, not the UK. “No deal is better than a bad deal,” as the prime minister used to say. They say the real choice is between a lightly regulated open economy trading largely outside Europe, and maintaining a highly integrated European-style social market that has to keep collaborating with Brussels. After Wednesday’s clash, pretending Britain can have both is an option May no longer enjoys."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/may/03/beatles-dundee-concert-caird-hall-beatlemania","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-02T23:01:25Z","webTitle":"Beatles: Dundee concert photos to go on display in city","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/03/beatles-dundee-concert-caird-hall-beatlemania","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/may/03/beatles-dundee-concert-caird-hall-beatlemania","fields":{"headline":"Beatles: Dundee concert photos to go on display in city","bodyText":"The Beatles are returning to Dundee, the city where the term Beatlemania was coined after the Fab Four had to leave a concert by crawling out through a coal cellar to escape their ecstatic fans. The McManus gallery and museum has acquired a set of photographs showing the band’s last appearance at the Caird Hall on 20 October 1964. In Glasgow, earlier on the tour, all police leave was cancelled and 200 extra officers were drafted in to cope with the crowds. In Dundee, local papers reported that screaming fans drowned out virtually every note of the music, and dozens of paramedics attended to care for those who collapsed, overcome by the heat and excitement – 50 young women were carried out of the hall in the first five minutes. The audience included the Countess of Strathmore, who arrived in a chauffeur-driven Rolls-Royce, and later told journalists: “The audience was appalling, and completely bad mannered to make so much noise. Most of the time I had my fingers pressed over my ears to keep out the awful noise.” The images of the Beatles arriving with crowds mobbing their car, an interview before the show, and the hysterical audience reaction, were captured by local photographer Winnie Forbes-Cochrane. They were bought by the museum at auction in March, and curators hope to put them on display later this year. The term Beatlemania was conceived when the band first played the hall a year earlier, after the promoter had to open his office at 3am when crowds waiting to buy tickets were already blocking the street. After the concert the group of people surrounding all the doors of the hall was so large that the band were smuggled out through the cellars, to be driven to a hotel 20 miles away."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2018/may/04/karl-marx-revived-west-neglected-east-still-divides-germany","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-04T11:37:38Z","webTitle":"Revived in the west, neglected in the east: how Marx still divides Germany","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/04/karl-marx-revived-west-neglected-east-still-divides-germany","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/04/karl-marx-revived-west-neglected-east-still-divides-germany","fields":{"headline":"Revived in the west, neglected in the east: how Marx still divides Germany","bodyText":"Throughout the cold war, Karl Marx stood tall and proud in the centre of Neubrandenburg, a socialist model town in Germany’s north-east. Rising to 2.2metres (7ft 2in) and made of bronze, the sculptor Gerhard Thieme’s 1969 memorial showed the bearded thinker facing the capitalist west with a grim-eyed snarl. But as dignitaries from around the world flock to the German philosopher, economist and revolutionary socialist’s birthplace in Trier on Saturday for his 200th birthday, the Neubrandenburg Marx will be snarling only at the ceiling of a warehouse on the outskirts of town. Since the fall of the Berlin Wall, the town’s Karl Marx Square has been renamed Market Square and on the spot once reserved for the man behind the theory of commodity fetishism now stands a shopping centre retailing fridges, sneakers and push-up bras. Marx, a thinker with a clear notion of the proximity between tragedy and farce, might well have appreciated the topsy-turvy situation in the land of his birth: while a revival of his ideas is in full swing in what was once the capitalist west, the part of the country that for four decades tried to put Marxist thinking into practice now keeps a cool distance. In Trier, in the south-west, politicians including the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, and Germany’s Social Democrat leader, Andrea Nahles, will give speeches at the unveiling of a 5.5 metre-high statue gifted by the Chinese government, which has been welcomed even by members of Angela Merkel’s centre-right Christian Democratic Union. “Thirty years ago, such a statue wouldn’t have been possible,” said Wolfram Leibe, Trier’s Social Democrat mayor. “But today, with more distance to the socialism of the German Democratic Republic, is the right time to engage with Marx in this form too.” Marx’s Das Kapital is climbing back into the bestseller charts and a raft of biographies and TV dramas celebrate the enduring relevance of his ideas. Even Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, the centre-right bourgeoisie’s broadsheet of choice, last Sunday put Marx on its front page and let its staff writers choose their favourite passages from his oeuvre. Thomas Steinfeld, a former editor of Süddeutsche Zeitung’s reviews section and author of a recently published book on Marx’s philosophy, said a revival of Marxist thinking had been in full swing since the 2008 financial crisis. “The economists on our business pages were only able to explain the market as a system that worked. But the crisis forced us to confront Marx’s alternative: what if markets are latently catastrophic? “We live in an age that is as pious as the middle ages, but now we define ourselves not through a divine order but capital relation. Going back to Marx allows us to recognise this condition from the outside.” Dieter Kowallick, a local politician for the leftwing Die Linke party in the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, said: “When it comes to reading Marx, the west is now more progressive than the east.” In the run-up to the anniversary, Kowallick and his comrades had proposed the Neubrandenburg Marx be re-erected in the city. But the task of finding an appropriately symbolic location proved divisive. While leftwingers wanted to see the philosopher outside the local library, other members of the senate insisted Marx be placed outside the former Stasi prison, to remind people of the injustices committed in his name. The city’s mayor, Silvio Witt, a former comedian and entrepreneur who ran for office as an independent, proposed a compromise: what if Thieme’s sculpture returned to Neubrandenburg, but lying horizontally on his back? “Is Marx sleeping? Has he been toppled? Or does he just need a breather?” said Witt of his proposal, which was eventually rejected by Die Linke, who hold a majority in the senate. “If we had put Marx back in his place without commentary, that wouldn’t have made sense. We needed a monument that expresses a certain amount of discomfort with his heritage,” said Witt, sitting in his office at the town hall, a German Democratic Republic-era building on a ring road called Friedrich-Engels-Ring. While Marx’s bearded face was everywhere in East Germany – on the classroom walls during Witt’s youth or the 100 ostmark bill – the ruling socialist party treated his writing less as a theory to be critically engaged with than a science. Those who questioned whether the GDR’s existing socialism was really in keeping with Marx’s writing, such as the dissident writers Robert Havemann or Rudolf Bahro, were expelled either from the party or the country. “In the east Marx was omnipresent, and yet, in an odd way, most people felt like they never really knew him,” said Christina Morina, an East Germany-born historian whose recent book The Invention of Marxism examines the people who turned the philosopher’s ideas into a political movement. “What citizens in the GDR knew was Marx through the rigid prism of Lenin, Stalin or [the former East German head of state Walter] Ulbricht. The state had no interest in them finding their own way into his work.” While Morina largely blames Marx’s interpreters for East Germany’s experiment with authoritarian Marxism, she also suggests that the contemporary revival’s pick-and-mix approach overlooks the 19th-century thinker’s absolutist ambitions. “There was a megalomania – and a dash of Prussian authoritarianism – to Marx’s desire to read and write his way into all sorts of scientific disciplines,” Morina said. In Neubrandenburg, a place once run on principles of Marxist economics, Witt is convinced that his city has prospered since state-run businesses were privatised after the fall of the wall. In one of Germany’s structurally weaker states, the city now has the greatest taxpaying ability. Still, not everybody agrees. “We have never been in an economically stabler position – and yet many people complain that they feel insecure. The GDR felt like a stable society to its citizens, but as a system it was instable. Now it is the other way around.” Before the end of the year, Neubrandenburg’s citizens will once again be able to consult Marx for answers to this dilemma. After hours of fractious debates, the mayor has agreed that the statue will again go on display in 2018 as part of the city’s art collection – standing upright."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/may/04/performing-stones-a-murderous-puppet-and-the-psychedelic-60s-the-week-in-art","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-04T11:34:02Z","webTitle":"Performing stones, a murderous puppet and the psychedelic 60s – the week in art","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/may/04/performing-stones-a-murderous-puppet-and-the-psychedelic-60s-the-week-in-art","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/may/04/performing-stones-a-murderous-puppet-and-the-psychedelic-60s-the-week-in-art","fields":{"headline":"Performing stones, a murderous puppet and the psychedelic 60s – the week in art","bodyText":"Sign up to the Art Weekly newsletter Data protection laws are changing in the UK, under an initiative called GDPR.

According to the MoD, a Reaper drone armed with a Hellfire missile fired at three suspected Islamic State fighters on 26 March. Almost simultaneously, a civilian on a motorbike entered the target area and was killed too. The defence secretary, Gavin Williamson, in a written statement to parliament described the fatality as “deeply regrettable”. The MoD has faced scepticism over repeated claims that not a single airstrike out of 1,600 in Iraq, and latterly Syria, had resulted in any known civilian deaths since strikes began in September 2014. The decision to admit responsibility in this case follows a review of aerial footage and other evidence. Williamson, in the written statement, said: “We do everything we can to minimise the risk to civilian life from UK strikes through our rigorous targeting processes and the professionalism of UK service personnel. “It is, therefore, deeply regrettable that a UK airstrike on 26 March 2018, targeting Daesh [Isis] fighters in eastern Syria, resulted in an unintentional civilian fatality. During a strike to engage three Daesh fighters, a civilian motorbike crossed into the strike area at the last moment and it is assessed that one civilian was unintentionally killed.” Williamson added: “We reached this conclusion after undertaking routine and detailed post-strike analysis of all available evidence.” A separate review will be carried out by the US-led coalition of which the UK is a part. If the family of the dead man comes forward, they will be receive compensation. The former defence secretary, Michael Fallon, was met with scepticism in 2015 when he told the BBC: “Our estimate is that there hasn’t yet been a single civilian casualty because of the precision of their strikes.” Independent data at the time suggested the US-led coalition’s overall record of civilian casualties was roughly about 6%-8%. The MoD later elaborated to say that while it could not state definitively that no civilian had been killed, no one had come forward until this latest incident with evidence of a single death attributable to an RAF strike. The MOD says it uses precision weapons and there are elaborate checks before a strike is ordered, in order to avoid civilian casualties. The use of drones is controversial, with repeated questions about their legality. As with strikes from planes, there are also questions about the accuracy of the intelligence on which attacks are based. Chris Cole, who runs Drone Wars, a UK-based organisation that monitors their use, said that based on recent freedom of information requests there had been a dramatic increase in UK drone strikes in Syria in the first quarter of this year – 92 in total. Cole said this was as many as the total number for the previous 18 months and more than those fired from RAF Tornado and Typhoon aircraft. He also said the RAF had confirmed the use of the thermobaric version of the Hellfire missile, the first time it has publicly acknowledged using them in Syria. The MoD acknowledged in 2009 their use from helicopters in Afghanistan. Human rights groups have criticised the use of thermobaric weapons, which create a pressure wave that sucks the air out of victims, rather than more traditional weapons that pierce armour or blast fragments over a wide area. The MoD did not specify whether a thermobaric weapon had been used in this case."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2018/may/07/rspb-lost-focus-binoculars","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-07T06:00:42Z","webTitle":"Why did RSPB lose focus on our binoculars?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/may/07/rspb-lost-focus-binoculars","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2018/may/07/rspb-lost-focus-binoculars","fields":{"headline":"Why did RSPB lose focus on our binoculars?","bodyText":"Three years ago, my wife purchased a set of binoculars from the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds that lately developed a fault with the left eyepiece.

In 2009 Alan Johnson said many Brits had “legitimate concerns” over immigration. “Failed asylum seekers, overstayers and foreign national prisoners who have no right to be here must be speedily removed,” he said in an interview. Three years before, another Labour home secretary, Charles Clarke, announced his intention to “drive out” migrants “coming here who are a burden on the society”. The scandalous treatment of the Windrush generation has brought increasing scrutiny to May’s hostile-environment policy. Hours after taking office, Sajid Javid rejected the phrase. Perhaps it’s no surprise then that it’s another New Labour policy – the mostly forgotten ID cards programme – that Johnson and Clarke have been championing this week. In a letter to the Times, the pair said the scrapping of the programme in 2010 left Whitehall with “no idea how to tackle the most pernicious form of immigration: illegal entry”. Johnson and Clarke said ID cards “remain the best way to prove and so protect a citizen’s identity”. But this was only ever half the story. David Blunkett said the scheme would also mean that “when we find people we can identify quickly that they are not entitled and get them out”. The Windrush scandal is not about illegal migration. In 2014, showing remarkable foresight for a politician, Diane Abbott asked May if “measures that are designed to crack down on illegal immigrants” could be used against “people who are British nationals, but appear as if they might be immigrants”. And of course, legitimacy was in the eye of the beholder: the Home Office, whose punitive approach is the work of Johnson and Clarke as well as Rudd and May. This latest scandal happened not because of a lack of paperwork, but because of an immigration regime designed to appease the fear-mongering of Ukip and hardline Conservatives. There is little evidence that ID cards would have helped. Why would Caribbean people who travelled to Britain on their parents’ passports as children have registered for a card in old age? Especially if, as New Labour proposed, ID cards were optional for British citizens and subject to a fee. Instead, ID cards would drive an even bigger wedge between so-called mainstream society and its margins. As with stop-and-search powers and tenancy checks, black and Asian people would be challenged most often to prove their identity. Only last month, the Equality and Human Rights Commission raised serious concerns that the new voter ID checks for Thursday’s elections would disenfranchise people from ethnic minorities. There are also legitimate, and familiar, concerns over how the state – whatever its political stripe – would handle our data. There have been too many mass data losses and breaches to list, and police forces have been rapped repeatedly for holding on to photographs of innocent people. And, police chiefs admitted in March, elite undercover officers are likely to have passed intelligence to an illegal blacklist of construction workers. Thousands of builders were turned down for jobs over several decades until 2009 – often for raising safety concerns on sites. With opinion against the idea, it was indeed May who abolished the ID cards scheme. But her hostile environment was a policy cut from the same cloth. The Windrush saga has laid bare the cruelty of Britain’s immigration regime. For all his warm words, Javid has yet to draw a line under May’s approach. While Clarke and Johnson proffer punishment and suspicion amid a rare public appetite for compassion, Abbott, as a longstanding opponent of both the punitive immigration system and the surveillance state, is uniquely placed to offer an alternative while public opinion is most malleable. No wonder Labour’s former home secretaries sound like yesterday’s men. • Conrad Landin is a writer and journalist based in Glasgow, and Scotland editor of the Morning Star"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"film/2018/may/06/nothing-like-a-dame-review-enjoyable-documentary","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-06T06:00:13Z","webTitle":"Nothing Like a Dame review – an actor’s life for the famous four","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/may/06/nothing-like-a-dame-review-enjoyable-documentary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/may/06/nothing-like-a-dame-review-enjoyable-documentary","fields":{"headline":"Nothing Like a Dame review – an actor’s life for the famous four","bodyText":"It’s a gloriously simple idea.

I was born in Jamaica but arrived in the UK aged eight to join my mum. I loved school, and in my final year was made head girl at Clapton Girls’ academy. I was so excited when I won a place at LSE to study law in 2013. It was only then that I realised that my immigration status meant I would not be able to take up my place. I contacted the charity Just for Kids Law with a few questions about the Ucas process, but it became clear that my situation was far more complicated than I first imagined. I spent the next few weeks in complete shock. I discovered that, rather than having “unsettled” status in the country I call my home, I had no “lawful” status at all. I made numerous phone calls to the Home Office, and was initially told that my family had a valid application and that our documents would be with us in a few weeks. But this didn’t turn out to be the case. I was in the Just for Kids Law offices, desperate to take up my place at university, when I made the final call. I remember listening to the woman on the other end of the phone tell me that, despite what I had previously been informed, I had no status nor an active application at all. I went numb. I had to abandon my university dreams and focus on resolving my immigration status. It took a long time and it was not a pleasant experience for a teenager to navigate, even with the support I had. I raised funds to pay the Home Office fees and found pro bono legal support. Since 2013, there has been no legal aid for this type of immigration case, even for children. I got my limited leave to remain in early 2014, but soon learned that I still would not be eligible for student finance and would be treated as an international student. I saw my whole world crumbling around me again. I’d watched all my friends go off to university, leaving me behind, but had refused to let them know about my situation. I felt too ashamed. This is why I founded Let Us Learn. I realised there would be many others like me in the same situation, and I wanted to highlight what was happening to a generation of smart, ambitious young people. I also wanted to bring young migrants like myself together, to share our stories with each other and show that we had nothing to be ashamed of, and that we are not alone in our struggles. Our campaign group includes aspiring lawyers, doctors, scientists and astronauts, as well as people who want a career without going to university. We initially campaigned on access to university for young migrants, and helped to change the student finance rules so that many more young people like us can go to university. We also had success in lobbying universities with our #younggiftedandblocked campaign to establish scholarship schemes for those who are still not eligible for student loans, like the one that enabled me to take up my place at LSE. But more recently we have realised that, as important as education is to all of us, there is a much greater risk to our safety and wellbeing. The “hostile environment” is having devastating consequences on our friends and families. For Let Us Learners, the issue that most urgently needs addressing is the extortionate cost of the Home Office applications we must regularly make in order to maintain our “lawful” status. Including the NHS surcharge, we will soon have to pay £2,033 to maintain our status. This is an increase of 238% from when I first applied as an 18-year-old, in 2014, and this does not even include any legal fees. We have to do this every two and a half years for 10 years, at a total cost of over £10,000, or we become “illegal”. This is not affordable, this is not a fair system. We have members who simply cannot afford to maintain their status. We know parents who have had to choose between one child and another. Whose status will be maintained? Who will have to become “illegal”? Mental health is a serious and constant concern among our members, who live in constant fear of losing their status. Because losing one’s status after fighting so hard to get it is to lose everything. The ability to work, study, rent, hold a bank account, contribute, feel safe. The hostile environment and these fees are making it impossible for young migrants like us who have grown up in this country to lead normal lives. We want to work with the government to create a route to British citizenship that is just, simple and affordable so it allows us to contribute all that we want to give to this country • Chrisann Jarrett is co-founder of Let Us Learn, a project led by young migrants and based at the charity Just for Kids Law"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/may/06/big-picture-sean-connery-bond-cannes-1965","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-06T06:59:14Z","webTitle":"The big picture: Sean Connery brings Bond to Cannes, 1965","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/may/06/big-picture-sean-connery-bond-cannes-1965","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/may/06/big-picture-sean-connery-bond-cannes-1965","fields":{"headline":"The big picture: Sean Connery at the Cannes film festival, 1965","bodyText":"In May 1965, Sean Connery was at Cannes to promote Sidney Lumet’s film The Hill, in which he played a gruff and unbreakable rebel in an army prison in north Africa. He had chosen the role because he felt he was becoming a “Bond slave” and the film was about as far away as possible from the cartoon smoothness of 007. Cannes wasn’t much interested in that distinction, however. Goldfinger had come out the previous year; Thunderball was on its way. When Connery cruised the Croisette in an open-topped sports car it was Bond, “Mr Kiss Kiss Bang Bang” as the New York Times called him, the crowds wanted to see. Connery, for all his reluctance to identify with his character, clearly didn’t disappoint. Has he ever looked more Bondlike than in this picture? Eyebrow raised, catching the eye of a beautiful face in the crowd, keeping his head and his tailoring on point, while all around him are losing theirs. This was his first time at Cannes, but he knew exactly what Cannes demanded: it was the place actors had always come to act most like film stars. This year’s festival, which opens next week, will conjure similar images: the same spring Riviera light, the same rococo facades, the same paparazzi scrum around an icon. Just as the photograph of Connery harked back to the welcome and confected spectacle that the film festival represented after the war, so this year’s images will reference the less inhibited atmosphere of the 60s.

The home secretary said she deeply regretted not spotting the problem of a generation of Britons being wrongly targeted by immigration authorities, vowing there would be a culture change in her department. However, there was immediate confusion over whether she had sanctioned regional targets for deporting migrants, with Rudd at odds with the head of immigration service union who claimed they appeared on posters across the Home Office estate. Rudd came under continued pressure over the Windrush debacle at prime minister’s questions when Jeremy Corbyn accused her of inheriting a “cruel and misdirected” policy from Theresa May and making it worse. The prime minister struggled to get the upper hand in a series of tetchy exchanges with the Labour leader during which she insisted the government was committed to making sure those who were entitled to be in Britain could remain. May added that it was also right to clamp down on illegal immigration. “Up and down this country people want to ensure the government is taking action against those people who are here in this country illegally,” she told MPs. The prime minister denied the hostile environment had affected the Windrush generation, saying: “The problem at the time is that they were not documented with that right, and that is what we are now putting right.” Earlier this week, Rudd unveiled an emergency package of measures in an attempt to draw a line under the affair, but the Home Office has remained under pressure as new cases continue to emerge. Under the government’s plans, thousands of people will be offered the chance to obtain British citizenship free of charge and without the requirement to take language tests. A compensation scheme for those affected by the failings will be introduced within weeks. During her grilling from the home affairs select committee on Wednesday, Rudd remained steadfastly loyal to May. The home secretary, who Tory ministers expect to survive in her role as long as no new scandals emerge, was accused of protecting the prime minister, her predecessor at the Home Office, after refusing to say whether May was responsible for the department ending up too focused on policy, rather than people. “I think the Home Office needs to have a more human face ... I’m trying to look forward to make those changes now. I want the Home Office to have more personal focus,” she said. However, asked whether the fault lay with changes that she had implemented, rather than her predecessor, she said: “That would be for others to judge ... I don’t think I can give a clear answer to that.” Labour’s John Woodcock, who sits on the committee, told Rudd: “You could give a clear answer but you’re choosing not to because you’re choosing to protect the previous incumbent of the home department, who is the prime minister.” The home secretary also refused to identify the so-called hostile environment immigration policy brought in by May – which requires people to proactively prove their status – as a specific failing. Rudd again appeared to deflect blame from the current government, saying the Windrush problem had been around for decades, and it was “disappointing no previous governments saw this coming.” Lucy Moreton, the head of the ISU immigration workers’ union, told the commitee that the changes introduced by May in 2011 had made a difference. Before then, she told MPs, immigration case workers dealing with a Windrush generation person could assess their case by checking their knowledge of events such as the 1977 silver jubilee and the the 1976 drought, adding: “That level of discretion is no longer permitted.” Rudd later said she hoped to give immigration staff more discretion to assess people’s cases to prevent anything similar happening again. She also told the MPs that the government was still checking to confirm no Windrush citizens had been wrongly deported, and had not yet begun to assess how many might have been detained over their supposed immigration status. Asked by the committee chair, Labour’s Yvette Cooper, when she first learned of the issue, Rudd replied: “I became aware over the past few months, I would say, that there was a problem of individuals I was seeing. “This was covered by newspapers, and MPs bringing it forward anecdotally over the past three or four months, and I became aware that there was a potential issue.” She continued: “I bitterly, deeply regret that I didn’t see it as more than individual cases gone wrong that needed addressing. I didn’t see it as a systemic issue until very recently.” The home secretary paid tribute to the “extraordinary job” done by the Guardian’s Amelia Gentleman, who had been highlighting the issue for more than six months. Rudd caused confusion over the existence of regional targets for deportations, which she claimed to be unaware of, prompting Cooper to suggest that she might “lack a grip” on the system. She confirmed she had asked for more removals to take place generally, of around 12,000 people a year, adding that there was “nothing wrong” with trying to remove people who were here illegally. However, after the hearing, Moreton said: “Net removal targets certainly do exist, and I’m somewhat bemused as to why the home secretary would say they do not.” The home secretary denied that the Tories’ target to bring net migration below 100,000 – which she has previously refused to say whether she would stick to – had fuelled the saga. “I don’t think that’s got anything to do with it. It’s wrong to think the net migration target is the problem here. The problem here is that people were not properly documented,” Rudd said. She denied she had discussed the net migration target in the context of the whole Windrush scandal with May, but refused to be drawn on “private conversations” they have had more generally on the issue. Satbir Singh, chief executive of the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, told the MPs there was now a “decision-making culture of suspicion”, based around “inflexible and unrealistic evidentiary burdens”. Singh said that even though he is a UK national born in the country, he was recently asked to prove his immigration status when renting a flat. As his passport was at an embassy to get a visa he missed out.

Until recently, this paradox appeared to make raising more money from inheritance tax a no-go zone. Yet leading thinktanks are now talking about it as a way to deal with some of the most burning questions on the minds of middle-class families. Baby boomers have unprecedented stashes of wealth tied up in their properties, yet their children and grandchildren are paying sky-high rents from squeezed incomes, and struggle to raise a deposit for a flat. Families also face a social care lottery that could wipe out an inheritance if a parent or grandparent cannot look after themselves. This month the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development proposed inheritance tax as a way to reduce wealth inequality and redistribute between the generations. Next week, a report by the Resolution Foundation’s Intergenerational Commission will also put the case for raising more from this tax in the UK. Adam Corlett, the report’s author, says: “We are going to need extra revenue in the coming years both to help the younger generation who have been screwed over in the jobs market and the housing market, and to help with their education – and also to provide the healthcare and social care people expect in their old age. We have been promoting the role wealth taxes can play, and inheritance tax should be a part of that mix.” But inheritance tax faces entrenched hostility. An opinion poll in 2015 showed 59% opposed it, making it the UK’s least popular tax. Research by the Fabian Society that year found people from across the political spectrum disliked the levy because it was imposed at a time of grief on money on which the deceased had already paid tax. If inheritance tax is part of the remedy for gaping inequalities and a looming tax crisis, what is needed for Britain to come round to the idea? The first thing is to understand it. Government figures released on Tuesday showed it raised £5.1bn last year – more than double the amount in 2009-10, but the earlier figure was depressed by the post-financial crisis property slump. It makes up less than 1% of the total tax take and only about 4% of estates pay it. It is charged at 40%, but most married couples can leave up to £850,000 to their direct descendants tax free. That figure is due to rise to £1m by 2020. Those with assets outside their main home can make gifts tax-free up to seven years before their death, as David Cameron’s mother did when she gave him £200,000 in 2011. The 40% rate bothers people, especially because many are unaware of how much can be left untaxed. Andrew Harrop, the general secretary of the Fabians, says many respondents in 2015 were surprised at how few estates were caught but were still “incredibly hostile” to inheritance tax. “Our view was that it had become a toxic brand,” he says. Instead of taxing a dead person’s estate, the government should tax the receivers of all bequests and gifts at their marginal tax rate, the Fabians argue. The OECD also favours taxing inheritances as income because it weakens the objection that the donor’s income is being taxed twice. Corlett says the idea would feature in his report. “It opens up options for raising more money and it helps with the perception because at the moment inheritance tax is seen as a tax on giving.” Taxing inheritance as income was floated by the Mirrlees Review of the UK tax system, carried out for the Institute for Fiscal Studies in 2011. Stuart Adam, an economist at the IFS, says everyone could have a lifetime allowance of, say, £300,000 and pay income tax on the rest. Collecting the tax might not be easy but “no one thinks what we have now works very well”, he says. One of the main objections to inheritance tax is that it is seen as being paid by the middle classes whereas the rich avoid it by giving assets away and paying advisers to find other ways round it. These include investing in businesses, agricultural land and Aim shares, all of which are exempt, and putting money in trusts. The government estimates agricultural and business reliefs alone cost more than £1.2bn in 2017-18. Corlett says closing loopholes “isn’t enough to solve long-term fiscal pressures, but it would make a big difference to health and social care in the short term. It’s possible to raise a surprising amount.” IHT relief not claimed George Osborne promised to send wealth “cascading down the generations” by cutting inheritance tax but his changes, which took effect last year, have made the levy even more complicated. The headline threshold is £325,000, but married couples or those in civil partnerships can pass this on to their partner. Osborne introduced an additional “residents nil rate band” of £100,000 per person, taking the total that can be passed on tax free to direct descendants to £850,000, rising to £1m in 2020. But the system’s complexity and various restrictions appear to have left many people out of pocket. Only about 4,000 of an estimated 24,000 estates paying inheritance tax last year benefited from the relief, according to NFU Mutual. Sean McCann, chartered financial planner at NFU Mutual, said: “The low numbers claiming the new residence nil rate band may be the result of more executors doing DIY probate and not being aware of the new allowance or not realising that it isn’t given automatically and has to be claimed.”The allowance can be claimed retrospectively. The Office for Tax Simplification is looking at ways to make inheritance tax more straightforward."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/apr/25/cliff-richard-top-police-officer-thought-the-evidence-not-so-strong","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-25T18:33:15Z","webTitle":"Cliff Richard: top police officer thought the evidence 'not so strong'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/25/cliff-richard-top-police-officer-thought-the-evidence-not-so-strong","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/apr/25/cliff-richard-top-police-officer-thought-the-evidence-not-so-strong","fields":{"headline":"Cliff Richard: top police officer thought the evidence 'not so strong'","bodyText":"The former chief constable of South Yorkshire police said he had not believed the evidence against Sir Cliff Richard “to be particularly strong” when his force raided the singer’s home after an accusation of historic sexual assault. David Crompton told the high court in London he was not personally involved in the case but had been informed by officers that they were “unsure whether the investigation would lead to charges”. Richard, 77, is suing the BBC for substantial damages, arguing that the broadcaster infringed his right to privacy when it used a helicopter to film officers raiding his Berkshire home in August 2014. The singer strongly denied the accusation that he assaulted a boy after an event in Sheffield during the mid-1980s, and no charges were ever brought. South Yorkshire police have already paid £400,000 to the singer after the incident. Compton told the court on Wednesday that he was shocked when he was informed by the force’s press officer that a BBC journalist, Dan Johnson, had been in touch about the nascent investigation in July 2014. The police press officer claimed Johnson had said he was ready to publish a story on the investigation. “I can remember very clearly thinking there was a journalist who knew as much as I did about the allegations,” Crompton said. “This information was deeply concerning to me because I thought that a media report on a high-profile case, which was in its infancy, could fatally compromise [South Yorkshire police’s] ability to carry out a thorough investigation.” As a result the decision was taken to cooperate with the BBC and tell the broadcaster when a raid would take place, the court heard. Crompton told the court that when he finally saw helicopter footage of the raid he thought it was “intrusive” and swiftly texted a colleague asking him to be careful about what iwas “said on email” about the case because he was concerned about a freedom of information request. Earlier on Wednesday, Fran Unsworth, who is now the BBC’s director of news and current affairs, told the court it was the right decision to press ahead with the coverage. “I took the view, and still do, that we had a responsibility in the public interest, this whilst being sensitive to the position of Sir Cliff,” she said. “The BBC has publicly said it is very sorry that Sir Cliff has suffered distress and that remains the position.” She also said it was correct for the broadcaster to use helicopter footage of the singer’s home. “They did not show anything which I would describe as personal or intrusive and [it] lasted a few seconds.” Unsworth was also questioned on why the BBC decided to submit the story for “scoop of the year” in the Royal Television Society’s annual broadcast news awards, a decision she said had sent the wrong signals. The case continues."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/apr/29/the-deminer-mine-clearing-mosul-review","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-29T07:00:39Z","webTitle":"The Deminer review – a gripping tour with a hands-on minesweeper","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/apr/29/the-deminer-mine-clearing-mosul-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/apr/29/the-deminer-mine-clearing-mosul-review","fields":{"headline":"The Deminer review – a gripping tour with a hands-on minesweeper","bodyText":"Assembled mostly from home video footage shot by army colonel Fakhir Berwari and his associates between 2003 and 2008, this tense verité documentary is a difficult, thrilling watch.

These methods are so effective they can activate similar mechanisms as cocaine in the brain, create psychological cravings and even invoke “phantom calls and notifications” where users sense the buzz of a smartphone, even when it isn’t really there. “Facebook, Twitter and other companies use methods similar to the gambling industry to keep users on their sites,” said Natasha Schüll, the author of Addiction by Design, which reported how slot machines and other systems are designed to lock users into a cycle of addiction. “In the online economy, revenue is a function of continuous consumer attention – which is measured in clicks and time spent.” Whether it’s Snapchat streaks, Facebook photo-scrolling, or playing CandyCrush, Schüll explained, you get drawn into “ludic loops” or repeated cycles of uncertainty, anticipation and feedback — and the rewards are just enough to keep you going. “If you disengage, you get peppered with little messages or bonus offers to get your attention and pull you back in,” said Schüll. “We have to start recognising the costs of time spent on social media. It’s not just a game – it affects us financially, physically and emotionally.” Recreating the slot machine The pull-to-refresh and infinite scrolling mechanism on our news feeds are unnervingly similar to a slot machine, said Tristan Harris, a former design ethicist for Google who has been described as the closest thing Silicon Valley has to a conscience. “You pull a lever and immediately receive either an enticing reward (a match, a prize!) or nothing,” Harris wrote. We cannot know when we will be rewarded, and more often than not we don’t find anything interesting or gratifying, much like gambling. But that’s precisely what keeps us coming back. “The rewards are what psychologists refer to as variable reinforcement schedules and is the key to social media users repeatedly checking their screens,” said Dr Mark Griffiths, a professor of behavioural addiction and director of Nottingham Trent University’s International Gaming Research Unit. “Social media sites are chock-a-block with unpredictable rewards. They are trying to grab users’ attentions ... to make social media users create a routine and habitually check their screens.” Like gambling, which physically alters the brain’s structure and makes people more susceptible to depression and anxiety, social media use has been linked to depression and its potential to have an adverse psychological impact on users cannot be overlooked or underestimated. For instance, phone dependency, driven by high social-media usage, can lead us to think our phone is vibrating, or that we have received a message, even when we haven’t. “Phantom calls and notifications are linked to our psychological craving for such signals,” said Professor Daniel Kruger, an expert in human behaviour, from the University of Michigan. “These social media messages can activate the same brain mechanisms as cocaine [does] and this is just one of the ways to identify those mechanisms because our minds are a physiological product of our brain.” “There are whole departments trying to design their systems to be as addictive as possible. They want you to be permanently online and by bombarding you with messages and stimuli try to redirect your attention back to their app or webpage.” Tech insiders have previously said “our minds can be hijacked” and that Silicon Valley is addicting us to our phones, while some have confessed they ban their kids from using social media. However, the number of monthly active users of Facebook hit 2.13 billion earlier this year, up 14% from a year ago. Despite the furore around its data privacy issues, the social media monolith posted record revenues for the first quarter of 2018, making $11.97bn, up 49% on last year. A key reason for this is because Facebook has become so entrenched in our lives: we can’t put it down. Behavioural psychologist, Nir Eyal, the author of Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products, has conceptualised how people become attached to social media. “It starts with a trigger, an action, a reward and then an investment and its through successive cycles, through these hooks, that habits are formed. We see them in all sorts of products, certainly in social media and gambling. This is a big part of how habits are changed.” Once a habit is formed something previously prompted by an external trigger, like a notification, email, or any sort of ring or ding, is no longer needed, Eyal remarked. It is replaced or supplemented with an internal trigger meaning that we form a mental association between wanting to use this product and seeking to serve an emotional need. “The products are built to be engaging and what’s engaging for some is addictive for others, that’s clear.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/26/theresa-may-labour-customs-union","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-26T08:46:55Z","webTitle":"Theresa May has no choice.

She must back Labour on a new customs union","bodyText":"The government is crashing toward the critical stages of Brexit negotiations. In 11 months we leave the EU and enter a transition period. The prime minister can no longer rely on warm platitudes or catchy phrases, but will soon be judged on the reality of the deal she achieves (or worse, the no-deal she ends up with). The success of Brexit now hinges fundamentally on two questions: whether our new relationship with the EU will put the British economy first, and whether the Good Friday agreement, which has brought lasting peace in Northern Ireland, will be respected. To achieve both outcomes, the UK must negotiate a new customs union with the EU. This would ensure that no Northern Irish border is necessary. It would also maintain the frictionless movement of goods into and out of the country, keeping many of the benefits of trade with the EU. It was a former prime minister who once noted how “it is no small thing to have completed and preserved a customs union covering a market of nearly 300 million people”. No, not the words of Tony Blair, nor Harold Wilson, but of Margaret Thatcher. Oddly, this puts the Iron Lady on the same side as Jeremy Corbyn when it comes to this crucial issue of Britain’s future relationship with the EU (though not much else), and on a different side of the argument to Theresa May. By explicitly ruling out such an aspiration in her negotiating stance, May takes a rather lonely perch against this consensus, confined by the ideological whims of the Tory hard-right. This is an unenviable position for the prime minister, who looks increasingly exposed to the judgment of history. Politics is, after all, about building coalitions. This is a point not overlooked by MPs from across the political spectrum, who are coalescing around a motion that calls for the government to accede to Labour’s demand for a customs union. The benefits of Labour’s position are so many that most MPs now find it impossible to disagree that it is the only route forward. The motion has found signatories from almost all parties, and was tabled by the chairs of every select committee in the Commons. It leaves those who support British isolation after Brexit looking rather isolated themselves. Should this cross-party coalition win the vote today it would be yet another symbol of a widening split between parliament and the government over May’s Brexit approach. We have seen the government defeated three times in the Lords, including on the question of a customs union. With legislation still going through the Commons on our future relationship, it seems the voice of parliament will be respected. The case is now overwhelming. The government must back Labour’s position of negotiating a new customs union with the EU, as outlined in full by Corbyn at the beginning of this year, and by Thatcher 40 years earlier. • Peter Dowd is shadow chief secretary to the Treasury"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/25/tech-no-moral-code-racist-ads-cambridge-analytica-technology-ethical-deficit","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-25T14:52:39Z","webTitle":"Tech has no moral code.

The 2016 US election was a turning point for what was formerly the face of upbeat, self-actualising capitalism. Today the common view is that a tiny minority has been making money by disrupting things at the expense of the majority. Technology companies are out of control because law-makers have been neglectful, indifferent or – worse – baffled by the prospect of regulation. But in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica/Facebook data-harvesting scandal, there is new interest in the role of ethical considerations in the work of technology companies, and the programmers who build their machinery. Engineers have traditionally not been required to reflect on the work they do in its broader social context. The technological design process rarely lends itself to consideration of power dynamics, even though they are never absent. I once heard a coder talk about scratching his itches, by which he meant building computer programs to solve the problems that he confronted. Coding is about writing the most elegant program to get a computer to complete a task, which can be anything from fixing a bug or creating a plugin to swapping pictures of politicians with cats. Ethical considerations are often considered outside the engineers’ remit or above their pay grade – for others to ponder, while they build stuff. The problem with this outlook is that digital technology is so widely used, the coders who write the programs need to anticipate the needs of others, their vulnerabilities and circumstances: a significant and complex task. We have seen the unintended consequences of earlier failures to undertake such work – where code has gone wrong. Five years ago, the Harvard professor Latanya Sweeney produced convincing research about Google searches for African-American names being more likely, when compared with searches for white-sounding names, to generate adverts for companies that offer background checks – raising the suggestion that the person might have a criminal record. Google photos have tagged photos of African-American people as “gorillas”. Until recently, Facebook had an algorithm that generated categories for use in targeted advertising that included people who expressed interest in topics such as “Jew hater”. Google has had a similar problem with targeted categories that were racist. It is not that the people who coded these programs are racist. Individual workers are not to blame for these bad outcomes. On the contrary, they arise because of many factors, including the profit motive, rushed design, and a lack of diversity among technology workers, which reduces the chances that thoughtful programs will be written, with sufficient attention paid to issues of diversity and discrimination. If company executives command that their workers move fast and disrupt things, the presumption is clearly that other people will be forced to pick up the pieces. Martin Lewis, the UK consumer advice and money-saving expert, is now suing Facebook over fake adverts using his name and face to lure people into costly scams. The company’s algorithms have allowed certain people to be targeted with these false adverts, rather than having systems of checks and balances that might pick up these problems. Similarly, more human moderation of misogynistic “incel” (involuntarily celibate) forums and warnings of rebellion on Facebook profiles that might be linked to the Toronto van attack could prevent atrocities. The future of technology is not fixed. Addressing the problems facing us will require all kinds of efforts. But one thing that needs to happen is that ethical considerations must be brought to the fore. Lawyers owe their highest duty to the court. Doctors owe theirs to patients. Such frameworks can be a way for technology professionals to articulate the conditions necessary to do their jobs well. They also ask us to consider to whom software engineers should be accountable – their chief executives, themselves, or the public? We are already starting to see how ethical considerations can serve as a focal point for industrial and political organising in tech companies. Thousands of Google employees recently signed a letter protesting at the company’s involvement in a Pentagon project to apply artificial intelligence to footage collected from drones. Dozens of scientists from numerous countries have called for a boycott of a South Korean university that wants to create autonomous robots for defence purposes. Thousands of engineers in the US signed a pledge refusing to build an immigrant database. The Tech Workers Coalition helped organise a protest outside Palantir, the US company creating an enormous technological spy brain used by police and spooks. Such actions by individuals and groups require bravery and deserve public support. They also remind us what is possible, and give us the chance to talk about where such activism might lead. Ethical design can serve as a bulwark against the relentless pursuit of profit and power. Builders of digital technology need space, and encouragement, to discuss the resources they need, if they are to work in ways that are respectful and focused on the needs of users. Proper regulation of these industries by governments is well overdue, but it’s not a total answer. Workers need the power to resist the business model that creates these problems, and they often have good ideas about how to solve them. What might such problem-solving look like? It will start with more ethical training, both as part of every computer engineer’s education, and on the job. It could include ideas such as allowing users to know what data is collected about them, and giving them the choice of what and how they want to share. It might also require actively considering the experience of a diverse cohort of users, and involving them in the development and beta testing of new programs and tools. Oversight by humans may be more expensive than automation, but it is essential and unavoidable if we want to improve our digital environment. Over time, such work might broaden into questions about political power. Might we foster a culture that lionises technology for peaceful purposes, and start to challenge technology in the service of prisons and the military? In short, create a culture that is the opposite of “move fast and disrupt things” – one that takes the time to build things respectfully, in ways that empower people. • Lizzie O’Shea, a human rights lawyer, is writing a book on the politics of technology"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"fashion/2018/apr/25/baldly-go-where-lots-of-men-have-gone-before","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-25T16:23:00Z","webTitle":"Baldly go where lots of men have gone before | Brief letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/apr/25/baldly-go-where-lots-of-men-have-gone-before","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2018/apr/25/baldly-go-where-lots-of-men-have-gone-before","fields":{"headline":"Baldly go where lots of men have gone before","bodyText":"Frances Ryan (In plain view, 25 April) highlights yet another catastrophic treatment of people by the government: the freezing of the fund for disabled would-be politicians.

We must learn to find value in solitude","bodyText":"Loneliness – the sense of isolation, accompanied by the feeling of alienation – has always been a feature of the human condition. References to the unhappy state of loneliness are scattered throughout the Bible. As the 17th century poet John Milton reminded us: “Loneliness is the first thing which God’s eye named not good.” However, it was only in the early modern era that people started talking about loneliness as a standalone problem. Until the 19th century, loneliness tended to be associated with the physical state of being apart from society or company. During the 19th century, loneliness became associated with people’s inner state, and philosophers such as Kierkegaard were preoccupied with the fear of loneliness. Until the 21st century, loneliness was principally a problem addressed by theologians, philosophers, sociologists, poets and artists. In recent times it has become an issue for health professionals. Unfortunately, once a dimension of the human condition becomes framed in the language of medicine, it is only a matter of time before it acquires the status of an epidemic. Inevitably, health professionals in the US have sounded the alarm on the loneliness epidemic. Loneliness is the fashionable new problem in the UK. Earlier this year the UK government appointed Tracey Crouch into the newly established post of minister for loneliness. The appointment follows a series of alarming reports about the prevalence of loneliness among elderly people; this month the problem expanded to include young people. The Office for National Statistics reported that “young adults are more likely to feel lonely than older age groups”. Earlier this week, a study claimed that “lonely millennials” faced a variety of health and social problem. No doubt there are millions of us who feel lonely. It is impossible to determine with any degree of accuracy whether people are more lonely than in previous times. We certainly talk a lot more about it. But the feeling and the emotions associated with loneliness cannot be reduced to measurable quantities. So when campaigners assert that loneliness is a “comparable risk factor for early death as smoking 15 cigarettes a day, and is worse for us than well-known risk factors such as obesity and physical inactivity”, they speak as propagandists rather than as scientists. Campaigners who warn that “loneliness increases the likelihood of mortality by 26%” turn an intangible feature of our inner life into calculable quantities. The medicalisation of loneliness mystifies a condition for which there is no cure. Loneliness often expresses the difficulty that we have in understanding our place in the world. When people struggle to come to terms with their self and find it difficult to gain affirmation, loneliness can assume the form of an existential crisis. The philosopher Hannah Arendt described loneliness as “that nightmare which, we all know, can very well overcome us in the midst of a crowd” when we feel “deserted by oneself”. She argued that this nightmare is a symptom of the difficulty we have in engaging with ourselves. Arendt believed that the destructive effects of loneliness could be contained through the habit of conversing with oneself. She called this “silent dialogue of myself with myself” solitude. For Arendt, solitude had a positive connotation. She wrote that “though alone, I am together with somebody (myself) that is”. Arendt’s attempt to convert loneliness through an inner dialogue into solitude offers one way of coming to terms with our estrangement from ourselves, Others, such as the writer Maya Angelou, found refuge in music. “I could crawl into the space between the notes and curl my back to loneliness”, she wrote. Still others, such as the existentialist feminist writer Simone de Beauvoir, embraced loneliness and sought to harness its creative force. What they all understood was that we can exist with loneliness through finding value in our solitude. Meaning, rather than a cure, helps us deal with the problems of existence. • Frank Furedi’s How Fear Works: Culture of Fear In The 21st Century will be published in June by Bloomsbury Press."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/apr/25/jim-faley-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-25T16:53:36Z","webTitle":"Jim Faley obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/25/jim-faley-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/apr/25/jim-faley-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Jim Faley obituary","bodyText":"My father, Jim Faley, who has died aged 90, was a man who lived his life based on family, a strong work ethic and integrity. In the 1940s and 50s he was employed as a fireman on steam locomotives with the London and North Eastern Railway, and his tasks included firing the Mallard and the Flying Scotsman. When he was nearly home, my mother and brother would stand on a bridge waiting for his train to pass underneath. He would blow the whistle and give an extra “toot” if he was going to make it back for tea. Born in Lemington, Newcastle upon Tyne, Jim had a hard childhood. His mother, Emma (nee Baker) died while he was a boy, and shortly afterwards he went to live with his father’s sister, Carrie, and her husband, Ned. His family’s circumstances prevented him from taking up his place at grammar school. Instead, he started work aged 14 at Cramlington pit. There his maths and organisational skills saw him promoted quickly from coal sorter to wages cashier. Following a succession of other jobs, he joined the LNER in 1944 as an apprentice, and then fireman. He longed to join the RAF during the second world war, but when the recruiting officer discovered he worked on the railway he was sent back to this “reserved occupation”. The railway career ladder would have meant another 20 years’ service before becoming a train driver, and he needed a higher salary to provide for his growing family, so, after 12 years, he left for a better-paid job in insurance. He later worked in the construction industry, as a purchasing manager for Tilcon. Jim retired in 1991. Major heart surgery allowed him to live a full and active life until relatively recently, attending the local church (where he often read the lesson at Sunday mass), playing golf and watching sport, and helping out friends and neighbours. He died as he lived: patient, ready and supported by his wife, Joan (nee Welsh), whom he married in 1953.

It was pointed out on Tuesday that the words on the banner that the statue holds – “Courage calls to courage everywhere” – were written by Fawcett about the suffragette Emily Wilding Davison, who died on 8 June 1913, days after running on to the Derby racecourse. What was not said was that those words were not written at the turbulent time of Davison’s death, when Fawcett made no public comment, but in the relative safety of 1920. The NUWSS, which Fawcett headed up, did not even send a wreath to Davison’s funeral and refused to take part. To include these words on the banner is a travesty of justice, especially since the picture of Davison is placed at the back of the statue’s plinth, hidden from view. And that is not the only point. Fawcett does not represent the diversity of the women’s suffrage movement. The well-known suffragette leader Emmeline Pankhurst (whose name was not even mentioned in the speeches) should also be in Parliament Square. After all, Caroline Criado-Perez, in her original petition for female representation in the square, signed by nearly 85,000 people, campaigned for a statue of a “suffragette”, not a “suffragist”. June Purvis University of Portsmouth • It is not before time that Millicent Fawcett has been honoured with Gillian Wearing’s magnificent sculpture in Parliament Square. Sadly this contrasts with the neglect of her portrait, painted by fellow suffragist and pioneering artist Annie Swynnerton. Bought for the nation by the Chantrey Bequest in 1930, and in the possession of Tate Britain, where it was on display in February this year for the first time in 30 years, but for only about a week, prior to its going to Manchester Art Gallery, where it is currently on show as part of a major retrospective exhibition of the work of Annie Swynnerton, the first woman to be elected an associate of the Royal Academy. Our concern is that when this exhibition closes in January next year, the painting will not only return to the Tate, but to the obscurity of the stack. It may well be more appropriate that some agreement should be reached between the Tate and the National Portrait Gallery, which would ensure that Fawcett has a permanent place with the many other pioneers who have helped to shape our society. The portrait shows Fawcett in her academic robes from the University of St Andrews where she received an honorary doctorate in 1899, and was first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1930, when the Manchester Guardian described it as showing “the great leader of the woman’s suffrage cause in her most vital personality”, and the Times correspondent wrote “Mrs Swynnerton presents you to a real human being”. Both of these pioneering women deserve a place of lasting recognition.

The Egyptian has 43 goals in 47 clubs games this season, which is incredible enough, and thanks in no small part to his contribution against Roma his club are favourites to reach the Champions League final. If Salah can keep up his goalscoring and his knack of influencing the outcome of important matches he will certainly be a contender, and his Anfield team‑mates are backing him all the way. “Mo is becoming a superstar,” Dejan Lovren said after Salah’s performance against Roma. “It looks easy what he does, but it is very difficult. I don’t want to put any extra pressure on him and maybe this is not the right time but if he continues like that he has every right to be regarded as one of the best three in the world at the end of the year. “When people talk about Ronaldo and Messi they should also talk about Salah. He deserves it, he deserves to be mentioned for the Ballon d’Or. At the start of the season I didn’t know he could do this, but you see how he is working, how he wants the ball, he is just a different player to what he was. “I think our style helps him a lot. He didn’t play that way for Basel or Chelsea or Roma, but the way we can find him suits him perfectly. The most important thing now is for him to stay injury free. If he can do that, anything is possible.” Trent Alexander-Arnold, whose improvised pass sent Salah on his way to set up Liverpool’s third goal, agrees it is easy to play with someone who not only finds space but knows how to use it. “You know he is quick, you know he is smart and really intelligent, so I think we all know our game-plan,” the teenage full-back said. “We know if we hit it into the channels there will be a runner on the end of it and more often than not it is Mo on the right. “He’ll get on the end of it and usually manage to make something happen, which is a credit to him. There is still a long way to go to the Ballon d’Or ceremony, so he has another six months or so to carry on, but I think the team would back him to continue doing well.” The only downside as far as Alexander-Arnold is concerned is having to face such a tricky player in training. “It’s a nightmare when you are up against him,” he said. “It’s great to watch him scoring his goals and growing in confidence, he produces cool finishes day in and day out and it’s become second nature to him now, but I can’t say I really like it when he does that stuff to me. “The good thing about the second leg in Rome is that Mo is on our side not theirs. It’s much better to be playing with him rather than against him, and though Roma showed they are a threat in scoring their two goals, they know that we carry a goal threat as well. Maybe in the last 15 minutes of the first leg we lost our concentration, a little bit. I think we will all learn from that, but you don’t expect to be five goals up in a Champions League semi-final. It was hard not to get carried away with the atmosphere and the scoreline at the time, but we know what we need to do now. We have to go to Rome and finish the job.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/26/avicii-music-inspired-snobbishness-yet-he-was-sound-collective-euphoria-elle-hunt","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-26T06:00:10Z","webTitle":"Avicii’s music inspired snobbishness – yet he was the sound of collective euphoria | Elle Hunt","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/26/avicii-music-inspired-snobbishness-yet-he-was-sound-collective-euphoria-elle-hunt","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/26/avicii-music-inspired-snobbishness-yet-he-was-sound-collective-euphoria-elle-hunt","fields":{"headline":"Avicii’s music inspired snobbishness – yet he was the sound of collective euphoria","bodyText":"I did not know Tim Bergling, the 28-year-old Swede who died on 20 April. But I knew Avicii well. His bouncy, blatant electronic dance music – how you imagine strobe lights might sound – was the soundtrack to my first few years at university. In 2011, whether you were drinking cheap wine out of a mug in someone’s room, or amid a heaving mass of strangers at the same grimy nightclub you went to every week, or eating pizza outside afterwards, it was only a matter of time before you heard his breakout hit Levels. Often, you would hear it more than once, as DJs, buoyed by the joyous reaction its opening bars elicited, tried their luck to see if the same trick would work twice. It usually did. There was such appetite for Levels that, when the rapper Flo Rida sampled it on Good Feeling just a month after its release, his take also topped the charts. The song was ubiquitous in the way only a smash-hit single can be, the kind that makes a specific time and place feel written into the music. Many of Avicii’s songs were like that: Wake Me Up, You Make Me, Hey Brother, Addicted to You, X You, I Could Be the One. He often paired an upbeat acoustic guitar riff with an unlikely vocal – a 1962, gospel-inspired Etta James sample on Levels; the neo-soul singer Aloe Blacc on Wake Me Up; an uncredited Adele soundalike (Audra Mae) on Addicted to You – before launching into his trademark frantic synths, irrespective of whether the song had sounded like it was heading in that direction. I now struggle to tell these songs apart, at least until the drop kicks in – but they were never meant to be heard by an individual, through tinny earbuds, in the daytime. These were the songs of Saturday night, 2011-14. If you are in your 20s now and went to a nightclub, music festival, house party or shopping centre between mid-2011 and early 2012, the chances are you had an Avicii moment, whether you recognised it at the time or not. There is a particular snobbishness towards Avicii’s brand of big, unabashed EDM that relates to the notion that music of value cannot be computer-generated or enormously popular, but the same distaste is generally not applied to Daft Punk, for example, or Taylor Swift. His is the kind of music that is readily dismissed as something you “press a button on a laptop” to make. (Would that such a button existed!) Even now, when the divide between high and low culture is being smoothed out and there is said to be no such thing as a guilty pleasure, you may be more likely to “own up” to liking Levels than to declare it proudly (you might just sequester it on your gym playlist). But Avicii’s music was that rare thing in a world where culture has atomised: the soundtrack to moments of pure, collective euphoria. When, in 2013, Bergling was asked how he felt about criticisms of his music being “too mainstream”, he did not engage with the charge. “I’ve always been mainstream,” he said. “I don’t see it as something negative at all.” By defining the sound of that period, Avicii gave us a way to access it years later. Many of the bars where I first heard Levels have closed down and been reborn as nicer joints – but the opening bars take me straight back there, to Hope Bros and Temperance, to flashing lights and the first flushes of independence and something resembling adulthood. For a friend I had dinner with after news broke of Bergling’s death, the song evoked her last years of high school. We had never spoken about Avicii before, and certainly would never have introduced ourselves as fans – but I suppose I had known innately, by virtue of our ages, that it was likely to be something we shared. That is part of the joy of popular culture when it is properly popular: you are in it with everybody else. Kanye West: making Twitter great again My pick for bon mot of the decade? “I hate when I’m on a flight and I wake up with a water bottle next to me like oh great now I gotta be responsible for this water bottle.” That or: “What do I have to do to get a simple persian rug with cherub imagery uuuuugh.” Both are tweets sent by Kanye West in 2010, the first and golden age of Twitter that West played a fundamental role in creating. The platform seemed purpose-built to accommodate his mile-a-minute inner monologue (“Sometimes I get emotional over fonts”; “I would like to thank Julius Caesar for originating my hairstyle”) and soon he had tens of millions hanging on his every 140-character observation. But, like many Twitter users, West was clearly conflicted about the platform, deleting his entire oeuvre in 2012 on what NME called “a black day for anyone who enjoys the gushing firehose of randomness and arrogance”. Now he is back (greeted with a hero’s welcome by Twitter founder Jack Dorsey) and apparently in the mood to inspire. “Constantly bringing up the past keeps you stuck there.” “Everyone should be their own biggest fan.” “Prince opened up for Rick James. everybody starts some where.” “You can say anything as long as you put the right emoji next to it.” At the time of writing, West has sent 140 tweets in 11 days, but give him 10 minutes and a spark of inspiration and that total could double. Late on Tuesday night, he tweeted: “2024”, suggesting his slated presidential bid may have been set back four years. The day before, West had reiterated to a radio interviewer his support for President Trump, a similarly enthusiastic tweeter. The specifics of West’s run remain unclear, but if we can take tweets as policy announcements now, I would go for “practice [sic] pure love” over talk of nuclear buttons. Will I visit London’s lump of gunk? Fat chance I have not gone to see the pride of London, the fatberg, on display. I am left cold by the idea. But the seemingly bottomless interest in fatbergs, evinced most recently by Channel 4’s “autopsy from the sewers”, suggests I am in the minority. The most generous explanation for this national fascination is that it allows us to confront the physical impact of our single-use, plastic-is-fantastic society. But my sense is that it is more about voyeurism and our childish glee in being revolted – the same impulse that, when we smell something bad, leads us to urge others to smell it, too.

His administration was immediately criticized for its reluctance to accept people fleeing the war-torn country: in the past six months, the US has accepted 44 Syrian refugees – just two more than died in the Douma gas attack. This week, Trump’s travel ban was back in the supreme court, as the legal battle continues to rage around his most high-profile effort to curb migration. But behind the scenes, a slew of other measures has already slashed refugee resettlement to the US. “The administration has turned its back on the country’s historical practice of welcoming and resettling refugees in this country,” said Jennifer Sime, senior vice-president of US Programs at the International Rescue Committee (IRC). The US government has said it will admit 45,000 refugees from around the world in 2018 – the lowest number in more than 30 years – but advocates say that the country is on course to admit barely half that number. US vetting procedures were already rigorous before the government made them more stringent in October 2017 with additional measures including extra security vetting and a 90-day halt on refugee admissions from “high risk” countries. These new measures and three attempts to introduce travel bans have caused a sharp decline in resettlement and sewn deep uncertainty in people fleeing danger or hoping to rejoin their families. “Nobody is against the vetting system. We all recognize that it needs to be there and that is OK,” said Sime. “But making refugees jumping through unnecessary hoops is something that should be examined.” The IRC says it anticipates no more than 23,000 refugees will enter the US before the fiscal year ends on 30 September. For Syrians, the numbers have decreased from 5,839 resettlements in the first half of fiscal year 2017 to 44 resettlements in same period in 2018 – a 99% drop. Eman and Amneh, two sisters from Damascus, reached the US in February 2017, before the additional measures were in place, and now live in Idaho. But they left behind their father and Amneh’s husband, who she had just married. At the time, the UN’s refugee agency (UNHCR) told them the men would be able to follow in six to eight months on refugee relative petition, but more than a year later, there is no sign that the family will be reunited. “It was really hard at the beginning. It is still hard,” said Amneh, 25. “You cannot know what the future will bring, and you cannot know when you will meet your husband, your dad. “I just want to be peacefully with all my family around me: my dad, my husband, my sisters and my brother. And I think that is the simplest right of any human.” UN ambassador claims no Syrian refugees want to resettle in US More than 5.4 million people have fled Syria since the civil war broke out there seven years ago, most of them to nearby countries in the Middle East. Earlier this month, Trump’s ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, was asked to explain why the US could target Syria with missiles, but admit almost no refugees from the country. In response, she claimed that Syrians she had met in refugee camps do not actually want to come to the US. “Not one of the many that I talked to ever said we want to go to America,” Haley said. “They want to stay as close to Syria as they can.” But one of the 44 Syrian refugees to resettle in the US in the past six months told the Guardian he was joyful to be in the US. “I was so happy and excited when they told me I was going to America. Everybody over there was dreaming of coming here,” said Imad, 55, now living in Atlanta. “They said I was one of the lucky ones.” He arrived in Georgia in October 2017 with his wife and three of his children, after fleeing his home in southern Syria in 2012 for Jordan. (Like Eman and Amneh, Imad asked to withhold his surname to protect family members still in Syria.) After nearly five years of waiting, Imad said arriving in the US was a relief. The only snag was that his 28-year-old son remains in Jordan even though he filed for resettlement before the rest of the family. “My wife is crying all the time,” said Imad, speaking through an interpreter. “We’ve called them 50 times. We don’t know why they have separated us.” He speaks frequently to his son, who he said is suffering from the uncertainty and the separation from his family. Imad apologized for sharing what he said was a sad story, and he was at pains to stress that he was grateful to the US. He said: “We’re just hoping our son will also come here and that we will be happy and united again.” Uncertainty weighs on refugees in US hoping to reunite with family Refugee resettlement has historically received bipartisan support in the US, but that shifted after 130 people were killed in the 2015 Paris terrorist attacks (even though the perpetrators were European citizens). Trump further weakened US support for refugees days after taking office, when he made his first attempt to introduce a travel ban on refugees and people from seven Muslim-majority countries. Amneh and Eman were caught up in the chaotic unrolling of the ban in January 2017. They had been set to travel to the US with their mother, two brothers and Eman’s children when the trip was abruptly cancelled. Just as abruptly, their trip was rescheduled six days later. After four years as refugees in Egypt, the relief of finally traveling somewhere they hoped they could rebuild their lives was paired with their fear of heading to a country whose government didn’t want them. “I had never heard about Boise,” Eman said. “I didn’t know what life will be like in Boise. It’s very difficult and fearful to a person.” Eman still finds life in Idaho challenging. She said she has been upset by people’s assumptions about Arab culture – one neighbour told her she was surprised her father let his daughters go to school. While the family was still in Egypt, Eman’s husband tried to head on to Europe, but drowned in the Mediterranean, so her father became especially important to her three children, aged seven, six and three. The 30-year-old widow said they speak to their grandfather every day by phone and tell him how easy it is to get to the US, if he would just board a plane. Sometimes, they ask her if he hasn’t traveled to the US because he doesn’t like them. “They are not adjusting,” Eman said. “All the time when I pick them up from school they say they want their dad.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/apr/27/my-partner-still-has-some-of-his-exs-underwear","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-27T11:30:58Z","webTitle":"My partner still has some of his ex’s underwear","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/27/my-partner-still-has-some-of-his-exs-underwear","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/27/my-partner-still-has-some-of-his-exs-underwear","fields":{"headline":"My partner still has some of his ex’s underwear","bodyText":"I am in the initial stages of a relationship with a wonderful, loving man.

The commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, also suggested that two executives at the firm, AggregateIQ, misledCanadian MPs on Tuesday when they claimed to have answered all of her questions fully. Her intervention was dramatically revealed during a session of a Canadian parliamentary committee on access to information, privacy and ethics with AIQ’s chief operating officer, Jeff Silvester, and his deputy, Zach Massingham. The hearing was ambushed by an email to members of the committee by the British MP Damian Collins, who is chairing a related inquiry into fake news and was watching a live-stream of the Canadian inquiry. Early in the two-hour hearing Silvester denied refusing to cooperate with Denham’s inquiry. He said: “On 17 May [2017], the Information Commission from the UK sent us a letter. We responded on 24 May. And then we didn’t hear from [Denham] again until 30 January 2018, when she sent us a letter and we replied. We have been cooperating the whole time.” After he said this, Collins emailed members of the committee citing communication with Denham to dispute Silvester’s evidence. During the hearing, the Canadian MP Nate Erskine-Smith said: “After my first round of questions I received a note from the chair of the UK digital and culture committee, Damian Collins. He has spoken after my questions to the UK information commissioner and she has indicated that AIQ has refused to answer her specific questions relating to data usage during the referendum campaign, and that the UK information commissioner is considering taking further legal measures to secure the information that she needs.” Another committee member, Frank Baylis, asked Silvester: “Who’s telling us the truth, you or her?” He replied: “If she has additional questions, I’m hopeful that she will follow up with us.” Later he added: “I’ve been 100% honest in all of my answers. We provided answers to all of the questions that she provided and offered to provide any clarification in our letter to her.” But Denham told the Guardian: “The Canadian company AIQ has so far not answered the substance of our questions in the ICO’s investigation. Contrary to the statements made to the Canadian parliamentary committee about cooperation, in recent correspondence we were advised that the company would not answer any more questions from my office, stated it was not subject to our jurisdiction, and considered the matter closed. We are considering the legal steps available to obtain the information.” Silvester and Massingham were also repeatedly asked about a £625,000 payment AIQ received from Vote Leave for advertising commissioned by BeLeave, amid allegations that it broke election spending rules. Both denied that the ad campaign was being coordinated, but admitted that AIQ had access to a Google drive run by Vote Leave which contained BeLeave documents. Massingham said the firm was aware that if the money was spent by Vote Leave on behalf of Vote Leave, this would have broken a spending cap. Erskine-Smith asked: “Did you not think it was strange you received £625,000 from Vote Leave to spend on behalf of BeLeave ... in the context that if they spent on behalf of Vote Leave they would have gone over the limit? Did this not raise any flags for you?” He replied: “No.” Silvester added: “When they asked us to do the work, we sent an invoice to BeLeave and then they let us know that was going to be paid by Vote Leave. That was all within a couple of days.” Erksine-Smith said: “How is that not a coordinated campaign between Vote Leave and BeLeave?” Massingham said: “I’m not sure.” At the end of the two-hour hearing, the chairman, Bob Zimmer, said: “We are all concerned. Something doesn’t smell right here. And I would challenge AIQ to do the right thing.” Silvester has previously said: “AIQ has never been, and is not a part of, Cambridge Analytica or [its parent firm] SCL. AIQ has never entered into a contract with Cambridge Analytica.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/may/02/pakistani-army-manzoor-pashteen-pashtun","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-02T04:00:02Z","webTitle":"'Are you with the tyrants?'

The charismatic 26-year-old, rarely seen without his “Pashteen hat”, leads the Pashtun Protection Movement (PTM), which has convulsed the country with unprecedentedly virulent criticism of the powerful armed forces. It accuses the military of being behind a litany of abuses in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (Fata), an inhospitable, mountainous region on the border with Afghanistan dominated by Pakistan’s 15-million-strong Pashtun minority and which has played host to a variety of terrorist groups. Although Pashteen is committed to non-violent protest, his youthfulness, firebrand speeches and distinctive headgear have drawn comparisons with Che Guevara. What marks the PTM out as a particular threat to Pakistan’s army, which has ruled the country for more than half its 70-year history, is that its allegations mirror those made by western officials, namely that the army plays a “double game” with regard to terrorism, silently supporting groups that target India and Afghanistan. The government has responded with a crackdown, banning rallies and harassing PTM supporters. Nine PTM activists have gone missing in Karachi, Pakistan’s southern business capital. At a rally last weekend in Swat, pro-military protesters tried to block entry to some of a 25,000-strong crowd. Even the “Pashteen hat” has been subjected to local, unofficial bans. Replicas can no longer be found in the Swat valley city of Mingora, where at least five shopkeepers selling the hat were recently detained and beaten by thugs associated with the military, locals say. At a rally in Lahore on 21 April, held in defiance of the government ban, Pashteen bowed his head like a boxer as minders escorted him through an exultant, selfie-taking crowd to a stage adorned with pictures of missing people. Earlier that day, sewage had mysteriously flooded the ground. About 8,000 people – many in the Pashteen cap – chanted “the uniforms are behind the terrorists”, a slogan that fosters particular apoplexy in the military’s headquarters in Rawalpindi. Pashteen tells his audience that he has come to Lahore, a city populated by relatively few Pashtuns, to “expose what the army are doing against us”. To his right, a gigantic poster shows a devastated, rubble-strewn street in a town in North Waziristan partly flattened during a 2014 military campaign against Pakistan’s Taliban. That campaign is credited with helping reduce deaths from terrorism by more than two-thirds. Yet, according to the PTM, ordinary Pashtuns were caught in the crossfire, and have ever since been subject to humiliating curfews, checkpoints and collective punishment by troops stationed to maintain order. So-called enforced disappearances generate particular grief. A government commission has dealt with almost 5,000 cases since 2011, but rights groups say this number vastly underestimates the scale of the problem. “According to the constitution, anybody who commits a crime must be produced in a court of law within 24 hours,” says Pashteen. “But so many people have been taken and are still missing.” His voice rising, almost to a scream, Pashteen yells at the crowd “are you with the tyrants?” He calls on ordinary soldiers to defy the orders of high command, a statement some have interpreted as treasonous. One rally-goer from Pakistan’s Punjab majority bites his lip and glances anxiously over his shoulder. “It’s quite remarkable hearing this,” he says, on condition of anonymity. “What it portends for Pakistan I don’t know.” By tradition the military is largely referred to in code, as “the establishment” or, in the case of agents of the feared Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), “angels”. Among PTM-supporters, however, that is changing. “Before the PTM we didn’t say anything, even in our bedrooms, about the ISI and military intelligence,” says Shehrullah Khan, whose brother was “disappeared” from his luggage shop in 2016. With some safety in numbers, “we can now say everything in our mind and hearts”. PTM leaders admit that some of the disappeared may have links to the Taliban, but argue that all should be produced in court to face charges. A white flag, representing the movement’s commitment to non-violent protest, flutters above the stage. Among the stereotypes Pashteen is helping to break down, says analyst Fasi Zaka, is that of “Pashtuns being a martial ethnic group given to conflict”. Its leaders argue that Pashtuns are more victims of the Taliban than the willing hosts often portrayed in the media. One, Ali Wazir, has had 17 members of his family or killed. The military response betrays choking discomfort. General Bajwa, the chief of army staff, has referred indirectly to the PTM as being “engineered” by Pakistan’s enemies. Reporting on the movement has been censored in the media. Yet, unable to stop its growth, corps commander Lt General Nazir Ahmad Butt held a meeting last week with the PTM to discuss its “legitimate grievances”, referring to a five-point list of demands that includes de-mining, the punishment of a Karachi police chief accused of carrying out extrajudicial killings, and a “truth and reconciliation commission” on enforced disappearances. “The PTM’s success,” says civil rights activist Jibran Nasir, is that after years of denial, some in the military “admit there have been some transgressions”. From the back seat of a car whisking him away from a horde of supporters, Pashteen tells the Guardian that he is unconcerned by a possible threat to his life. “At first my family said they would throw me out of the house,” he says, “but now they say if you are killed, then at least you will have done something for the people.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/apr/25/westminster-not-the-eu-is-to-blame-for-the-sorry-state-of-uk-fishing","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-25T16:23:29Z","webTitle":"Westminster, not the EU, is to blame for the sorry state of UK fishing | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/25/westminster-not-the-eu-is-to-blame-for-the-sorry-state-of-uk-fishing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/apr/25/westminster-not-the-eu-is-to-blame-for-the-sorry-state-of-uk-fishing","fields":{"headline":"Westminster, not the EU, is to blame for the sorry state of UK fishing","bodyText":"Bertie Armstrong, chief executive of the Scottish Fishermen’s Federation, claims that if Brexit happens we can “take back control of our waters” (Letters, 25 April). He cites the UN convention on the law of the sea (Unclos) as evidence. What the convention says is that “the coastal State, taking into account the best scientific evidence available to it, shall ensure through proper conservation and management measures that the maintenance of the living resources in the exclusive economic zone is not endangered by over-exploitation. As appropriate, the coastal state and competent international organisations, whether subregional, regional or global, shall cooperate to this end.” Britain and all EU member states are parties to Unclos, which also says that countries must jointly manage fish stocks that migrate between two or more countries’ waters. Those pesky fish species. More than 100 of the species present in UK waters have an annoying habit of not recognising the UK’s 200-mile coastal zone. So they have to be managed at levels that do not exceed maximum sustainable yield. There is widespread agreement that the UK should continue to fund, and take advice from, the International Council on the Exploration of the Sea, which is exactly the same advice on the basis of which total allowable catches are agreed at EU level. Sympathy should indeed lie with the smaller UK fishing communities. The blame, however, should not lie with the EU but with our own government. It is not the EU that decides how to allocate the UK’s quota between vessels but Defra. UK fishing industry revenues are growing again but the profits are going to a small number of larger offshore vessels, often owned by overseas companies. The UK government distributes less than 4% of its quota to inshore fishing vessels. We don’t need Brexit to have a change of policy on this.

Occasionally (say, at 2am at a house party), most of us would, but not Princess Margaret. At the recent GQ food and drink awards, the chef Richard Corrigan recalled the notoriously high-maintenance royal being so appalled by the tiny glasses on Concorde that she once grabbed a vase and used that for her G&amp;T instead. But how important is matching the right glass to your favourite drink? Craft beer With its bespoke Belgian chalices, 200ml kölsch stange and vase-like weizen glasses (designed variously to trap sediment, promote head retention, release volatile aroma compounds and so on), beer can get very technical. But for most pint drinkers (conical “shaker”, please!) errors are more prosaic. Don’t serve ales in daft nucleated lager glasses that make beer froth like a volcano, nor pricey beers in scratched old nonics. It is aesthetic. It is psychological. But when you are paying £4 a half for a rare US double IPA, a stemmed tulip glass makes the transaction feel less like daylight robbery. Brandy The scarcity of bulbous brandy snifters in modern bars is a sign of brandy’s declining popularity and a neglect of standards. That curvy crucible sits snugly in the hand for a reason (so you can easily warm the brandy), as its narrower neck concentrates its heady aroma. Serving brandy in a tumbler is as disgraceful as putting ice in it. Champagne Many experts now reject the traditional flute. Who knew? It may be an elegant visual showcase for champagne’s bubbles, but its narrowness (while it produces a fizzy tingle on the nose) inhibits the champagne’s character. Try a wider, airier white wine glass instead. Gin Princess Margaret’s thoughts on the Spanish copa de balon (the huge, stemmed fishbowls ubiquitous in serious gin bars) are not recorded, but in everything from how dramatic they look garnished with rosemary or peppercorn-studded ice to the science (stuffed with ice, they supposedly keep your drink colder, less diluted and fizzier for longer), the copa feels like a keeper. Goodbye limp, watery G&amp;Ts. Wine Undoubtedly, if you want to experience good wine at its best, you need specialist glassware. The volume of air in your glass is key to how wine expresses itself. The expense and boning-up necessary to achieve such marginal gains, however, compounds wine’s elitist image. In its emphasis on relaxed enjoyment over uptight appreciation, the recent push in wine to popularise multifunctional tumblers is a welcome revolution."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"film/2018/may/14/sir-review-sexual-tension-brews-in-mumbai","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-14T10:51:26Z","webTitle":"Sir review – sexual tension brews in Mumbai","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/may/14/sir-review-sexual-tension-brews-in-mumbai","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/may/14/sir-review-sexual-tension-brews-in-mumbai","fields":{"headline":"Sir review – sexual tension brews in Mumbai","bodyText":"The Indian screenwriter and documentary director Rohena Gera makes her fiction feature debut with this thoughtful and heartfelt drama she has written and directed, showing here at Cannes in the Critics’ Week sidebar. It’s a love story that slides a bit towards sentimentality and photo-love unreality in its final act, away from the strongly and plausibly rooted situation we had started out with – but the performances are likable and persuasive enough, particularly the female lead. Tillotama Shome (whose screen credits include Mira Nair’s Monsoon Wedding) plays Ratna, a young woman from a remote village who has come to Mumbai to be the live-in maid to a wealthy newly married couple in their handsome apartment. She has been allowed this relative freedom because she is a widow – her husband died shortly after their wedding. But something is very wrong. She is briskly informed by her employer that she will have to take up residency earlier than expected because the honeymoon isn’t happening. Then the supposed groom arrives on his own: the young, handsome and depressed Ashwin, played by Vivek Gomber. There has evidently been a monumental row, the marriage is off and now Ratna’s job is looking after this highly attractive and eligible young man. They will effectively be living together. After a tricky start, incorrectly cooking a mutton curry (as a vegan, she has no aptitude for the dish), Ratna soon smoothly becomes the perfect maid to someone she calls “Sir”. She is good at screening calls from his formidable and sorrowing mother; she tactfully suggests keeping all the unopened wedding presents in her tiny room so they don’t upset him. The gift pile in her personal space is an ever-present symbol of his catastrophic choices in love and dangerously unmarried status. Inevitably, Ashwin feels closer to Ratna than anyone. He gives her time off to learn the tailoring business, her ultimate dream, and he admires her courage and drive – so different from the spoilt princesses that his family and acquaintances are still trying to set him up with. And perhaps he also glumly senses that he too is spoilt. He has supposedly been a writer of “magazine articles” and “blog posts” in New York, but we never see him write a word, just indolently sit around watching TV. Soon a line is going to be crossed. This is, in many ways, a classical domestic drama about character, situation and social class. There are many pleasingly subtle touches. Ratna wears bangles on her wrists in Mumbai as a symbol of big-city fashion, but thoughtfully removes them on the bus when she heads home. The situation between Ratna and Ashwin begins to thaw when he sees her dancing in the street during a festival and they have to ride up in the elevator afterwards, the atmosphere pulsing with social and sexual tension. The problem is asymmetry. Ratna’s character is drawn more strongly and convincingly than Ashwin’s; he sometimes looks like a figure from a Bollywood comedy, whereas there is real depth, poignancy and strength to Shome’s character. Both the lovers and the film-maker face the dilemma of whether to consummate this forbidden desire, and Gera finesses it as far as she can. But it is a resolution that involves an implausible turnaround for a minor character who had seemed obnoxious but becomes considerate. Still, this is is a delicately observed and attractive drama with some great Mumbai cityscapes and an excellent performance from Shome."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2018/apr/28/janelle-monae-dirty-computer-observer-review","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-28T12:00:14Z","webTitle":"Janelle Monáe: Dirty Computer review – from dystopian android to R&B party girl","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/apr/28/janelle-monae-dirty-computer-observer-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/apr/28/janelle-monae-dirty-computer-observer-review","fields":{"headline":"Janelle Monáe: Dirty Computer review – from dystopian android to R&B party girl","bodyText":"The title of Janelle Monáe’s third full-length outing – a frontrunner for album of the year – suggests compromised hardware, the gunk in the machine. And really, a tech fetish would have come as little surprise for Monáe’s return to music. Machines have long been her thing. Well before her performances in the films Moonlight and Hidden Figures, and before her features on records by Grimes and fun., the singer-turned-actor came to renown with her own stylish, sci-fi concept album. Set in a futuristic dystopia, The ArchAndroid (2010) starred a saviour robot, Cindi Mayweather, and disdained easy categorisations, combining R&amp;B, pop and rock with Fritz Lang’s Metropolis and southern states sass. The early Monáe offered up dazzling avatars, embraced the speculative and swerved the lanes often assigned to young black women. She sang about far-fetched ideas, not sex; she wore black-and-white, uniform-style outfits that did not bare skin, but instead bore witness to her parents’ service industry jobs. She was cerebral, thought-provoking and refreshingly original, if, perhaps, a little distant. She even had a workshop-cum-label, Wondaland, in her adopted Atlanta, which mirrored Prince’s Paisley Park. During the filming of Black Panther, the cast would gather there for downtime and to listen to early cuts of Monáe’s newest songs. Now, with her profile burgeoning from screen roles, and stirring speeches at last year’s Women’s March and this year’s Grammys, Dirty Computer seizes Monáe’s moment. It is emphatically about people, and not our best metalwork. When Monáe offered a sneak peek at it in London last March, she frolicked and mimed her way through five tracks from the album’s midsection in the company of a bevy of dancers, in a celebration of joyous #blackgirlmagic. Hearing the songs again on headphones, without themed cocktails, their brio is undimmed. Ditching Monáe’s earlier sci-fi tropes, Dirty Computer retains some vestigial allegory. Co-starring Monáe and her Are-they-aren’t-they? muse Tessa Thompson, a short film – Monáe calls it an “emotion picture” – screened on MTV and BET in the US the night before this album’s release. Although the plot is set in another nearly now dystopia, the album is very much set somewhere pink and engorged and vulnerable. We are the dirty computers, with our corrupted drives, although Monáe’s liberating message here is on behalf of those who don’t fit the Trump-era matrix: the marginalised, “highly melanated”, the non-straight, the poor. The track Django Jane, released a couple of months ago, best displays Monáe’s fearlessness: every rapped line is barbed and brilliant, taking in her background, her success, its possible tokenism (“Prolly give a Tony to the homies”) and concluding with a salvo on behalf of creative black womanhood; even calling it “a salvo on behalf of creative black womanhood” can’t kill how great her flow is here. The politics of fear of the last few years (not to mention the inequity of ages) are woven through these songs of freedom and self-belief. Screwed (ft Zoë Kravitz) is, on the surface, a fruity pop tune that mulls how far south things have gone. But Monáe turns it into an analysis of power dynamics that takes in Prince (the Kiss-like opening riff), and Madonna (the dominatrix spoken bits). “Everything is sex, ’cept sex, which is power,” warns Monáe, a cultural studies professor manqué. “Now ask yourself, who’s screwing you?” The personal has long been political, but here Monáe is calling songs sweeping things such as Americans – the closing track, not the album’s most convincing – and singing pointed lyrics such as: “I am not America’s nightmare/ I am the American dream.” In one of the album’s most subversive acts, these bouts of flag-waving often come in the stadium pop vernacular, not hip-hop or R&amp;B. This album’s most obvious lodestone is 80s Prince, a Monáe collaborator and sounding board before his death in 2016, most audible on the terrific purple tribute, Make Me Feel. Here and there, though, there are faint and unexpected echoes of Taylor Swift. Released earlier this month, the song Pynk (ft Grimes) divided opinion, not least because of its high sugar content. It remains a sensational cut about cunnilingus, intimacy, and how all our insides are the same colour; Peaches for millennials. Most specifically of all, though, Dirty Computer concerns Monáe, who is now wearing colours, baring skin and singing about herself and not Cindi Mayweather. Long-time fans might miss the steely distance of all the Afrofuturist conceptualising, Monáe’s rigorous otherworldliness. But the aim here is to rocket-propel Monáe into the mainstream, and on that count Dirty Computer succeeds: it is a juicy, genre-crossing pop record ripe with the funk, which somehow combines Beyoncé’s Lemonade and St Vincent’s Masseduction with lashings of Lauryn Hill. The price? A lot of these songs are about sex, often in swimming pools, the kind of R&amp;B Monáe used to define herself against. Crazy, Classic, Life is a case in point: here, Monáe is “young, black, wild and free, naked in a limousine”. There is huge joy in R&amp;B and hip-hop depictions of partying, contrasting as they do with the deprivations that often preceded them. However, the jolt here – Monáe going from buttoned-up sphinx to party girl – is a little startling. But Monáe doesn’t care; she is sure of her tastes. I Like That is a declaration of individuality that is – paradoxically – hugely accessible, quoting TLC’s CrazySexyCool. Secondly, for all Monáe’s long-time campaigning to “Fem the Future” and her impeccable girl-positive credentials, there are a lot of chaps at work on this feminist tour de force: Prince; Pharrell Williams, squelchily frontin’ on I Got the Juice; the sage advice of Stevie Wonder on Stevie’s Dream; Brian Wilson on the title track’s harmonies. These reservations are offset by the depth of Monáe’s offering. You get a lot of her game face but you also get her insecurities. Drill down into the track listing and there are song titles such as Don’t Judge Me (airy psychedelic soul) and So Afraid (a grunge-like ballad that builds into more psychedelic soul) that get to the nub of things. Not Monáe’s sexuality per se, pretty much declared in the amazing vagina-trousered video for Pynk, but her fear: of letting the vast, trolly public in, of alienating the people who love her, as she points out in the sleeve notes to Don’t Judge Me. Monáe has cast off her carapace, and she’s frightened of the consequences. Somehow, it makes this album about fearlessness all the more inspiring."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/apr/27/royal-wedding-meghan-markle-prince-harry-media-magazines-fever","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-27T11:00:44Z","webTitle":"Royal wedding fever means big bucks and high views for US media","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/27/royal-wedding-meghan-markle-prince-harry-media-magazines-fever","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/apr/27/royal-wedding-meghan-markle-prince-harry-media-magazines-fever","fields":{"headline":"Royal wedding fever means big bucks and high views for US media","bodyText":"Commemorative magazines are already on the newsstands and news networks are ramping up their coverage. Meghan Markle’s marriage to Prince Harry next month offers the US media the prospect of vast numbers of viewers and readers, and a substantial advertising payday, according to media experts. “Over the course of 2018 we can expect to see media revenues related directly to the marriage of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle run as high as $100m,” estimates Mike Bloxham, an analyst at the media advisory firm Magid. “Everything attached to the American princess carries advertising inventory at an increased premium of one sort or another.” TV viewership for the event is expected exceed the 23 million who tuned in for Prince William’s wedding to Kate Middleton in 2011 – which itself exceeded the 17 million who watched William’s parents getting hitched in 1981. This time Americans have a player in the game – the first American royal bride since Grace Kelly married into Monaco’s house of Grimaldi in 1956 and Rita Hayworth wed Prince Aly Khan in 1949. In commercial terms, Bloxham compares nuptials to a major sporting event, with networks commanding $2m to $3m for ad packages around the broadcast and a 25% boost to spot ad rates. The digital arms of news organizations are reportedly offering ad packages in the half-million-dollar range. “Obviously the wildcard in the mix here is the participation of an American. While it’s a big yawn from some, many others are smitten, and that’s only increased by the participation of Meghan Markle and what she brings to the table,” Bloxham adds. “And it’s in marked contrast to the things driving media coverage for news networks, which have all been political and highly charged.” The major US networks began announcing their coverage lineups on Wednesday. Each is planning to fly in dedicated live news teams. “US networks will be sending 50 to 80 people to the UK for this, all told – quite possibly more,” says Bloxham. “When you take into account the logistical support required – even allowing for UK-based personnel being a part of the mix, it’s easy to see how the numbers start to spiral upward. “But the value that can be extracted from strong programming, popular on-air talent and the unique appeal of the occasion and it all becomes worthwhile.” “We won’t just be watching it. No, we will be across the pond – we will be there!” NBC host Savannah Guthrie has told her viewers. Her co-host Hoda Kotb, who along with colleagues Megyn Kelly, Kathie Lee Gifford, Al Roker and Sheinelle Jones will also be in the UK for the event, said: “We are all heading to England to bring you the excitement of the royal wedding.” NBC announced: “Other NBC News correspondents also will help capture the festivities around the town of Windsor, as well as nearby London.” CNN also has a large number of high-profile journalists going to the UK, including Christiane Amanpour, Anderson Cooper and Don Lemon. The network will also broadcast a special report on the relationship between Harry and Markle, “a biracial American child who grew up on the sidelines of Hollywood glamour and then worked her way to the centre of it”. CBS has said former Vanity Fair editor Tina Brown will feature as a “royal contributor” in its coverage, which will also include a two-hour primetime special on the couple. Gayle King, Kevin Frazier, Vladimir Duthiers and Steve Futterman will all be in the UK reporting on the wedding. Bloxham warned that the current estimates of numbers of US journalists travelling to cover the wedding could be too low, since Fox and ABC have yet to announce their plans. “This could not be a more American royal wedding, so my guess is we’re going to see more of a commitment from US networks, because Meghan is American and the level of interest is that much greater. There’s so much more money to be made.” Primed by the success of the TV show The Crown, royal fever has been building in the US, notes Vanity Fair editor Radhika Jones. The monarchy has updated its storylines with new blood and an uncommon sense on inclusivity. The families of heads of states act as symbols, Jones notes in her editor’s letter for the May issue of Vanity Fair, subtitled Love &amp; Royals. “Their values, for better or worse, have the power to reflect, and maybe redirect the nation’s values.” Josh Duboff, the author of the magazine’s cover story How to be a Princess in the Age of Instagram, one of eight royal-related stories in Vanity Fair’s May issue, said: “Meghan has captured a base in America that maybe hadn’t been following the royals’ every move before. She has so many attributes that make her an intriguing figure in the context of the royal family: being biracial, an American actress, and divorced. It’s like she was engineered for maximum American fascination.” That view is shared at other publishers. Julie Alvin, the senior digital director of the lifestyle group at publisher Meredith, which recently purchased many of the magazines at Time Inc, says Markle-related stories drive traffic to the company’s titles. “Seeing an American swept up into it captures the imagination in a really cool way,” Alvin says. “It doesn’t matter what publication, we’re getting traffic on content about Meghan and Harry.” She added: “People are obsessed with her as a style icon so we have a lot of luck shopping her looks out – that is showing people where they can get the looks.” The New York Times fashion editor Vanessa Friedman last week described Markle “the biggest influencer of all”. Monthly women’s interest magazine Real Simple has produced a video series called Road to the Royal Wedding that includes attending an etiquette class, visiting a milliner and going to Y-7, reportedly Markle’s favourite workout class. Elsewhere there are trending stories about the Queen’s last corgi, a new royal baby and more hat stories. “Everybody is just roundly fascinated. For Americans, it’s just so foreign,” said Alvin. “A lot of Americans think she’s really cool and are excited to see her on an international stage in a role traditionally filled by someone born and bred into that lifestyle.” All that stands in sharp contrast to the American political environment. “We want to hold on to moments of hope that maybe things are getting better, hope that racial equality is something we can achieve,” says Alvin. “So to see a woman of color in the role of princess feels good. It feels like a moment for equality to see her in such a place of stature.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2018/apr/26/bank-economist-andy-haldane-counselling-primary-school-pupils-mental-health","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-25T23:01:02Z","webTitle":"Bank economist calls for counselling for primary school pupils","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/apr/26/bank-economist-andy-haldane-counselling-primary-school-pupils-mental-health","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2018/apr/26/bank-economist-andy-haldane-counselling-primary-school-pupils-mental-health","fields":{"headline":"Bank economist calls for counselling for primary school pupils","bodyText":"The chief economist at the Bank of England has backed the use of counselling services for primary school children, arguing there is a strong economic case for investment in early intervention to improve mental health in later life. Andy Haldane, who is more commonly found grappling with interest rates and quantitative easing, has helped produce a report that suggests early mental health intervention in primary schools could lead to a sixfold return on the investment. Haldane is co-founder and trustee at Pro Bono Economics, which uses economic analysis to help charities and social enterprises understand and improve their impact. In this capacity he has contributed to a report for Place2Be, a school-based mental health charity that offers one-to-one counselling sessions for pupils. The Pro Bono Economics study analysed the improvement in mental health of pupils from 251 primary schools, covering 4,548 children who had received one-to-one support from Place2Be counsellors in 2016-17. It calculated that for every £1 invested out of a total of £4.2m, Place2Be’s counselling service had the potential to deliver a £6.20 societal return – £25.9m in total – by improving long-term outcomes for each child. Haldane said: “An estimated one in 10 children and young people in the UK have a mental health condition. Without effective intervention, these conditions can have a significant impact on their life chances and result in significant long-term costs. “These costs arise from a range of adverse outcomes for the individual, such as reduced earnings and increased government spending on education, social care, and youth and criminal justice.” The report calculates the potential benefit of Place2Be’s counselling service at £5,700 per child, of which just under 63% (£3,568) is attributed mainly to a child’s higher lifetime earnings from increased employment and higher wages. More than a third (£2,050 per child) represents savings to government due to increased tax revenue and lower spending on service such as health and criminal justice. The findings come at a time when many headteachers say they are having to cut pastoral care and mental health support in schools because of budget constraints. According to Department for Education research, 56% of primary schools offer counselling services, compared with 84% of secondary schools. Paul Whiteman, general secretary of National Association of Head Teachers, said: “[School leaders] are doing everything they can to give the children in their care the support they need, but it is becoming harder and harder as funding and resources get cut both for schools and for specialist mental health services. “This research shows so clearly the positive impact early help can have, for individuals and for society. It would be a sensible investment for the government to fully fund a universal rollout of mental health and wellbeing support in all schools.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2018/apr/25/google-youtube-kids-app-parent-control-what-children-watch","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-25T19:00:04Z","webTitle":"Google to improve YouTube Kids app to let parents control what children watch","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/25/google-youtube-kids-app-parent-control-what-children-watch","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/apr/25/google-youtube-kids-app-parent-control-what-children-watch","fields":{"headline":"Google to improve YouTube Kids app to let parents control what children watch","bodyText":"Google is updating its YouTube Kids app to improve the control over the videos and channels that can be watched by children. YouTube Kids is a separate app for smartphones and tablets that provides access to a subset of the videos available on the main site. There have been 70bn video views since the app, which is used by 11m families, launched in 2015. In the app’s biggest change yet, Google is giving parents much greater control over what their children can find and watch. In controls rolling out later this year, parents will be able to manually approve individual videos or channels that their children can access through the app, giving them the ability to pre-vet and handpick a collection of videos to ensure they are appropriate. Google is also creating collections of videos and channels from trusted channels such as Sesame Workshop and the YouTube Kids team, so that parents can select only the collections or topics they would like their children to have access to. James Beser, product director for YouTube Kids, said said: “From collections of channels from trusted partners to enabling parents to select each video and channel themselves, we’re putting parents in the driver’s seat like never before.” In addition the firm will limit the video recommendations the app will make to only those from channels that have been verified by the YouTube Kids team, when parents turn off the search function within the app. Previously recommendations could include content from any video or channel that is accessible through the YouTube Kids app, not just those verified by Google’s team. Google is also rolling out signed-in profiles for YouTube Kids across Europe, the Middle East and Asia this week, which means parents can create individual profiles for each of their children on shared devices. Beser said that the current version of the app will still be available for those who are content to use it, but that Google was continuing to “fine tune” its filters for the more open selection of content, encouraging parents to block and flag content they do not see as appropriate. Josh Golin, executive director of the Campaign for a Commercial Free Childhood, saw the move as broadly positive, but said that more parental controls do not absolve Google of its responsibility to keep inappropriate content out of the YouTube Kids app. “It’s been clear for a long time now that algorithmic filtering on YouTube Kids doesn’t work and giving parents the ability to select more human-reviewed content is an improvement,” Golin said. “But let’s not forget that most kids are watching the main YouTube platform, where they not only exposed regularly to inappropriate recommendations and content, but also ensnared by Google’s troubling data collection practices.” YouTube illegally collects data on children, say child protection groups"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/apr/26/james-cook-the-voyages-british-library-review","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-26T08:06:12Z","webTitle":"James Cook: The Voyages review – eye-opening records of colliding worlds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/apr/26/james-cook-the-voyages-british-library-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/apr/26/james-cook-the-voyages-british-library-review","fields":{"headline":"James Cook: The Voyages review – eye-opening records of colliding worlds","bodyText":"Sydney Parkinson drew the weird animal in a clear sharp line, looking at it carefully, then looking again, erasing his mistakes until he had an image that was beautifully recognisable. He wondered what to call this creature that was so utterly unlike anything back home in Britain. He found out by speaking with local people and making a brief dictionary of their language. You can picture, from the British Library’s moving and absorbing account of a moment when worlds apart suddenly met – how they communicated by pointing at parts of their bodies: words like belly, hand, foot. Among these basic terms is the name of the creature Parkinson drew. He transcribes it as “kangooroo”. It means, he says, “the leaping quadruped”. What he heard was probably the word “gangurru”, which is indeed the name of a type of kangaroo in the language of the Guugu Yimithirr people who James Cook, his crew, and the artists and scientists they took to the far side of the world met when they landed at the place they named Endeavour River. As an attempt to give an Australian species an Indigenous Australian name, kangooroo isn’t bad. Parkinson’s drawing – the first ever made by a European – is just one of his sensitive scientific images of flora and fauna including a great white shark. The adventure cost him his life: he died (of disease, not a shark bite) on the Endeavour’s voyage home. Another artist, Alexander Buchan, who portrayed the people of Tierra del Fuego, had died earlier in the voyage. The fact that artists, as well as scientists such as the pioneering naturalist Joseph Banks, went on Cook’s voyages was unprecedented. There were none on the ships of Columbus or Cabot. Cook’s first voyage went to Tahiti so a team of astronomers could observe the transit of Venus. They were not there to conquer. They got on well with the Tahitians – too well for Cook, who worried the newcomers would spread venereal disease and was upset when satirists back home had fun with the romantic exploits of Mr Banks. Banks’s friendship with the Tahitian female chieftain Purea led to the most unexpected of the expedition’s artworks. Tupaia, high priest of the god of war, was part of Purea’s retinue. He not only became a translator for the English, but also started to record Tahitian life and beliefs in bold, compelling drawings. When the Endeavour sailed on to New Zealand he went too, and portrayed their encounters with Maori people. Tupaia’s picture of Banks meeting a Maori, done in 1769, is one of the most eye-opening records of cultural encounter you could ever hope to see. For Tupaia, Banks and the Maori are foreign and fascinating. Banks in his blue coat is giving the New Zealander a piece of cloth in exchange for a big, red lobster. “I had a firm fist on the lobster,” remembered Banks. Tupaia also died on the Endeavour’s return to Britain. Given the death rate of the Endeavour’s artists, it’s amazing that an up-and-coming painter, William Hodges, risked it all to go Cook’s second voyage. Not only would he survive, but he proved an accomplished, ambitious artist. His panoramic sketches of war canoes massing off Tahiti and a Polynesian vessel at sea are great works of art that anticipate JMW Turner – but Turner never went to the Pacific. His pictures of the Resolution and the Adventure isolated in the vast black seas of the Antarctic circle, menaced by towering icebergs, are even more daunting. Suddenly, you see how far Cook sailed, how extreme the risks these 18th-century explorers took in their frail wooden ships. Hodges in Antarctica painted the most unearthly journey anyone had ever made. His icy sketches are as incredible as images sent back today by the furthest space probes. But they were made by a human being shivering on a sailing ship with no radio, no contact with home, in a sea with no mercy. “We were the first that ever burst / Into that silent sea,” as Coleridge was to write in 1798, as if dreaming of these images by Hodges. Did Romanticism start in Antarctica? This exhibition sets the remarkable artistic legacy of these voyages alongside a mass of documents from the original journals of Cook and Banks, the beautiful charts the captain made and to some of the first examples of Pacific art ever collected by Europeans. By the end you feel dwarfed by the immensity of the world they sailed and haunted by the faces of the peoples they encountered. The violence of imperialism was coming. Yet this was a moment when strangers looked at one another with open eyes.

Cosmic collision 12bn years ago created mega-galaxy","bodyText":"The colossal merger of 14 galaxies more than 12 billion years ago has been captured by astronomers who used the world’s most powerful telescopes to peer 90% of the way across the observable universe. The cosmic pileup occurred 12.4 bn years ago and the resultant gigantic galaxy will have continued to snowball in size ever since. Calculations suggest that by the present day, hundreds more galaxies would have been swallowed up by the cluster, propelling it to a mass equivalent to 1,000 trillion suns, which would make it the largest known object in the universe. The observations reveal at least 14 galaxies packed into an area only four times the diameter of the Milky Way’s galactic disk. An adjoining blob of light that has not yet been resolved into individual objects suggest that the total number of galaxies heading for a collision could be closer to 30. The light from the merger began travelling to us 1.4bn years after the big bang, when the universe was just a tenth of its current age. “Having caught a massive galaxy cluster in throes of formation is spectacular in and of itself,” said Scott Chapman, an astrophysicist at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada and co-author. “But, the fact that this is happening so early in the history of the universe poses a formidable challenge to our present-day understanding of the way structures form in the universe,” he said. During the first few million years of cosmic history, normal matter and dark matter began to clump together, eventually giving rise to galaxy clusters. In the present day, these clusters may contain as many as a thousand galaxies, vast swathes of dark matter, immense black holes, and clouds of gas that reach temperatures of over a million degrees. Current theories suggest that clusters as massive as the one observed, known as SPT2349-56, should have taken about twice as long to evolve, however. “How this assembly of galaxies got so big so fast is a bit of a mystery, it wasn’t built up gradually over billions of years, as astronomers might expect,” said Tim Miller, a PhD student at Yale University and coauthor on the paper. Computer simulations of the galaxies predict that over time the cluster will have assembled into one of the most massive structures – perhaps the most massive known object – in the modern universe. “It would exceed anything we’ve seen in the local universe,” said Carlos De Breuck, an astronomer at the European Space Observatory. The 14 galaxies seen heading towards each other are known as starburst galaxies due to the vigorous star formation. In such galaxies, thousands of stars are born every year, compared to just one in our own Milky Way. The galaxies would have blazed bright and then burnt out quickly because they consume their gas at an extraordinary rate. The galaxy cluster was first spotted as a faint smudge of light, using the South Pole telescope and the Herschel space observatory. Astronomers then used the Atacama large millimeter/submillimeter Array (Alma), a telescope comprising 66 antennas spread over 16km in the Chilean Andes, to make more detailed observations. The findings are published in Nature."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/may/11/a-cluster-of-children-asks-for-my-help-with-a-wounded-cat","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-11T13:00:44Z","webTitle":"A cluster of children ask for my help with a wounded cat | Coco Khan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/11/a-cluster-of-children-asks-for-my-help-with-a-wounded-cat","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/11/a-cluster-of-children-asks-for-my-help-with-a-wounded-cat","fields":{"headline":"A cluster of children ask for my help with a wounded cat","bodyText":"During the recent heatwave I did what any mature and refined modern woman would do: I took myself off to my local park to bask in the sun with a good book and take a hundred selfies in the hope one might look sexy enough for Instagram (it didn’t). I am lying on the grass with my phone camera above me – the book coincidentally in shot (how else am I meant to show refinement than by impressing people with my pretentious book?) – when some small faces appear. A cluster of children, probably about 10 years old, have gathered around. “Miss!” they say. “Please help us, this cat is hurt.” “Me?” I think, sitting up. “They can’t possibly mean me.” But they do. That’s the thing about small people: they assume that big people know what they’re doing, when big people are equally amazed and baffled by life – they just happen to have an overdraft. I look around for a more adult adult. There is no one, just me. Suddenly I’m being hurried by the children to a bush and cowering beneath the branches is a cat, shivering. Its paw is red and bloodied. I wonder if it can walk. “This is your moment, Coco,” my internal voice says. “This is where you graduate to grownup.” Telling the tykes to wait, I dart back to my house to find a box and a blanket, wondering if I’ll win a medal for bravery and if it would be appropriate to wear a cape to the ceremony. “Stand back, small humans!” I think to myself, practising my superhero voice. “I shall save you, furry one!” Back at the park, I approach the cat cautiously as it begins to hiss. Dropping to my knees, I begin the obligatory kissy sound that humans make at cats. “Sssshhhh,” I say. “It’s OK, love, I’m here to rescue you.” I hold my hand out slowly. The cat’s nose twitches as it familiarises itself with my scent. Slowly I get closer until I am softly touching its head when – bang! – fangs in the hand, teeth into flesh, it’s biting me. I howl in expletives. Now claws are scraping down my forearm and… is that blood? Before I know it the cat has bounded off. The children watch it race up a tree before their eyes return to me clutching my arm. One looks at me and – with what seems like genuine care and understanding – says, “Should I go and get a grownup?” “Well,” I reply. “I certainly don’t see one here.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"culture/2018/apr/25/trevor-noah-french-president-macron-belle-trump-beast","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-25T14:58:25Z","webTitle":"Trevor Noah calls Emmanuel Macron 'the Belle to Trump's Beast'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/apr/25/trevor-noah-french-president-macron-belle-trump-beast","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2018/apr/25/trevor-noah-french-president-macron-belle-trump-beast","fields":{"headline":"Trevor Noah calls Emmanuel Macron 'the Belle to Trump's Beast'","bodyText":"Late-night hosts on Tuesday discussed the visit of the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and his wife Brigitte to the White House, which included the pair attending Trump’s first state dinner. Trevor Noah Comedy Central’s Trevor Noah also focused on the Macrons’ visit to DC. “It’s President Trump’s first state dinner,” Noah said. “If you don’t know, a state dinner is basically a full, formal evening. The president hosts the event at the White House and it’s in honor of a visiting foreign leader.” Noah went on: “It’s no accident that the French president is getting the honor of being Trump’s first state dinner guest, because from the very beginning, while other leaders seemed to clash with Trump, Macron was the Belle to Trump’s Beast.” Noah then showed news coverage in which Macron is referred to as the “Trump whisperer”, having apparently convinced Trump to take action in Syria while frequently invoking their countries’ “special relationship”. “All this fun aside, Macron didn’t fly across the Atlantic just to hang out,” Noah explained. “He came to Washington on a very specific mission: to stop Trump from doing something dumb.” The mission, specifically, is being referred to as Operation Save the Iran Deal, as Macron is attempting to convince Trump not to pull out of the agreement reached in 2015 between Iran and world powers such as France, the United States, Germany, the United Kingdom, Russia and China. “This deal is the only reason that Iran is not advancing its nuclear program,” Noah added. “If America backs out, it’ll even further destabilize the Middle East. This is really sticky for Macron, because he has to try and save the Iran deal while also making it seem like Trump is getting what he wants.” But Macron, Noah said, “has the recipe for handling Trump,” since as a former investment banker “he’s an expert in dealing with egotistical rich people”. Stephen Colbert “I have broken out the French accent because tonight Donald Trump is hosting a menage-a-France with French president and home-wrecking masseur, Emmanuel Macron,” Stephen Colbert began. “It is Trump’s first state dinner and, in a major departure from tradition, Trump will not invite Democrats or the media. “Macron brought a gift for Trump, a young oak tree, and yesterday Trump and Macron planted it on the White House lawn together,” the host said, showing footage of the Trumps and Macrons shoveling dirt. “All that shoveling is great practice for when Trump has to hide Michael Cohen’s body.” Colbert went on to joke about the now-viral footage of first lady Melania Trump resisting her husband’s attempts to hold her hand. “She is not having it,” he said. “He’s like trying to arouse a dead trout. You can’t blame her, though. She watches 60 Minutes. She knows where that hand has been. “There is one relationship that Trump thinks is really strong,” the host continued, showing Trump and Macron in the Oval Office speaking to the press before the president abruptly stops to announce he is removing “that little piece of dandruff” from Macron’s shoulder. “Mr President: Macron is still standing next to you smiling after hanging out with you for two days,” Colbert quipped. “That’s not dandruff. That’s cocaine!” Jimmy Kimmel Finally, Jimmy Kimmel also weighed in on the upcoming state dinner and the state of relations between Macron and Trump. “This is the first official state visit since Donald Trump took office,” Kimmel said, “and the Trumps welcomed the Macrons to the White House today, where much affection was shared.” Kimmel showed footage of President Trump leaning in to kiss his wife Melania, who wore a large white hat that made it difficult to do so. “That’s her special Donald-proof sombrero,” Kimmel joked. “Trump very much needs a friend, because most of his old ones are going to prison,” the host continued. “And Macron is looking to improve his country’s standing in the world, and the United States can help with this. So these two meet each other, and Donald Trump really cannot keep his hands off this guy.” The host went on to show more footage from the event, in which Trump and Macron shared several extended handshakes and more than once exchanged friendly kisses on the cheek. “Macron is like, ‘Melania, can I borrow your hat for a minute?’” Kimmel added. “He gave him the full Stormy Daniels there.” The host eventually covered the awkward moment when Trump appeared to remove dandruff from Macron’s suit. “That’s really what orangutans do, they groom each other,” Kimmel said, noting that “a little touch of dandruff-shaming didn’t put their love-fest to an end”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"global-development/2018/may/01/myanmar-army-escalating-conflict-kachin-un-united-nations","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-01T12:27:49Z","webTitle":"Myanmar army killing civilians in escalating conflict in Kachin, warns UN","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/may/01/myanmar-army-escalating-conflict-kachin-un-united-nations","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2018/may/01/myanmar-army-escalating-conflict-kachin-un-united-nations","fields":{"headline":"Myanmar army killing civilians in escalating conflict in Kachin, warns UN","bodyText":"The UN’s human rights expert for Myanmar has raised alarm over a lethal escalation in hostilities in the country’s Kachin state, warning that civilians had been killed and displaced in recent government bombing. Amid reports that the military in Myanmar had blocked relief supplies to people displaced by the fighting, Yanghee Lee, the UN’s special rapporteur on human rights in the country, cited accounts of the army using aerial bombings, heavy weapons and artillery fire in civilian areas near the border with China. “Innocent civilians are being killed and injured, and hundreds of families are now fleeing for their lives,” said Lee, commenting on the displacement of about 5,000 people in recent weeks of conflict, in which civilians have numbered among fatalities. According to the UN, children, pregnant women, the elderly and people with disabilities are among those displaced. “What we are seeing in Kachin state over the past few weeks is wholly unacceptable, and must stop immediately,” Lee said. “Civilians must never be subjected to violence during the course of conflict. All parties must take all necessary measures to ensure their safety and security,” she added. Lee’s comments followed an earlier warning by the official in March to the Human Rights Council in Geneva that while the world’s attention had been on Rakhine state, scant attention had been given to escalating violence in Kachin, Shan and other conflict-affected areas in Myanmar. “Any wilful impediment of relief supplies may amount to war crimes under international law,” Lee said, adding that she had received reports that a food convoy organised by the Myanmar Red Cross had been prevented from entering the village of Man Wai late last month. More than 100 civilians have been trapped in the village for three weeks with very limited access to food, medicine and other items needed for survival. While international attention has been focused on violence that has forced almost 700,000 Rohingya out of Rakhine state into neighbouring Bangladesh since last August, observers have been warning of the risk of mounting ethnic strife across Myanmar’s states, not least in northern Shan and Kachin, which both border China. The recent displacement does not include the nearly 100,000 people living in camps in both northern Shan and Kachin since a government ceasefire broke down in 2011. Also raising the alarm has been the International Rescue Committee, whose regional director, Sanna Johnson, said: “The latest wave of violence in the world’s longest running civil war shows no signs of abating. “We are increasingly concerned for civilians trapped by the fighting in Kachin state, who have already had to endure so much. Our teams are hearing reports that some have been sheltering in forests since being forced to flee … unable to escape ongoing fighting.” According to Unicef, logistical and security concerns mean only a third of the target population in Kachin have access to basic healthcare. Local news reports have described clashes continuing in four areas around the towns of Tanai, Phakant, Myitkyina and Injangyang. Myanmar must hold a “proper investigation” into alleged atrocities against the Rohingya in Rakhine, a UN security council envoy said on Tuesday, after a visit by UN delegates to the country."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/may/01/badger-cull-policing-cost-800000-in-one-county-cheshire","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-01T13:32:16Z","webTitle":"Badger cull policing cost £800,000 in one county","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/01/badger-cull-policing-cost-800000-in-one-county-cheshire","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/may/01/badger-cull-policing-cost-800000-in-one-county-cheshire","fields":{"headline":"Badger cull policing cost £800,000 in one county","bodyText":"The cost of policing the controversial badger cull in just one of the 21 zones last autumn approached the £1m mark – the equivalent of more than £1,000 for every animal killed there. Objectors to the cull described the bill for Cheshire as a horrendous waste of public money and called for the policy to be scrapped on economic as well as animal cruelty grounds. The zone in Cheshire was one of 11 new areas where the cull, which is designed to help eradicate bovine TB in cattle, took place in the autumn of 2017. In January, a member of the organisation Wounded Badger Patrol asked Cheshire police under freedom of information legislation how much the operation for policing the cull – codenamed Operation Aviator – cost. At first the force said it did not hold the information but a member of the patrol, appealed, writing: “Having been out in the cull zone five nights a week and the police liaison for one of the groups, I know how many police officers were taken off normal duties ... as well as seeing the number of police in cars/riot vans out each night of the cull period.” Last month the force apologised for not providing the information and revealed it had charged the Home Office £831,000 for the badger cull operation. According to government figures, 736 badgers were killed in the Cheshire zone in 2017 over 48 days. In all, there were 21 cull zones in England in 2017 involving seven police force areas. A spokesperson for Wounded Badger Patrol said: “While the figure is staggeringly large, we’re not surprised. Out on Wounded Badger Patrol every night, we could see just how much police time and resources were going into policing the cull, and what a waste of taxpayers’ money it was. “During a time of economic austerity it’s shocking that not far short of a million pounds of taxpayers’ money can be found to police the government’s badger cull in Cheshire.” Jay Tiernan, of the Stop the Cull group, said: “We think everyone should be asking how is this policy delivering its forecast of saving money.” Stop the Cull will be asking its supporters to contact the National Audit Office and request an investigation. Dominic Dyer, CEO of the Badger Trust, called the bill in Cheshire “horrendous”, adding: “The badger cull is becoming the most expensive wildlife destruction policy in British history. “To date we estimate that the government has spent over £50m of public funds killing just over 35,000 badgers. If the badger cull is massively expanded as [the environment secretary] Michael Gove plans, we could see public costs spiral to over £100m by 2020.” A government spokesperson said the average cost of policing each zone had declined significantly year on year and it expected the same to happen in Cheshire. The spokesperson said: “Bovine TB is the greatest animal health threat to the UK and costs taxpayers more than £100m each year.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/may/06/chloe-sevigny-tv-roles-metoo-trump-lean-on-pete","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-06T07:00:17Z","webTitle":"Chloë Sevigny: ‘I didn’t want to name names.

I think they’re commonly known as assholes anyway’","bodyText":"Chloë Sevigny walks into the bar of a hotel in downtown New York like a discreet but still conquering hero: leather jacket, red lipstick, round John Lennon-style sunglasses and a laugh that draws the eyes of the room. She recently moved back to Manhattan from a far-flung neighbourhood of Brooklyn, where she had gone in search of a quieter life. For decades, the actor enjoyed the buzz of being a well-known figure, until suddenly, in her early 40s, she didn’t. “But it didn’t work out,” she says, drily. Brooklyn was too quiet, too far; not Sevigny’s style at all and now she is back – greeting people she knows every few paces – a somewhat reluctant queen of the scene. It is more than 20 years since Sevigny was anointed “the coolest girl in the world” by Jay McInerney in his New Yorker profile, a piece that now reads like the slightly doddery engagement of a middle-aged man with youth culture, and for whose purposes any modish 19-year-old woman may have served. Sevigny has never been “cool” in the traditional sense, being neither detached nor aloof. Her style these days errs on the side of men’s braces/baggy shirts, landing somewhere between A Clockwork Orange and Amish country. She is also forthright, intelligent, chatty, unguarded – she got into trouble recently for bad mouthing one of her own screen projects – and, above all, opinionated: over the course of our interview, Sevigny will get stuck into Trump, movie stars who hog all the best TV roles, and why she turned down an offer to chip into #MeToo. “I hope they’re not going to read this,” she says, of her family. Oh, and conscientious. Sevigny decides which roles to accept largely based on whether she approves of the people offering them. In the case of Andrew Haigh, the British director best known for the HBO series Looking, who has just directed Sevigny in the movie Lean on Pete, it was a no-brainer. “I wanted to be part of the calibre of movie Andrew puts out,” she says. “Knowing how he likes to sit with characters and that he has a sensitivity and a beauty to his films.” Although, she adds, smiling, “even with the greatest director in the world you never know – it’s always a risk.” Lean on Pete, which is based on the novel of the same name by Willy Vlautin, tells the story of Charley, a 15-year-old boy who falls through the cracks after his father’s death, takes up with a bunch of small-stakes horse racers and flees across the country after stealing a horse. Sevigny plays Bonnie, one of the jockeys – a tough, weather-beaten figure full of hidden damage and pragmatic charm. It’s reminiscent of her role in Boys Don’t Cry, the 1999 movie for which Sevigny was nominated for a best supporting actress Oscar: measured, deep, finely balanced between knowing and subtly evasive. The film was shot in Oregon and, says Sevigny, she has to think harder these days about committing to months of filming away. “I was doing a show on Netflix in southern Florida called Blood Line – that commute wasn’t as bad; same time zone. But as my mother is getting older and my brother has just had another child, so I have two nephews, and my life and my friends are here, it is harder. If it’s an isolated thing it’s easier to accept, but signing on to a series for five or six seasons somewhere far from home, I think I would be more reticent.” Sevigny lives alone in New York and her family are an hour away in the Connecticut town where she grew up. One of the advantages of getting older, she says, is understanding that the best way to ensure good work for herself is to take on a greater role in curating it. She is starting to direct short films: the first, Kitty, from 2016, based on a short story about a girl who turns into a cat, and more recently Carmen, about a fortysomething standup comedian. “Creating opportunities helps ease anxiety and focus yourself on keeping busy with other things – to get some control, to be a pure expression of your own.” With Lean on Pete, I was shocked to discover Sevigny had first been considered for the role of Charley’s aunt, who is in the film for about three minutes, and only won the larger role after lobbying hard. It says something regrettable about the film business that Sevigny isn’t currently a bigger star, although she is at pains to point out she is doing fine: she has a movie about Lizzy Borden coming up later in the year, in which she co-stars with Kristen Stewart, and more projects lined up beyond that. “I’m not allowed to talk about my finances,” she says, smiling ruefully, “because I am very privileged.” Still, while the boom in TV promised to be a gold rush for good actors, it hasn’t really turned out that way. Sevigny is a veteran of the small screen after appearing in five seasons of the HBO show Big Love, since when the TV landscape has become much more crowded. “It feels like there’s been a big industry shift, especially in the film industry, so that now all the big movie stars are doing TV.” Reese Witherspoon? “Yeah.” She rolls her eyes. “It’s now more competitive than ever. Like Amy Adams is doing an HBO series; the big movie stars who would normally just stick to the big movies are now in TV. There is something to be said for doing a long-term thing that is interesting to explore a character. And I guess if you’re a movie star of that calibre, you’re used to being on sets for six months at a time. They’re not doing indies, which are 30 days and you’re out.” The downside to committing to a multi-season TV show can be expressed with a single word, says Sevigny, one that strikes fear into the heart of most actors: “unavailable”. She says: “If you’re out of the film hustle, then you’re ‘unavailable’ and you might miss an opportunity there. Actors hate being unavailable. Being in a play is really hard because then you’re unavailable. It’s terrifying being unavailable, unless you’re on a great project.” Doesn’t she find that getting older takes some of this anxiety away? “I feel more relaxed,” she says. “I feel confident in the fact that I’ll always be working, whether it’s getting the parts I necessarily want or,” she laughs apologetically, “feel that I deserve, although deserve is a strange word to use. I know something will come along and I’m also pursuing directing. I’m shooting another short film. I’m going to Cannes to be on the jury during critics’ week.” In honour of which, she orders the fruit and yogurt: “Trying to keep it trim, girl. I have to fit into some sample-size dresses” she says, and delivers one of the hooting laughs that, however much she jokes about slimming down for Cannes, give a sense of Sevigny as someone who won’t diminish herself to meet industry demands. How is she finding her 40s? Sevigny stops laughing. “I don’t mind it. Some of the physical changes are a little frustrating.” Like what? Sevigny lifts a hand vaguely to her neck. “I feel like… texture. Like, certain areas. It’s the décolletage. Those sorts of things are disconcerting. We need more women like Frances McDormand, and Tilda Swinton. Just the way they present themselves and don’t bend. Frances with no make-up and hair just loose; why can’t more women do that? I love seeing Helen Mirren, too; I think Helen is such a natural beauty. And she still does the classical dress up, but she has her own hair and her face looks natural. Seeing her next to Jane Fonda at the Oscars and Jane had like… not natural hair.” She laughs. “But Jane can do whatever she wants. Jane is the ultimate. All women should do whatever they want, obviously.” Last year, Ronan Farrow, who broke some of the Harvey Weinstein sexual assault allegations in the New Yorker, approached Sevigny and asked if she’d be interviewed by him about her experiences of Hollywood. She turned him down. “I didn’t really have anything to say to him,” she says. “I’ve had experiences that are kind of common, verbal experiences, or innuendos. But I didn’t feel they offended me to such a degree that I wanted to name the names. I think they’re commonly known as assholes anyway. Do you know what I mean? I felt it would draw attention to myself, in a way. Which I know is the wrong thing to say, because we have to be vocal for people who don’t have a voice… ” She trails off, then starts up again. “For someone to say ‘What are you doing after?’ during a casting session is not so unheard of. Yeah, it shouldn’t be done and lots of girls might feel vulnerable and not know what to do in that situation. For me it was like: really?” She laughs. “I do feel like what Harvey Weinstein did compared to Al Franken [the former senator of Minnesota] – there has to be some delineation. Instead they’re all grouped together.” Was she just naturally buoyant enough to push back against casual propositions? “I think maybe growing up around some men in my life who were a little chauvinistic [helped]; I don’t know. I can’t even remember now who said it to me, but a female casting director said, in a room full of people: ‘You have to make the men want to fuck you and the women want to be you.’” Ew. “Yeah. I almost wish I could remember who she was. Not that I want to call her out, but I feel like that was almost more damaging in a way. To think to myself, that’s really what I have to be? And then trying to figure out how to be that. This was from a casting person who was like, this is how you’re going to get the jobs and then that permeating through how I thought about myself, and the commodity I was. That was more damaging than the guy asking me what are you doing after or saying you should take your clothes off more. Shocker.” It makes sense that Sevigny, while sensitive to all the nuances surrounding #MeToo, held back when approached by Farrow; to be in a room with her is to be reminded that Sevigny, while friendly and charming, is a non-conformist who makes up her own mind, thinking long and hard before she answers some questions and doubling back to qualify them once she has. She is politically at odds with her family, a situation she finds depressing, but is well used to by now. Sevigny grew up in Darien, Connecticut, the US equivalent of the conservative Home Counties, but after moving to New York at 19 and falling in with a fashionable art crowd, rapidly moved away from the opinions she’d grown up around. Her family watch Fox News, she says, “which I try to zone out whenever I go home. It’s a losing battle. They’re at an age when – now it’s just the sad undercurrent of tension, and me having to block it out or ignore.” Are they the kind of Republicans with whom she can at least unite against Trump? “Unfortunately not. I think they have fallen prey to his anti-establishment rhetoric and they feel radicalised in a way. I don’t know where all their Catholic values went.” Sevigny shrugs. “There’s something about him they find comfort in, because they were so anti-PC; so I think they’re like, ‘Oh, finally, someone’s being honest.’” Sevigny sometimes wishes she could be more effective politically; she’s a big fan of Susan Sarandon and she admires Rosario Dawson, “who I know from the Kids days [Larry Clark’s 1995 film] and who’s very vocal. You see her in an interview and she’s throwing out numbers and references to this bill and that bill. If I had that artillery, I feel like I’d be more empowered. But I don’t know if my brain works that way.” If her strengths lie elsewhere, they are perhaps rarer and more valuable for that. After the interview, Sevigny is running uptown to meet with the director of photography who worked on Beyoncé’s Lemonade, who she hopes to persuade to work on a new short film she is writing. What’s it about, I ask and she smiles. “A woman and the relationship to her power.” Lean on Pete is out now. Lizzie is released later in the year"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/01/bfi-aspergers-disabled-people-hostile-environment-cinema","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-01T11:53:16Z","webTitle":"The BFI Asperger’s incident shows disabled people face a ‘hostile environment’| Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/01/bfi-aspergers-disabled-people-hostile-environment-cinema","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/may/01/bfi-aspergers-disabled-people-hostile-environment-cinema","fields":{"headline":"The BFI Asperger’s incident shows disabled people face a ‘hostile environment’","bodyText":"A couple of years ago my brother, who has autism, was confronted by an angry audience member at the theatre. Or rather, his care worker was. “You shouldn’t let him out if he can’t behave,” the man said. My brother’s carers insisted he had as much right to be there as the aggressive man did, and it was the latter who eventually left, to a round of applause from the rest of the audience. When my brother’s carer told me the anecdote, it made me smile. People are kind, I thought. Unfortunately, things don’t always happen this way for people with autism-spectrum disorders (ASD). On Sunday night, for instance, Tamsin Parker was thrown out of the British Film Institute (BFI) cinema in London for laughing “too loudly” during The Good, the Bad and the Ugly while she protested “I have Asperger’s.” Other audience members had called the 25-year-old a “bitch” and “retarded”. Witnesses described themselves as “shaking with anger” and feeling “sick to my stomach” at the scene. It was Tamsin’s birthday, and she loves the film, which she has seen eight times. “A couple of audience members were yelling, ‘Shut up, bitch!’ and ‘It’s not that funny!’” said Tamsin, an artist and animator. “The thing is, it was funny. It was Eli Wallach playing with parts of guns, clearly improvising. Wallach hated guns, and he had no use for them, so it seemed like he had no idea what he was doing … I was distraught that I wasn’t able to watch the film the whole way through. This was a film that was very personal to me, because I first saw the film during a rough time in my life and it made me feel better about myself.” The BFI has since apologised to Tamsin, and has offered her a private screening. The manager on duty, one witness told me, was “visibly upset” and said that had she known Tamsin had Asperger’s, she would never have let that happen. This sad incident should be an opportunity to learn, not hound someone out of their job. Clearly, much better training is needed here for staff. But Tamsin’s mother, Lydia, is rightly furious that she was humiliated in this way. “Even if she were not autistic, no one should be treated as she was. All audience members deserve respect,” she told me. Autism inclusivity in cinema and theatres has come on in leaps and bounds since my brother, who is also 25, and Tamsin, were small. Relaxed performances are now widespread, not only at the Globe and the National Theatre but in cinemas and theatres up and down the country, and are great for those who get sensory overload and as a result need sound and vision to just be a little bit less intrusive. But people with ASD should not feel limited to these, segregated from the rest of society. They have as much right to attend an ordinary performance as anybody else. I admit that I have felt on edge taking my brother to the cinema before. You steel yourself for people’s reactions. When we took him to see Shaun the Sheep, he announced loudly: “SHEEP, BAAAAAAA!” whenever Shaun came on screen. People were lovely, but it was mostly children and parents in the audience. Would you be so tolerant? It was the attitude of the audience members who abused Tamsin that really shocked me. The lack of humanity and compassion: the anger, where there is really so little to be angry about. Much has been made of the “hostile environment” Theresa May has tried to create for immigrants, but one wonders whether it exists for disabled people too. This is not a case of me being dramatic: the UK was last year criticised by the UN for failing to uphold disabled people’s rights. It pointed to the high levels of poverty for disabled people and their families as a result of benefit cuts. An earlier report by the same committee condemned “systemic violations” of people with disabilities. People who are ill and disabled are being sent to work, and some of them are dying. To what extent have some of these policies, and the media coverage around them, seeped into the national psyche? Reported hate crimes against disabled people are rising even faster where children are the victims, a BBC investigation found late last year, with children and their families verbally abused in the street. These acts do not occur in a vacuum. There is so much innovation occurring in film and theatre when it comes to disability. Madhouse re:exit, a performance by five artists with learning disabilities from the Access All Areas theatre company, recently took spectators at Shoreditch Town Hall on a fantastical tour through the history of the institutionalisation of disabled people. It’s currently in Manchester. Our Country’s Good, at Theatre Royal Stratford East, has a mixed cast of 17 disabled and able-bodied actors telling the story of their journey to a penal colony in Australia. Productions such as these do crucial work in shifting attitudes. But it is our government’s policies, not to mention our media coverage, in which we truly need a shift, or disabled people will continue to be abused for having the audacity to exist in public; or, as in Tamsin’s case, for simply wanting to watch her favourite film, with her friends, on her birthday. • Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"film/2018/may/05/sean-penn-some-of-my-best-laughs-have-come-out-of-the-worst-reviews","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-05T08:00:46Z","webTitle":"Sean Penn: ‘Some of my best laughs have come out of the worst reviews’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/may/05/sean-penn-some-of-my-best-laughs-have-come-out-of-the-worst-reviews","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/may/05/sean-penn-some-of-my-best-laughs-have-come-out-of-the-worst-reviews","fields":{"headline":"Sean Penn: ‘Some of my best laughs have come out of the worst reviews’","bodyText":"Sean Penn walks into a low-key restaurant not far from his house and slides undetected into a seat at the back. It is a misty day in Malibu, 15 miles north of LA, and the actor appears in familiar, I-don’t-care guise: beat-up leather jacket, brushfire hair (which, in light of the views he will air about female vanity in Hollywood, I feel bound to report may be more vibrant than nature intended), with the jittery energy of a man who has stood for too long next to very loud speakers. The 57-year-old greets me affably, to my surprise: while Penn may be long admired for his acting, he is denigrated for almost everything else. He is known to be pugnacious, short-tempered, long-winded, a man who yells at photographers and smokes on TV. And now he has written a lunatic novel. “It’s the most fun I’ve had professionally,” he croaks and leans back in his chair. A few days before our meeting, Bob Honey Who Just Do Stuff was the subject of a full-page newspaper ad in which the publishers, rather cleverly, ran lines from the book’s worst reviews and asked readers to make up their own minds. The novel, which follows the adventures of its eponymous hero as he goes around selling septic tanks and murdering old people, is a satire of American consumer culture and the cult of image, and for weeks its excesses have been gleefully documented. Penn writes as if every word has been put through a thesaurus: for “face”, read “dermal mask”; for “quiet”, “lingering symphony of silence”; a man with good hearing has “extraordinary auditory augmentation efficiency”. So it goes on, until we reach: “Effervescence lived in her every cellular expression, and she had spizzerinctum to spare.” Cherrypicking these extravagances has provided us with a jolly good laugh, but here’s the odd thing: taken as a whole, there is something quite thrilling about Bob Honey, a hallucinatory effect that makes the novel at times almost feel like a piece of performance art. Linger long enough in the world of Penn’s prose and one starts to lose all purchase on reality, a sort of brain slide that Penn insists was intentional. “It was meant to be challenging,” he says. “Meant to have you stop-the-rhythm to go and look something up.” If he talks in a word fog, it is because he prefers “to be understood by osmosis. If I’m being brief, I assume [people] will fill in, or if I am not being brief” – the far greater likelihood, on the evidence of our chat – “the tangents would be connected by the other person.” He hoped the book might work along similar lines. The result, while largely insane, does provoke an emotional response in the reader and for that reason alone might be judged a success. “I wrote the Sean-by-osmosis version in about 30 days,” Penn says, after which “I rewrote for two years”, before selling it to Simon &amp; Schuster, where “I got lucky; Peter [Borland] totally got the book. I felt I was being supported by a really smart reader.” Was he edited? “He wasn’t looking to change anything,” Penn says cheerfully. “But he did send me great notes which said, ‘I don’t understand this. Do you want me to?’” (In most cases Penn replied “yes”; in some, “not so much”.) The suggestion he was indulged because of his celebrity is one he finds baffling. “No, because I wouldn’t have done it any other way. When people listen to the advice they get, it usually robs the soul of the piece. In the movies, they’re not thinking about whether it has impact on them; they’re thinking about whether it will impact the box office.” This rather quaint view of publishing – as an industry devoid of commercial principles and certainly not the kind of business that might judge a book by a famous actor to have greater value as a car crash than as something more credible – is the main source of Penn’s enthusiasm for novel writing, which he sees as a less mediated form of expression than acting. But why would he trade in something he is indisputably world class at – Penn has won two Oscars, for Milk and Mystic River – for something he is indisputably not? The answer is burnout, what he calls “my great source of alienation from my peers, actors who would rather sell a movie than make one”. Where these actors are “brands”, and where even a movie he loves “is the sum of compromises at its best”, Bob Honey, by contrast, is “all mine. It’s been said you never complete a film, you abandon it, and I didn’t abandon this. I stand by every line exactly how I wrote it.” Has he seen the worst reviews? “I have a sense of them. It’s keep-your-day-job shit. A bunch of children, schadenfreude, whatever. And in the end, some of the best laughs I’ve got have been the one-liners that have come out of the worst reviews.” Through long espousal of leftwing politics, including vocal protests against the Iraq war and support of Hugo Chávez and Raúl Castro, Penn is used to being unpopular. Does it hurt to be mocked? “Well, mocked means the person’s an idiot.” Penn smiles crookedly and shutters his lids. “I’m not vulnerable at all.” There are two images of Sean Penn that rival the memory of his greatest screen roles. Up there with Carlito’s Way, or Dead Man Walking, or his role as Harvey Milk – the 2008 biopic of California’s first gay elected official and a performance for which one could almost forgive Penn any amount of bad behaviour off-screen – there is the shot of him in a boat rescuing survivors of Hurricane Katrina, and the one of his handshake with Mexican drug lord El Chapo. The latter, taken two years ago when Penn interviewed El Chapo for Rolling Stone, brought down on his head almost as much opprobrium as Bob Honey, for its perceived amateurism and for the way it seemed to apologise for a man with so much blood on his hands. Penn remains unrepentant. “Just because someone writes about stuff doesn’t mean they know about it. I know fathers who don’t know their own families. Most of these journalists on this subject know fucking nothing and most never read my piece. They read the excerpts. Then you get a talking head like a Don Winslow [on CNN], I’ve read his books cover to cover and he’s a functioning moron, and people think he’s something. That’s their resident expert. It’s like Henry Kissinger is their resident expert.” The gung-ho activism is more complicated and, on closer inspection, much more admirable than the caricature suggests. If there is precedent for Penn wading into a job about which he knows nothing and nailing it through sheer bloody-mindedness, it is here, in his experiences with aid. In 2010, Penn went to Haiti in the wake of the devastating earthquake and set up the J/P Haitian Relief Organization, an agency that has, by all accounts, been enormously successful and helped thousands of Haitians find shelter and medical relief. In a piece in the New York Times in 2011, by which time Penn had been in Haiti for almost a year, veteran aid workers lined up to praise him. The question of what he was doing in Haiti in the first place has roots in his inability to find equilibrium at home. The most persuasive passages in Bob Honey are those in which Penn writes of his character’s insomnia. When I ask if this comes from experience, he takes a big breath. “So this goes back as far as I, or my mother, can remember. I was born at 3.45am and I generally fall asleep at 3.45am. I’ve been to Zen centres, done sleep studies, everything. I could never get myself to go to sleep. I’d get up, sometimes, with no sleep at all. And I was getting older, so I wasn’t able to push through this thing mentally.” Eventually a doctor prescribed Ambien: “But it doesn’t work like it used to. It doesn’t keep me asleep, but I get to sleep and at least get three hours. Then you’re watching the clock for the time you have to get up, and it’s getting closer and closer.” Some of Penn’s wilder behaviour makes more sense, perhaps, when looked at in the context of a man who has never had more than three unbroken hours’ sleep. “Yuh. Judgment issues,” he says, raising his eyebrows in what is almost certainly a reference to the time, in 2009, when a court made him attend anger management classes after an altercation with a photographer. It probably didn’t improve your temper, I suggest. “No. Nor the thoughts that lead to a temperamental response.” One result of this is that Penn often feels himself to operate best in crisis mode. He quotes a line from Cutter’s Way, a movie from 1981 starring Jeff Bridges and John Heard in which a woman kills herself to get away from her alcoholic husband, and the final line of which is: “You know, the routine grind drives me to drink. Tragedy, I take straight.” “There’s been a lot of that in my life,” Penn says and he relates it, obliquely, to how he is able to function effectively in a destabilised environment such as Haiti after the earthquake. “I think tragedy can also be urgency. I find myself going calm, and being demanding. I can bring an American arrogance to anywhere in the world.” He smiles. “Look, in the movie business you tell your crew: ‘I need this set done yesterday.’ When I got to Haiti and I saw how NGOs worked, it would be like: ‘This patient needs this, now, and this is the person to get in touch with.’ Then I had six other people asking me six other things. When I circled back half an hour later to the first one and said, ‘Did you get it?’ they said, ‘We’re waiting for a response, we sent an email.’ I said, ‘You sent an email? Give me your phone, I’m going to call.’ And it drove me fucking mad.” Pretty quickly, Penn’s outfit became known as an agency that got things done quicker than the NGOs and he calls it “the easiest kind of work to do in an emergency, because it’s emergency related”. It was triage. He nods. “It’s the easiest, commonsense work. There’s a kid in the street, a truck’s going to hit it, do you know that the sidewalk is clear of paedophiles? No. I’ll make my apologies later.” It is fascinating that the self-important urgency of a Hollywood movie set can be translated to a disaster zone, but think about it, Penn says: “It’s the same business, the stakes are higher.” There’s even overlap with the sanitation logistics of shooting a movie. “You’ve gotta get porta potties for people.” Was he surprised when allegations were made last year that aid workers, including Roland Van Hauwermeiren, the head of Oxfam in Haiti, used sex workers? “I don’t know why it wasn’t a bigger scandal earlier. I was reading about it in the Haitian press when I was in Haiti in the beginning. Roland Van Hauwermeiren was probably the best country director of an organisation there. Of course, you’re not the best anything if you’re looking the other way on that stuff. Or, worse yet, if you’re participating.” In his own organisation, Penn had a policy of “no tolerance” right down to the rule that “if you smoke one joint, you’re fired”. In fact he ended up relaxing the drugs rule for his indigenous workers, because “how am I controlling that when my local workers went back to their homes at night? I stopped being an idiot with that.” For the imports, mostly Americans or Brits, however, “You don’t come to this country to break its laws.” And when someone in his organisation did break a rule? Well, Penn says, “There’s no organisation, including my own, where you don’t have something happen. And you deal with it; you certainly want to take it transparent.” The cover-up, he says, is the biggest problem. “I’ve known of situations where big organisations discovered something and did an investigation, and fired somebody – and because they didn’t want a lawsuit from that person, another organisation would hire them; it’s like passing on priests. In our organisation, I’d get on the phone to whoever the violator was and say, ‘If I hear you are ever trying to get a job in one of these organisations, I’m coming to your home town, and I’m going to rent out the movie theatre and show a documentary about you and make sure your parents are there.’” Why does he think an aid worker, who presumably starts out with good intentions, gets to the point of exploiting desperate women this way? “I can have theories,” Penn says, “but they’re the same theories one would apply to someone who abuses their children. How do you do that?” In light of these life-or-death stakes, Penn is unsympathetic to what he seems to regard as more trivial abuses closer to home, particularly those involving celebrity exposure. A week before we meet, he appeared in the gossip columns for dining with Charlie Rose, the disgraced former TV host fired from PBS and CBS for inappropriate behaviour around female staff. Penn is not, it is safe to say, on board with #MeToo, which he describes as “not intellectually honest”, “a movement led by mania” and full of “self-aggrandisement and venting”. At the end of Bob Honey, he writes a poem defending Charlie Rose and appearing to lament the demise of Louis CK. Clearly, I say, Penn thinks his friend was mistreated. “He says one thing happened; other people said another thing happened. I wasn’t there. What I do think is we maybe should be very careful; for example, are we now going to say we will never celebrate Thomas Jefferson again: slave holder, that’s all you are? Charlie Rose provided one of the only sophisticated dialogue programmes, and I don’t know what the percentages are, but I know that there are some lies that have been told publicly about people; I know of some serious omissions. I’m talking about women towards men.” This is a personal issue for Penn, who in 2016 won a court-appointed apology from the director Lee Daniels, who erroneously implied the actor was guilty of domestic violence. Romantic relationships don’t seem to be Penn’s strong point. The worst bits of Bob Honey are those involving the character’s ex-wife, a harridan called Helen, about whom he is so vicious, I had wondered whether Penn’s own ex-wife might have commented on it. Penn gives me a dry look. “Which ex-wife?” he says. Oh. I had momentarily forgotten about Madonna, to whom Penn was married from 1985 to 1989. “The mother of your kids,” I say. (Penn and Robin Wright, who were married for 14 years, have Dylan and Hopper, both in their 20s.) “No; these characters are amalgamations of a lot of things and she’s not a character in the book.” Penn pauses. “I don’t think the book would be either one of my ex-wives’ cup of tea. They both thought that I talked too much in ways that were too complicated.” He laughs. “I don’t have a lot of conversations with my most recent ex, but my first ex, we have a close friendship.” What does he think Madonna would say about the book? “I think if she was reading it, she’d say, ugh, I’ll read this some other time.” Anyway, Penn says, returning to the subject of #MeToo, “I don’t ever want to be in a movement. I don’t trust any movement. The anti-war movement did not sustain. We’re back in wars.” But going back to his friend Charlie, surely the lesson of this is: don’t wander around naked in front of your staff if you don’t want to get sacked. “I don’t disagree with that,” Penn says. “I go back to my original thing, which is that if that’s what the individual that happened to is asking for, then they have a legal case to go through, or the company has a decision to make. But when the company is making that decision under the pressure of… a movement that is led by mania, I get worried for both [sides].” There is a libertarian streak in Penn that is impossible to miss. I repeat a wince-making line from Bob Honey, which Penn almost certainly considers to be a liberal statement: “Getting older in America is tough on a woman; seeing what she’ll do to avoid it is tough on a man.” I assume Penn approved of Frances McDormand’s unadorned style at the Oscars this year? He takes a big breath: “When my kids were growing up, there was a thing called the surgery channel and I would watch this thing and get into hysterical laughter. One slice and you’re a human body! We’re the fucking same! But where I really became a giggling 12-year-old girl was volunteering for cosmetic surgery: you have someone who’s anaesthetised, and they’re doing the most vile things to them, and I would get so hysterical. You bring up Frances McDormand. What do you do to be more beautiful than that? That fucking woman walks into a room and you don’t know if you want to kiss her, eat her farts or bite her toes off, you just want to be around that energy.” As opposed, he says, to “the vanity that errs on the side of violence against oneself, physical violence. It’s crazy.” But there are market forces at play. You’re still viable as a leading man at 57; a woman is not. “But isn’t it changing? There’s Meryl out there. Also, in terms of the social/sexual part of it, I think more and more – I mean my ex-wife just married a 30-year-old guy she met two months earlier. [Wright is reported to have married a French fashion PR manager earlier this year.] You see that dynamic shifting. When I would try to console a woman in the business who maybe wasn’t getting the opportunities I was because they were a woman, I’d say, well, which parts are you not getting? Because, man or woman, most parts are shit. Most movies are shit. If you look at the really talented women – Julianne Moore never has trouble getting a job. The opportunities are there.” Does he understand why his countrymen voted for Trump? “I have a pretty good idea. We became celebritised,” he says. “I don’t buy People magazine. But when people complain that someone took a picture of them or that their privacy is being invaded, I’m like, yeah? Fuck you. I just spent my entire adult life with you telling me that because I want to express myself as an actor, that that comes with the territory. Well, it comes with the territory for you, now, and you bought those fucking People magazines. You made that happen.” He is jabbing his finger at me across the table. “When I go like this, I’m not at my best,” he says. “So two sides that are not at their best, it gets very shallow.” Penn has a disdain for the idea of the personal brand. “Branding is being! Branding is being! The algorithm of modern binary existentialism,” he writes in Bob Honey, a line I read out to him now. “Yeah,” says Penn, lowering his eyes and looking sage. What does “the algorithm of modern binary existentialism” mean? He snaps his eyes open. “Well. Binary – two components. When you’re taking an algorithm that’s going to identify the two components, and, there are, I think I talk about in the book also… it’s America today.” There follows a long story about how easy it is to buy components for a bomb in the US. “I’ve just gone off on the word binary. But I think it’s self-explanatory, in there. Huh.” Anyway, he says, the reason people voted for Trump is “because I think there’s a mental health problem in this country. It’s rage over reason. There’s a lot going on that was going on in Nazi Germany; we’re finding scapegoats, groups to hate, whether it be of a race, or so-called lefty Hollywood, so that’s part of why I want to write something – I only have my sense of humour to offer. I didn’t want to just be angry all the time.” And he isn’t. There is an underlying humour to Penn’s rants that is often lost in translation and while I find much of what he says preposterous, arrogant and occasionally delusional, to my surprise, I also find him likable and funny – a genuine American eccentric. As we get up to leave, I can’t help laughing. “Sorry. I keep thinking about the fact that Madonna thought you were boring.” “I love her,” Penn says, and laughs. Is she a good egg? “Such a good egg.” We go outside to his pick-up truck and he introduces me to Flyboy, his six-month-old golden retriever. After Penn has gone, I call a friend with a degree in philosophy. “Does ‘the algorithm of modern binary existentialism’ mean anything?” I ask. After the laughter has died down, he says, “I think he means… in modern life everything is black and white. But existentialism refers to a specific tradition in philosophy; he surely just means existence.” No matter; Penn has a lot more to say. Before leaving he told me: he is hard at work on Bob Honey, the sequel. • Bob Honey Who Just Do Stuff by Sean Penn is published by Simon &amp; Schuster at £14.99.

The smash-hit online shooter game, which sees 100 players battling each other to survive on a vast island, was updated on Tuesday, with a selection of new items and emotes. More intriguingly, there are now two new areas to explore. The game is split into seasons, with each lasting several weeks and all introducing new features and items. Season III had a sci-fi theme, with a variety of space suits to unlock and wear. Season IV, it seems, has an apocalyptic superhero feel – cleverly timed to coincide with the arrival of Avengers: Infinity War. Throughout April, developer Epic Games teased apocalyptic changes to Fortnite’s colourful landscape, starting with comets streaking across the sky. Over the past two days, however, meteors have been falling, crashing through buildings. “Shards of a massive comet have crashed into the map and altered the landscape,” says Epic Games on its patch notes page, describing the refreshed environment. Players are already gathering to investigate the new scenic features, many pausing during hostilities to gawp at the changes. Although many expected the densely built-up Tilted Towers area to be destroyed in a massive meteor shower, it has survived intact. Instead, Dusty Depot, the grouping of three large hangars in the centre of the island, has been destroyed. In its place is Dusty Divot, a huge crater surrounded by glowing “hop rocks”, which place players in a low gravity orbit. This could make for interesting slow-mo shoot-outs. There’s a whole new area, Risky Reels, in the northeast corner of the island, as well as fresh buildings and features dotted around the map. Epic has also made various updates and improvements to the game’s user interface, detailed in its patch notes. The Save the World co-operative battle mode has also been updated, with a new Origin Story mode and enemies who drop a wide variety of useful loot. Once again, there will be 100 tiers to progress though as you earn experience points and level up. There will also be a new Battle Pass, costing 950 v-bucks (or £7.99), giving access to costumes, items and emotes at each tier. The new season is set to last for 70 days. Released last September, originally as an offshoot of Fortnite: Save the World, Fortnite: Battle Royale has been the hit game of the last 12 months, passing 40m downloads in January. It hit mobile phones last month, quickly topping the App Store charts around the world. Available free on PC, consoles and phones, the revenues come entirely from cosmetic item purchases. The game is estimated to have made more than $126m (£92m) in February."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"technology/2018/may/06/kia-stinger-review-coupe-five-door-five-seat-fastback-classy","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-06T05:00:13Z","webTitle":"Kia Stinger: ‘A secret weapon with the power to rebrand Kia’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/may/06/kia-stinger-review-coupe-five-door-five-seat-fastback-classy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/may/06/kia-stinger-review-coupe-five-door-five-seat-fastback-classy","fields":{"headline":"Kia Stinger: ‘A secret weapon with the power to rebrand Kia’","bodyText":"Kia Stinger Price £31,995 0-62mph 5.8 seconds Top speed 149mph MPG 35.8 CO2 181g/km Meet the Stinger! Yes, really. For some, the name may conjure up images of Corvette’s mind-blowing Stingray, one of the most lusted-after performance cars of all time; for others it might be the surface-to-air missile used by US troops. But in the (admittedly lavatorial) Love household, a “stinger” can mean only one thing: the post-curry “after burn” following a good vindaloo. The concept car, originally unveiled in 2011, was called the GT – dull, yes, but at least it wasn’t eye-watering. I asked Kia why they’d decided to switch and was told: “Everyone felt GT was just too bland. But we think Stinger perfectly describes the style, character and intent of our new gran turismo.” Name aside, everything about the Stinger is, in fact, pitch perfect. It’s Kia’s new flagship: a lovely, long, low, elegant car which harks back to the golden age of fastback tourers. It’s not hard-edged; it’s a speedy cruiser designed to whisk you to St Tropez and back with the minimum of fuss and the maximum of pleasure. It’s an important car for Kia. When it comes to building useful and affordable hatchbacks and crossovers, the Korean firm is a global player. But the Stinger shows what else they can do. It’s as if they wanted to flex their muscles and say: “Look at us! We’re cool and we can make sassy cars that will make you drool!” And that’s exactly what they’ve done. The stinger is a coupé-sized, five-door, five seater. And it really is lovely, both to drive, to look at and to travel in. It’s also the first rear-wheel-drive car the company has sold in Europe and in range-topping twin-turbo V6 mode, it is the fastest car they’ve ever made, bowling you from 0-60mph in just 4.7 seconds. The problem is that most people associate Kia with value, not vanity. Spending more than £30,000, most would get a bad case of badge envy and hope to step up to a BMW or an Audi (it already has more than a passing resemblance to the A5 Sportback). To counter this the Stinger comes with a massively generous equipment checklist, so that rather than feeling expensive the car begins to feel like great value – especially when you throw in its seven-year, 100,000-mile warranty. The amount of kit that Kia has managed to fit into the Stinger to keep you safe and entertains is remarkable. There are five versions of the car available, all with turbocharged direct-injection engines and an eight-speed automatic gearbox, and all with state-of-the-art electronic driver aids and connectivity systems. Most buyers will avoid the diesel offerings and go for either the 2-litre or 3.3-litre petrol. I drove the smaller of the two. It was relentless, solid and fast – and yet still gazelle-light in terms of its handling. The car has been vigorously tested, prototypes covered 10,000km on the infamous Nürburgring in the Eifel mountains in Germany. It contains 73 challenging corners and is known as the Green Hell. It’s a brute camp for cars which can cruelly expose their shortcomings. But the Stinger totally burnt the ring (groan)! So much for the tough stuff. What about the mollycoddling? It’s luxurious, in a roomy and leathery way, and it’s a very pleasant place to while away the miles. The wing-shaped dashboard – also covered in leather – sweeps over the 8in touchscreen. Controls are clear and intuitive. All models have satnav and head-up display, plus DAB radio with Bluetooth and music streaming. It’s splendiferous! The Stinger is a secret weapon – with the power to rebrand Kia.

I particularly loved this pairing of tahini with raw fish. I played with the idea at home using a dry chile de arbol – a chilli I use more than any other for its toasty, nutty flavour and adaptability. Find them online and order in bulk or use dried chilli flakes tiny peperoncino or, for a milder flavour, pul biber – Turkish chilli flakes. Then crumble into anything and everything. Salmon tahini crudo with courgetti and pumpkin seed salad Fish, chilli, lime and garlic are very Mexican salad ingredients, which here are given a Middle Eastern spin with the nutty tahini: bold flavours, but an altogether fresh and light finish. Prep 25 min Serves 4 1 chile de arbol, or ½ tsp chilli flakes 1 small garlic clove, unpeeled The juice of 2 limes 30g tahini 2-3 tbsp toasted sesame oil, to taste 1 tsp caster sugar Salt and black pepper 3 fillets best quality (preferably organic) salmon, or very fresh mackerel 1 small bunch chives, finely chopped 2-3 tbsp stale breadcrumbs (optional) Oil, for frying (optional) For the courgetti salad A small bunch chervil, or tarragon 4 courgettes 4 tbsp pumpkin seed oil or extra-virgin olive oil 2 tsp tamari, or light soy sauce 30ml fresh lime juice 2 spring onions, peeled and finely chopped 50g pumpkin seeds, toasted Heat a small, dry frying pan over a medium-high heat and toast the chilli on all sides until it smells nutty and aromatic – about 30-40 seconds. Remove the chilli and add the garlic clove – skin on – and dry-roast on all sides for about eight minutes, until blackened and soft. Peel when cooled. Meanwhile, grind the chilli to a powder in a mortar, then blitz with the peeled garlic, lime juice, tahini, sesame oil and half the caster sugar. Season to taste. Skin the salmon and cut into even 1cm dice. Add the chives and stir through the salmon, seasoning lightly with salt and pepper. You can now toss the fish with the tahini dressing if you prefer it cured – otherwise dress it at the last minute (see below). Refrigerate the fish until you are ready to eat. If you are using the breadcrumbs, fry these over a medium heat in a tablespoon of oil for five to six minutes, until golden and crisp. Wash the chervil (or, if you can’t find it, tarragon), pick the leaves and discard the stalks. Make spaghetti using all but the inner core of the courgettes with a shredder, speed peeler or spiraliser – you will know when to stop shredding when you see the seeds in the centre. When you are ready to eat, whisk the oil with the soy sauce and lime juice, and season to taste with salt, pepper and the rest of the sugar. Toss the courgetti in this dressing with the rest of the salad ingredients. Either toss the salmon with the tahini dressing and arrange in a circle or line on a large plate with the courgette salad on the side, or arrange the naked salmon on the plate and drizzle with the dressing. Scatter with the crumbs, if using, and serve at once. Alternatively you can toss the whole lot together and serve with some sticky rice on the side for a more substantial meal. And for the rest of the week I loved the tahini cream so much that I made it again with lots of extra-virgin olive oil to become a dressing for a cold udon noodle salad (great with smoked mackerel). I love courgette noodles – once the weather starts to turn properly hot, I shall be tossing them with sweet, diced tomatoes and lots of fresh summery herbs; mint, basil, chervil – a lovely accompaniment to chicken schnitzel.

But it is not just elderly UK citizens from the Caribbean who have been treated badly, as anyone from sub-Saharan Africa invited to visit Britain will know. Three months ago, the Gumbi Education Fund, a tiny charity set up in 2002 by Guardian readers to help educate children in Malawi, invited Patrick Kamzitu, its administrator and sole employee, to come to Britain to give two talks and meet donors. Because he had set up four community libraries in villages that had never seen books, Patrick was to speak at the Hay international book festival with the author and historian Bettany Hughes about how books can change lives and bring development. Inviting Patrick was easy. Getting him a visa from UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI) to come for eight days to tell his simple, inspiring story about friendship and books has been a nightmare of hostility, suspicion, bureaucracy and the exercise of remote power. A long visa application form must be filled in online – a costly and hard task in itself for most Malawians who live without computers or electricity and who only go to the capital occasionally. But Patrick also had to provide his birth certificate, passport, marriage certificate, his children’s birth certificates, his employment contracts and several months of bank statements. At the UK end, the Gumbi fund had to issue a letter of invitation, an hour-by-hour itinerary of everywhere he hoped to visit as well as personal and business bank account details. It was not enough. After three weeks and paying £147 online to a French-owned call centre giant based in Johannesburg, which Britain uses to process all southern African visa applications and which charges anyone who wishes to contact them £5.48 per email, his request was refused. A rude letter stated that the combined income he was earning from administering the fund and working for the Malawi government as a health assistant was not enough to cover his stay in the UK. Nor could he show he earned enough money in Malawi. Moreover, he was told that because he was a rural health assistant it was unclear why he should be chosen to speak at Hay about rural development and books. But he was invited to apply again, for another £147. All the points were addressed and this time, his second application was accompanied by letters of support from a member of the House of Lords and the head of a large international charity, along with a copy of the Hay festival programme. His application was refused again on Monday. This time he was told that he could not show he had strong enough family and financial ties in Malawi to return; that he appeared to have no savings or assets, and that he could not show that he would not abscond. The hurdles are new, endless and impossible to jump and further ones are likely to be erected at will. There is no appeal, nowhere to turn to for official advice, no individual or website to consult, and no chance of any of the £300 being returned. But Patrick can apply again and pay £430 for a quick response. This is cruel but not unusual. It means that nearly 97% of Malawians and southern Africans who, like Patrick, earn less than a few thousand pounds a year are not welcome simply because they are not rich. Official figures show that hundreds of people from Malawi are refused visas for similar reasons every year. The Scottish-Malawi partnership, which represents more than 1,000 Scottish NGOs, churches, hospitals, schools and grassroots groups all with links to Malawi, reports that invited people are being refused entry on the most offensive grounds every week. And it’s not just Malawi. The latest UK figures show nearly one in four Malawians, one in three Zimbabweans, and one in two Ghanaians are denied visitors’ visas. Yet only 2% of American citizens are denied entry. Put simply, if you are invited to the UK but are not rich enough you will be refused entry – irrespective of who invites you and how much funding is available to support your visit. Immigration rules introduced when Teresa May was home secretary conflate relative poverty with criminal intent. It is assumed now that poor people will try to abscond. Yet these are Commonwealth people, whose countries are tied to Britain by long history, whom Britons have invited to visit in our own homes and workplaces, and who can teach us about Africa and and hospitality and good will. Instead, we meet them with hostility, humiliate and intimidate them, make them jump through hoops, treat them like would-be criminals and demand their most private information. Yet there is no evidence that poor people are more likely to abscond than rich, and it is simply wrong to assume that everyone wants to stay in Britain. Worst of all, it undermines the government’s own development work and it destroys relationships between groups of people who have forged friendships over decades. The Gumbi fund is trying for a third time to get Patrick Kamzitu a visa, but with little hope. This time he has submitted a letter from his government office stating that he intends to report back to work in Nambuma on 5 June. He has sent the receipts from selling his acre of tobacco, as well as his house documents. What more can he do to persuade a private company 2,000 miles away that he has a good family life in Malawi and that he does not want to stay in a hostile and unwelcoming Britain? Britain has all but lost its reputation for being a hospitable and welcoming nation. It is squaring up to be even more hostile to visitors than Trump’s America. This government should be ashamed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/may/03/norwich-james-maddison-championship-premier-league-interview","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-03T12:32:26Z","webTitle":"Norwich’s James Maddison: ‘I like having pressure on my shoulders’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/03/norwich-james-maddison-championship-premier-league-interview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/03/norwich-james-maddison-championship-premier-league-interview","fields":{"headline":"Norwich’s James Maddison: ‘I like having pressure on my shoulders’","bodyText":"James Maddison has a habit of producing the spectacular, so it is no surprise he exudes confidence. “I’ve always wanted to be a winner, the best player, the one that everyone is talking about,” he says. “I’m greedy in that sense.” The 21-year-old, by his own admission, treads a fine line between confidence and arrogance but Norwich’s skilful midfielder need not apologise for savouring centre stage or relishing responsibility. “I like having the pressure on my shoulders,” Maddison says at the club’s training base, in between one of manager Daniel Farke’s notorious double sessions. “I think I have the right balance of believing in my own ability and having that confidence on the pitch, people watching you thinking: ‘He knows he’s a good player’ but without taking it to that level where it’s: ‘He’s an arrogant so-and-so.’” Maddison’s form in a team who have underwhelmed has been so impressive it is scarcely believable this is his first full season in the Championship. His performances, which brought a call-up to the England Under-21 squad in November, mean it could yet prove to be his last. Maddison smiles as he tells of how, a couple of weeks ago, he found himself rubbing shoulders with one of this season’s outstanding performers at the PFA awards in Mayfair. “We had Mo Salah on the table next to us,” he says. “I took my mum, a big Liverpool fan, with me and she was in awe of him, as was I to be honest. I was like: ‘Wow, there’s Mo Salah, there’s Marcos Alonso and David de Gea and all these Premier League footballers.’ But my dad said to me: ‘You’re here for a reason, you deserve to be here,’ being in the Championship team of the season.” On match days being star struck is not an option. “We played Chelsea in the FA Cup, Eden Hazard comes on and you get the ball, turn and he’s there,” Maddison says. “You just try to turn and get past him. But after the game, I’m stood there and I ask him: ‘Eden can I have your shirt?’ When you’re on the pitch and you’re playing, it’s same old, you’re just playing against another human you’re trying to beat. But after, it’s Eden Hazard, Mo Salah, all these players. Especially for a younger player like me watching these guys in the Premier League every week, it’s nice to be in and around them.” Maddison glides with grace but there is a reason why his Norwich team-mate James Husband recently described him as a “weathered young boy”. On Sunday at Hillsborough Maddison will make his 113th appearance, primarily a result of being thrust into men’s football at Coventry, his boyhood club whom he joined after a successful trial just before his seventh birthday. Others have prospered via the same route: Ben Stevenson joined Wolves in January and George Thomas signed for Leicester last summer. This season, 19-year-old Tom Bayliss is making a name for himself at Coventry. “You don’t get the access to under-19 Champions League tournaments and things like that but you get access to first-team men’s football from the age of 16 or 17, if deemed good enough by the manager,” Maddison says. “Thankfully Steven Pressley at the time threw me in at the deep end and I was on the bench at 16 – I was just a boy. I learnt so much at Coventry – I was playing as a regular at 17, most weeks. And that’s something that left me in good stead.” These days he considers himself a Coventry fan; it is the first result he checks. When his schedule allows, he gets back to the family home in the West Midlands, where “football’s always on the TV”. He credits his mother, Una, and father, Gary, for keeping him grounded and they attend every game along with his younger brother, Ben, who studies carpentry at college. “I’ve tried to teach him a bit and he’s my number one fan to be fair,” Maddison says. “He loves it, he comes to every game with his Norwich shirt, holds his scarf up and I hope to keep making him and my family proud because that’s the best achievement you can get in football.” One moment he will never forget was his international debut in Kiev at the end of last year before he started against Ukraine at Bramall Lane in March, alongside a friendly foe in Demarai Gray. “We grew up playing against each other, Birmingham v Coventry,” he says. “Demarai used to have an afro, so when we used to play Birmingham it used to be: ‘The lad with the afro is a good player.’ We must have been 12 or 13. And now the afro’s gone.” Last season Maddison requested a loan in search of game time and moved to Aberdeen. It is easy to overlook the fact he joined Norwich in January 2016 because it is only now he has made a lasting impression, under Farke. “I didn’t just become this player that can make things happen in the summer,” he says, clicking his fingers. “It’s always been there, nothing’s changed but I just needed that chance.” As a team, there is frustration at a campaign that has fallen short of an expected promotion challenge but it has been an extraordinary eight months individually for Maddison. “You should always want more,” he says. “If you get comfortable with what you have done, you can never go to that next level.” After signing, he was asked in an interview what supporters could expect. Fast-forward almost two years and he can safely say he has delivered on his promise of getting fans out of their seats."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"film/filmblog/2018/may/01/uk-box-office-avengers-infinity-war","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-01T15:45:06Z","webTitle":"Avengers: Infinity War goes cosmic with huge £29m opening at UK box office","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2018/may/01/uk-box-office-avengers-infinity-war","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/filmblog/2018/may/01/uk-box-office-avengers-infinity-war","fields":{"headline":"Avengers: Infinity War goes cosmic with huge £29m opening at UK box office","bodyText":"The phenomenon: Avengers: Infinity War The last weekend in April has served Disney and Marvel splendidly in the past three years with Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), Captain America: Civil War (2016) and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 (2017). When Disney grabs that date for a Marvel movie, other distributors run for cover. So it proved again with Avengers: Infinity War, which Disney launched into a market that contained little in competition – Rampage in its third week of play, and Ready Player One in its fifth. And, by mixing characters from across the Marvel Cinematic Universe, fans were offered a winning combination of familiarity and novelty. Avengers: Infinity War debuted at UK cinemas with £23.1m for the weekend and £29.4m including Thursday. That’s the biggest opening ever for a superheromovie, and more than double the opening number for Black Panther which debuted in February with £10.5m for the weekend period, and £17.7m including previews. If previews are included in films’ opening tallies, this is the third biggest debut ever, behind Spectre (a seven-day £41.3m) and Star Wars: The Force Awakens (£34m). If previews are excluded, Infinity War also delivered the third biggest opening ever, behind The Force Awakens (£24.3m) and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 (£23.8m). The alternative: Beast Before 2017, the commercial track record for British films by first-time directors at UK cinemas was not encouraging, with admired debuts such as Scott Graham’s Shell, Daniel Wolfe’s Catch Me Daddy and Stephen Fingleton’s The Survivalist grossing less than £200,000 in the UK between them. Even the acclaimed talents such as Andrea Arnold and Lynne Ramsay didn’t translate acclaim into box office success, with Arnold’s debut Red Road grossing £331,000 in the UK and Ramsay’s Ratcatcher £438,000. Last year, however, the bar for commercial success was suddenly set a lot higher when debut British filmmakers Will Oldroyd and Francis Lee grossed £813,000 and £871,000 with respectively Lady Macbeth and God’s Own Country. Those robust numbers have evidently given encouragement to UK distributor Altitude, which has released Beast – from debut British director Michael Pearce – into a bullish 82 cinemas. The Jersey-set mystery/thriller/romance took a decent £127,000 (£166,000 including previews). That compares with a debut of £153,000 from 104 venues for Lady Macbeth a year ago, and £191,000 including previews. God’s Own Country began last September with £136,000 from 45 sites, and £168,000 including previews. The recovery: Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society Period romance The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society faced the challenge of sunny skies when it was released on 20 April, landing in third place with a soft £811,000 plus previews. But this is a film that appeals to older audiences – a cinema-going segment that is traditionally hesitant at weekends and strong on weekdays – and it rose to the top spot on Monday, grossing £1.24m over the Monday-to-Thursday period – 53% up on its weekend number. Building on that success, Guernsey has posted a 22% rise on its debut number, with £969,000 for its second session, and a 10-day total of £3.03m. For comparison, Their Finest reached £2.3m at the same stage of its run a year ago. Guernsey is now running 31% ahead of that film’s pace. Funny Cow, starring Maxine Peake as a standup comedian in the 1970s and 80s, showed an even bigger increase, up 38%. Second-weekend takings of £94,000 from 78 cinemas push the 10-day total to £247,000. The market Thanks to the arrival of Infinity War, the market is a stunning 451% up on the previous session, and also 78% up on the equivalent weekend from 2017, which greeted the arrival of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2. Overall, box office was the strongest it’s been since late December 2015, which saw the arrival of The Force Awakens.

Gerrard is the favoured candidate of Mark Allen, the Rangers director of football, and Dave King, the chairman, with the Scottish club still confident they can coax the 37-year-old from his current position as a youth coach at Liverpool. This would mark Gerrard’s first job in management. “The rumours are true, I have had initial talks,” said Gerrard. “I have had positive talks. I’ll pick them up on Thursday and we will see if we can progress it. We will see.” Gerrard was speaking on BT Sport, for whom he is a pundit for both of this week’s Champions League semi-finals. He is known to want assurances from Rangers regarding precisely what resource will be available to mount a challenge to Celtic. Rangers have been without a permanent manager since the removal of Pedro Caixinha last October. Gerrard’s comments arrived at the end of a day which had started with confirmation that Graeme Murty had been relieved of his position as the Rangers interim manager following Sunday’s 5-0 mauling by Celtic. Jimmy Nicholl and Jonatan Johansson will take charge of the Ibrox side for their three remaining matches of the season, with Rangers engulfed in a scrap to finish second - or even third - in Scotland’s top flight. “The club hopes to be in a position to comment further on the managerial situation in the near future,” said a Rangers statement. Murty may yet return to his former post within the club’s youth system."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/may/02/wednesday-best-tv-love-in-the-countryside-taskmaster","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-02T05:20:04Z","webTitle":"Wednesday’s best TV: Love in the Countryside; Taskmaster","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/may/02/wednesday-best-tv-love-in-the-countryside-taskmaster","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/may/02/wednesday-best-tv-love-in-the-countryside-taskmaster","fields":{"headline":"Wednesday’s best TV: Love in the Countryside; Taskmaster","bodyText":"Love in the Countryside 9pm, BBC Two Farming life can seem idyllic, all rolling hillsides and mucking out the livestock, but it can be a lonely business.

The May 1968 protests are remembered for students in Nanterre, outside Paris, railing against rules preventing men and women students visiting each other’s living quarters. But the row about the right to be treated as adults was soon subsumed into much bigger concerns and disillusionment with the leadership of an ageing General de Gaulle in an oppressively hierarchical society. More than 9 million workers staged wildcat strikes in May 1968, closing factories, occupying workspaces and paralysing France with the largest strike movement in Europe since the second world war. Hierarchy was chipped away but it was a slow, incremental type of revolution – De Gaulle won elections in June 1968, only sidling out of politics the following year.

West tweeted last week that he would be using the image of Adams, and said that he wanted “to forgive and stop hating”, since the purported title of his new album is Love Everyone. Adams gave Donda West liposuction, a tummy tuck and a breast reduction in November 2007, but she died the following day, after reporting pain and tightness in her chest. A coroner found “no evidence of a surgical or anaesthetic misadventure,” and said “the final manner of death could not be determined. Multiple post-operative factors could have played a role in the death. The exact contribution of each factor could not be determined.” Adams has written an open letter to West, posted on the website the Blast, asking him to “cease and desist” from using his image on the album cover. “I don’t want to seem ungrateful,” he wrote, “I just think that if in fact this conversion to love is genuine on your part, then it’s inappropriate to drag the negativity of the past with it.” After writing a lengthy description of the events around West’s death and the subsequent investigations, he adds: “Don’t put my picture out there and pretend you are about love. Love deals with the truth. Over the past 10 years I have tolerated all the errors, misinformation and lies told by reporters, journalists and people on the street out of respect for doctor-patient privilege and your mother.” West responded to Adams’s letter on Twitter, writing: “This is amazing. Thank you so much for this connection brother. I can’t wait to sit with you and start healing.” The messages are part of a recent burst of activity from West, as he gears up to release two albums in June (one in collaboration with Kid Cudi), as well as albums he has helped produce for Nas, Pusha T and Teyana Taylor. Most controversially, he reiterated his support for Donald Trump, saying: “We are both dragon energy. He is my brother.” He released two new tracks over the weekend, including Ye Vs the People, in which he further argues his support for Trump, saying: “Make America Great Again had a negative perception / I took it, wore it, rocked it, gave it a new direction / Added empathy, care and love and affection.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2018/may/09/stubbornly-fighting-for-life-how-arthur-koestler-reported-the-birth-of-israel","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-09T05:00:38Z","webTitle":"'Stubbornly fighting for life': how Arthur Koestler reported the birth of Israel","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/09/stubbornly-fighting-for-life-how-arthur-koestler-reported-the-birth-of-israel","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/09/stubbornly-fighting-for-life-how-arthur-koestler-reported-the-birth-of-israel","fields":{"headline":"'Stubbornly fighting for life': how Arthur Koestler reported the birth of Israel","bodyText":"‘In the beginning was chaos and muddle,” reads the first line of the June 1948 dispatch from the coastal city of Tel Aviv. The state of Israel was less than a month old when the Manchester Guardian launched a series of articles by the journalist and novelist Arthur Koestler. The country had declared independence on 14 May. In the midst of a conflict with Arab Palestinians, coupled with an invasion by surrounding states, Israel had no clearly accepted borders but was hastily forming a government. So young was the country that the Israeli visas stamped on Koestler’s and his partner’s passports in Paris were numbered five and six. On arrival, he found airport signs freshly painted in English and Hebrew, while immigration and customs officers had not yet received uniforms. “Here is bureaucracy in a state of virginal innocence before it has had time to spin itself into a cocoon of red tape,” wrote Koestler in his first article, titled “Israel: First Impressions”. Seventy years ago, Koestler had published Darkness at Noon (1940) and was established as a buccaneering leftwing intellectual and close friend of George Orwell. He arrived to an Israel vastly unrecognisable from the regional powerhouse it is today. Notwithstanding open conflict, Israel’s untested leaders were gathering Jewish militant factions into one army and forming a nation of disparate Jews from across Europe and the Middle East. After close to three decades in which the territory had been under the British Mandate for Palestine, the United Nations proposed, in 1947, to split the area into two, forming independent Arab and Jewish states. Civil war erupted, and Jewish leaders later announced Israel’s creation. “The first year or two of Israel’s existence will be decisive for its future, and it depends on its leaders who have resurrected the Jewish State against almost impossible odds,” wrote Koestler. Born in Hungary in 1905 to Jewish parents, Koestler had embraced a myriad of 20th-century political movements, describing himself as the “Casanova of Causes”. Sometime communist, anti-fascist, anti-death penalty and pro-euthanasia, Koestler was captured by Franco’s forces in the Spanish civil war in the late 1930s, and narrowly avoided being executed after he was arrested for spying. Later, in 1940, he managed to escape from the Nazis when they invaded France, and made his way to Britain. Despite all this, chief among his political obsessions may have been the establishment of the Jewish state. Koestler, who first travelled to Palestine in 1926 as a Jewish settler, once described himself as a “young duel-fighting Zionist”. A controversial malcontent, the writer was known to be a manipulative sexual predator, and an alleged rapist (Michael Foot’s wife, Jill Craigie, was one of his alleged victims, confirming a claim made in a 1999 biography). Further contention was added to his record after he and his wife killed themselves in 1983, even though she was healthy and years younger than him. Police found the pair seated in chairs in the living room of their Knightsbridge home. Koestler began his Israel dispatches in deserted Haifa, a Mediterranean town where, weeks before his arrival, he reported that most of the port city’s 70,000 Arabs had fled amid fierce fighting with Jewish forces. Koestler’s take was that “it fell because the Arab population, though only slightly inferior in numbers and superior in arms, were utterly demoralised through the desertion of their leaders”. The Haganah, a Jewish paramilitary organisation that went on to become the Israel Defense Forces, had broadcast in Arabic the names of the deserters to demoralise the Arab gunmen, he wrote. Arabs featured only occasionally in Koestler’s articles. “The native Palestine Arabs,” he said, “never fought seriously because they had no reason for fighting, having accepted the presence of the Jews with its economic benefit and the de facto partition as accomplished facts.” Travelling down the coastal road from Haifa to Tel Aviv, Koestler said his view was “confirmed” by Arab farmers in Israel who he said were “unmolested” while being treated “with equanimity and trading produce with Jews”. It was not clear if he had stopped to speak to them. Anita Shapira, an Israeli historian who has focused on the early years of statehood, says this “very idyllic description of farmers working in the fields baffled me. It was far from reality. We are talking about almost 10 months of civil war between the Palestinians and the Jews, and then a month of fighting with the Arab states. I don’t think anybody could have imagined idyllic relations between Jews and Arabs at that time.” More than 700,000 Palestinians fled or were driven from their homes in the war surrounding Israel’s creation – an event that is commemorated by Palestinians every year on 15 May as the Nakba, or “catastrophe”. Tens of thousands of Palestinians stayed and make up about a fifth of Israel’s modern-day population. Eman Abu Hanna-Nahhas, who has written a PhD on the collective memory of the Nakba for Palestinians, says the relationship with Arabs remaining inside Israel, many of whom were internally displaced, varied significantly. “When you are defeated and you know that you’ve lost your home, I’m not sure you would have good relations,” she says. Other Palestinians who had fled but were trying to return to the new state were blocked. But, she adds, in other cases there was amicability. One of the only times an Arab source did appear in Koestler’s reports was when he interviewed two Egyptian prisoners who, he said, “displayed about the lowest morale I ever saw among combatants in any army”. Koestler had already written much on Palestine, including Thieves in the Night, a novel inspired by his experiences in an agricultural kibbutz. A 1946 review in the New York Times called it “editorial, angry and partisan”. It added: “There is never a time when [the book’s Jewish settler protagonist] questions the right of his people to dominate the land in which the Arabs are and have long been in a majority.” After he returned to Israel in 1948, Koestler described what he said was a “mystical fervour” among the state’s improvised army: “Native Jewish Tarzans throw homemade Molotov bombs on tanks from the tops of eucalyptus trees or jump at turrets blowing themselves up.” Many of his reports centred on the Jewish forces being haphazardly collated into one military, with sporadic “fratricide struggle” between bitter rivals. One story, titled “Trouble in Israel”, covered the sinking of the Altalena cargo ship, which was the focus of a confrontation between the Irgun, a rightwing Jewish paramilitary group, and the nascent army. Sixteen men were killed and scores wounded when gunboats of the Israeli navy fired on and grounded the ship, which the Irgun had used to transport arms. Koestler quotes one of the civilian passengers, a woman who had travelled from France to immigrate to the new state: “I gave up my studies to help defend the Jewish State. While approaching the shore we were received by the fire of Jewish guns and four of us were killed. This ends all hope.” Koestler contrasts what he said was a moderate Haganah with the “terrorist” Irgun and Lehi militants, whom he described as religiously motivated extremists who “fought with uncompromising fanaticism, committed murder, and walked cheerfully to the gallows, with some savage Psalm of David on their lips”. Operating underground during British rule, in 1946 the Irgun had blown up the southern wing of Jerusalem’s iconic King David hotel, killing 91. And, in September 1948, Koestler reported the assassination by Lehi of Count Folke Bernadotte, the UN peace mediator. The heavy-handed response to the Altalena incident, Koestler wrote, was down to an insecure leadership, which he said “suffers from an inferiority complex and is obsessed with asserting its authority”. “Like a young school teacher facing an unruly class it is reverting to unnecessarily draconian measures,” he wrote. “This situation is aggravated by the fact that the government is not elected but self-appointed and is displaying embryonic tendencies towards dictatorship.” The provisional prime minister, David Ben-Gurion – who Koestler said ran the country with “paternal despotism” – would go on to lead Israel for a total of 13 years, although not consecutively; his political allies remained in power until the late 1970s. Shapira says there was never a concern that Israel would not hold elections, which were planned for and took place a year after Koestler’s visit. “Dictatorship was never an option,” she says. “However, Ben-Gurion was not a very tolerant person, especially on the issue of authority.” For him, she says, it was essential that the state had a monopoly on the use of force. Koestler later turned his back on Israel (where he is viewed disfavourably to this day), but in 1948 he was bursting with Zionist zeal. Nevertheless, he found Israel “aesthetically” disappointing. He appeared to hold a particular dislike for Tel Aviv, then a city of about 200,000 people whose apartments had sprung up swiftly following waves of migration. “Tel Aviv’s architecture is the drab functionalism of the early 20s at its worst. The streets have no skyline; the seafront is hemmed in by a row of sordid little cafes with blaring loud-speakers,” he wrote. “As for the countryside, no greater contrast is imaginable than that between the picturesque squalor of the Arab villages, now mostly dead and deserted, and the sober purposefulness of Jewish settlements,” he added. Israel, he concluded towards the end of his seven-month assignment, “is both a hard pioneer country and a bitter refugee country, disillusioned by experience, stubbornly fighting for life, with an aching void in its past and an interrogation mark for its future”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/may/01/from-glossies-to-gal-dem-the-websites-revolutionising-womens-media","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-01T10:42:19Z","webTitle":"From glossies to gal-dem: the websites revolutionising women’s media","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/01/from-glossies-to-gal-dem-the-websites-revolutionising-womens-media","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/01/from-glossies-to-gal-dem-the-websites-revolutionising-womens-media","fields":{"headline":"From glossies to gal-dem: the websites revolutionising women’s media","bodyText":"Over the past decade, the women’s magazine has undergone a radical makeover. While 00s glossies consisted largely of insidious bodyshaming and bankrupting shoe recommendations, in recent years female-centric journalism has migrated online, simultaneously shifting its gaze to social justice, mental health and the hitherto hidden realities of womanhood. It has not always been a smooth transition: last week, the online women’s magazine the Debrief announced its closure, with its parent company, Bauer Media, deciding to refocus resources into its print product Grazia. Last year, Sarah Millican’s Standard Issue shut, while US website the Hairpin followed suit in January. Yet a host of other publications remain committed to doing things differently. Here, the women behind London-based site gal-dem and Mille World, an online magazine aimed at Arab readers, explain why they are determined to reimagine the women’s magazine as a force for positive change. RA Mille World Sofia Guellaty launched Mille World out of frustration that it did not already exist. She was looking for a publication that engaged with what it meant to be a young Arab woman. Versace, Dior, Calvin Klein and Chanel were sending hijabs down their runways, but who was catering to the savvy, cosmopolitan Arab women looking to reclaim the Arab narrative for an educated Arab audience? It turned out no one was, so Guellaty decided to. Educated in Paris, but born and now based in Tunis, the capital of Tunisia, 35-year-old Guellaty was at the helm of Condé Nast’s first Middle East launch, the now-closed Style.com/Arabia, in 2012. “I kept hearing about things being ‘good enough’ for the Arab market. That really got to me, this ‘good enough’ attitude. Two things: one, it’s not good enough, what you’re doing is crap. Two, it’s racist,” Guellaty says. Two years ago, she quit Condé Nast; last May she became pregnant with her first child. It was during her pregnancy that she developed the idea for Mille World. After giving birth, she recruited the first members of the board, which now includes Saudi princess Reema bint Bandar al-Saud and Saif Mahdhi, the president of Next Models. She recruited the company’s CEO, Nez Gebreel, from the Dubai Design and Fashion Council. It was crucial to Guellaty that her executive and editorial team were Arabs and leaders in their field. “Because of colonisation – whether it’s real, as with Tunisia and France, Egypt and the UK, or whether it’s cultural supremacy – [Arab readers] tend to be like: ‘If a white guy did it, it must be good.’ I wanted to change that. I wanted the whole team to be Arab, which never happens. At the big fashion titles, like Harper’s Bazaar, Vogue, there’s not one Arab there – maybe there’s an Arab assistant,” she says. “They write articles about ‘Oriental fashion’ being on the rise. We write about decolonising beauty standards. We’re very now. They’re very yesterday.” Mille World launched in January and already has 40,000 unique visitors a month. Its readers come from across the Arab world and diaspora, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Lebanon, Egypt, France, the UK and the US. Its 12-person editorial staff is equally international, based in Dubai, London, Paris and Tunis. The deputy editor, Samira Larouci, 28, has lived in Dalston, London, for years, but she was raised in “very, very white” Chichester by her Moroccan parents. She left i-D magazine in July, having helped set up its luxury lifestyle site, Amuse. She was put in touch with Guellaty by a mutual friend. Their first phone call lasted two and a half hours. “We were talking about Arab identity issues; I’ve always been seeking a community of my own to connect with. We both agreed there was a voice missing that we wanted to hear. It was young, inclusive and not based around materialism,” Larouci says. “We wanted to address that need. It’s almost laughable no one’s done it before.” Larouci now commissions and edits the bulk of the site’s editorial content – 60 pieces a month, every one of which is translated into English, French and Arabic. She is interested particularly in Arab counterculture and championing Arab artists who do not have any other platform in their region. “The reader I want to reach is someone studying in Washington, raised in Saudi, who’s in a sort of cultural limbo. That’s where I come from. I want to find those people in LA who are interested in feminism in the Arab world,” Larouci says. All this is only financially possible thanks to Mille World’s consultancy wing, led by co-founder Myriam Djelouat, which translates its connection with the Arab market into campaign advice for massive brands such as LVMH, Ralph Lauren and Converse. As Mille World’s promotional material points out, 40% of people living in the Arab world are millennials with higher spending power than their peers everywhere else, including in the US. “Our generation is the highest-spending generation in history, but it’s also woke. [The big brands] are realising they need to rethink,” Guellaty says. “Mille World is my playground and I’ll write what I want there. If this Gucci bag sucks, it sucks and it’ll never see the light of day on my website. But if you want help on a Gucci campaign? Yeah, for sure,” she says. “What I want is a generation-defining media, something like what Jefferson Hack did with Dazed and Another Magazine. It’s like, here is a media through which I can understand the world I’m in, something that inspires me within my own identity.” PG gal-dem Deep in the belly of a south London car park lie the offices of gal-dem, an online magazine produced exclusively by women and non-binary people of colour. It is not big – each of the work studios in Peckham Levels has been converted from a single parking space – but it is significant. By parsing culture and current affairs through a prism of intersectional feminism, covering topics from Grenfell to mooncups, gal-dem is one of the publications changing the face of female-focused media. Liv Little was halfway through a politics and sociology degree at the University of Bristol when she founded gal-dem and the site’s ethos sprang directly from her studies. “The issues that I was really interested in politically were the specific, nuanced ways that women are affected by legislation in this country,” she says. “So I did a lot of campaigning and research around women seeking asylum in the UK and Yarl’s Wood [immigration centre] and how types of violence which they would fall victim to were gendered.” In doing so, Little observed “a lack of understanding of a different type of experience” faced by women – especially women of colour – and a gap in the market for a site that could tell their stories. As a concept, gal-dem is a world away from the blinkered women’s glossies available to the editorial team in their youth. While those magazines shared some women’s stories, the scope was narrow, and much of the content was designed to reaffirm strict beauty standards. gal-dem, meanwhile, has no such agenda, aiming to provide women with just one thing: a voice. In this sense, the site is part of a much broader cultural shift in women’s media – one that has seen print titles fail (recent casualties include Company, She, Glamour, Bliss and Sugar) and a new breed of online magazine take their place. Riding the fourth wave of feminism, publications such as The Pool and Refinery 29 are fuelled not by materialism, but by a rich seam of untapped subject matter: the experiences women have long been told to keep quiet. While the gal-dem team acknowledge their position in the wider landscape of newly feminist media, they are careful to distinguish themselves from their peers. “There is a tendency within feminism for its face to be quite white and middle-class,” says Little. “To see an editorial team comprising women of colour is a rarity; I think that is clearly our point of difference.” From her desk in the gal-dem offices, the deputy editor – and Guardian contributor – Charlie Brinkhurst-Cuff explains how the focus on issues that affect women of colour manifests itself in gal-dem’s attitude. “The tone in general is a bit more serious than the Refinerys and Bustles; we don’t have that ‘you’re talking to your best friend’ thing going on,” she says. “The nature of the topics we’re talking about a lot of the time don’t really lend themselves to that and we don’t want to ever dilute that seriousness.” Slowly, gal-dem’s efforts to rectify a lack of representation are being echoed by the mainstream media – with decidedly mixed results. Since he took over six months ago, the Vogue editor Edward Enninful has managed to include five women of colour on his covers (February’s Vogue featured Little in a spread about “the new suffragettes”), yet glossies are still regularly derided for their treatment of black women. In November, the actor Lupita Nyong’o expressed her disappointment at Grazia’s decision to photoshop away her natural hair on its cover; the previous month, the Evening Standard’s magazine caused much consternation by airbrushing Solange’s braids. And just because online magazines tend to avoid scandal, that does not mean they are necessarily much better, Brinkhurst-Cuff says. “It would be more hidden if there was an issue online, because you don’t have the physical print cover to see. We can say Alexandra Shulman only published 12 black women on the cover, whereas if an online publication is pretty much exclusively publishing white writers or using stock images of white women you’re arguably less likely to pick up on that.” That said, she sees the new online media “struggling towards intersectionality, for the right or wrong reasons. Diversity is in fashion right now, but we hope it’s not always about money.” Money, however, is something gal-dem is beginning to consider seriously. Until now, it has been a voluntary organisation. Nobody gets paid, apart from contributors on specific brand collaborations; the annual print issue, the covers of which hang from the office’s chipboard walls, is more passion project than money-maker. But as the site has grown – gal-dem receives “anything from 4,000 to 20,000 unique visitors a day”, according to Little – the team believe it is turning into an economically viable enterprise. Little has just stopped working full-time and the team are developing a business plan. It is still early days for the new breed of women’s magazine and the economic forecast remains uncertain – but, in terms of broadening the scope for women’s media, the legacy of gal-dem and its peers already seems indelible. RA Four more new-wave websites The Pool Aimed at the time-stretched woman, this online magazine from Lauren Laverne and former Red editor Sam Baker focuses on snackable content – its intimate personal essays and practical advice are all stamped with an average reading time. Man Repeller Initially a blog documenting Leandra Medine’s love of ugly and offbeat fashion, Man Repeller now also publishes smart, funny and moving pieces on everything from ghosting to antidepressants. Broadly “For women who know their place” runs the tagline to Vice’s women-focused channel, which covers feminist issues with an emphasis on reportage.

The animation appeared this month, projected on to Dublin’s Treasury building, and images quickly spread on social media under the hashtag #TheWeightOfTheEighth. It was a striking symbol of a debate that has engulfed Ireland in recent months, playing out on the walls and streets of its cities. On 25 May, Ireland will vote on whether to repeal the eighth amendment to its constitution – a clause that protects the right to life of the unborn – and clear a path to legalising abortion in the country. The question challenges the Irish state’s conservative, patriarchal foundations, from which many people in Ireland – its urban dwellers in particular – feel increasingly disconnected. Old tropes have been fleshed out during a heated referendum campaign: the city versus the countryside, the capital versus “the rest”. That divide concerns pro-repeal campaigners. “The polls keep telling us that the rest of Ireland outside Dublin is less likely to vote Yes,” says Ailbhe Smyth, leader of the pro-repeal Together For Yes coalition. “But there is still a very high proportion of don’t knows.” The pro-repeal campaign’s message – “care, compassion and change” – was “designed to reach that middle ground” and unite the country, Smyth says.An urban/rural divide has been evident for previous “moral issue” referendums in Ireland, says electoral geographer Adrian Kavanagh. When Ireland voted to legalise divorce in 1995 – by a margin of just 9,000 ballots – the number of those voting in favour was 14% lower in rural than in urban areas. For the 2015 vote to endorse same-sex marriage, the differential was 10%. As conservative governments from Poland to the US have increasingly fostered a hostile climate for abortion services, the role of cities as safe havens for reproductive rights has been reinforced. The UN predicts that as much as 70% of the world’s population will be living in urban areas by 2050; as a result, the power and influence of mayors and other locally elected officials is expected to grow. Those offices could act as a counterpoint to anti-abortion forces at national or federal level. In the US, cities have already demonstrated their legal power and social mandate to resist efforts by the Trump administration to target migrant rights and the Paris climate agreement. The National Institute for Reproductive Health aims to harness this power for change at a local level, encouraging cities to lead on access to abortion. Its Local Reproductive Freedom Index determines the best and worst performing US cities in terms of reproductive health services. The index was set up to show the impact of local policy-making, says Andrea Miller, president of the NIRH. The NIRH index illustrates the inequality in abortion services across the US, with access largely clustered in coastal cities. But that picture is slowly changing. “What we’re seeing are blue [Democrat] dots in red [Republican] states,” says Miller. “Cities that are moving in a more progressive trajectory, even in some of the most restrictive and conservative states.” She singles out St Louis, Missouri, and Columbus, Ohio. “They’re a great example of states that have passed law after law to try to eliminate access to care and yet we’re seeing the cities themselves stepping up.” In 2016 Ohio politicians passed the “heartbeat bill”, which sought to ban abortion after six weeks of pregnancy (the state’s governor vetoed the bill, approving a 20-week ban instead). State lawmakers have also moved to defund family planning clinics. But Columbus has strengthened laws protecting access to clinics and punishing harassment of clinic employees. “Having said that, there’s still room for improvement,” Miller says. She believes the key is for women to get involved in local politics as well as supporting existing bodies. “Change trickles up. It rarely comes from the top down.” Abortion in Italy has been legal since 1978, but recent government studies found that seven in 10 Italian gynaecologists refuse to carry out the operations on moral grounds. In regions such as Sicily and Lazio, which contains the capital Rome, that percentage is higher still. According to Laiga, an association of pro-choice gynaecologists, only seven doctors in Lazio will carry out an abortion past the first trimester – and all of those are based in Rome. “In Italy women aren’t aware of the restrictions on abortions until they need one,” says Silvana Agatone, president of Laiga. “In the city of Trapani in Sicily there was one doctor who took care of all abortions in the area, 80 a month. He retired this year. What do we do now?” It’s up to urban hospitals and individuals to educate and take action, she says, which is why Laiga prioritises lobbying regional and local government to enforce Italy’s abortion laws. Efforts to undermine abortion rights in Poland have been more overt. The conservative Law and Justice party wants to ban abortions even in cases of foetal abnormality, grounds that account for 95% of terminations in the country and one of the few exceptions to strict laws already in place. “This is the most serious threat yet,” says Krystyna Kacpura, a director at the Federation for Women and Family Planning. Thousands took to the streets of Warsaw in March to protest against the plans, with the city serving as a hub for wider mobilisation aimed at educating the public. “In March 2016, only around 14% of the Polish population described themselves as pro-choice,” Kacpura says. “But by September 2017 that had risen to 42%.” If Ireland does vote Yes next week, it will still fall to cities to safeguard women’s access to safe abortion services. That these battles are still being fought around the world, often many decades after reproductive rights were won, is a reminder that such freedoms cannot be taken for granted.

In his 2012 show The Bee, a man’s family are taken hostage by an escaped convict so the man duly kidnaps the convict’s family. In this apocalyptic farce – the third of three Noda plays to be staged by Soho theatre, all starring the ever-playful Kathryn Hunter and all cast against gender – the family home becomes a prison of their own making. Hunter plays family patriarch Boo, the self-styled “legend of the classical stage” clinging to more than 600 years of Noh history. He is going out for the evening but wife Bo (Noda, who also directs) and daughter Pickle (Glyn Pritchard) also have appointments and are just as determined to leave the house. But with Princess the dog about to give birth, somebody has to stay home for the evening. Who is it going to be? Drawing on the Noh theatre tradition and featuring live musical accompaniment from Japanese kabuki musician Denzaemon Tanaka XIII, this is as strange and dislocating an evening as you can currently find in London. It’s like watching a heightened Ray Cooney farce crossed with Beckett and overlaid with a heavy veneer of Japanese cultural references. It is distinctly odd, and yet in the end oddly moving, too, as the entire family’s failure to take responsibility for the future has appalling consequences. The performances are spot-on, and if the outlandishness of the comedy sometimes veers dangerously close to being irritating, the piece earns its ending as it demonstrates the madness of standing your ground and refusing to give an inch. • At Soho theatre, London, until 19 May.

Projects such as the Crimes of Britain website are monitoring Britain’s imperial legacy for today’s youth and interrogating Britain’s claim to greatness. Now, the Indian standup Anuvab Pal anatomises the same subject matter in his touring comedy show, The Empire, which he performs at Soho theatre in London this week. A Bengali native, Pal offers an Indian perspective on the armies who turned up uninvited on India’s shores. But he also uses his routines to inform audiences of a subset of Indians who yearn for the return of the Raj. “A certain sort of middleman got very rich both in Britain and India by exploiting poor Indian people, who have pretty much always been exploited,” he tells me over the phone. “And it wasn’t just the British doing horrible things directly – it was through a class they created.” And what does this class look like? Pal’s interpretation dons a Beefeater jacket and judge’s wig, and adopts the personality of an Indian suffering from such a fervent colonial hangover that Ukip’s nationalism seems tame. This is a character who has no desire to be Indian. He sports jodhpurs, refers to his friends as “old chap” with the staccato slur of a bygone radio announcer, takes his wife ballroom dancing and attends Gymkhana and croquet clubs. It’s a cartoonish image but one that resonated with Pal for an uncomfortable reason: “As I did more research [into these people], I realised, ‘Oh shit, I’m part of that class.’” Pal’s absurd onstage persona navigates India’s recent colonial history, taking us on a journey from the Mughals to the Portuguese and finally the British. In a convivial manner he explains India’s battle to define its identity after being subjected to outside interference, juxtaposing its history with the rightwing nationalism of the country’s current prime minister, Narendra Modi. “The Modi narrative is essentially: ‘We started a long time ago, and the Mughals were invaders, and the British were invaders, and everything before that, we were who we were,’ whatever that means,” Pal explains. “In new India, no one’s really interested in going back and looking at our history. Shah Jahan built an entire city. They just ignore the amount that the Mughals did for religious tolerance, culture and architecture.” Modi’s nationalistic narrative labels the Mughals as colonisers and delegitimises everything they brought with them. Such a stance has been used to perpetrate Islamophobia. Pal hopes to point out the hypocrisy in dismissing the significance of invasions. “Which country would not like to be told that invaders were horrible? With that same logic you can say: ‘Oh, Taj Mahal, terrible, just a rubbish monument built by invaders. Biryani, nonsense, rubbish food.’ You could keep going back in history and say anything.” Pal is by no means endorsing colonialism. “It’s true that the British were invaders, but I just thought there has got to be more nuance, there’s got to be more deception on both sides,” he says. “I was struck by how similar wealthy Indians’ homes were at the turn of the century, based on copying British homes because they were contractors and serving as middlemen for British people.” It’s this dichotomy of thought that made Pal’s Britain-loving Indian such a striking caricature. “These people are kind of outdated in new India but their generation, in many ways, built India by being very English and following the same exploitative things that the English did.” Due to increasing animosity towards those who don’t fit in with India’s image of unified hindutva, this class is being erased from Indian culture. “These people belong nowhere – they’re foreigners in their own country,” Pal says. But his show does not set out to make audiences feel sorry for them. “I wanted to understand this bizarre generation of anglicised Indians,” says Pal. In doing so he has delved into what makes India India. Perhaps it acts as an antidote to the current regime’s exclusionary populism, but Pal laughs: “There is no ‘we’ – everybody’s fighting.” Anuvab Pal: The Empire is at Soho theatre, London, until 5 May."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/may/06/the-biggest-scandal-ever-campaigner-hopes-for-banking-justice","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-05T22:32:56Z","webTitle":"'The biggest scandal ever': fraud campaigner hopes for banking justice","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/may/06/the-biggest-scandal-ever-campaigner-hopes-for-banking-justice","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/may/06/the-biggest-scandal-ever-campaigner-hopes-for-banking-justice","fields":{"headline":"'The biggest scandal ever': fraud campaigner hopes for banking justice","bodyText":"In the 90s Denise Brailey, a single mother who was beginning to make her name as a tenacious consumer rights advocate, enrolled in a criminology course. To her surprise she was told by her professor that there was no white-collar crime in Australia so she would be looking into murders and other assorted wrongdoing. How things change. Over the past two weeks the banking royal commission has exposed the shocking extent of misconduct and possibly criminal behaviour by the financial sector in a system driven by greed. Sign up to receive the top stories every morning The revelations have stunned the nation but not Brailey. She has campaigned on behalf of the victims of misconduct for more than two decades, helping hundreds of people to claim redress in a variety of cases such as the finance brokers scandal, and the collapse of the finance companies Storm Financial and Westpoint. But the current royal commission, which has pointed towards the type of systematic fraud she has been denouncing for years, still represents a kind of crowning glory after years of hard slog for Brailey, who founded and single-handedly runs the Banking and Finance Consumers Support Association from a cottage in the Western Australian bush. “I’ve lobbied for two royal commissions and 23 parliamentary inquiries in my career but this is the biggest scandal I have ever uncovered,” she says of what she calls the “black box” fraud carried out by lenders. “I’m a little weary and a bit worn out. I’m 71 now and I’ve often wondered how long I can keep it up. But it’s something I started doing because people would come to me saying, ‘I’m about to lose my house and all my savings.’ “My parents understood decency and I think that’s where I get this from. I love digging into these kind of problems and and I love using my skills to help everyone else.” Brailey, who has completed three degrees to help in her fight, is nevertheless frustrated that the commission’s terms were drawn so narrowly by a government that tried from the beginning to do whatever it could to limit the impact of the inquiry on the big banks. “I feel vindicated by what’s been revealed at the commission so far, although it’s not what we really want,” Brailey says. “The terms have been written by the banks’ lawyers and steered by Asic. “We need a proper royal commission – this is not a proper royal commission. Kenneth Hayne is doing a good job, he has a high intellect and is very clever. Rowena Orr is also very impressive. But the problem is that he is only as good as the material put in front of him for political purposes.” The current commission is just scratching the surface, she says, and should be extended to examine the “mechanics” of the loan industry that have so enraged Brailey and given her the motivation to keep digging. In a 20-page submission to the royal commission, she details the experiences of borrowers who have come to her for help after being crushed at the hands of the mortgage industry. They are typically people towards the end of their working lives, she says, who have paid off their mortgage but are tempted by sales people into taking out a large interest-only loan to buy an investment property. (The lenders even have an acronym for them: Arip, which stands for asset-rich, income-poor.) These loans require low documentation and are often approved with little proper regard for how much the borrower can afford. In many cases seen by Brailey, the income is actually exaggerated by the lenders – so-called “liar loans”. In addition, borrowers often discover that the size of the loan is much bigger than they thought. “The banks devised a product, the interest-only loan. They wanted people to think it was a normal loan so they called it a low-doc loan because it only needed a low amount of documentation,” Brailey says. “They had to fudge the income to make unaffordable loans look affordable by use of a bank-engineered calculator, which could then be processed by a computer. “The banks were doing all this – the business development managers, the middle managers, the brokers. They were told they wouldn’t make any money if they didn’t do it. When they asked why they had to enter an income of $150,000 when it was $50,000, they were told that lawyers had checked it out and it was all fine. They were told that the inflated incomes on the loan application forms were projected incomes. The borrowers didn’t have the money but they were approved because it meant the brokers and other staff would meet lending targets and earn their percentage as a bonus.” This kind of scenario was brought shockingly to life in the royal commission, such as in the cases of Jacqueline McDowall and her husband. They were guided into selling their home with disastrous consequences, by a Westpac adviser who nevertheless made thousands of dollars in commission. “While all this evidence keeps coming out, you’ll never have trust or confidence in the banks ever again. It’s notable that all the people giving evidence are middle managers. “A proper royal commission would have to look at the mechanics of the loan business and how the chiefs at the top of the banking sector are acting as a cartel. You’ll never clear it up unless you do that.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/apr/24/meek-mill-sixers-bell-nba-playoffs","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-25T00:32:24Z","webTitle":"Meek Mill, choppered to arena after prison release, rings bell as Sixers win","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/24/meek-mill-sixers-bell-nba-playoffs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/apr/24/meek-mill-sixers-bell-nba-playoffs","fields":{"headline":"Meek Mill, choppered to arena after prison release, rings bell as Sixers win","bodyText":"Newly freed rapper Meek Mill, little more than one hour after his release from incarceration on a decade-old drug and guns conviction, rung the ceremonial bell amid a thunderous hometown ovation before the start of the Philadelphia 76ers’ series-clinching win over the Miami Heat in Philadelphia. Sixers co-owner Michael Rubin posted a picture of himself with Mill on Instagram Tuesday night with the caption “On the way to the sixers game let’s go”. The Philadelphia-born artist, whose given name is Robert Rihmeek Williams, was freed from the state prison at Camp Hill shortly before 7pm and took off in a helicopter from the facility outside the city. He visited privately with the Sixers in their locker room before emerging from the tunnel to rapturous applause shortly after 8pm at the sold-out 20,478-seat Wells Fargo Center for the ceremonial pre-game ringing of a Liberty Bell replica, a newer tradition in south Philadelphia reserved for local luminaries that’s been embraced during the team’s rapid – and long-anticipated – ascent from the NBA cellar. They used to pray for times like this, indeed. Wearing a Joel Embiid jersey, Mill took in the game from courtside beside Rubin, Pennsylvania governor Tom Wolf, Philadelphia Eagles owner Jeffrey Lurie and comedian and fellow Philly native Kevin Hart. The high-stakes playoff tilt would become a impromptu celebration of his body of work: Throughout the night Mill’s songs were played on the arena sound system during timeouts and breaks in play. The red-hot Sixers won 104-91 over the Heat to clinch the first-round series, four games to one. Embiid finished with 19 points and 12 rebounds while Ben Simmons had 14 points and 10 boards. Simmons called Mill’s presence “amazing”. “Just having someone that looks out for us, all of us here, it would just mean a lot for him to be back in Philly, in the city of Philadelphia with the fans, especially with a game like that tonight,” Simmons said. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court had directed a Philadelphia judge who had jailed the Maybach Music Group rapper to immediately issue an order freeing him on bail while he appeals drug and gun violations from a 2008 incident. Mill was sentenced in November to two to four years in prison for violating probation. While he was incarcerated, celebrities including Rubin and New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft, visited him and pledged their support. Several of the Sixers made visits, too, including Embiid, Simmons and Markelle Fultz. The case became a flashpoint for criticism of the criminal justice system’s treatment of African Americans, prompting outcry from high-profile critics including Kraft, Colin Kaepernick and Jay Z, who wrote an op-ed for the New York Times decrying Mill’s case as a high-profile example of an institution that “entraps and harasses hundreds of thousands of black people every day”. The Sixers, who finished an anemic 10-72 only two seasons ago, jumped to 52-30 this year and have now advanced out of the opening round with a win before a crowd only further electrified by the night’s improbable aperitif. The club has won 19 of its last 20 games dating back to mid-March including 16 straight to end the regular season, breaking a 68-year-old NBA record. Awaiting them in the best-of-seven Eastern Conference semi-finals will be either the Boston Celtics or Milwaukee Bucks. (The Celtics lead three games to two after Tuesday’s 92-87 win in Boston.) The 30-year-old rapper was already beloved in a city fiercely protective of its artistic own, but the affinity has taken on a talismanic hue in recent months since the Eagles adopted Mill’s Dreams and Nightmares as an unofficial anthem during their charmed run to the team’s first championship in 57 years, a worldview-altering milestone in a city that cares desperately about its local teams. Said Mill in a series of tweets following his release: “I’d like to thank God, my family, and all my public advocates for their love, support and encouragement during this difficult time. While the past five months have been a nightmare, the prayers, visits, calls, letters and rallies have helped me stay positive. “To the Philly District Attorney’s office, I’m grateful for your commitment to justice. I understand that many people of color across the country don’t have that luxury and I plan to use my platform to shine a light on those issues. “In the meantime, I plan to work closely with my legal team to overturn this unwarranted conviction and look forward to reuniting with my family and resuming my music career.” A spokesman for Philadelphia district attorney Larry Krasner said late Tuesday that the Supreme Court’s decision on Meek Mill’s release was consistent with the position taken by their office. Mill’s attorney, Joe Tacopina, thanked the high court. “Meek was unjustly convicted and should not have spent a single day in jail,” Tacopina said. Later Wednesday, the Golden State Warriors eliminated the San Antonio Spurs with a 99-91 win to clinch their Western Conference first-round series in five games."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/24/football-alex-oxlade-chamberlain-injury-world-cup-russia-liverpool-roma-champions-league","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-24T21:45:31Z","webTitle":"Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain’s World Cup dream in balance after knee injury","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/24/football-alex-oxlade-chamberlain-injury-world-cup-russia-liverpool-roma-champions-league","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/24/football-alex-oxlade-chamberlain-injury-world-cup-russia-liverpool-roma-champions-league","fields":{"headline":"Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain’s World Cup dream in balance after knee injury","bodyText":"Jürgen Klopp fears Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain’s fine debut season for Liverpool is over after the midfielder suffered a knee injury against Roma that threatens his involvement at the World Cup. Oxlade-Chamberlain was taken off on a stretcher in distress during the Champions League semi-final first leg victory following a 15th-minute challenge on Aleksandar Kolarov, his right knee appearing to give way as he tackled the former Manchester City defender. The extent of the England international’s injury will not be known until later in the week but the Liverpool manager said the club’s medical team did not expect him to play again this season. With only two months to go before the World Cup, Oxlade-Chamberlain’s loss is also likely to impact on Gareth Southgate’s plans for Russia. Klopp said: “The biggest blow for the mood in the dressing room is the injury of Oxlade-Chamberlain, so conceding two goals is not what we want 100 per cent but we can deal with that.” Asked whether he expected the player’s season to be over, the Liverpool manager replied: “Yes, that is how it is unfortunately. We don’t know yet but when all the medical department are concerned without a scan then you know it doesn’t look good. The season is not that long any more. “I am a very positive person and hope it only feels bad but the reason I am not flying mood-wise tonight is because we lost a fantastic player. I am not in the mood to talk about fantastic things. Since I have been here Liverpool has always had to take the more difficult way but in the end Liverpool have always succeeded.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/ng-interactive/2018/apr/26/david-squires-on-an-unpredictable-a-league-finals-series","type":"interactive","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-25T18:00:04Z","webTitle":"David Squires on ... an unpredictable A-League finals series","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2018/apr/26/david-squires-on-an-unpredictable-a-league-finals-series","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/ng-interactive/2018/apr/26/david-squires-on-an-unpredictable-a-league-finals-series","fields":{"headline":"David Squires on ... an unpredictable A-League finals series","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"business/live/2018/apr/25/tsb-online-banking-mobile-app-paul-pester-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-26T00:12:12Z","webTitle":"TSB crisis: customers count cost of IT meltdown as problems continue - as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2018/apr/25/tsb-online-banking-mobile-app-paul-pester-business-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2018/apr/25/tsb-online-banking-mobile-app-paul-pester-business-live","fields":{"headline":"TSB crisis: customers count cost of IT meltdown as problems continue - as it happened","bodyText":"And finally, here’s our latest news story on the TSB IT crisis: In theory, TSB customers have another hour to call the bank for help before customer services closes for the day, at 11pm. In practice, there’s a long queue, and no certainty of getting through eventually.... Radio producer Amanda Redman is just one of many customers to report that TSB is giving her inaccurate information when she logs in: This whole IT migration fiasco is a setback for TSB’s attempts to challenge Britain’s larger banks, says the Financial Times tonight. The FT adds: A person briefed on the TSB board’s plans insisted the platform had not been rushed out, and said questions over who was responsible would have to wait until the system was running smoothly for all its customers: “Given the testing they didn’t think this was where they were going to end up — they never would have pushed the button otherwise,” the person said. “It’s getting a bit better but there’s still some way to go . . . we’ve got to get to a point where things are stable, the backlogs are cleared, and then we can start an inquest.” TSB is facing more criticism from MPs tonight, over its failure to migrate smoothly onto a new IT system. Conservative MP Kevin Hollinrake told the Daily Telegraph: It doesn’t seem sensible that TSB took a big bang approach to this switch. This is simply not acceptable. If they’re going to do an upgrade they should have been prepared and have contingencies in place. This is like when KFC ran out of chicken.” And still they come.... TSB customers are still reporting a litany of problems tonight: TSB has now revealed that its internet banking service is only running at 50% capacity. It admits that half of the customers who try to get onto its internet banking system are still facing issues - despite CEO Paul Pester announcing 16 hours ago that things were up and running. TSB also says its mobile app is now operating at 90% capacity, meaning one in 10 users are suffering problems. Pester also conceded that customers still aren’t getting a good enough experience. In a curious statement - he says that ‘everything is working’, but not in a way that customers can see (!!). The challenge we are facing at the moment is that while we know everything is working, one of the main ways that our customers see everything is working – through our internet banking and mobile app – isn’t functioning as well as it should be, and for this I’m truly sorry,” he added. “I can appreciate how frustrating this must be for our customers.” Penny Simpson has got back in touch, to report that she still can’t log into TSB’s internet banking service. She adds: Can we not dispel the myth that the online system is working, because if you have to spend hours everyday attempting to get in, then it isn’t working. TBS insists that things are running smoothly for the ‘vast majority’ of customers. Some, though, are still experiencing problems - such as Andy Sharps of Shropshire. He says TSB’s site crashed this afternoon as he tried to withdraw his money: TBS say they’re ‘working around the clock’ to put things right: TSB also warns that some customers are experiencing a delay in receiving text alerts, or may not receive them at all. It’s also taking longer than usual to isssue replacement debit and credit cards. Both these problems might not be fixed until the end of April. Despite CEO Paul Pester claiming that TSB’s internet banking is “Up and running”, some services are still in the “down and out” category. According to TSB’s service status page, there are still several problems. For example, internet and mobile banking customers still can’t view their mortgages online (which explains why some people found their loans had vanished this morning) Business banking customers are seeing errors when they try to reset their log-in details, and some also can’t see their standing orders in their banking app. Neil De Silva, a DJ and part-time model from Glasgow was unable to pay for additional luggage because he couldn’t get his TSB card to work, leaving him stranded in Thailand: “I ended up missing my flight to Singapore after my card was declined. Things then went from bad to worse as I couldn’t log into my bank account to transfer some savings to pay for a new flight.” Stacey and Louie Brown, who have recently been married in Thailand, had to borrow money from weddings guests to cover their costs. “My husband’s card was blocked but luckily we had friends and family with us who we borrowed from to pay for food and accommodation. We would have been sleeping on the beach otherwise,” says 31-year-old Stacey from Dorset, adding: “We’ve been trying to sign up to a divemaster course as part of our honeymoon, but now the internet banking is down we can’t transfer any money. We’re now living on water and toasties and down to our last £40. Hopefully we will have access to our money again soon.” This is similar to the case of Matt, covered earlier in the blog. TSB’s online banking system still looks like a lottery, 11 hours after CEO Paul Pester tweeted that it was working again. Some customers, such as PA Liza Young, have managed to overcome its problems.... ..but others, such as historian Guy Walters, are still frustrated. Breaking away from TSB briefly, UK housebuilder Persimmon is being given a bloody nose by shareholders. Investors at its AGM are angry at “totally and utterly unjustifiable” multi-million bonuses paid to its chief executive and senior managers, including a £75m award for CEO Jeff Fairburn. Around 64% of shareholders refused to back the package - either by abstaining or voting against it. Euan Stirling, head of stewardship at Aberdeen Standard Investments, one of Persimmon’s biggest shareholders with a 2.3% stake, said the “enormous sums” due to Fairburn and other senior managers were “grossly excessive” and have “tarnished” the housebuilder’s name. Stirling said that Fairburn’s offer to reduce his bonus from his legally entitled £110m to £75m “does not even get close to acceptable”. Stirling declared: “The important point I referred to is that regardless of any moral or societal duties, company directors have a legal responsibility to act in the best long-term interests of the company that employs them Today’s remuneration results suggest that the executive directors at Persimmon have lost sight of that because the long-term success of the company is being endangered by the reputational damage associated with grossly excessive pay!” The Church of England has also weighed Persimmon in the balance, and found it wanting: The owner of the UK’s first and oldest luxury leather lingerie brand is also caught up in the TSB IT crisis. Jules Hawkins, 54, who owns Bristol-based Lux Tenebrae, has been unable to pay her staff through her TSB accounts. That echoes the problems reported earlier this morning (here and here) Jules tells us: “I’m going to have to pay them out of my First Direct personal account, which will look to HMRC like I’m paying myself a huge amount of money when I eventually manage to reimburse myself. My staff don’t have TSB accounts so why should they have to bear the brunt of this mess by going overdrawn and having to wait to claim back? It’s the end of the month and they have rent and bills to pay. Also, are my automated payments still going out? Did I just pay my tax? Don’t even get me started on trying to input my end of year tax return.” Matt from South Wales is on holiday in the Canary Islands and has been unable to pay for goods and services thanks to TSB’s botched IT migration: “I arrived on Saturday for a five night break and this has totally ruined my holiday. My card was declined in a restaurant I went to and I had to walk 50 mins back to my hotel as I didn’t have enough money to pay for a taxi. I tried to contact TSB via email and on the phone but after waiting for 40 mins I couldn’t wait any longer. I feel for everyone that’s having these problems and I can’t wait to get home to speak to someone from in person. They are not keeping their customers updated and they will lose a lot of customers due to this terrible service. How can we trust them after this?” Louise (not her real name) is a sole trader who holds both a business and current account with TSB: “The whole thing is a fiasco. I knew that the site would be down as TSB said they were ‘upgrading’ the business banking and instead of the trusty card reader that I’ve been using for years they would be introducing a system which uses an app instead. “Although I’m a web designer and tech savvy I didn’t want to install the app for various reasons (size, privacy, just don’t want it on my phone!) but did so reluctantly. The amount of permissions the app wanted was outrageous so I emailed them to say that I wasn’t happy and that from 25 May when GDPR comes into force I’d be contacting them every day to delete the unnecessary data that they were collecting via the app. “A very rapid response suggested that I order one of their basic devices instead, which I did. Credit where credit is due, it arrived promptly yesterday, just in time for the new system to be live. Except of course it’s not live. The system is still down. Also the basic device seems incapable of doing anything at all. This is one of those ‘upgrades’ that seems completely futile and designed to annoy customers.” A stream of TSB customers are reporting that they can’t get their TSB internet passwords to work. Penny Simpson tells me that she has been frozen out of her account, because the bank’s new IT system isn’t recognising customers’ existing passwords and memorable information. She says she’s not alone: I have spoken to more than a dozen people and nobody has managed to get through. Have we really gone through all this pain to install a system that can’t cope with 1.9m customers? Penny was eventually forced to drive eight miles to her nearest branch, Gillingham in Dorset. Staff looked like they’d “been in an earthquake”, she says. To take money out they have to use handwritten slips like the old credit cards. I wanted to know my balance which, after two or three attempts they were able to access. My direct debits have been going out - what a pity Paul Pester couldn’t have reassured customers that despite the problems, standing orders etc were being processed. However, I was told that this branch will be closing in May. My next nearest branch will be 26 miles away. Totally unacceptable.... I will move banks as soon as the system is running again. Another TSB customer, Louise Pennington, found herself at the back of a long queue: Other TSB customers are also reporting similar problems when they try to log on: Another dissatisfied customer: Clean Sheet, a charity that helps former offenders to find work, can’t log into its TSB account to pay staff -- another sign that the IT meltdown isn’t fully fixed yet. Guardian readers have been in touch about how they’ve been affected by the TSB IT failures. Angela from Kent is concerned about her upcoming holiday: “We are going away on Saturday and can’t transfer money from our savings to buy holiday clothes and travel money. We didn’t bother trying to contact TSB as their phone call waiting time is over an hour!” Mark, 54 from Birmingham was on hold for three hours after seeing his account was showing in US dollars: “My account is showing £40k in arrears against my mortgage and the whole account shows in dollars. I can live with all of that but yesterday my son couldn’t eat as I couldn’t transfer funds to his Parent Pay account. Everybody can have issues but the true measure is how you rectify them. TSB’s contingency has been very poorly thought out and will undoubtedly cost them long-term loyal customers.” Jos is on a low income, with no credit cards or savings accounts and unable to use his debit card: “I have £3.14 in my pocket, my wife is disabled and we can’t shop for food. I’ve been able to see my account details twice on the app since Sunday - both times the balance was wrong with credits and debits to the account missing. I have been particularly infuriated by TSB’s claims of “intermittent” problems which is entirely untrue.” You can get in touch with your experiences, here. TSB’s IT chaos is threatening to prevent some small businesses from paying their staff. Scottish domestic cleaning service Good Fairy Clean couldn’t access its account this morning, which is very problematic as it has wages to pay. This accountancy firm also suffered problems: Here’s Press Association’s take: TSB is continuing to limit access to its mobile banking app and online service after days of delays that saw customers unable to use their accounts. Chief executive Paul Pester announced on Twitter on Wednesday morning that the services had been restored and thanked customers, many of whom had been left furious by the outage, for their “patience and bearing with us”. However a spokeswoman said the bank was limiting the number of customers to ensure those able to access the app received a normal service. She recommended customers continue to try to open the app, but to close it down and restart if they encounter problems. Those continuing to experience issues should contact TSB’s telephone banking service, she said.

Your responses will only be seen by the Guardian and we’ll feature some of your responses in our reporting. More reports of vanishing mortgages: Five hours after CEO Paul Pester claimed things were ‘up and running’, the complaints are still rolling in: Chris Hodgson, director of education technology provider @discoverelearn, has managed to get into his TSB account....only to hit problems making a payment: TSB’s services may be ‘up’ at last, but - at least for some users - they are shuffling rather than running. That’s because TSB are restricting the number of customers who can get online at once, in an attempt to avoid being overwhelmed by demand. So, many customers are still being blocked from internet banking, and told to ‘keep trying’.... At least two TSB customers have found that their mortgages have vanished this morning. Scores of TSB users are reporting problems getting into their accounts this morning, suggesting things aren’t as ‘up and running’ as the company claims. Translater Adam Ramsey was thwarted when he tried to get online: Actor Annabel Taylor has similar problems: And they’re not alone either... Good morning. After days of disruption, is the UK bank TSB finally getting to grips with its IT chaos? Staff at the bank have been working through the night, after its botched technology migration left around 2 million customers unable to access their money online since Friday. TSB had reassured customers that services should have restored yesterday afternoon, once it had tackled the blunders that meant things weren’t working properly when the migration officially ended on Sunday night. Instead, it took until 3.40 this morning until CEO Paul Pester could declare that services were “up and running”, and thank customers for their “patience and bearing with us”. Mission accomplished? Perhaps not. Some TSB users are already reporting that they can’t get into their accounts, as the bank struggles to cope with the pent-up demand. TSB really needs to address these concerns quickly. The Daily Mail has given the bank a rollicking this morning, and there are already suggestions that Pester should lose his bonus over the fiasco. Also coming up today European stock markets are expected to drop, following a bloody day on Wall Street yesterday. In the City, Lloyds Banking Group is reporting results – and Whitbread is announcing the spin-off of its Costa Coffee chain."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/apr/25/americas-best-scientists-stood-up-to-the-trump-administration","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-25T10:00:45Z","webTitle":"America's best scientists stood up to the Trump administration | John Abraham","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/apr/25/americas-best-scientists-stood-up-to-the-trump-administration","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/apr/25/americas-best-scientists-stood-up-to-the-trump-administration","fields":{"headline":"America's best scientists stood up to the Trump administration","bodyText":"Anyone who has read this column over the past five years knows that I tend to be unfettered in my criticism of people who lie and distort climate science to further their political ideologies. At the same time, I believe that the majority of climate sceptics are not willfully wishing to damage this precious Earth that we call home. I believe that there are common areas we can all agree on to take meaningful action to protect the Earth’s environment and build a new energy future; even for people who do not understand climate change or climate science. But with the election of Donald Trump and his ushering in people who are openly hostile to the planet and future generations, my position has been strained (to say the least). We have had more than a year to observe President Trump’s efforts to roll back Obama-era regulations on pollution from coal plants, weaken pollution standards for motor vehicles, become the only country in the world to reject the Paris climate accord, and gut our climate science budget so that we become blind to what is actually happening. We have to believe Trump when he says that he thinks climate science is a hoax and we have to expect he will act according to this belief. Under Trump, the USA has become a pariah nation. It hurts me to say this, because I love the USA and what it stands for. But regarding the environment, we are the worst of the worst. Some people will claim I am “unpatriotic” or “unAmerican” to criticize my country. My response is, I am honest. A patriot is someone who loves their country and wants their country to meet the ideals that are the foundation of that nation. Patriotic means you want your country to be better; you want your country to make a positive impact. I believe that turning a blind eye to your country’s faults is a most deeply unpatriotic act. I want my country to excel, I want my country to lead, I want my country to be a shining light on a hill. If my country fails or falters in that endeavor, I will work tirelessly to correct our path. That, in my mind is patriotism. President Trump has installed radical science deniers in his administration to obstruct climate science research, to stop development in clean and renewable energy (the economic growth engine of the future), and to attack scientists for doing their jobs. Among Trump’s most harmful acts was to appoint Scott Pruitt to head the EPA. Scott Pruitt does not understand even basic climate science, and he doesn’t comprehend that climate change will be bad for human society. But it isn’t just Trump and Pruitt that are a problem. Everyone in the Trump administration seems hell-bent on damaging the planet. Recently, climate change denier Jim Bridenstine was confirmed by Senate Republicans to lead Nasa – one of the two most important climate science organizations in the country. Trump has brought with him a swamp filled with anti-science staff whose goal is to handicap the US and permanently remove us from any leadership role in the world. To be clear, Trump, Pruitt, the entire administration, and those who support him will inherit a terrible legacy that we will not forget. These people will be known for willfully trying to destroy the planet that we rely on for health and prosperity. Despite the attacks from the Trump/Pruitt Administration, some scientists have begun to speak out. This speaking out takes courage. I have the luxury of being unbridled in my work. My livelihood does not depend on federal research grants; I have no boss in Washington DC that can threaten me; Scott Pruitt cannot attack me; nor can President Trump. For a scientist like me, speaking out is low-risk. But many of my colleagues are not so fortunate. Many of my colleagues, who have dedicated their lives to understanding the Earth’s environment, are employed by Washington. That is, they are able to carry out research by obtaining federal grants. These grants pay for their instruments (satellites, sea level gauges, weather balloons, supercomputers, etc.), their offices, salaries, and so forth. And when these scientists speak out, it is an act of courage and selflessness. This week, many of these scientists have spoken out. In an open letter, over 600 scientists from the prestigious National Academy of Sciences (America’s best scientists) wrote the following: In September 2016, over 375 members of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences (NAS) signed an Open Letter calling attention to the dangers of human-induced climate change. The letter warned that U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Accord would have negative consequences for the world’s climate system and for U.S. leadership and credibility. In the intervening 15 months, these negative consequences have become more obvious. Human-caused climate disruption is leading to suffering and economic loss. Suffering and loss are not future hypotheticals. They are happening now. Despite these serious negative consequences, the present Administration has fulfilled its threat to initiate U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Accord. The United States is the only nation in the world that has taken this action. The decision to withdraw is symptomatic of a larger problem: The Trump Administration’s denigration of scientific expertise and harassment of scientists. The dismissal of scientific evidence in policy formulation has affected wide areas of the social, biological, environmental and physical sciences. It has been particularly egregious in climate science. A recent instance of this is the intention of the Administration to assemble a “Red Team/Blue Team” to re-litigate all aspects of climate science. Such an exercise seeks to foster the erroneous impression of deep uncertainty concerning the reality and seriousness of anthropogenically driven climate change. Scientific evidence and research should be an important component of policymaking. We therefore call on the Federal Government to maintain scientific content on publicly accessible websites, to appoint qualified personnel to positions requiring scientific expertise, to cease censorship and intimidation of Government scientists, and to reverse the decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris Accord. My country has withdrawn from the most significant multinational agreement to stop climate change, has attacked scientists funding and censored scientists and threatened them to stay quiet, and has actively enacted measures to encourage pollution both in the US and worldwide. This is not the USA I know in my heart. This is not the world leader I believe my country to be. This is a pariah nation led by a small number of people who are getting rich at the expense of public and environmental health. For those who support these policies – shame. There is no ethical or moral justification to value polluters’ profits more than the health of the planet and the inheritance of future generations. That’s just greed, plain and simple. For those who voted for Trump and who vote for other deniers of climate change, you can no longer say “I just didn’t know.” Now is the time to acknowledge you were lied to. It is never too late to change course. But it is untenable to say you care about future generations yet still support politicians and policies that lead to future destruction. You have to choose one or the other; there is no middle ground, and we need to quit pretending there is."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/apr/25/arizona-special-election-debbie-lesko-holds-on-to-seat-for-republicans","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-25T17:12:49Z","webTitle":"Arizona special election: Republicans hold on but Democrats upbeat for midterms","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/apr/25/arizona-special-election-debbie-lesko-holds-on-to-seat-for-republicans","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/apr/25/arizona-special-election-debbie-lesko-holds-on-to-seat-for-republicans","fields":{"headline":"Arizona special election: Republicans hold on but Democrats upbeat for midterms","bodyText":"Republicans managed to hold on to a deeply conservative Arizona congressional seat on Tuesday night in a special election race that was far closer than expected. The Associated Press called the race for Republican Debbie Lesko shortly after 8pm local time, when the results from the first batch of early votes showed that she had an insurmountable lead over her Democratic opponent, Hiral Tiperneni. Lesko, a former state senator, led Tiperneni, a doctor and political newcomer, by a margin of 52.6% to 47.4% in the race for a Phoenix-area seat that Donald Trump had won by over 20 points. The narrow margin is unlikely to calm Republican nerves before the midterm election cycle when the president’s party historically loses seats in Congress. Mike Noble, a Republican pollster in Arizona, said a race in a solidly conservative district, with older voters who are less likely to cross party lines, should not have been anywhere close to as tight as it was. “Republicans should not be hitting the panic button. They should be slamming it,” he said. A Democrat in the state called it the “perfect scenario” for the party. And the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee said the result should “terrify” vulnerable Republicans running for re-election. “These narrow results in Arizona’s eighth district spell serious trouble for the Republican majority, particularly because it proves there is no place in the country where energized, organized Democrats are not ready to compete,” a DCCC spokesperson, Jacob Peters, said in a statement. That concern was nowhere to be found at Lesko’s victory party in Glendale on Tuesday night. Cheers rang out as she clinked champagne glasses with the former Arizona hardline Republican governor Jan Brewer. “Here’s to success! Here’s to Republicans winning this year!” she said. Tiperneni, meanwhile, waited until most of the ballots were counted on Wednesday morning before conceding the race. “Now that nearly all of the votes have been counted, we know that the special election goes to our opponent,” Tiperneni said. “I congratulate Debbie Lesko on a hard-fought campaign, and wish her good luck in Congress.” The seat came open in December when conservative lawmaker Trent Franks resigned over reports he offered to pay a female staffer $5m in exchange for carrying his child. Lesko will serve the remainder of his two-year term and seek re-election this fall. The race was being watched as a potential test of Trump’s popularity after surprising Democratic special election victories in Republican strongholds like Pennsylvania and Alabama. And the strong performance by the Democrat in a district where the party did not even field a challenger in the last two elections marked yet another troubling sign for the Republican party ahead of the 2018 midterm elections. On Wednesday morning, Trump congratulated Lesko on her victory and chided the press for its coverage of the race. “Congratulations to Republican Debbie Lesko on her big win in the Special Election for Arizona House seat. Debbie will do a Great Job! Press is so silent,” he said on Twitter. The district, located in the western suburbs of Phoenix, is known for its Sun City retirement community and for permitting golf carts to drive on the streets. The constituency is home to a sizable senior population that helped keep the hardline former sheriff Joe Arpaio in office for more than two decades. National GOP groups collectively spent nearly $1m to defend the reliably conservative seat. National Democrats, notably, stayed out of the race. After a loss in Arizona’s eight congressional district, Democrats still must win 23 seats to take back the House of Representatives. Tiperneni, who was part of the wave of Democratic women inspired to run for office since Trump was elected, entered the race to challenge Franks. After he resigned, Democrats rallied around her campaign. She intends to challenge Lesko again for the seat in November."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/apr/25/shire-board-recommends-46bn-takeover-by-japanese-drugmaker-takeda","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-25T22:12:23Z","webTitle":"Shire board recommends £46bn takeover by Japanese drugmaker Takeda","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/25/shire-board-recommends-46bn-takeover-by-japanese-drugmaker-takeda","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/apr/25/shire-board-recommends-46bn-takeover-by-japanese-drugmaker-takeda","fields":{"headline":"Shire board recommends £46bn takeover by Japanese drugmaker Takeda","bodyText":"The UK-listed drugmaker Shire, known for its ADHD hyperactivity drug Adderall, has recommended a £46bn takeover deal by Japan’s biggest pharma company, Takeda. If approved by investors, it would be one of the biggest pharmaceuticals deals ever, ranking behind Pfizer’s $112bn takeover of Warner Lambert in 2000. The stock and cash offer values Shire at £49 a share, about £5 more than Takeda’s initial bid. After rebuffing several offers, the Shire board said “it would be willing to recommend the revised proposal to Shire shareholders subject to satisfactory resolution of the other terms of the possible offer, including completion of reciprocal due diligence by Shire on Takeda”. The FTSE 100 company set a new deadline of 8 May for the negotiations to be concluded, although this could be extended further. Shire shareholders would own about half of the combined company, whose shares would be listed in Japan and the US. Atsushi Seki, pharma analyst at UBS, said: “With Shire board’s willingness to recommend, Shire’s acquisition becomes realistic. That said, to complete the acquisition, there are still several hurdles, including no other bidder(s) emerging and a special resolution at a shareholder meeting (two-thirds supportive vote required), and the long journey to completion now begins.” Britain’s biggest drugmaker GSK ruled itself out of bidding on Wednesday. The US company Allergan, which makes Botox, dropped out of the running earlier this month. Shire shares in London closed down 2.8% to £38.20, well below the offer price, suggesting scepticism in the market about the deal. Takeda shares tumbled more than 7% on the Tokyo stock exchange, reflecting fears that a deal of this size could put too much pressure on the Japanese firm’s finances. A deal would give Takeda Shire’s lucrative rare diseases portfolio and propel the Japanese firm, led by Frenchman Christophe Weber, into the top ranks of global drugmakers. Shire, founded above a shop in Basingstoke, Hampshire, in 1986, is best known for its ADHD drug Adderall but its focus in recent years has been on rare diseases. The company is based in Dublin for tax purposes but run from Boston. It has scaled back its presence in the UK and most of its operations are in the US."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/25/there-is-more-than-one-christian-lesson-for-war-remembrance","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-25T00:49:24Z","webTitle":"There is more than one Christian lesson for war remembrance | Geoff Thompson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/25/there-is-more-than-one-christian-lesson-for-war-remembrance","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/25/there-is-more-than-one-christian-lesson-for-war-remembrance","fields":{"headline":"There is more than one Christian lesson for war remembrance","bodyText":"Today Australians will gather at war memorials scattered across the nation’s cities and towns. They will possibly hear a particular set of words which have long been woven into Anzac Day ceremonies. If they look around, they might also see the same words engraved on the surrounding monuments: “Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.” They sound innocuous. But are they? The last time I heard them at an Anzac Day service, they were the impassioned rhetorical high point of a Dawn Service at the Melbourne Shrine. Spoken on such occasions they convey dignity and gravitas; they powerfully evoke the deep human fascination with sacrifice; they resonate deeply with the patriotism linked with the remembrance of war and its tragic costs. Anyone aged under 40 may well have no idea of the source of these words. The text is from the New Testament; to be precise: the Gospel of John Chapter 15 verse 13. “Greater love hath no man ...” are, in fact, words attributed to Jesus. For the record, however, they’ve got nothing whatsoever to do with war. But in earlier eras when Jesus could be invoked as a symbol of authority these words entered our culture’s patriotic and military vocabulary. They offered a comforting link between the suffering of the culture’s primary religious figure and that of our lost soldiers. The link worked at all sorts of cultural, psychological and social levels. In the very different context of the Gospel narrative, however, the only death on the horizon was Jesus’ own. Anticipating it, he was instructing his disciples about how they should understand him and what he was doing. His point? He is not to them as master to slave. Although entitled to claim the rights of a master over his followers, he chose not to. The text is about Jesus’ humility and how it should shape the community of his followers. His words were not intended as succour to any warrior. But, centuries later, wrenched from that context, Jesus’ words were easily used to legitimate certain cultural collusions. The link between his words and the death of the nation’s soldiers was used, consciously or not, as a strategy for religious endorsement of the nation’s war effort. “Greater love hath no man …” could easily be a surrogate for “God, Queen and Country”. Sign up to receive the latest Australian opinion pieces every weekday That patriotic rallying cry would fall flat today, and rightly so. Do Jesus’ teachings, then, have any relevance to today’s remembrance of our war dead? Certainly, Christian faith has much to say to those who grieve, mourn, and bear the deep scars of war-time loss: words of lament, compassion and hope. But in the face of the terrible loss of life that war produces, Christian faith also protests, not least to God, that lives are lost in this way and on this scale. There are some other words of Jesus which might speak into the war-torn character of every age. In what has come to be known as his Sermon on the Mount, Jesus exhorts his followers to love their enemies. Critics argue that while this might have some small-scale application, it is completely impractical at the geopolitical level. Then there are others who just reject it outright. Christopher Hitchens, for instance, was quite blunt: “Go love your own enemies, don’t be loving mine. My enemies are the theocratic fascists; I don’t love them, I want to destroy them.” But notwithstanding such criticisms, there is yet another dimension to the Christian faith which just might be relevant to a nation’s war memories and the legitimate honouring of its war dead. It’s the insight of the apostle Paul – that larger-than-life, persecutor-turned-missionary, who generated so much early Christian theology. Centuries later, Martin Luther King and Nelson Mandela (among others) would draw on this insight to great effect. What was it? Christianity calls for reconciliation between enemies. For Paul, the enmity at issue was between God and humans – a notion jarring to modern ears, but not to his own contemporaries. What would have jarred for his contemporaries was his novel argument that God was the peacemaker. And here’s the twist. Drawing on his understanding of Jesus, Paul inverted the common idea that peace would come through humans cringingly appeasing an angry deity. In Paul’s theology, it is God who makes the declaration of peace. God is the friend-maker. Enmity is over and friendship begins. This is the deep Christian meaning of reconciliation. Understanding reconciliation in this way goes beyond loving enemies. It’s the “what’s next?” step. Reconciliation seeks abiding friendships. If the wells of Christianity are to be tapped this Anzac Day, it could be to encourage, support and celebrate the friendships between the peoples of Australia and Turkey (and other former enemies from other wars). Christians themselves might well learn from the ongoing relationships that have, against all odds, developed between our two countries. For Christian faith, enemies need not only to be loved, but to be lived with. If soldiers and politicians do choose to invoke Christianity this Anzac Day, it would be refreshing if they dropped, “Greater love …” and drew instead on its deepest message: the “next-step” message of reconciliation.

Police and paramedics were called to the Albert pub, next to the Kop end of Liverpool’s Anfield stadium, shortly before the first leg match kicked off, where they found the victim, believed to be a 53-year-old man from Ireland, who had suffered a head injury. Merseyside police said the men arrested were aged 25 and 26 and one of them was apprehended inside the ground. They were among nine men, aged between 20 and 43 years, arrested on suspicion of various offences, including affray, actual bodily harm and possession of offensive weapons, among others. Officers appealed for witnesses of the incident in which the 53-year-old was injured to come forward. They said forensic examination had been carried out at the scene and CCTV footage from the area would be reviewed. DI Paul Speight said police believed the victim was in Liverpool with his brother for the match. “Witnesses report that the victim was hit with a belt and then fell to the ground. Paramedics treated him at the scene and he was taken by ambulance to Walton Neurological Centre, where he is being treated for a head injury. His condition is currently described as critical and his next of kin have been informed. “The place where this incident occurred is right by the ground and was heaving with fans making their way to the game. I would appeal to anyone who has any information, or mobile phone footage of the incident to contact us urgently, as information they have could be vital to our investigation.” Such video footage does appear to exist, with clips posted to Twitter showing clashes between supporters with ambulances in attendance, and suggestions that a group of Roma fans had used belts as weapons. In a statement released on Tuesday night, Liverpool FC said it was “shocked and appalled” by the incident. “Our thoughts, in the first instance, are with the victim and his family at this very traumatic time. We will be offering them our full support. The club has been liaising with the emergency services since the incident occurred and will continue to do so.” There was an increased police presence around the stadium after Manchester City’s team bus had its windows smashed by bottles and cans prior to the quarter-final earlier this month. The team arrivals passed with no repeat of that trouble, but there were plenty of red flares – despite specific requests from the authorities not to bring pyrotechnics. Liverpool fans were even pictured waving flares from the roof of a police van, though with no apparent aggression. Officers said they were investigating whether any offences had been committed. Before the match, Ch Supt Dave Charnock of Merseyside police had appealed for calm, saying: “We know that this will be a busy operation and we hope that fans attending the match will act as ambassadors for their clubs and enjoy what I am sure will be a good game.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/apr/25/robert-doyle-second-sexual-harassment-investigation-inconclusive","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-25T00:59:49Z","webTitle":"Robert Doyle: second sexual harassment investigation 'inconclusive'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/apr/25/robert-doyle-second-sexual-harassment-investigation-inconclusive","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/apr/25/robert-doyle-second-sexual-harassment-investigation-inconclusive","fields":{"headline":"Robert Doyle: second sexual harassment investigation 'inconclusive'","bodyText":"A second investigation into allegations of sexual harassment by the former Melbourne lord mayor Robert Doyle failed to make any conclusive findings because Doyle was too unwell to respond to questions. The investigation concerned allegations made against Doyle in his role as the chairman of Melbourne Health, which were made public after he had stepped aside from his position as lord mayor following sexual harassment allegations from two female councillors. He resigned from both positions in February and has repeatedly denied all claims of sexual harassment made against him. Victorian barrister Charles Scerri QC was appointed by the Victorian government in January to investigate an allegation that Doyle had touched a woman’s inner thigh and made inappropriate comments at a Melbourne Health Awards ceremony in 2016. According to a summary of Scerri’s report, released on Tuesday, he found that he “has no reason to doubt, and at present does not doubt, the veracity of the complainant”. “However, because of ill health, Mr Doyle has been unable to respond to the allegations,” the summary says. “In the absence of any response from Mr Doyle, Mr Scerri is not able to reach, and has not reached, any conclusions about the allegations.” Doyle’s lawyer, Nick Ruskin, reiterated his client’s ill health. • Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon “Robert has not been well enough to participate in the Melbourne Health investigation and has received no material from the investigator regarding the allegations,” Ruskin said. Scerri found that Melbourne Health responded appropriately to the allegations but raised two areas of concern. He said that while the organisation had appropriate policies and procedures in place for reporting sexual harassment, they were not known by the complainant and there was uncertainty around how a complaint that concerned the chairman of the board should be managed. Melbourne Health said it welcomed Scerri’s findings and had updated its sexual harassment policies to include handling complaints against board members. “Melbourne Health is united against sexual harassment, assault or discrimination of any sort,” it said in a statement. The Victorian health minister, Jill Hennessy, announced a $400,000 trial of independent facilitators in Victorian hospitals to help staff speak out about inappropriate behaviour and sexual harassment, and navigate the complaints process. “These independent facilitators will give staff confidence to stand up and speak up against unacceptable behaviours without fear of reprisal,” she said. Last month an investigation into allegations of misconduct at the City of Melbourne concluded that Doyle had sexually harassed fellow councillors Tessa Sullivan and Cathy Oke and made council an unsafe workplace for them. A 10-page summary of the 100-page report said the finding was made despite Doyle’s strong denial of engaging in inappropriate conduct. The full report has not been made public. A byelection for the lord mayor’s role is being conducted by postal vote and will conclude on 12 May."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/may/03/berlusconi-biopic-loro-is-a-tender-look-at-the-weaknesses-of-an-old-man-paolo-sorrentino","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-03T08:59:26Z","webTitle":"Berlusconi biopic Loro is 'a tender look at the weaknesses of an old man'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/may/03/berlusconi-biopic-loro-is-a-tender-look-at-the-weaknesses-of-an-old-man-paolo-sorrentino","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/may/03/berlusconi-biopic-loro-is-a-tender-look-at-the-weaknesses-of-an-old-man-paolo-sorrentino","fields":{"headline":"Berlusconi biopic Loro is 'a tender look at the weaknesses of an old man'","bodyText":"Steamy sex, exotic dancers, cocaine sniffing and raucous poolside parties – the life and times of Italy’s scandal-tainted former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi would appear to be natural material for a biopic. Oscar-winning director Paolo Sorrentino has taken up the challenge, and the first instalment of his two-part film Loro (Them) was released in Italian cinemas on 24 April. The second part is due on 10 May. Describing the inspiration behind Loro at last year’s Cannes film festival, Sorrentino said he wanted to “make a film about Italians … Berlusconi is the archetype of ‘Italianness’ and through him I can tell the Italians’ story.” But if Loro’s first half is anything to go by, the film is mostly an account of the sordid, power-hungry personalities who orbited around the billionaire. Berlusconi is played by Toni Servillo, a long-term collaborator who was also cast as the playboy protagonist in Sorrentino’s 2014 Academy award-winning film The Great Beauty, only makes an appearance towards the end of Loro 1. Sorrentino clarified his earlier comments at a press conference following a screening of Loro 2 in Rome on 2 May. “The film is a take on power and characteristics during the 2006 to 2010 period,” he said. “In part, it is about characteristics that Italians have, but it’s not a film about Italians.” What Italians will recognise is an era of politics the majority are embarrassed by and people they would rather forget. The central character in Loro 1 is a pimp from southern Italy called Sergio Morra, played by Riccardo Scamarcio, who longs to get close to Berlusconi. Italians will likely compare the character with Gianpaolo Tarantini, a businessman who was convicted in 2015 of procuring prostitutes for Berlusconi’s parties in the hope of winning lucrative public contracts. Loro covers the period between 2006, when Berlusconi’s second term as prime minister came to an end, and 2010, two years after he began his third stint (and a year before he was forced to resign amid an acute debt crisis). Sorrentino steers clear of politics in the film, mainly alluding to it as part of Berlusconi’s rampant ambition, which is summed up neatly when his character is asked: “What did you expect: to be the richest man in the country, become prime minister and be madly loved by everyone too?” He replies: “Yes, that’s exactly what I expected.” Loro 2 sees Sorrentino endeavour to understand the complex personality and emotions of Berlusconi during a tumultuous period in his career and as his marriage to second wife Veronica Lario, played by Elena Sofia Ricci, stutters towards an end. “Loro is neither pro- or anti-Berlusconi,” Sorrentino said. “It is instead a tender look at the weaknesses of an old man.” Berlusconi, who is currently vying for his Forza Italia party to get into government again as part of a centre-right coalition, has not commented publicly on the film. It was reported last summer that he was only too happy to have a movie about his life made by a respected director and that for shooting he had opened up his villas in Milan and Sardinia, where famous “bunga bunga” parties were hosted. However, by October, as the 81-year-old geared up for general elections on 4 March [the result was inconclusive], he expressed concerns that the film might be a political attack against him. Servillo has been praised for his portrayal of Berlusconi, but reviews for Loro 1 have been mostly negative. Writing in La Repubblica, Emiliano Morreale described it as “lopsided and disharmonious”, while Paolo Mereghetti of Corriere della Sera said it was “a cross between farce and tenderness”. Giovanni Robertini, of Rolling Stone Italia, likened it to “a porn film without a moral issue”. Box-office takings also reflect lack of enthusiasm for the film when compared to his previous: Loro 1 made €1.7m in its first week, much less than The Great Beauty and 2015’s Youth."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"us-news/2018/apr/25/trump-travel-ban-supreme-court-key-justices-support","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-25T18:26:08Z","webTitle":"Supreme court appears to lean in favor of Trump's right to impose travel ban","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/apr/25/trump-travel-ban-supreme-court-key-justices-support","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/apr/25/trump-travel-ban-supreme-court-key-justices-support","fields":{"headline":"Supreme court appears to lean in favor of Trump's right to impose travel ban","bodyText":"Two key judges on the US supreme court signaled support on Wednesday for Donald Trump’s authority to impose his controversial travel ban on several Muslim-majority countries, as fierce arguments raged before the bench in Washington. Chief justice John Roberts and Justice Anthony Kennedy, the two most likely swing votes on the nine-judge court, both expressed skepticism over attempts to undermine Trump’s authority on what the president’s side insists is a matter of national security. Opponents argue the Trump travel ban is motivated by discrimination and want the supreme court to uphold lower court rulings striking down the ban, which Trump first imposed by executive order as one of his first moves as president in 2017. As the justices began their first full consideration of the ban on Wednesday, Justice Elena Kagan – an Obama appointee – posed a hypothetical for the court. Suppose a presidential candidate was a “vehement antisemite”, elected after regularly making denigrating statements about Jews, and upon taking office issued a proclamation barring immigrants from Israel, she posited. Solicitor general Noel Francisco, arguing on behalf of the Trump administration, dubbed it a “very tough hypothetical” that could only be imposed if the relevant federal agencies believed it to be the result of genuine national security concerns. “This is an out-of-the-box kind of president in my hypothetical,” Kagan replied, invoking laughter in the imposing courtroom in Washington. The exchange was emblematic of both the unprecedented nature of Trump’s travel ban, which indefinitely bars more than 150 million people from gaining entry to the United States, and what many see as the core issue before the court: was the president’s action motivated by an actual national security threat or by animus toward a particular religion? The court is considering the third version of the travel ban, which bars or limits entry to citizens of five Muslim-majority countries – Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen – as well as North Korea. It also imposed travel restrictions on certain government officials from Venezuela and their families. The restrictions against North Korea and Venezuela are not being challenged in court. Chad was also among the list of banned countries but removed by the Trump administration earlier this month. Human rights groups and other critics have labeled it an unmistakable attempt to make good on his campaign pledge to ban all Muslims from entering the US. Since then, lower courts have struck down three version of the travel ban, declaring it discriminatory on the basis of nationality and religion. The travel ban was elevated to the conservative-leaning supreme court, which now stands as Trump’s best hope to uphold what remains one of the most divisive actions of his presidency. And in a sign of a possible looming victory for the administration, justices appeared split along ideological lines even as they peppered both sides with tough questions in oral arguments that extended just over an hour. In the 15 months since Trump handed down his first travel ban, federal judges in Hawaii, California, Maryland and Virginia have rejected different versions of the executive order as unconstitutional. The appeals process ultimately placed the fate of the travel ban with the highest court in the land. The supreme court signaled in December it may uphold Trump’s policy by allowing it to go into effect while the various legal challenges unfolded. The challengers were represented by Neal Katyal, the former acting solicitor general under Barack Obama, and include the state of Hawaii and other individuals who said they were directly affected by the ban. Roberts and Kennedy strongly indicated a reluctance to challenge the president’s authority on the matter, and poked holes in some opposition arguments. Kennedy suggested the travel ban was not as indefinite as its opponents contended, pointing out that its language included a review after 180 days. “That indicates there will be a reassessment and the president has continuing discretion,” Kennedy said. Roberts asked if the notion that Trump’s actions were the result of bias meant airstrikes against Syria would similarly be considered illegal. “Does that mean he can’t because you would regard that as discriminating against a majority-Muslim country?” Roberts asked. Noting Trump’s order still allowed the majority of the Muslim world to seek entry to the US, the conservative Justice Samuel Alito said plainly that the policy “doesn’t at all look like a Muslim ban”. Francisco strongly rejected assertions that the travel ban sought to bar any travelers on religious grounds, stating: “It excludes the vast majority of the Muslim world.” The president, he added, “has been crystal clear this is not a Muslim ban”. In a nod to the widespread interest in the case, the supreme court took the highly unusual step of immediately posting audio of the arguments online. The travel ban case marked the final arguments of the supreme court’s current term. A ruling is not expected until June."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/apr/25/melania-trump-waxwork-madame-tussauds-sean-spicer","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-25T18:38:59Z","webTitle":"Melania Trump waxwork unveiled at Madame Tussauds by Sean Spicer","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/apr/25/melania-trump-waxwork-madame-tussauds-sean-spicer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/apr/25/melania-trump-waxwork-madame-tussauds-sean-spicer","fields":{"headline":"Melania Trump waxwork unveiled at Madame Tussauds by Sean Spicer","bodyText":"Sean Spicer, the former White House press secretary, has unveiled a waxwork of Melania Trump at Madame Tussauds in New York, praising the model as “unbelievably lifelike”. The figurine of the first lady was unveiled on Wednesday, and stands next to a waxwork of her husband, Donald Trump. The Trumps are positioned behind a wooden presidential desk in a section devoted to world and religious leaders. It is located across from Pope Francis, Gandhi and Fidel Castro. It’s the first time Melania Trump has been displayed at Tussauds. She joins a pantheon of wax celebrities at the Times Square location, including Angelina Jolie, Queen Elizabeth II and the boyband ‘NSync. Asked what Trump was like away from the cameras, Spicer said: “She’s a very gracious and fashionable woman. I don’t think the American people have fully appreciated the level of intellect she has and her political savviness.” In a brief Q&amp;A with a Tussauds representative, Spicer, who resigned in July, described Melania as “a great spouse” who is “always supportive” of Donald Trump “in public and private”. Asked by the Guardian if Melania Trump was supportive when news broke of her husband’s alleged affair with a pornographic actor, Spicer said: “I haven’t had any conversations on that.” There is an interactive element, too: Tussauds have invited visitors to “Give Melania a voice” by tweeting from a social media station next to her waxwork. The tweets will appear on a live stream, and those deemed suitable will be tweeted out to the world. The option to “Give Melania a voice” seemed a curious decision by Tussauds, given the inevitable comparisons to the #FreeMelania movement that trended after the 2016 presidential inauguration. That hashtag was sparked by footage of her looking less than pleased as her husband was inaugurated. A spokeswoman acknowledged that people might make that comparison, but said “Give Melania a voice” was not intended as a comment on Melania’s taciturn image or her role in the White House."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/apr/29/the-wound-observer-review-john-trengove-nakhane-toure","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-29T06:59:36Z","webTitle":"The Wound review – lust in a taboo climate","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/apr/29/the-wound-observer-review-john-trengove-nakhane-toure","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/apr/29/the-wound-observer-review-john-trengove-nakhane-toure","fields":{"headline":"The Wound review – lust in a taboo climate","bodyText":"John Trengove’s tough, beguiling debut looks at what happens when queerness throws a wrench in the rusty machinery of traditional masculinity. Set in the mountains of South Africa’s Eastern Cape, it centres on the Xhosa tribe’s circumcision ritual of Ukwaluka, in which young men come of age under the careful watch of their “caregivers”. Co-written with Thando Mgqolozana (whose 2009 novel A Man Who Is Not a Man visits the same subject), it embeds itself in a community of scythe-swinging, dick-slinging machismo. Xolani or “X” (Nakhane Touré) is a young, closeted factory worker in Queenstown who is assigned as caregiver to a young initiate from the city: sensitive, pouty Kwanda (Niza Jay Ncoyini). “They trust you with the softies,” says a colleague. Kwanda could indeed be called a softie (or certainly, a snowflake); teased for his expensive shoes, and prone to politically charged monologues, he is marked as an anomalous initiate with western attitudes (perhaps acting here as a stand-in for white South African director Trengove). When in motion, Trengove’s camera is tense and aggressive, mimicking the brisk, blunt brutality of the ceremony itself, though these moments are tempered by the film’s scenes of stillness. The entwined bodies of two black men, nude and underneath a waterfall; a silhouette at dusk; closeups of necks and freckles and bare chests – men’s tender parts – are sensual images in tension with the harshness of their surroundings. The Wound is mostly interested in X and his tentative romantic relationship with fellow caregiver Vija (Bongile Mantsai). After a brief, secret (and lustily rendered) sexual encounter, it is revealed that each summer the pair have these trysts, with Vija retreating to his wife and children once the ritual is complete while X festers in Queenstown, alone and heartbroken. A blowjob is hungrily received, but a kiss refused. Still, the film resists easy moralising, with Trengove careful to flag the danger (and unpack the stakes) of “coming out” for each character, acknowledging just how taboo homosexuality is within this particular cultural context."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2018/apr/25/plumbing-the-depths-for-david-davis-is-this-possible","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-25T17:13:13Z","webTitle":"David Davis: a man with the utmost confidence in his own limitations | John Crace","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/apr/25/plumbing-the-depths-for-david-davis-is-this-possible","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/apr/25/plumbing-the-depths-for-david-davis-is-this-possible","fields":{"headline":"David Davis: a man with the utmost confidence in his own limitations","bodyText":"Back in November 2002, David Davis spoke in the House of Commons about why he didn’t think referendums were necessarily a good idea. “We should not ask people to vote on a blank sheet of paper and tell them to trust us to fill in the details,” he warned. With good reason. Because the person the country might be relying on for that information could be him. Detail and Davis are barely on nodding terms. Partly because leaving the EU is a great deal more complicated than he expected, but mainly because he’s hopelessly out of his depth. Davis has yet to be asked any question, no matter how straightforward, that doesn’t take him completely by surprise. The Brexit secretary has also yet to attend a meeting for which he is fully prepared. At the start of his latest outing to update the Brexit select committee on his lack of progress, Davis spent the best part of 10 minutes explaining why he had to get away early as he had another meeting scheduled that he was already late for. As this was precisely the same excuse he had used at his last appearance, everyone on the committee was underwhelmed. “I’m very busy,” Davis explained. Busy being busy with busy things. And always at least one meeting behind himself. As it turned out, the committee had more than enough time to explore the depths of Davis’s knowledge. Largely because he knows so little. On almost every question the Brexit secretary’s stock answer is one of definite vagueness. A man with the utmost confidence in his own limitations. Hilary Benn, chair of the exiting the European union committee, began by asking how, having spent the past 22 months achieving next to nothing, the government could be sure of reaching an agreement on Ireland in the next couple of months. Because he could, Davis insisted. And if he couldn’t then something would probably be sorted out later. So it went on. There might or might not be a deal. Parliament might or might not be able to ask the government to renegotiate with the EU. He was making tremendous progress but was unable to list any achievements. He didn’t know if there would be time for the Office for Budget Responsibility to calculate the economic impacts of any deal but it didn’t matter anyway because he would be providing his own assessments, which might or might not exist. Normally, the Brexit enthusiasts on the committee can be relied on to come to Davis’s rescue by asking him simple questions and congratulating him profusely for his failure to answer. But even they are now beginning to look worried that his air of stupidity may not be an act. When Davis declared that the real benefit of leaving the customs union was “releasing Liam to sign trade deals”, several members ran out of the room sobbing. When the country’s future depends on Liam Fox, even the Brexiters know we’re screwed. The only upside for Davis was that he was too dim to realise just what a poor impression he had made. At prime minister’s questions, later in the morning, Theresa May had no such relief. Her tragedy is that she is self-aware enough to realise she’s not very good, but not so much that she can do anything about it. A kinder party than the Tories would put her out of her misery. With Jeremy Corbyn, practice may not make perfect but it does make him less mediocre. For the second week running he went in on Windrush and this time he made no mistake. May could only mumble in a dissociated trance. It wasn’t her fault. It was Labour’s. She was going to give people the citizenship rights they already had. It wasn’t her fault ... “Maybot,” shouted Emily Thornberry. May smiled wanly. Her self esteem is now so low she regards “Maybot” as a term of endearment. The prime minister ploughed on. She had only wanted to deport a few illegal immigrants. The Windrush generation had just been unfortunate collateral damage. No biggy. It was being sorted and everyone should stop making such a fuss. Tone deaf, tin ear. It was Yvette Cooper who delivered the coup de grâce. May should stop hiding behind Labour, the cabinet and civil servants. The buck stopped with her. It was her hostile environment policy that had caused the scandal. End of. “The government isn’t bereft of ideas,” May stammered, her eyes wide in desperation. The situation was far worse than that. Ideas were only the tip of the iceberg. Sans eyes, sans teeth, sans everything."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/apr/25/iaaf-testosterone-rules-caster-semenya","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-26T08:13:07Z","webTitle":"New IAAF testosterone rules could slow Caster Semenya by up to seven seconds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/25/iaaf-testosterone-rules-caster-semenya","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/apr/25/iaaf-testosterone-rules-caster-semenya","fields":{"headline":"New IAAF testosterone rules could slow Caster Semenya by up to seven seconds","bodyText":"The Olympic 800m champion Caster Semenya could run up to seven seconds slower under new rules requiring her to lower her natural testosterone levels to race internationally, a prominent sports scientist has predicted. Under rules due to be announced on Thursday morning by the IAAF, the world athletics governing body, a separate female classification for an athlete with differences of sexual development (or DSDs) will be introduced. Such athletes, including Semenya, will have to reduce and then maintain their testosterone levels to no greater than 5nmol/L by 1 November if they want to compete in events ranging from 400 metres to a mile. The International Association of Athletics Federations believes its new rules will “preserve fair and meaningful competition in the female classification” because women athletes with high testosterone have an advantage of up to 9% over women with normal levels of testosterone. The move, which is sure to divide opinion, was unanimously approved by the IAAF council last month. According to the world-renowned sports scientist Ross Tucker, the effect will be significant on athletes such as Semenya. “If this policy passes, then I would predict that Semenya will be five to seven seconds slower over 800 metres,” he wrote. “The other really interesting thing is that, guided by the new IOC transgender policy that lowers the upper limit for testosterone to 5nmol/L, the IAAF are setting their limit at 5nmol/L. It used to be 10. That will slow the times of these athletes down even more than it did in the past.” He told the Guardian: “History suggests Semenya will lose about four seconds to five seconds. Because in 2013 and 2014, when the IAAF were diligent about ensuring her compliance with the upper limit at that time (10nM), she was running 2:00. I don’t think she even qualified for the Commonwealth Games. Now, at 5nM, that effect will be even larger, I suspect. She will go from a 1:54 to 2:01-2:03, is my estimate.” Semenya burst on to the scene in 2009 when she won the world 800m title but was then required to take testosterone-suppressing medicine by the IAAF in order to compete. However, in July 2015 the court of arbitration for sport reversed that rule when it examined the Dutee Chand case – allowing inter-sex athletes to compete without taking testosterone-suppressing medication. The decisive factor for the Cas panel in 2015 was whether testosterone above the 10nmol/L threshold set by the IAAF gave female athletes a competitive advantage over their fellow competitors. However research by the IAAF since then shows that in certain events testosterone does make an enormous difference. An IAAF report notes that “most females have low levels of testosterone circulating naturally in their bodies (0.12 to 1.79 nmol/L in blood); while after puberty the normal male range is much higher (7.7 – 29.4 nmol/L). Absent a DSD or a tumour, no female would have serum levels of testosterone approaching 5 nmol/L, but individuals with DSDs can have very high levels of natural testosterone, extending into and even beyond the normal male range.” The IAAF also makes it clear that science is on its side. In its report it writes: “There is a broad medical and scientific consensus that if these individuals are sensitive to androgens (ie, they have properly-functioning androgen receptors), such very high levels of natural testosterone can increase their muscle mass and strength, as well as their levels of circulating haemoglobin, and so significantly enhance their sporting potential. “This evidence shows clearly that (at least in certain events) DSD athletes with levels of circulating testosterone in the normal male range have a very significant competitive advantage over female athletes with testosterone levels in the normal female range.” It also uses numbers to back up its case. As it notes: “In particular, increasing testosterone levels in women from 0.9 nmol/L to just 7.3 nmol/L increases muscle mass by 4% and muscle strength by 12-26%; while increasing it to 5, 7, 10 and 19 nmol/L respectively increases circulating haemoglobin by 6.5%, 7.8%, 8.9% and 11% respectively. Taking all available knowledge and data into account, the experts estimate that the ergogenic advantage in having circulating testosterone levels in the normal male range rather than in the normal female range is greater than 9%.” “To the best of our knowledge, there is no other genetic or biological trait encountered in female athletics that confers such a huge performance advantage.” In explaining its decision, the IAAF said it was trying to create “a level playing field and ensure that success is determined by talent, dedication, hard work, and the other values and characteristics that the sport embodies and celebrates”. It added: “The IAAF wants athletes to be incentivised to make the huge commitment and sacrifice required to excel in the sport, and so to inspire new generations to join the sport and aspire to the same excellence. It does not want to risk discouraging those aspirations by having unfair competition conditions that deny athletes a fair opportunity to succeed. “Because of the significant advantages in size, strength and power enjoyed (on average) by men over women from puberty onwards, due in large part to men’s much higher levels of circulating testosterone, and the impact that such advantages can have on sporting performance, it is generally accepted that competition between male and female athletes would not be fair and meaningful, and would risk discouraging women from participation in the sport. Therefore, in addition to separate competition categories based on age, the IAAF has also created separate competition categories for male and female athletes. It added: “The IAAF respects the dignity of all individuals, including individuals with DSDs. It also wishes the sport of athletics to be as inclusive as possible, and to encourage and provide a clear path to participation in the sport for all. The IAAF therefore seeks to place conditions on such participation only to the extent necessary to ensure fair and meaningful competition.” In a Q&amp;A sent out with its new rules, the IAAF also anticipated a frequent argument made in this debate – namely that all elite athletes have natural genetic and/or biological advantages (such as height or lung capacity), so why deny DSD athletes the benefit of their natural levels of circulating testosterone? In response the IAAF wrote: “The IAAF divides competition into male and female classifications because male athletes have clear performance advantages in terms of size, strength and power, as a result (in particular) of increased lean body mass and increased serum haemoglobin, which in turn is due mainly to the fact that, starting from puberty, they produce 10‐30 times more testosterone than women. As noted above, the CAS has found that this difference justifies protecting female athletes from competition from male athletes.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/apr/25/windrush-scandal-five-unanswered-questions-amber-rudd-immigration","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-25T18:45:30Z","webTitle":"Windrush scandal: five unanswered questions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/25/windrush-scandal-five-unanswered-questions-amber-rudd-immigration","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/apr/25/windrush-scandal-five-unanswered-questions-amber-rudd-immigration","fields":{"headline":"Windrush scandal: five unanswered questions","bodyText":"The Commons home affairs committee heard almost three hours of evidence about the Windrush crisis from the home secretary, Amber Rudd, one of her senior officials and a series of immigration experts. But a number of questions remain: 1. What compensation will those wrongly targeted receive? Asked about this at prime minister’s questions, Theresa May said Rudd would “set out the details of that compensation scheme in due course”. Quizzed at the committee, the home secretary had nothing more to add. Yes, she assured the MPs, those who had wrongly lost jobs, homes or benefits would get recompense. But it remains to be seen when, how much, and how they apply. 2. How many people are potentially affected by the Windrush crisis? A lot. In the short space since the Windrush hotline was set up, Glynn Williams, the head of immigration for the Home Office, told the committee it had taken 3,800 calls, of which 1,364 had been identified as being Windrush cases. This seems set to rise. So far, he said, 91 appointments had been made, 25 had taken place and 23 documents issued. Earlier in the day, a junior minister, Nadhim Zahawi, had pledged all cases would be sorted out within a fortnight. This looks a tough ask. 3. Are there targets set for deportations? It depends who you ask. Giving evidence before Rudd, the general secretary of the ISU immigration workers’ union, Lucy Moreton, said there was a target for net removals, and that it was broken down by region. But asked about this, Williams said it was not the case. As the hearing continued, Moreton told Sky News she was “somewhat bemused” at this answer, and said the target was 8,337, with targets on posters in regional centres. Asked about Moreton’s later comments, Williams insisted he was right: “I said earlier on, I don’t think they do exist. There are no published removals targets and there is nothing broken down by region.” A slightly puzzled Rudd promised to look into it. 4. Who is to blame? Rudd was somewhat evasive on this, at times seeming to accept there was a wider issue connected to the so-called hostile environment approach, but then rejecting the idea that this had “blurred the lines” between targeting “illicit migrants” and those with the right to be in the UK. At times she seemed to blame Home Office officials, saying her department needed “to have a more personal approach in terms of engaging with people”. But she also targeted previous governments for not realising the undocumented status of many in the Windrush generation could cause problems, saying it was “disappointing no previous governments saw this coming”. 5. How many people have been wrongly detained or deported? We still don’t know. On removals, Rudd said: “The answer is, not as far as we can see at the moment.” But, she added, this was not definitive as checks were still being made. Asked by the committee chair, Labour’s Yvette Cooper, how many people had been wrongly detained, Rudd said – to Cooper’s apparent surprise – that no work had yet been done on this, adding: “I have to be frank, I am prioritising the removal for now.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2018/apr/25/persimmon-saga-has-been-a-shambles-from-start-to-finish","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-25T18:26:14Z","webTitle":"Persimmon saga has been a shambles from start to finish","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2018/apr/25/persimmon-saga-has-been-a-shambles-from-start-to-finish","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2018/apr/25/persimmon-saga-has-been-a-shambles-from-start-to-finish","fields":{"headline":"Persimmon saga has been a shambles from start to finish","bodyText":"How did the housebuilder Persimmon get away with paying their chief executive, Jeff Fairburn, a £75m share bonus? One answer is that too few City fund managers are willing to follow the example of Euan Stirling, of Aberdeen Standard Investments, and state the bleedin’ obvious – that a chief executive of a public company sometimes has to put the interests of the business ahead of his personal desire to become immensely rich. Stirling’s address to Persimmon’s annual meeting was admirably furious. The reduction in Fairburn’s bumper payday from £110m to £75m “does not even get close to acceptable”, he said. Company directors have a legal responsibility to act in the long-term interests of the employer, he argued but Persimmon’s executives were endangering success by linking the company’s name with “grossly excessive” pay. Note Stirling’s wider point, too: executives grumble about interfering regulators and politicians but they invite attention when they breach their duty to do the right thing for their own businesses. This will affect “all their corporate peers”. He’s completely right, of course. The Persimmon saga has been a shambles from start to finish. A technically flawed incentive scheme should never been proposed or approved in 2012. When it spat out figures that were obviously absurd, even by modern standards of boardroom pay, the lucky trio at the top of Persimmon should have known that trousering £200m between them would be damaging. Yes, the company has been successful but the chairman had just resigned out of shame and embarrassment over the pay debacle. The voluntary reductions that eventually followed from Fairburn and his two top colleagues came too late and, as Stirling suggests, were too small. Fairburn sat in silence at Wednesday’s meeting, presumably in the knowledge that the vote itself was in the bag. The company’s remuneration report was duly approved by 74.5m votes to 70.1m, or a 51.5% majority. Look at the number of active abstentions, though – 64.8m. What were those “no opinion” box-tickers thinking? They will probably tell themselves, and their clients, they were registering a protest and fulfilling their stewardship role. Get real: fund managers are paid to have an opinion and they justify their princely fees on that basis. If you can’t get off the fence when boardroom greed reaches Persimmon levels, you don’t deserve to be managing other people’s money. Whitbread’s Brittain should stay grounded Whether Whitbread – a hugely successful company since it stopped brewing beer in 2001 – really needs to demerge Costa is a debating point in itself. The coffee shops are doing fine and the self-serve vending machines have returns on capital that are off the charts. There isn’t obviously a business problem that needs to be fixed. But, yes, it’s true that Premier Inn, Whitbread’s bigger operation, and Costa have little in common. The former requires lots of upfront capital and is expanding in Germany. The latter is light on assets and is growing in China. Now that Costa is generating enough cash to fund its own expansion, a split is a reasonable idea if Whitbread’s share price is labouring under a “conglomerate discount” – which it probably is. The real debate, then, is about timing. The chief executive, Alison Brittain, reckons up to two years sounds about right and knows she will be booed for taking so long. Elliott – the US activist hedge fund that has been the chief lobbyist for a demerger – thinks six months, max, would be more like it. There will be trouble. Brittain’s argument for taking her time, though, sounds fair. Renegotiating bonds, attributing pension assets and liabilities, recruiting a new board and rewiring the IT are fiddly jobs. Sure, they could been done faster if there was an urgent need. But there isn’t, especially as Costa in China is still a young operation. The only reason to rush would be to suit the short-termist agenda of Elliott and its hedge fund co-traveller, Sachem Head. Brittain should ignore them. Two bossy agitators’ demand for instant action – and a pop in the share price that may or may not materialise – is not her lookout. Concentrate on what’s best for the business. TSB’s wonky wording As TSB’s computers have gone wonky, so has the ability of the chief executive, Paul Pester, to make sense. “The challenge we are facing at the moment is that while we know everything is working, one of the main ways that our customers see everything is working – through our internet banking and mobile app – isn’t functioning as well as it should be,” he opined on Wednesday. Eh? Surely the website and the app are important components of this “upgrade”. If they’re on the blink, you can’t claim “everything” is working."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/25/the-guardian-view-on-the-toronto-van-attack-a-misogynist-movement-spreads","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-25T17:40:26Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on the Toronto van attack: a misogynist movement spreads? | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/25/the-guardian-view-on-the-toronto-van-attack-a-misogynist-movement-spreads","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/25/the-guardian-view-on-the-toronto-van-attack-a-misogynist-movement-spreads","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on the Toronto van attack: a misogynist movement spreads?","bodyText":"The Toronto van attack that killed 10 people and injured 13 others on Monday caused shock and horror worldwide, and its method immediately raised suspicions of terrorism. Since then we have learned that the suspect appears to have published a post minutes before, claiming to be part of an “incel [involuntary celibates] rebellion” and praising a misogynist who shot six people dead in 2014, saying he wanted to punish women for rejecting him. The atrocity has shed light on the unsavoury, disturbing internet subculture of “incels”, some of whom have celebrated the crime. They believe they have been denied a fundamental right to have sex with women (more specifically, women they consider attractive). As twisted as this perspective is, it contains a kernel that is painfully familiar to women in particular. Some men believe they have a right to female attention and bodies, and are ashamed and then angry if either is not granted. Some of those will attempt to impose their demands by threat or force. As Margaret Atwood wrote, men are afraid that women will laugh at them; women are afraid that men will kill them. The structures of male power are ultimately buttressed by the threat of violence; it is no coincidence that suffragettes were sexually assaulted as well as shouted down. Violence against women and girls, often instrumental and sometimes explicitly described as punishment for their imaginary sins, is age-old and global. What is new is the interpretation of a perceived personal slight in social and political terms, and the vow to overturn what incels regard as the current status quo. Yet the discovery of the post, if anything, steered coverage away from discussion of terrorism – which the FBI defines simply as “the unlawful use of force and violence against persons or property to intimidate or coerce a government, the civilian population, or any segment thereof, in furtherance of political or social objectives”. Details of this case are still emerging, and whether it can be defined as terrorist in purely legal terms is arguable. But misogynist violence is not just a personal issue. It is a social one. The Southern Poverty Law Center, which monitors far-right hate groups in the US, this year added male supremacy, including incel culture, to the ideologies it tracks. One factor appears to be a backlash against the gains that women have made. Though women are still a long way from achieving parity in pay or other areas, some men believe the progress towards it is unfairly bought at male expense. Like the white bigots who felt threatened by Barack Obama’s presidency, they portray equality as not only a warping of the “natural” order but also a form of oppression. Another factor is that the internet and social media have facilitated and supercharged this form of misogyny, just as they have allowed a fourth wave of feminism to burgeon. People can more easily find like-minded souls, have their identities reaffirmed, develop their thinking and organise – for better or for worse. Communities can easily turn into echo chambers, radicalising minds and hardening hearts. So tackling the misogyny of the online world is essential. Yet companies so quick to remove intellectual property infringements have proved ineffectual in removing vile material that demeans or attacks women, or in dealing with direct threats and abuse towards them. This normalises and fosters hatred. But the internet did not invent such attitudes and instincts. We need to challenge a broader strain of toxic masculinity which equates manhood with the capacity for brute conquest and shames men for any perceived weakness, bringing them misery too. Boys and young men need to know that masculinity does not have to be so narrowly defined and that vulnerability is no mark against them (a message that the grime artist Stormzy sent effectively in acknowledging his depression, for example). You do not have to read very far between the lines of incel forums to detect a festering sense of humiliation and fear that has turned into anger and aggression. There are no excuses for violence. But we cannot tackle it unless we stop treating it as an anomaly, and instead recognise it as an extreme manifestation of a wider problem."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/apr/29/death-in-ice-valley-we-came-to-win","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-29T06:00:36Z","webTitle":"The week in podcasts: Death in Ice Valley; We Came to Win","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/apr/29/death-in-ice-valley-we-came-to-win","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/apr/29/death-in-ice-valley-we-came-to-win","fields":{"headline":"The week in podcasts: Death in Ice Valley; We Came to Win","bodyText":"Death in Ice Valley BBC World Service We Came to Win: How the 1990 World Cup Saved English Soccer Gimlet Death in Ice Valley, the much-heralded new World Service podcast, is two episodes in and proving to be as classy and addictive as The Bridge. It’s a re-examination of a 48-year-old Norwegian death – the “Isdal woman” case – that hopes to solve its mysteries through techniques such as DNA forensics and crowd-sourcing. We, the listeners, are the crowd. Did you happen to be in Bergen or Stavanger in November 1970? Did you know a woman who called herself Finella Lorck? The case begins, as they all do, with a body: a young woman’s, found in a remote part of a mountain near Bergen. The body has been burnt and is surrounded by small artefacts: a watch, some drinking bottles, expensive jewellery. All these items have had their identifying characteristics removed, and there are no labels on the woman’s clothes. By the second podcast, we have more odd possessions – wigs, fake glasses, a notebook with coded messages – plus a garlic smell and a name, Finella Lorck, that’s so hilariously spy-like it might as well be Jamesina Bond. For the podcast, the case is being reinvestigated by Norwegian journalist Marit Higraff and Neil McCarthy for the BBC. It’s a joint production between the BBC and NRK (Norway’s public radio) and the combination of the two reporters works well. Higraff has the insider knowledge – she’s been working on this case for two years – while McCarthy is the intelligent outsider, working to understand the clues at the same time as we do. And it’s important to note that the clues are being drip-fed. There is much that is held back here: a simple Google search of “Isdal woman” reveals far more than the podcast does (so don’t do it, if you don’t want spoilers). The BBC has set up a Facebook page so that listeners can give their theories as to what went on. It seems unlikely that any of these – “maybe she was working for the Israeli secret service”; “what if she was involved in a vampire cult?” – will solve the case, but they’re less mad than those you’d get on Reddit. And you don’t need to join in online speculation to enjoy the podcast itself, which is beautifully atmospheric: doomy music with a wailing female vocal gives it an unsettling tone, and the sound of pattering rain in the first episode is used to great effect. It’s a headphone experience; immersive storytelling. I’d be surprised if any listener suddenly popped up with a memory of a glamorous travelling auntie who liked dressing up and not brushing her teeth, but that’s not really the point. This is a mystery, told in the clue-by-clue manner of an Agatha Christie novel. I just don’t hold out much hope for the final reveal. It’s the World Cup in eight weeks’ time and We Came to Win, from Gimlet, aims to whet our appetite. The podcast’s stated aim, announced in the first few minutes, is to give us football’s special times, those “moments that transcend sport”, that “say something about what it is to be alive”. Already, I could feel a snigger coming, and the story that’s told in the first episode – England’s semi-final performance in Italia 90 – is delivered in such an American way that I defy anyone from the UK not to be on the floor. Presenter Nando Villa describes Gazza as urging his team on (not Gazza’s style), as playing “all over the field” (the field!), as having “something on his mind” (hmm). We’re given a potted history of 1980s English football, a quick whiz through Hillsborough and hooliganism. The experts who speak are great (they include Pete Davies and Adrian Tempany) but their insights (“gormless hoofing”) are in wild contrast to Villa’s. At one point he talks about New Order’s World in Motion, calling to our attention the positive words in the chorus. No mention of rave culture, of why those words might be there. Just an image of the England team singing along on the bus: “like that scene in Almost Famous, where they’re singing Tiny Dancer”. I’m still laughing. Podcasts that give context Slow Burn: A Podcast About Watergate slate.com This came out last year but is still relevant. Presenter Leon Neyfakh takes us through eight episodes packed with revelation and insight. We hear from insiders, from those with a small part to play and, most interestingly, from ordinary people who simply followed the story of a flailing president and his comeuppance and were changed by it. The contemporary parallels are obvious. And the first episode, concerning Martha Mitchell, the wife of Nixon’s first attorney general, is so shocking I almost couldn’t believe what I was hearing. Lost Notes itunes.apple.com From KCRW, the Los Angeles station, this new podcast examines what it calls “some of the greatest music stories never told”. If you’re a music nerd, this may not quite be true (I knew quite a few of the yarns about Louie Louie, for instance), but each episode offers something new. I enjoyed the tapes of interviews with Captain Beefheart and the story of WBAD, a New York pirate radio station. Future episodes promise to look at the connection between New Edition and basketball, and a new (really?) story about Johnny Cash and Folsom prison. All good stuff.

She reports on Islamic State and the fall of Mosul. Her producer, Andy Mills, records her work as she does it. The first episode had me on the edge of my seat. You hear the explosions, the confusion, what it’s like to be inside a building only just vacated by Isis… Callimachi is my new heroine. “I’m looking for Isis’s diary,” she says, meaning the debris, the bags, the papers.

Arthur, who was the head coach of Australia between 2011 and 2013 and is now in charge of Pakistan, spoke on Wednesday about his disappointment with the team but also said he felt “really sorry” for the three banned players – Steve Smith, David Warner, and Cameron Bancroft. He feels they should be allowed to play county cricket this summer because “they were really stupid but have paid a big price already”. Surrey have said they would be open to signing Smith and Warner, pending approval from the England and Wales Cricket Board. “Australia always play their cricket really hard,” Arthur said. “They’ve pushed ‘the line’. I just want to know where the line is because I’m not sure many people do know where that line is and what it is. They’ve always played that way but I think it got to a point where perhaps, hopefully, this is a reality check for world cricket and just makes everybody sit back and take stock. Hopefully something good comes out if it.” Actions speak louder than words, of course, and Arthur will have a chance to be as good on his in the next few weeks, during which his Pakistan team play a Test against Ireland and then two against England. Arthur was full of praise for England on Wednesday, saying: “It’s a little bit early to get too controversial.” There have been plenty of bad-tempered series between Pakistan and England although though the last one in Britain, in 2016, was a lot less fractious than the two before it, which were marred by ball-tampering and spot-fixing scandals. Arthur is certainly pushing through major changes in the way Pakistan go about the rest of their cricket as part of an attempt to “resurrect” their Test team after two years of bad results. In that time they have beaten West Indies four times but lost all the other nine Tests they have played. Which is one reason why their squad for this tour is so fresh. It includes seven men who are 24 or under, and five who have never played Test cricket before. Altogether the squad have only 242 Test caps, while Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad have more than that between the two of them. “They are a young group,” Arthur adds. “There is a lot of vibrancy in this team. They are fit and raring to go. This bunch have a first crack at rebuilding the side.” There are some conspicuous omissions, such as Wahab Riaz. Arthur has been blunt about his reasons for dropping him. “He has not won us a game in two years,” he said this year. He was just as tough on Kamran Akmal, who has not played a Test in seven years but was in the limited-overs side last year and has been in superb form in the Pakistan Super League. “If you can’t field you can’t play for Pakistan,” Arthur said. “It’s as simple as that.” Fawad Alam, who has scored more than 10,000 runs at 55 in first-class cricket, also missed out on selection. He has signed to play with Clitheroe in the Lancashire League instead. The chair of selectors, Inzamam-ul-Haq, explained that last decision by saying that he had seen “better players in the last three years”. One of them is his own nephew, Imam-ul-Haq, who is one of the five new boys in the Test squad. Inzamam explained that he left the room when Arthur and his assistant Grant Flower were deciding whether or not to pick Imam for the tour. It all means Arthur has come in for some fierce criticism back in Pakistan, where Abdul Qadir described him as an “incompetent white man who has never played Test cricket” and “someone who was kicked out by South Africa and Australia”. Arthur has been too busy working to worry. He ran a four-week camp in Lahore before this tour and the team also have two first-class games organised, against Kent and Northamptonshire. But still, Yasir Shah is recovering from a stress fracture, which means the spin bowling will be done by the 19‑year‑old Shadab Khan. And Mohammad Amir, who is by far the most experienced of thefast bowlers quicks in the squad, arrived late because he had problems getting a visa. Arthur said: “We are a young team, a team that’s a little bit short on Test-match experience but a team that’s really skilful and talented.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2018/apr/25/may-puts-tories-before-national-interest-on-brexit-says-starmer","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-25T21:30:02Z","webTitle":"May puts Tories before national interest on Brexit, says Starmer","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/apr/25/may-puts-tories-before-national-interest-on-brexit-says-starmer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/apr/25/may-puts-tories-before-national-interest-on-brexit-says-starmer","fields":{"headline":"May puts Tories before national interest on Brexit, says Starmer","bodyText":"The shadow Brexit secretary has accused the prime minister of putting party management before the national interest, as MPs seek to ramp up the pressure on the government over a customs union. Keir Starmer said: “Over the past few weeks it has become abundantly clear that Theresa May is unwilling and unable to put the country’s interests first during the Brexit negotiations. “She has wasted 12 weeks of the Brexit negotiations delaying a Commons vote on the UK negotiating a customs union with the EU for fear of a defeat.” May has delayed contentious votes over amendments to two Brexit bills, aimed at forcing the issue of a customs union. But after the House of Lords overwhelmingly backed a pro-customs union amendment to the Brexit bill last week, 10 select committee chairs, including Tory MPs Nicky Morgan and Sarah Wollaston, have triggered a backbench debate on the issue on Thursday afternoon. Backbench debates do not always result in a vote – though Labour may try to force one – and any resolution would be non-binding. Mel Stride, the financial secretary to the treasury, will set out the government’s position. But backers of a customs union hope it will demonstrate clear support for the cause in parliament. Starmer, speaking in advance of the debate, said: “The prime minister is now solely focused on internal party management and masking the divisions within her government. Above all, it shows we have a prime minister governing for narrow party interest, not the national interest.” On Wednesday the leader of the House of Commons, Andrea Leadsom, became the latest senior minister to reject the idea of Britain remaining in a customs union, saying it would be “ludicrous” to do so. A customs union with the EU – which is Labour’s preferred outcome – would help to minimise border checks (though diverging from EU rules would be likely to result in some checks being imposed). But it would prevent Britain from being able to sign independent trade deals. It emerged last weekend that the prime minister could be ready to concede on the issue, after Brussels formally rejected Britain’s proposals for avoiding customs checks at the Northern Ireland border. But Michael Gove and Sajid Javid both reiterated their insistence that Britain must remain outside a customs union. Boris Johnson said last week: “Without your ability to do things in a different way if you want, and your ability to do free trade deals, there is very little point in Brexit. I think Theresa totally gets that.” Downing Street said the customs union had not been on the agenda at Wednesday’s meeting of May’s Brexit inner cabinet. Pro-Brexit ministers still believe the government can throw out pro-customs union amendments in the Commons, despite hopes among some backbenchers that Labour could team up with Tory rebels to force May’s hand. Asked whether the issue was back in contention, one cabinet Brexiter said: “The Tory party won’t wear it.” Earlier, David Davis said he would consider it a failure if the UK was forced to extend its membership of the EU customs union, amid mounting concern among MPs that time is running out for talks on alternative solutions. Ruling out this possible compromise route for minimising a hard border for Northern Ireland, the Brexit secretary instead insisted that the problem did not need solving until at least October. He said both the government’s proposals for resolving the Irish border issue were still on the table – a customs “partnership”, which would see the UK collect revenues on the EU’s behalf; and so-called “maxfac”, or maximum facilitation, which would use technology to help avoid cumbersome border checks. “I do not expect the solution to be an extension of the customs union,” Davis told the Brexit committee. “I would view that on my part as a failure.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/blog/2018/apr/25/james-milner-liverpool-in-vogue-barney-ronay","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-25T16:19:56Z","webTitle":"Liverpool’s James Milner in vogue again by doing simple things properly | Barney Ronay","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/apr/25/james-milner-liverpool-in-vogue-barney-ronay","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2018/apr/25/james-milner-liverpool-in-vogue-barney-ronay","fields":{"headline":"Liverpool’s James Milner in vogue again by doing simple things properly","bodyText":"Sometimes the cock crows at midnight, the cats bark a dawn chorus and the cow does indeed jump over the moon. Just as every now and then a football statistic crops up that goes against every prevailing metric and trend, which seems not so much an anomaly as a case of football simply kicking off its shoes and enjoying itself. Only the stoniest heart could fail to be cheered a little by the news that James Milner is now out there alone as the most incisive creative player over the course of a single season in Champions League history. Not only has Milner contributed more goalscoring assists than Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo, Neymar, Andrés Iniesta and Xavi. He has done it having played fewer minutes than all of them, and while shouldering close to zero creative expectation, performing in effect as a defensive midfielder and occasional full-back. As Roma wobbled and reeled like a boxer punched out of shape in the second half at Anfield on Tuesday night, Milner’s right-wing corner was headed in by Roberto Firmino to take his own total to a record nine assists this season in world football’s premier club competition. This probably should not be happening. Milner himself was moved to tweet a typically wry response to Uefa’s celebration of this achievement, in the process sub-referencing and also contradicting his own Boring Milner persona (do keep up). And yet there it is all the same, tribute to Milner’s underrated precision at set pieces, his fine, accurate crosses with both feet, and indeed to Liverpool’s own strikingly well-drilled team dynamic. All this with a second leg in Rome and quite possibly a final in Kiev to come. For Milner these are some hard-earned, late-breaking high notes to a career spent close to, but often a little in the shadows of, the main stage. Milner does not start every week for Liverpool. He probably would not have played on Tuesday night if Emre Can were fit. But he is now unavoidably central to Jürgen Klopp’s plan for the remainder of the season following the trauma of Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain’s knee injury in the first half at Anfield. As things stand Liverpool will face Roma, Chelsea and quite possibly Real Madrid or Bayern Munich with only Jordan Henderson, Gigi Wijnaldum and – yes – Europe’s deadliest provider of assists to fill the central midfield. Not that this should be a concern judging by Tuesday night. Milner’s performance against a team who had beaten Barcelona last time out was good enough to earn him a 7.5 rating from the notoriously sniffy Gazzetta dello Sport, below only Mohamed Salah and Roberto Firmino. And yet there is still an element of double-take to Milner’s presence as a key part of the finest attacking display at this stage of the Champions League since Bayern’s World Cup winners-in-waiting walked through Barcelona’s era-defining club team five years ago. Perhaps the most intriguing part of the current Milner Supremacy is that there are no obvious changes to his game. This is not an act of alchemy, the dramatic discovery of some hidden superpower by Professor Klopp, wheeling himself in through the conservatory doors, cranium throbbing. At Anfield Milner was simply himself once again, a footballer without a turn of pace, with no eye-catching technical skills, or obvious extreme qualities beyond the vital ones of intelligence, stamina and versatility. As Liverpool wrestled with Roma’s power and craft in the opening 20 minutes Milner was diligent and compact. As Liverpool surged into that annihilating Red Zone midway through the half Milner was diligent and compact. As Roma scored two late goals Milner was still diligent and compact, not to mention a little unlucky to concede a late penalty. He remains Milner the mule, an endearingly dogged, biddable figure, approaching each box-to-box shift like a plucky Soviet tractor steadily ploughing its way to the horizon and back again. Alongside the more deep-lying version of Henderson he provides a vital element of stillness at the heart of this attacking whirl of a team. Milner knows where to stand, where to cover, is free of the kind of creative ego that might lead him galloping into the wrong part of the pitch. His success points to the best part of Liverpool’s fine run, to the primacy of team and system that has so many players in this XI performing to their maximum capacity in bespoke, and perhaps untransferable tactical roles. Just as Roberto Firmino is the perfect Klopp centre‑forward, with no need to measure him against others doing other jobs in other teams, so the presence of Milner-Henderson at the peak of European club football points to the importance of balance over starrier qualities. In isolation Henderson+Milner might look a pretty ordinary collection of footballing attributes. But just as Klopp has talked about needing everyone to push the train, the players just component parts, so Milner and Henderson are the perfect piston engine behind the whistles and sparks and steam of that eye-catching attack. This is probably the best explanation for those assist stats too, a sign not of individual brilliance but of a functioning and indeed highly specialised team. Milner’s job in that midfield three is to close the space, to get the ball and to give it to the people who score the goals, something he has done with great efficiency. Should Liverpool make it to Kiev no doubt some will suggest Milner might be tempted from international retirement, that a midfield two that can perform at such a level might just be England’s best bet in Russia. This would be to misunderstand the best parts of Milner’s success in the Champions League. Were England looking to replicate the Liverpool style, to play fast-pressing shock‑metal football then it might well be an ideal fit. But England play slowly under Gareth Southgate. This is lounge-jazz football, a carefully geared soft-metal style that requires if anything a little acceleration in midfield. Instead the lessons of late Milner are the primacy of the system, the value of versatility and those hard‑won game-management skills. And beyond that of a player who, like a footballing version of late‑career Johnny Cash, is fashionable once again simply by walking at the same speed, doing the same things, waiting for the right team, the right moment to take shape around him."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/25/roma-mohamed-salah-sell-liverpool-uefa-monchi","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-25T16:20:43Z","webTitle":"Roma: we had no choice but to sell Mohamed Salah to Liverpool for £36.9m","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/25/roma-mohamed-salah-sell-liverpool-uefa-monchi","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/25/roma-mohamed-salah-sell-liverpool-uefa-monchi","fields":{"headline":"Roma: we had no choice but to sell Mohamed Salah to Liverpool for £36.9m","bodyText":"Roma’s sporting director, Monchi, has defended the sale of Mohamed Salah to Liverpool and insisted the Italian club had no option because of financial fair play pressures. Salah was described as “the best player on the planet right now” by Steven Gerrard on Tuesday having led Liverpool’s 5-2 rout of the Italian club in the Champions League semi-final first leg. The Egypt forward’s stunning display, scoring his 42nd and 43rd goals of the season, has intensified criticism of Roma for sanctioning his move last summer for an initial £36.9m. Monchi, who oversaw the transfer shortly after his arrival from Sevilla, insists the need to comply with Uefa’s financial rules gave the club no alternative. “I sold him for more than €42m,” the sporting director told the Spanish radio station Onda Cero. “We had a need to sell. We had no option but to sell Salah before 30 June. Had we not done that, we probably wouldn’t be here playing the semi-final of the Champions League as we had Uefa closely monitoring us. “We didn’t want to sell him but we had no choice. We had to take an offer before the end of the month. He wanted to leave, but we would have kept him if the regulations weren’t against us. When I arrived, the offer [from Liverpool] was €30m but we managed to get it up to almost €50m with bonuses. That is what we could do. The market then went crazy with Neymar, Coutinho and Dembélé.” Salah was named PFA player of the year on Sunday, is being touted for the Ballon d’Or and needs four goals to equal Ian Rush’s 34-year record for the most goals in a season by a Liverpool player. Monchi said: “He’s had an extraordinary season. Of course people have questioned why we sold him. We congratulate Liverpool for buying him. We had to sell him and the player wanted to leave. Unfortunately, we suffered that on Tuesday night because we know of his quality. He is a very strong player.” Roma’s captain, Daniele De Rossi, said his team suffered “a total blackout” as they were torn apart at Anfield and that Liverpool resorted to long balls to bypass midfield. De Rossi claimed: “Not having seen the game back, it would be wrong for me to give a tactical view of what happened. Liverpool are strong, let’s not forget, and they did very well, but we had 20-25 very good minutes at the start. “They constantly went for the long ball, from any area of the pitch, and it’s difficult to cover that space when there are players who are always faster than you. We got the feeling they were going over the midfield completely, so we couldn’t intercept the ball.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/apr/26/divorce-blame-game-leads-to-futile-court-battles-new-study-finds","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-25T23:01:01Z","webTitle":"Divorce blame game leads to futile court battles, new study finds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/26/divorce-blame-game-leads-to-futile-court-battles-new-study-finds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/26/divorce-blame-game-leads-to-futile-court-battles-new-study-finds","fields":{"headline":"Divorce blame game leads to futile court battles, new study finds","bodyText":"The lack of no-fault divorce in England and Wales is forcing separating couples into unnecessary and unsuccessful courtroom battles to establish who caused the breakdown, according to a report by the Nuffield Foundation. The charitable trust’s detailed study of nearly 500 divorces, led by Prof Liz Trinder of Exeter university, finds that many “defended cases are triggered by the law itself” which is out of step with most other jurisdictions in Europe and North America. The only ground for divorce in England and Wales is irretrievable breakdown of a marriage. There are five specific types, three of which require allegations of fault: adultery, behaviour and desertion. Claimants in contested cases can alternatively agree they have lived apart for two years or one of them may prove that they have been separated for five years. In rare cases where divorces are resisted, the report said, disputes degenerate into who should be blamed and are eventually “settled, rather than decided” by a judge. “The outcomes ... reflect the relative bargaining capacity of the parties, not an inquiry into the truth of allegations. The court’s willingness to accept the results of some deals appeared intellectually dishonest, even if it did bring an end to a damaging dispute,” the study said. The report comes ahead of a supreme court hearing next month into the case of Owens v Owens, the only successfully defended divorce case in recent years. Tini Owens, who is in her sixties, claims she has been left trapped in a “loveless and desperately unhappy” marriage after judges refused to allow her to divorce her husband of 40 years. Trinder said: “The divorce law is now nearly 50 years old and reform is long overdue. Our interviewees told us how difficult marriage breakdown is, yet the law makes the legal divorce even more difficult than it needs to be. “Having to blame one person to get a divorce does not help and in most cases is unfair. And the court is not able to investigate why a marriage has broken down and recognises anyway that it is a fool’s errand. “While the supreme court may find a way to grant Mrs Owens her divorce, [it] can only interpret the law. It requires parliament to change it. Reforming the divorce law to remove the requirement for ‘fault’ and replacing it with a notification system would be a clearer and more honest approach, that would also be fairer, more child-centred and cost-effective.” Defending a divorce is emotionally demanding and few can afford the typical legal fees of around £6,000. Family lawyers generally discourage defence, viewing it as expensive, counter-productive and futile. Jo Edwards, head of family law at the London firm Forsters and former chair of Resolution, the national family lawyers’ association, said the report “brings into sharp focus what most practitioners have long known – that fault-based divorce is futile, pitting couples against each other in a way which is wholly unnecessary. “It leaves people wanting the opportunity to put their side of the story as to why a marriage has ended, but finding barriers to doing so. Where a defence is filed, the law undoubtedly causes disputes.” She added: “It is even harder for the growing number of litigants in person in the system who, without legal advice, feel cornered when served with a petition blaming them for the marriage breakdown and conclude (wrongly) that they must defend a petition because they think that they will get a worse outcome with the children or money aspects if they don’t defend. It is time to end the blame game.” Sir James Munby, president of the family division of the high court, told a Westminster legal policy forum conference on Wednesday that he also backed no-fault divorce and called for legislation to introduce it. • This article was amended on 30 April 2018.

Yet the use of force without the authorisation of the United Nations security council is contrary to the charter of the UN. There is something bewildering about violating international law in order to promote the enforcement of international law. If there is a taboo on the use of chemical weapons, why is there not also a taboo on the unilateral use of armed force, contrary to international law? Does one taboo trump the other? That three nuclear powers express outrage about inhumane weapons has a ring of cynicism. Their conduct recalls that of tobacco companies howling about the health dangers of electronic cigarettes. Although couched in humanitarian language, the real motives of the United States, France and Britain may have more to do with protecting a monopoly on weapons of terror. The use of chemical weapons in the Syrian civil war appears to be occasional and somewhat isolated, rather than systematic. In a conflict responsible for the deaths of 500,000 people, most of them civilians, the casualties from chemical weapons probably number in the hundreds. The use of chemical weapons is hardly the only serious violation of international humanitarian law to feature in the conflict. Many categories of weapons are prohibited by specific treaties and declarations that form part of international law. The earliest such rule dates back exactly 150 years. The St Petersburg Declaration of 1868 condemned the use of exploding bullets. The pre-first world war Hague Conventions established that “the right of belligerents to adopt means of injuring the enemy is not unlimited”. They expressly prohibit “poison or poisoned arms”. After the 1914-18 war, British government lawyers prepared criminal charges against Kaiser Wilhelm II for the use of poison gas and “liquid fire” by German forces. A century later, lists of prohibited weapons include asphyxiating gas, cluster munitions, anti-personnel mines and blinding laser weapons. The international court of justice has affirmed a general principle prohibiting the use of any weapon that is inherently indiscriminate or that causes unnecessary suffering or superfluous injury. This formulation was incorporated into the Rome statute of the international criminal court, where the use of such weapons is labelled an international war crime. But the provision in the Rome statute is a hollow shell, a rhetorical device, a law without teeth. It adulterates the general principle by requiring that a list of such weapons appear in an appendix. There is no list. There is no appendix. The general provision on indiscriminate weapons in the Rome statute insists they be listed specifically in an appendix because nuclear powers would never trust judges to interpret the phrase “inherently indiscriminate”. Judges might reach the not unreasonable conclusion that this term describes nuclear weapons. There is no list and no appendix because too many states resist the hypocrisy of condemning the “poor man’s weapons of mass destruction” while leaving untouched those of the rich man. The Rome statute explicitly prohibits only three categories of weapons. It uses language and technology borrowed from another age: poison or poisoned weapons, asphyxiating, poisonous or other gases and expanding bullets. Moreover, in a further limitation, the 1998 text of the statute confines the prohibition on these weapons to international armed conflicts. Only in 2010 was the statute amended to extend the prohibition on the use of such weapons to non-international armed conflicts. But only 36 of the more than 120 members of the court have ratified these amendments. Britain and France are not among them. Some argue that the war crimes of use of “poison or poisoned weapons” and “poisonous gas” include chemical weapons of the type being used in the Syrian civil war. Whether this was the intent of those who drafted the Rome statute is a matter of controversy. When the statute was adopted, proposals to include an explicit ban on chemical weapons were rejected. Nuclear arms explain the inadequacy of universally accepted legal rules governing prohibited weapons. They are the quintessential indiscriminate weapon. The unnecessary suffering and superfluous harm that they have caused, on the two occasions they have been used, dwarf the human toll attributable to chemical weapons in all conflicts over many centuries. Citing the Treaty on Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, the international court of justice recalled the obligation imposed on the nuclear powers to pursue in good faith and to conclude negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament. The nuclear powers consistently ignore this requirement. Yet it is a quid pro quo not only for the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, it is also fundamental to the effective enforcement of a ban on chemical weapons. Only a principled approach to disarmament that addresses all weapons of terror and mass destruction in a consistent manner can succeed. • Professor William Schabas is professor of international law at Middlesex University in London"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"stage/2018/apr/25/anthony-neilson-metoo-the-prudes-royal-court","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-25T16:44:48Z","webTitle":"Anthony Neilson: Does #MeToo need a liberal male sticking his oar in?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/apr/25/anthony-neilson-metoo-the-prudes-royal-court","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/apr/25/anthony-neilson-metoo-the-prudes-royal-court","fields":{"headline":"Anthony Neilson: Does #MeToo need a liberal male sticking his oar in?","bodyText":"12 March First day of rehearsals. Really happy to be back at the Royal Court, where I’ve had productions under each of the last four regimes. Despite the Court’s standing, it’s still small enough that you interact with all the departments on a daily basis. It is the theatre whose mission statement most resembles my own, and one of the few that will let me work the way I prefer. For good or ill, without the Court I wouldn’t exist as the artist I am. As usual, I begin work with no written material, just a basic idea: to use the story of a couple’s attempts to resurrect their sex life as an analogy for the recent, seismic events in sexual politics. My idea is that The Prudes will be half-gig, half-play. The scenes will be counterpointed by songs, written and performed by the brilliant actor and musician Amanda Wilkin, with actors Jonjo O’Neill and Sophie Russell playing the couple. 13 March The first few days are spent talking about the issues I plan to explore. Everyone in the room contributes: actors, the design team, stage management – anyone who’s around. Even a seemingly irrelevant comment can lead to a great idea. 14 March I’ve started writing, only a few pages for now. I have the actors read it cold so they are my first audience and I am theirs. In this way, the notion of audience is kept constantly alive in the room, and I get to “feel out” the show according to what I’d want to see. Some material works, but some of it is glaringly awful when spoken. I don’t seem to write less shit than I did when I started, 30 years ago: I’m just better at spotting it and knowing how to fix it. 16 March Today is my birthday. Just saying. 19 March Something of a blow: the show Amanda is appearing in has been extended and she won’t be able to perform in ours. She’s a unique talent, so I’ve decided not to replace her but to pivot the idea to a two-hander between Jonjo and Sophie. The ability to be flexible in this way is an advantage of my process. The downside is that the actors will have to learn a lot more dialogue. Gulp. 27 March We debate the merits of using the song Bump n’ Grind. Some argue it will be distasteful, given the allegations against R Kelly; but this is exactly why we should use it. Fly Davis, our set designer, shows me some of her ideas. We settle immediately on a kind of tented structure, which reminds me of the way children make tents out of their quilts. It’s often effective to include design elements that trigger childhood memories, as it puts the audience subconsciously into a more imaginative space. Fly thinks everything should be pink. She assures me it won’t seem as if we’re inside a giant vagina. 5 April The greatest danger in writing as you go is what I call the “conceptual flaw”. Scenes and dialogue can be fixed right up until opening night, but if there’s a basic, conceptual flaw in your idea, you’re very soon stuck with it. From then on, it’s just damage limitation. I don’t usually engage overtly with political issues, but I am fascinated by, and invested in, the #MeToo movement and the issues surrounding it. Clearly, however, one could argue that the last thing needed right now is a middle-aged man sticking his oar in. In an attempt to insulate myself from that, I was determined The Prudes should be scrupulously balanced between the male and female viewpoints. But I have suddenly realised this is vanity on my part: I can’t leech off the insights of women and pass them off as my own. That would be using the play to self-aggrandise, rather than present the possibly unpalatable truth of my own limitations. I’ve railed against this kind of egotism in other writers and it would be hypocritical of me to start doing it. I realise now that what I’m writing – what I’m best positioned to write – is a (fairly vicious) satire about the Liberal Male response to these events, rather than the events themselves. The Prudes can only be a sidebar to a much larger volume of work that is hopefully being written by women as we speak. This small epiphany relaxes me no end. 10 April I am sleeping only once every two days on average. I attend rehearsals and direct the actors in what little material I can be sure will stay in the play and then go home to write. Sometimes, I will cancel rehearsals at short notice, if I’m writing good material and want to keep at it. Only industrial quantities of caffeine and cigarettes are keeping me upright. There is something fascinating about the effect of sleep-deprivation: the ebbs and flows of alertness are unpredictable and give rise to as many great ideas as poor ones. I am living in a different reality from everyone around me, a kind of living ghost. It is awful, but I think I am happy in some way. 14 April Approaching the previews and everybody hates me. This always happens around this time in the process. It’s all free and fun to begin with, but then the reality dawns that an audience is actually coming to see this in a few days and there’s still no ending to the play. To make matters worse, my latest attempt at the play is unusable garbage. Instructive, as terrible writing often is; but the actors must now spend their penultimate day of rehearsal without me, while assistant director Nimmo Ismail bears the brunt of their understandable panic. Thankfully, she’s formidable as hell. Until I’ve finished writing, the director part of me takes a back seat. This makes the actors feel insecure, but they know more than they think they do. Much of direction is about helping the actors find the characters; but because the actors have seen a lot of extra material we’ve cut – and because I’ve pretty much tailored the script to them – they have taken on a lot of that information by osmosis. 17 April Technical rehearsals, when we set the sound and lighting cues. In many ways, this is the most creative time, when we have lots of our best ideas. I like to feel the show out instinctively, in the space. It seems almost like conducting music. 18 April First preview and we do have a play, albeit full of shonky writing. As no mortal could have memorised the entire text in this time, the actors must perform the last 15 minutes “script in hand”, words that strike terror into any performer, but a process I’ve found audiences to be touchingly tolerant of. There’s a certain live energy to an unpolished first performance that you never quite capture again. Because the actors are still partly on script, I stand up and introduce the show, which I don’t like to do. This is where my one year of drama school training pays off. 19 April Second preview and the audience is not quite as forgiving, which is very useful. Predictably, a heat wave has descended, and the Upstairs theatre at the Royal Court feels like an airport in Dubai. 22 April The actors are off book and, minor tweaking aside, we’re ready to be judged. Because my process is fast and reactive it occurs to me that The Prudes will be one of the first plays to address the current sexual climate head on, but I hope it will take its place in context with other plays on the subject. This is a time when we need to hear from female playwrights, first and foremost, and it’s beyond heartening that, at long last, we’ve got such an abundance of clever, funny and various voices out there. Their plays will no doubt address the meat of the issue, so to speak, but come and see mine if you fancy a slightly edgy laugh at the fumbling idiocy of liberal males like me. Coda: 24 April Press night. Forty-four days on and a fully written and rehearsed show, running 75 minutes, now exists. As I set out for my last proper day on The Prudes, I am not thinking of any major changes. But something is troubling me about the last 15 minutes of the show. Sitting on the number 453 bus, the solution suddenly strikes me. Strangely, a lot of ideas come to me on the bus. I break the news to the actors that I want to rework a whole section and introduce a much more visceral, physical set piece. They comply with a strange mix of enthusiasm and hostility. I feel like a wildly irresponsible parent with two children that, whilst still bonded to me, are no longer sure I have their safety in mind. They execute the changes near-perfectly and the whole show finally pulls together as it should. Everyone feels good again. It belongs to the actors now. Time for me to let go. • The Prudes is at the Royal Court, London, until 2 June."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2018/may/09/opera-houses-carmens-toscas-rare-neglected-rarities","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-09T09:00:43Z","webTitle":"Opera's roads not taken: two rarities in Italy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/09/opera-houses-carmens-toscas-rare-neglected-rarities","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/may/09/opera-houses-carmens-toscas-rare-neglected-rarities","fields":{"headline":"Opera's roads not taken: two rarities in Italy","bodyText":"Opera houses are increasingly loth to take artistic risks these days, for frustrating but wholly understandable reasons. With financial subsidies tight, familiar works and famous singers will shift tickets in a way that neglected repertoire and relative unknowns do not. Hence all those Traviatas, Toscas and Carmens in the recently announced 2018-19 Covent Garden season. One of the continuing casualties of this era of caution is opera’s vast but fascinating neglected repertoire. There are lots of these overlooked operatic pieces, many of them by household-name composers, as a glance in any opera dictionary or guide will show. But with the exception of festivals such as Buxton and Wexford, which specialise in the rarity end of the operatic canon, there are very few chances to see them. If you want to watch a professional performance of a neglected opera, you have to travel and be prepared to spend. Last month, I managed to catch two such rarities, of very different kinds, but it meant going to Italy. Verdi’s I Lombardi alla Prima Crociata falls firmly into the category of lesser works by great composers. I Lombardi was Verdi’s fourth opera in a career that produced around 30 of them (the imprecision is deliberate because some of Verdi’s works, including I Lombardi, exist in various versions and revisions). Covent Garden has not put it on since 1976. New York’s Met not since 1993. But there is a new production at Turin’s Teatro Regio this season. I Lombardi is a cobbled together historical tale of monumentally improbable coincidences woven into the exotic (and violent) world of the 11th-century crusades. A jealous brother kills his own father by mistake. A captive Italian girl is revealed as the long-lost daughter of Arvino the crusader commander. The exiled parricide Pagano turns out to be living as a hermit in a nearby cave. You get the idea. Probably the most famous number comes near the end, when a chorus of crusaders appeals to God to save them from death as they approach Jerusalem. Their chorus “O Signore, dal Tetto Natio” was second only in popularity to the one from Nabucco in making Verdi’s name with the public. An 1880s visitor once heard farm labourers singing it “quite spontaneously” to the composer as he passed by in his horse and gig on his way to the railway station. There is a notable Ave Maria scene for the soprano Giselda, written 44 years before the more famous one in Otello. And her suitor Oronte has one of Verdi’s earliest rapturous tenor arias. There’s a famous trio as he dies from his wounds. As a whole, though, I Lombardi doesn’t hold together. It is episodic, resulting in many pauses between scenes, it lacks the dramatic tautness of Nabucco, and its story of Christian heroism in the Muslim-dominated Holy Land is hard to take nowadays. In bolder artistic hands, a producer might make something contemporary out of that uncomprehending cultural tension. But Turin’s director Stefano Mazzonis di Pralafera opted for a doggedly traditional staging of the sort Verdi would have recognised, which is often the safe option in a complex story familiar to few. Musically, however, it was another matter, with the conductor Michele Mariotti bringing a dynamism to his work in the pit that evoked Riccardo Muti’s command of this early Verdi repertoire 30 years ago. Angela Meade was an accomplished Giselda, Francesco Meli a full-blooded Oronte and Alex Esposito an authoritative Pagano. There was a very different approach the following evening at La Scala in Milan. Unlike I Lombardi, Riccardo Zandonai’s Francesca da Rimini, first premiered in 1914, is a (relatively) neglected piece by a genuinely neglected composer. But where Turin had played it safe for I Lombardi, Milan went for broke, bringing in David Pountney to mount the first production of Zandonai’s opera there since 1959. Such a director as Pountney was never going to produce a traditional setting for a work that sets a play by the terrifyingly egotistical and sex-obsessed Gabriele D’Annunzio that is erotic and brutal by turns. Milan’s boldness was rewarded. There was not a trace of the floral medieval settings in which Francesca is sometimes drowned. Instead, Pountney approached the piece through the prism of D’Annunzio’s scarily dark aesthetic. Love scenes were played out between the pages of a book of Arthurian poetry but the battles of the second act were staged with harshly futurist and phallic aggression. It is one of the best things Pountney has ever done. That it worked so well, in a piece that can easily fall flat, owed at least as much to Fabio Luisi, who conducted a reading of unflagging conviction, securing electrifying playing from the La Scala orchestra. Maria José Siri was equally tireless as the adulterous Francesca. Marcelo Puente and Gabriele Viviani gave imposing interpretations of the brothers who are rivals for her bed. Shamefully, though, the Scala seemed only about half full on the second night of the run. It isn’t just the UK where opera audiences seem content to stick with what they know. What a lot they are missing."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/27/islamophobia-not-british-press-issue-got-to-be-kidding","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-27T10:30:43Z","webTitle":"Islamophobia not an issue in the British press?

You’ve got to be kidding","bodyText":"This week the home affairs select committee’s inquiry into hate crime turned to Islamophobia and the press. Many greeted with surprise the idea expressed by one witness: that anti-Muslim sentiment wasn’t much of an issue in the mainstream media. That was the day before the Times issued a correction for the third in a series of front-page stories focused on a fostering case in Tower Hamlets, east London, last year. The first was headlined “Christian child forced into Muslim foster care”. The coverage had been called “disgracefully dishonest” by Sir Martin Narey, head of the government inquiry into foster care provision; attacked by the biggest non-government providers of foster care; and widely derided as bigoted against Muslims. At least the new editor-in-chief of the Daily Express recognised that many of the stories published in the paper prior to his arrival had contributed to an “Islamophobic sentiment” in the media, and that the Express’s front pages had sometimes been “downright offensive”. This attitude is to be welcomed. And the evidence to support his argument that a broader anti-Muslim attitude does exist is overwhelming. In the past year and a half, more than 40 stories on issues related to Islam and Muslims have been corrected in mainstream national newspapers following complaints I made. If inaccuracies of a similar type on the same subject every one or two weeks do not demonstrate that there is a serious issue here, it is unclear what would. Why does this happen though? Let us not kid ourselves. Stories that play on the public’s fears and feed their prejudices are popular, especially at a time when more than half of British people see Islam as a threat to western liberal democracy. These sentiments might well be shared by journalists at the newspapers concerned. Of course, it is almost impossible to know for sure the motivations behind the coverage. Yet it is hard to explain away front-page news stories such as the Sun’s “One in five Brit Muslims’ sympathy for jihadis” (ruled “significantly misleading” by the press regulator Ipso); the Times’s “Muslims ‘silent on terror’” (a view not shared by senior counter-terrorism and police officers); or the Daily Mail’s “MPs’ anger as Christian girl forced into Muslim foster care”, a story accompanied on Mail Online by a doctored photo. How are we supposed to understand the fake “Islamic plot” to take over schools in Birmingham in many papers; and the Telegraph and the Sun falsely suggesting that two Muslims were responsible for a “Trojan horse” plot in Oldham? In opinion pieces the problems are even more apparent. The Sun’s Trevor Kavanagh ended one column with the ominous question: “What will we do about the Muslim problem then?” These examples are the tip of the iceberg. Their frequency alone gives an indication of the scale of the problem. This is not a question of freedom of speech. It is about the choices of editors to tolerate, if not encourage, bigotry in our newspapers. The National Union of Journalists understands the issue and demanded an inquiry into press Islamophobia by Ipso eight months ago. Done thoroughly, this could have an impact similar to the Macpherson report, which labelled the police “institutionally racist” and encouraged a sea change in attitudes. So, what is Ipso waiting for? • Miqdaad Versi is assistant secretary general of the Muslim Council of Britain"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/2018/apr/25/resistance-to-joint-proposal-to-wto-leaves-uk-and-eu-divided-us-australi-reject-brexit-trade-plans","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-25T16:45:26Z","webTitle":"Resistance to joint proposal to WTO leaves UK and EU divided","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/apr/25/resistance-to-joint-proposal-to-wto-leaves-uk-and-eu-divided-us-australi-reject-brexit-trade-plans","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/apr/25/resistance-to-joint-proposal-to-wto-leaves-uk-and-eu-divided-us-australi-reject-brexit-trade-plans","fields":{"headline":"Resistance to joint proposal to WTO leaves UK and EU divided","bodyText":"Resistance to a joint UK-EU proposal to the World Trade Organization on trade after Brexit – which was once celebrated by the trade secretary, Liam Fox, as “real progress” – has triggered a break down in unity, with London and Brussels divided on a way forward. Fox had described the plan on how much meat, butter and wheat the rest of the world could export to the UK and the 27 member states on low or zero tariffs as a sign of the country “forging ahead”, and boasted: “It’s a sign we can make progress when both sides choose to do so.” Yet, in recent months the united EU and UK front has splintered in the face of a strident rejection of their proposals from the US, Australia and New Zealand, among others, the Guardian understands. Brussels has proposed another way forward. But London has yet to agree and has left open the prospect that ithe UK could go its own way in talks with the world’s biggest trading powers. To add to the tensions, the UK is also seeking to speak during the 21-month transition period after Brexit with an independent voice at the WTO, where large multilateral trade deals are negotiated, something the European commission is resisting. Until Brexit, the EU has a schedule spelling out how much of each agricultural product from each country that can be imported into the bloc without attracting high tariffs. After Brexit, the plan had been for the UK and EU, as independent WTO members, to divide the current quotas between the two according to historical flows of trade in each product. This plan was described as a “technical rectification”. However, EU sources said an initial objection from the US, Argentina, Brazil and New Zealand over the joint plan, hammered home in a fiery letter last October, had not gone away, proving Brussels’ initial belief that the plan would “not fly”. Brussels is now pushing for a new tactic under which they would go through the more arduous procedure of a full renegotiation with WTO members over key agriculture products, offering compensation where necessary, via what is called an article 28 procedure. The UK is insisting that the EU sticks with the original plan. British negotiators working in the WTO in Geneva believe that for 95% of the schedules there is no need for negotiation. The UK also insists it could unilaterally liberalise its tariff regime from Australia and elsewhere, in a move that could be damaging to EU trade flows, but would receive immediate agreement from those countries resisting the original joint plan. The EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, is understood to have told MEPs during a recent private meeting that “unsurprisingly a number of [WTO] members do not agree” with the plan, adding: “They are reluctant to discuss and are reserving their position in Geneva.” A senior EU official told the Guardian: “We think we will we have to go through a more difficult procedure. The UK wants to go for the simplest way we are saying we are not against it but politically it will not fly at all and we will have to do it the other way and even then it will be contested. “I think some have a case. With New Zealand and their lamb, they might say that we send our meat via Rotterdam or elsewhere to Britain, and you are making our trade arrangements more rigid. “For the first plan to work, the changes have to be perceived as technical adjustments for which there are no political issues. The other is a real correction, a real adjustment when you go through an approval process. And they take their time.” Alan Matthews, a professor of agricultural policy at Trinity College Dublin, said: “Rectification was always a crazy idea which would never be accepted as clearly what the UK and EU propose goes way behind what is covered by rectification.” The Department for International Trade, which Fox heads, said: “As we leave the EU we need to create a new UK goods schedule at the WTO, covering tariffs on our imports from other WTO members. We have engaged all 164 WTO members, and they understand our intention to establish our goods schedule by rectification. “As a part of the process, we also agreed an approach with the EU to apportion tariff rate quotas covering certain imported goods, based on historic trade flows, and wrote to WTO members on this last year. We are continuing to speak to them about next steps to secure an outcome with is fair and avoids disruption to existing trade.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2018/apr/29/starwatch-mars-saturn-moon-eta-aquarid-meteors","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-29T20:30:01Z","webTitle":"Starwatch: Mars and Saturn on view with the moon","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/apr/29/starwatch-mars-saturn-moon-eta-aquarid-meteors","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2018/apr/29/starwatch-mars-saturn-moon-eta-aquarid-meteors","fields":{"headline":"Starwatch: Mars and Saturn on view with the moon","bodyText":"Throughout the early hours of 5 May, a nice grouping of solar system objects will be visible in the southern sky.

What if, because you were all going on about how great Ukip were, and how Nigel Farage was only saying what people had been thinking all along, and all these people coming over here, May and Rudd thought you wanted them to be racist too, like you are? And so back in 2013, to please you, they did some racism, and wrote racist stuff on racist vans and drove them around laughing. And in so doing, May furthered the creation of The Hostile Environment, which sounds like an irradiated wasteland where teenage amazons get sent to die in The Hunger Games. May probably wasn’t really all that racist herself, and only did the racism because she thought you wanted it, you racists. And now look what’s happened. Last week Mrs May spilt a massive silver tureen of hot sticky racism right into the laps of diners at the Commonwealth Heads of Government slap-up supper, leaving the poor old Queen to get down on her knees between Andrew Holness’s Jamaican knees and sponge up all the racist mess herself: “Never mind Theresa, it’s probably best if I do it. You’ve done enough.” When the royal family, their 1930s Nazi sympathies now walled up in a sealed room at Windsor Castle, are your secret weapon for papering over the racist cracks, you know you’re in trouble. But Prince Philip’s embarrassing colonialist gaffes of old seem now like the charming handmade racist woodcuts of a delightful artisanal bigot, compared with the mechanised Model T Ford production line racism of the current government. May’s industrialised prejudice, a vast Amazon.com of nastiness, aimed to put the corner shop snug-bar Ukip supporter out of business. And suddenly, small-time racists everywhere are nostalgic for the days before racism went mainstream. Franz Kafka’s novels of bureaucracy gone mad have given us the adjective Kafkaesque, without which it would be impossible to describe the experience of being billed twice as two slightly different addressees by British Gas; and then, when threatened with the bailiffs for not paying the bill of an address that didn’t exist, finding the best way out of the situation was to pretend on the phone to be an old confused pensioner who had forgotten his own name, while your wife pretends to be his carer, who doesn’t speak English as a first language. There was no 12b Shanley Road. It was “basement flat, 12 Shanley Road”. And I am not 84 and senile. My wife is not Latvian. But this was not my most Kafkaesque situation. In Prague last summer, having booked four tickets online to visit the Kafka museum, and then finding they had been issued with the name Kafka on them instead of Lee, the guide advised us to pretend to be the Kafka family named on the ticket, to save time, and to satirise administrative incompetence as a celebration of dead Kafka himself. How we laughed. The children, three and six, could not have enjoyed their tour of the dimly lit literary tomb, with its morbidly fading handwritten letters and projected images of death, more. An American family called Kafka arrived soon after us, visiting their distant relatives’ home town, and were denied entry, as their tickets bore our name, until the guide came out and advised them to pretend to be us. This was undoubtedly the most Kafkaesque situation any of us had ever been in, and we all had a good laugh about it in the cafe afterwards, before becoming fixated on the absurdity of existence and crawling away on our bellies to die. To die like dogs. In Franz Kafka’s Kafkaesque novel The Trial, which no one has ever read, the protagonist Danny K makes a complaint about two arresting officers, whose treatment of him, eating his breakfast and trying to steal his clothes, he felt was unfair. The next day Danny opens a store cupboard at work to find the officers being flogged for his benefit, but far more violently than he would have hoped. Danny protests, but the flogger explains that K had set wheels in motion. Likewise, it now appears you didn’t want May and Rudd to be too racist after all, and now there’s all this unpleasantness, old guys homeless and living in storage units, and old ladies told to pack their bags, and no medical treatment for pensioners who paid in for decades. But that wasn’t what you wanted at all, was it, you racists? Deporting and depriving those nice old black people who have been here for ever was wrong. And when they came for that Canadian dinner lady in Wolverhampton, who was actually white, and told her to go home as life in Britain was about to become “increasingly difficult” for her, that was definitely too much. How could someone who had lived in Wolverhampton for 47 years, breathing toxic smog, dancing to Slade, and eating only faggots and peas, be expected to readjust to the land of clean mountain air, the thoughtful roots rock of the Tragically Hip, and light and fluffy blueberry muffins? It is inhumane. No, it wasn’t the dinner lady and the nice black family from the electrical shop who had to go. It was the other foreigners. The bad ones, who scrounge and steal and are lazy. Not the ones that were like people you knew, harmless tropical fish caught in a dragnet sweeping for sharks. It’s the anonymous parade of frightening brown faces on that Vote Leave poster. They’re the bad ones. Tough British cheddar. You stoked this hate volcano, racists. And now it has exploded all over your front garden and melted your Ford Focus. Is this what you wanted?

I don’t want to be in this family. I’m going to live somewhere else for ever.” By “somewhere else”, it turns out he means “on the front doorstep in East Finchley”; by “live” he means “stand sulking”; and by “for ever” he means “45 seconds”. There’s my little chip off the old block! He really has inherited his father’s rugged individualism, defiance of convention and hunger for distant horizons. But both of us are put to shame by the unnamed Australian 12-year-old who, when his mum and dad cancelled the family holiday to Bali, thought, “Bugger that for a game of soldiers”, and went anyway. That is, he made free with the parental credit card, booking flights and a nice hotel online, then grabbed his passport and did one. He was reported missing, but nobody thought to check the airports (why would anyone have thought to check the airports, to be fair?) so it was nine days before it emerged that he had hopped on a plane in Sydney, changed in Perth and smartly checked into the Bali hotel he had booked, saying he was waiting for his sister to arrive. The report I read did not, regrettably, specify how he was found, but I like to think he was on a sun lounger in some garish board shorts, sporting a large soft drink with an umbrella in it, smiling winningly at the passing ladies. He is quoted as saying of his unaccompanied jaunt: “It was great because I wanted to go on an adventure.” What a little scamp! This unnamed lad joins a distinguished lineage of literary runaways that includes Treasure Island’s Jim Hawkins, Frankenstein’s monster (last seen “going on an adventure” on an arctic ice floe), most of Joseph Conrad’s heroes, and Macaulay Culkin in Home Alone 2: Lost In New York – which, unless I miss my guess, is where he learned how to talk his way into a hotel. As much as our reaction to this story will be to tut-tut about safeguarding procedures and joined-up policing, and how unimaginably awful it would be had our own children absconded like that, there’s a part buried in all of us that just thinks: what a baller! The adult face is a mask of horror; the inner child yelps with envy. How many of us earnestly packed the contents of our piggy banks, a penknife or catapult and some essential provisions into a knotted hanky and ran away from home – only to be scooped up by our parents three-quarters of an hour later, having stopped to eat our Marmite sandwiches at the bottom of the street? In reality, running away from home – really running away from home – more often than not ends badly. Yet that does nothing to quash the romantic fantasy of circuses, a life at sea, or – as in this case – white sands, palm trees and drinks with umbrellas in them. And the fantasy has a grip on us because the older we get, the less courage we have. We may long to leave our lives and head out on the road like Woody Guthrie, Jack Kerouac and Reacher or The Littlest Hobo, but we won’t. Even when we were younger and less sensible, we didn’t. But we like to imagine we would have. So much so, that sometimes we pretend we did. Do you remember Tony Blair’s claim, soon debunked, that as a child he had tried to stow away on a flight to the Bahamas? Bali boy really did it, and he did it, in a sense, on behalf of all of us. Next time Jonah heads for the front door, I’m going to clasp him proudly to my bosom, slip my credit card into his pocket and whisper: “Run, Forrest, run!” into his ear.

The European commission wants governments and private companies to boost research and innovation spending on AI, amid rising concern that Europe is losing ground to the US and China, where most leading AI firms are based. Health, transport and agriculture are among the areas the commission would like researchers to prioritise. But the commission distanced itself from proposals to give the most advanced robots the legal status of personhood. “I don’t think it will happen,” Andrus Ansip, a commission vice-president in charge of digital single-market policy told journalists. “I don’t think my vacuum cleaner has to get human rights.” Last year a committee of MEPs argued that robots should have a form of electronic personhood, raising the idea of machines being sued in law courts. The proposals were made under the parliament’s own-initiative powers, meaning they had no implications for EU law. The commission said it would appoint a committee to draw up ethical guidelines on the use of artificial intelligence. The group of experts from business, civil society and academia will be convened by July to consider AI and its impact on society, including work, social inclusion and privacy. Commission officials stressed they wanted a human-centric approach to AI policy. “Robots will never become humans,” said Elżbieta Bieńkowska, the European commissioner for industry. Researchers have said Europe risks being left behind, as the US and China ramp up spending. US tech firms have been luring top British PhD researchers with six-figure salaries. In an attempt to stop the brain drain, leading scientists have drawn up plans for a vast multinational European AI institute. Named the European Lab for Learning and Intelligent Systems – or Ellis – it would have centres in a number of countries, including the UK. Last month Emmanuel Macron, the French president, announced €1.5bn in public funding for artificial intelligence by 2022, in a move to turn France into a “startup nation”. To meet the €20bn target, the commission promised to increase its spending by €1.5bn in 2018-20, under the EU research programme known as Horizon 2020. It hopes this will trigger €2.5bn in extra spending through public-private partnerships. The UK is among a group of 24 European countries that signed a declaration this month pledging a European approach to artificial intelligence. “It can ... solve key societal challenges, from sustainable healthcare to climate change and from cybersecurity to sustainable migration,” the ministerial declaration said. Against the backdrop of Brexit, tensions have flared over Britain’s role in EU scientific projects. The UK is considering plans to launch its own satellite navigation system as a rival to the EU’s Galileo, amid a row over information security. Greg Clark, the business secretary, has taken legal advice on whether the UK can reclaim €1.4bn it has invested since the project’s launch, the Financial Times reported. Bieńkowska, who will be delivering the project, said she would be speaking to the secretary of state later on Wednesday. “The fact is that the UK, Britain, will become a third country from 30 March next year and of course we are assessing the consequences ... both for the 27 member states and for the UK.” She said it was “the right time to start thinking about adjusting cooperation” on Galileo, adding that her main priority was to deliver the satellite navigation system “on time and on budget”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2018/apr/24/facebook-releases-content-moderation-guidelines-secret-rules","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-24T22:14:38Z","webTitle":"Facebook releases content moderation guidelines – rules long kept secret","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/24/facebook-releases-content-moderation-guidelines-secret-rules","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/apr/24/facebook-releases-content-moderation-guidelines-secret-rules","fields":{"headline":"Facebook releases content moderation guidelines – rules long kept secret","bodyText":"A year after the Guardian revealed Facebook’s secret rules for content moderation, the company has released a public version of its guidelines for what is and is not allowed on the site, and for the first time created a process for individuals to appeal censorship decisions. The disclosure comes amid a publicity blitz by the company to regain users’ trust following the Observer’s revelation in March that the personal Facebook data of tens of millions of users was improperly obtained by a political consultancy. In a Facebook post on Tuesday, the company’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, said that the publication of the guidelines was a step toward his personal goal “to develop a more democratic and independent system for determining Facebook’s Community Standards”. The 27-page document provides insight into the rationale Facebook uses to develop its standards, which must balance users’ safety and the right to free expression while maintaining a sufficiently sanitized platform for advertisers. The company has long banned content from terrorist organizations and hate groups, for example, but the document reveals how Facebook actually defines such groups. “You have told us that you don’t understand our policies; it’s our responsibility to provide clarity,” said Monika Bickert, Facebook’s vice-president of global policy management, in a blogpost. Other details include bans on posts in which an individual admits to using non-medical drugs “unless posted in a recovery context”, posts that compare a private individual to “animals that are culturally perceived as intellectually or physically inferior or to an inanimate object”, and images that include the “presence of by-products of sexual activity” unless the content is intended to be satirical or humorous. One guideline bans images that include a “visible anus and/or fully nude close-ups of buttocks unless photoshopped on a public figure”. Spam messages are not allowed to “promise non-existent Facebook features”. The company also bans so-called “false flag” assertions (eg claiming that the victims of a violent tragedy are lying or are paid actors), defining such statements as harassment. Facebook’s role as a global publisher – and censor – has long created controversy for the platform, and free speech advocates have for years advocated for more transparency from Facebook around its decision-making process for content takedowns. Sarah T Roberts, a UCLA assistant professor of information studies, said: “[The disclosure] shows in no uncertain terms the great power these platforms have in terms of shaping people’s information consumption and how people formulate their points of view – and how important it is to understand the internal mechanisms at play.” But the document leaves out the kind of specific examples of policy enforcement that the Guardian published in the Facebook Files. Those documents – which were used for training content moderators – revealed how complicated it is to apply seemingly straightforward standards. According to training slides on hate speech, for example, the statements “You are such a Jew” or “Migrants are so filthy” are allowed, but writing “Irish are the best, but really French sucks” is not. The release of Facebook’s rules draws attention to the difficult work of the 7,500 content moderators – many of them subcontractors – who are tasked with applying the rules to the billions of pieces of content uploaded to the platform. The low-paid job involves being exposed to the most graphic and extreme content on the internet, making quick judgments about whether a certain symbol is linked to a terrorist group or whether a nude drawing is satirical, educational, or merely salacious. “Now that we know about the policies, what can we know about the people who can enforce them?” said Roberts. “How can we be assured they have the support and information they need to make decisions on behalf of the platform and all of us?” While speech advocates have long called on Facebook to provide some form of appeals process for content removal, many said Tuesday that the company’s current plan was inadequate. The new plan, which the company said would be built upon over the next year, will allow users whose posts were removed for nudity, sexual activity, hate speech or violence to request having their posts re-reviewed by a human moderator. “Users need a meaningful, robust right to appeal the removal of any post – and before it is removed,” Nicole Ozer, the director of technology and civil liberties for the ACLU, said in a statement. She called on Facebook to provide a process whereby users can explain why their content should not be censored; she also urged Facebook to release statistics about its content removals. Ozer also raised concerns about Facebook’s reliance on artificial intelligence to enforce content rules. “AI will not solve these problems,” she said. “It will likely exacerbate them.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/apr/24/meek-mill-rapper-released-prison-jay-z","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-24T21:32:29Z","webTitle":"Meek Mill, rapper whose imprisonment sparked outcry, released on bail","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/apr/24/meek-mill-rapper-released-prison-jay-z","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/apr/24/meek-mill-rapper-released-prison-jay-z","fields":{"headline":"Meek Mill, rapper whose imprisonment sparked outcry, released on bail","bodyText":"The supreme court of Pennsylvania has ordered that the rapper Meek Mill be released from prison on bail on Tuesday afternoon. In November, the 30-year-old rapper, whose real name is Robert Rihmeek Williams, was sentenced to two to four years in prison after violating the terms of a probation deal agreed to after he was arrested on drug and gun possession charges in 2008. Mill’s case had become a flashpoint for criticism of the criminal justice system and its treatment of African Americans. His imprisonment prompted an outcry from celebrities such as Kevin Hart, Colin Kaepernick and Jay-Z, who penned a New York Times op-ed late last year in which he wrote the situation was “just one example of how our criminal justice system entraps and harasses hundreds of thousands of black people every day”. The state’s highest court overruled Judge Genece Brinkley, who denied Meek Mill bail last week after prosecutors from Philadelphia’s district attorney’s office asked that his original drug conviction be vacated. Supporters gathered around the courthouse advocating for his release, including Mill’s son and mother, noting that the arresting officer, Reginald Graham, was on a list of cops “considered tainted and unworthy of testimony by the DA’s office”, according to Philadelphia magazine. On Tuesday, Mill told TMZ: “I’d like to thank God, my family, my friends, my attorneys, my team at Roc Nation including Jay-Z, Desiree Perez, my good friend Michael Rubin, my fans, the Pennsylvania supreme court and all my public advocates for their love, support and encouragement during this difficult time. “To the Philadelphia district attorney’s office, I’m grateful for your commitment to justice – not only for my case, but for others that have been wrongfully jailed due to police misconduct,” he continued. “Although I’m blessed to have the resources to fight this unjust situation, I understand that many people of color across the country don’t have that luxury and I plan to use my platform to shine a light on those issues.” Minutes after news broke, Mill wrote on Twitter: “I plan to work closely with my legal team to overturn this unwarranted conviction and look forward to reuniting with my family and resuming my music career.” According to the New York Times journalist Daniel Victor, who spoke to Michael Rubin, who co-owns the Philadelphia 76ers, Mill may even attend tonight’s game. Hart shared his reaction to the decision in an Instagram post. “Meek Mill is Frrrrreeeeeeeee ....I just left from seeing him in jail with @michaelgrubin and we were just told that he is being released. Woooooooow......Stand Up Philadelphia!!!!!” Mill, who is managed by Jay-Z’s Roc Nation, is best known for the 2012 single Young &amp; Getting It, which debuted at No 2 on the Billboard Hot 200."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/27/why-are-so-many-white-collar-professionals-in-revolt","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-27T10:00:21Z","webTitle":"Why are so many white-collar professionals in revolt? | Gabriel Winant","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/27/why-are-so-many-white-collar-professionals-in-revolt","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/may/27/why-are-so-many-white-collar-professionals-in-revolt","fields":{"headline":"Why are so many white-collar professionals in revolt?","bodyText":"Professionals – those consummate rule-followers – are in revolt. Across the United States, the last several years have seen a marked uptick in social protest and workplace organizing among the ranks of the credentialed. And just in the last months, this gradual rising trend has accelerated rapidly. Why are our white-collar workplaces suddenly seething? Part of growing up in an unequal society is learning how you’re supposed to relate to rules. At the top and the bottom of society, rules are either optional or mandatory. Elites break rules at their pleasure. Marginalized people follow rules because they have to. But in between, it’s traditionally been the professionals who most deeply internalize and embody dominant social norms and codes of conduct. Just think of how we use “professional” as a term of praise, meaning appropriate, competent, and reliable. The very concept of the “profession” is closely related to the idea of “vocation”: a quasi-religious calling that brings its own ethical code, often in the form of an oath that the practitioner is required to “profess”—hence the name. More than just following the rules most diligently, it’s professionals who are supposed to convey and enforce the rules. Teachers, social workers, lawyers, nurses—these are the people who tell others how to conduct themselves. But it’s now among teachers that rebellion has spread most quickly. Following on West Virginia’s successful teachers’ strike in February and March, educators have walked off the job in Oklahoma, Kentucky, Arizona, Colorado, and North Carolina. Nor is the trend limited to primary and secondary education. Graduate workers at the University of Illinois spent two weeks on strike in late February and early March. At Columbia University, graduate workers spent a week in April on strike, following a 93% strike vote (nearly matching the 99% of their counterparts at the New School). At Harvard, after a landmark pro-union vote this spring, graduate workers have just brought the university to the bargaining table – a watershed moment in higher education. Organizing campaigns are underway on many more university campuses, including recent victories for postdocs at the University of Washington and graduate employees at Georgetown University. Much the same is happening in health care, the other giant sector of professional labor. At Albany Medical Center in New York, nurses voted two-to-one to unionize in April. An organizing drive has recently begun at Johns Hopkins University Hospital, one of the country’s most prestigious institutions. And an astonishing 53,000 workers at the medical centers of the University of California went on strike in May after a 97% vote for a work stoppage. Professionals are not wholly unique. After all, all workers exercise judgment; every job requires skill, recognized or not. But autonomy from management has traditionally been an explicit part of the job description only for the credentialed. The reason, in fact, that professionals are such rule-followers is exactly because they must behave reliably to be trusted with this autonomy. Yet in recent years, this white-collar autonomy has been eroded. The testing regime imposed on public schools has routinized teaching. Nurses do paperwork rather than spend time bedside, and hospitals are systematically understaffed. The rise of contingent academic employment has eroded scholarly control over teaching and research—gutting the academic freedom once at the ethical core of the profession. Declining profits and intensifying competition for clicks have had a disastrous impact on journalistic working conditions, driving a wave of organizing across digital and print media. Traditionally, professionalism has been politically disabling. Its logic is individual and meritocratic rather than collective. It promotes the identification of the worker with the work. When workers cannot draw the boundary between themselves and their work, they may lose the ability to criticize their employers for taking advantage of them. They even may lose the ability to see themselves as workers at all. This is a recipe for fear of collective action. So when professionals seek to represent their interests, they’ve often tried to avoid conflict. A century ago, when the professions first emerged in their modern forms, virtually every one of them had a debate over how best to advocate for themselves. Should they organize themselves on a guild model and advance their interests by seeking to control credentialing and to influence public policy? Or should they pursue collective workplace action? In either case, who got to participate? Today, for example, two organizations represent American teachers. The older, the National Education Association, was founded on the guild model, and led by school and college administrators. Then, in the early twentieth century, teachers protesting the “factoryizing” of schools split away to form the American Federation of Teachers, a labor union. In a famous 1904 speech called “Why Teachers Should Organize,” Margaret Haley explained that teachers’ struggles for humane schools were “part of the same great struggle [as] the manual workers.” In this period, there existed many different types of skilled work. Some, like teaching, we would recognize as the ancestors of today’s professions, but others were forms of skilled manual labor now long-gone. Skilled craftsmen controlled production processes in many industries, which gained them security and status. Before he became a union leader and the country’s leading socialist, for example, Eugene Debs was a railway fireman, a skilled craft that earned him the position of a leading citizen in his hometown of Terre Haute, Indiana. People like Debs could easily consort with journalists, doctors, lawyers, and other such proto-professionals, who had not yet elevated themselves into a distinctive, superior social layer. Unions also went through brutal internal debates in this time over very similar questions to those facing the emergent professions. Should they confront their employers, or should they try to control access to jobs? Should they limit themselves by skill, race, and gender? Or should they organize everyone in an industry—or even the whole working class? The division we now take for granted between workers and professionals only emerged historically as skilled workers of all kinds sought answers to these questions. People we now call professionals were those who figured out how to protect their autonomy and privileges through the guild model, and we know them today as doctors, nurses, lawyers, and teachers. On the other hand, the old aristocrats of labor—the iron puddler, the machinist, the printer—are largely or entirely vanished now. Those skilled workers who became professionals bought themselves a century of respite, but they made themselves the political accomplices of the capitalist elite in exchange. Now capitalism has turned on them. What Margaret Haley called “factoryization” has returned with a vengeance, and professionals must decide again what to do. When skilled manual laborers came under such pressure a century ago, they eventually realized their best course was to make common cause with the unskilled masses. They had to reach across exclusionary lines of race, ethnicity, and status long held as sacrosanct. But when America’s great industrial unions formed in the 1930s, they were led in large part by skilled craftsmen displaced from their privileged positions, who had finally been driven to join with their lowlier workmates. In doing this, skilled workers were compelled to reimagine not just their strategies and alliances, but who they were themselves. The very identity of professional is a historical invention, an ideology rather than a reality. Like privileged Victorian craftsmen, professionals will have to trade in the distinctions that separate them from other workers for the commonalities that join them if they want to turn the tide. Remarkably, they seem to be awakening to this urgent necessity—perhaps just in time. Gabriel Winant is a historian and writer completing a PhD at Yale University.

Unlike Mo Salah, though, this is Mo Eisa’s first taste of professional football after swapping the Ryman South for League Two with Cheltenham Town last summer. Eisa is making history in his maiden season, all the more impressive given that 12 months ago he was at eighth-tier Greenwich Borough, giving Godalming Town the runaround in front of 156 spectators. Finding the net is in the family; Eisa’s younger brother, Abobaker, signed for Shrewsbury Town in January after impressing at Wealdstone. At 3.13pm last Saturday Mo and Abo scored in the same minute, the latter getting his first for the club, an eerie oddity and another step on an extraordinary journey for brothers who left Khartoum, the capital of Sudan, for Camden at the age of nine. “Some people may not have got out of that situation that I was in, so I feel blessed,” Mo Eisa says. “They have obviously had a few issues and civil wars. My family was there last summer actually but now it is more settled down and everything’s better in a way. Coming to London and to do what I am doing now compared with a few years ago, I wouldn’t have thought it was possible. “Growing up, from a young age I was playing football with just friends, not for a proper team and that’s a different experience. We used to play every day and I got a couple of skills from one of my cousins because he was pretty good. The facilities were way different; it’s not like how it is here. When we moved to London we had astroturfs and in Sudan we didn’t really have that. It was just normal pitches, grass pitches with not a lot of grass on. But that was home.” He joined ProTouch, an academy based in Islington, at 14 and had trials at Norwich City and Southend United before joining Oxford United as an apprentice. But via Dartford, Corinthian and a loan spell at Leatherhead, it was at Greenwich, managed by the former Millwall striker Gary Alexander, that his prolific form – 57 goals across two seasons – more than pricked the ears of Pete Johnson, Cheltenham’s chief scout and the manager Gary’s brother, who offered Eisa a day’s trial. Not that it went to plan. “I was probably just trying too hard,” Eisa says at the club’s training pavilion. “Everything was going wrong; I didn’t score, I didn’t do anything. I was nervous but luckily they invited me back for three days and I did well.” Eisa earned a 12-month contract but after four goals in his first three games he signed fresh terms until 2020. His 22 Football League goals this season are a club record in a Football League campaign. On leaving Greenwich in search of full-time football he was rejected by league clubs worried about his strength and slender frame. He trained with Boreham Wood and says he would “probably have played in the Conference with them this season” if Cheltenham had not come calling. Twenty-four goals later it has been a fairytale first season for Eisa, who lives round the corner from the training ground with three of his team-mates, Jamie Grimes, Jaanai Gordon and Emmanuel Onariase, in a flat owned by the chairman, Paul Baker. His success has not gone unnoticed by supporters at Cheltenham Lido either. “I went to the pool after a game with Nige [Atangana] and Ilias [Chatzitheodoridis] for a recovery session and we saw a bunch of kids shouting: ‘Mo, Mo, Mo!’ I like all of that interaction. It was good. It’s a totally new thing for me but it’s a nice feeling to have, people recognising you on the streets and stuff like that.” For Eisa, who spoke little English on arrival in London, turning professional has brought many challenges. He has risen to most, referencing a shift in training intensity, learning how to deal with a nine-game goal “drought” and shaking those nerves. “In non-league there were sometimes 50 fans maybe, and now it’s around a couple of thousand, some games even more – like against Coventry it was 7,000,” the 23-year-old says. The watershed moment was seemingly when West Ham United came to town in the EFL Cup, a month after he signed. “That was live on TV as well,” he says. “I had never been on TV. I’ve recorded that and sometimes I’ll go back and watch that again. If I am having a bad spell, I go back and remind myself of what I was doing before.” The Eisas, like the Sessegnons or Ayews, are one of few pairs of siblings in professional football and they are immensely proud of each other’s journey. Mo went to Wembley to support Abo in the Checkatrade Trophy final this month and they often play Fifa on Xbox together. At the same time they are very different; Abo finishes his biomedical science degree at Brunel University after exams next month. “My brother’s very smart; I wasn’t smart,” he says. “He always wanted to do football but he had to do education as well and I was just focused on football.” As kids, they shared a competitive edge. “Funnily enough every position I was, and I started off in centre midfield, he would then be in centre midfield,” he says, smiling. “I would move out to left wing, then so would he, and I’d go to striker, and he’d be a striker. But now he is a winger. On our summer breaks in London we would have kickabouts and we used to play with and against each other. He wasn’t as good then if I’m being honest but I have seen him rise up and that’s why he’s got his move. I knew I was going to get my chance eventually and he knew he was going to get his.” Talking points • Jack Lester became the 48th Premier League or EFL managerial casualty this season on Monday after exiting Chesterfield. Those numbers put the manager-of-the-moment Danny Cowley’s recent comments into perspective. “We’re very careful not to get ahead of ourselves and run before we can walk,” he said of himself and his brother, Nicky. • Pete Winkelman has apologised to supporters for MK Dons’ disastrous season after sacking the manager, Dan Micciche, on Sunday. “I thought going down from the Championship was bad but to be in this position is just unthinkable,” the club’s chairman said, with the team in grave danger of being relegated from League One. • And welcome back to Macclesfield Town who ended their six-year exile from the Football League after winning the National League."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/apr/24/england-suspected-ball-tampering-australia-perth-alastair-cook","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-24T19:22:17Z","webTitle":"England suspected ball tampering by Australia at Perth, says Alastair Cook","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/24/england-suspected-ball-tampering-australia-perth-alastair-cook","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/apr/24/england-suspected-ball-tampering-australia-perth-alastair-cook","fields":{"headline":"England suspected ball tampering by Australia at Perth, says Alastair Cook","bodyText":"Alastair Cook has admitted to suspicions among the England team of ball-tampering by Australia during the Ashes series. Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft are all serving lengthy bans after the latter was caught using sandpaper on the ball during the Cape Town Test against South Africa in a premeditated plan to obtain reverse swing. Smith, the Australia captain, insisted it was a one-off. Asked if he believed that to be the case, Cook pointed to the third Ashes Test, where England were bowled out on a final day that had been delayed by rain, as one instance that was queried by his team-mates during their 4-0 defeat. “We did think in Perth, when the outfield was wet after the rain, they managed to get the ball reversing. I didn’t see anything,” Cook said. “But there’s also that thing about whether reverse swing comes the quicker you bowl. Back in 2005 we had SimonJones and Freddie Flintoff, who were quicker than the Aussies – they managed to get reverse swing and the Aussies didn’t, so we have to be very careful there. “We were curious in that series at certain moments but we couldn’t get the ball up to 90mph and they consistently could, so it’s easy sitting here. No one really understands [reverse swing].” Cook will make his return for Essex at Hampshire on Friday in preparation for what will be a 13th summer of international cricket. But, though the sport’s landscape is shifting and a new selector is in place, his hunger is unabated. By his own admission the recent tour of New Zealand passed by Cook somewhat with a top score of 14 in four innings. And while he gorged on 244 not out during the Boxing Day Ashes Test, his winter overall was one of fleeting time spent at the crease. As a result the 33-year-old accepts that murmurs have again resurfaced as to his longevity but, while there is a new man in Ed Smith heading the selection process, Cook insists his own challenges remain the same as ever. “My job never changes,” said Cook, speaking at an event to mark the return of Yorkshire Tea national cricket week (18-22 June). “It’s to score runs at the top of the order. If someone taps me on the shoulder and tells me they don’t want me to open for England, it is going to hurt at this precise moment because I want to carry on. “The hunger and desire is still there but no one has a God-given right to play for England. You have to score the runs to justify your place. Since I’ve come home I’ve started to look at my preparation. Have I got it right? Do I need to change things? Because that’s the right way to do it. I will never sit here and say I’ve cracked the game or will ever be perfect.” With a paucity of alternatives it still seems a given that Cook will take the field when England host Pakistan at Lord’s next month and, should he do so, he would equal Allan Border’s record of 153 consecutive matches. It would be the latest testament to the fitness and mental obduracy of England’s record run-scorer but in an era of Twenty20 – or even the ECB’s proposed new 100-ball tournament – the question remains as to where the next Test players will come from. While he is the latest centrally-contracted player to offer predictable support to England’s new short-form competition – after Joe Root, Eoin Morgan and Stuart Broad – and believes social media would have derided Twenty20 back in 2003 had it existed, Cook has been pondering the same thing. He said: “Why would you put yourself through the stresses and strains of the five-day game when you can play three hours or two and a half hours of crash-bang-wallop? For a deep-down cricket fan, it’s very different from what we know. But that doesn’t mean it can’t go back the other way. There are a few guys now just playing white-ball cricket but there’s very few who can do that. For most people, to earn a living you’re going to have to play four-day cricket as well.” Cook believes there is a decent talent pool from which Ed Smith can construct a Test side but he believes patience will be needed if they are to match the side who last beat Australia away in 2010-11. “There were probably 14 cast-iron Test cricketers you could have picked from, with a lot of skill and experience. We are probably not at that stage. There are a lot of unanswered questions,” he said, “but I do think the talent is there.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/24/trump-iran-deal-macron-new-agreement-white-house-visit","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-24T18:59:38Z","webTitle":"Macron pitches new Iran deal to sweeten existing agreement for Trump","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/24/trump-iran-deal-macron-new-agreement-white-house-visit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/24/trump-iran-deal-macron-new-agreement-white-house-visit","fields":{"headline":"Macron pitches new Iran deal to sweeten existing agreement for Trump","bodyText":"Emmanuel Macron has proposed negotiations on a “new deal” aimed at curbing Iran’s military power and regional activities, to exist alongside a three year-old agreement that restricts the country’s nuclear programme. Amid the pageantry of a state visit laced with some characteristically undiplomatic touches from Donald Trump, the French president offered the idea of a new deal at a joint White House press conference with his US counterpart as a way of salvaging the 2015 agreement, which Trump has threatened to leave. The offer seemed calculated to appease the US president’s discontent with the current agreement, the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Programme of Action (JCPOA) by proposing a broader initiative to tackle other elements of Iran’s challenge in the region, particularly its ballistic missile programme, and its military role in Syria. “I always said we should not tear apart the JCPOA and have nothing else,” Macron said. “This would not be a good solution.” But it was unclear if Trump had agreed. Macron is on the first state visit to take place during Trump’s presidency. The two presidents have gone out of their way to stress their personal chemistry, planting a tree on the White House south lawn, holding a dinner at George Washington’s house at Mount Vernon and hugging, hand-holding and cheek-kissing at the White House on Tuesday, where a traditional arrival ceremony featured nearly 500 members of the US military and a booming 21-gun salute. But the intimacy took an awkward turn when Trump took Macron by surprise, ostentatiously brushing what he said was dandruff from the French president’s jacket. “We have a very special relationship, in fact I’ll get that little piece of dandruff off,” Trump said. “We have to make him perfect – he is perfect.” Saving the Iran nuclear deal would be a diplomatic coup for Macron, who has taken a political gamble in befriending a US president who is deeply unpopular in Europe. At a joint press conference in the East Room of the White House, Macron observed that while Trump saw the Iran nuclear agreement as “a bad deal”, he believes it is “not sufficient” and proposed a new deal, that would complement the JCPOA. “I’m not saying, we are moving one deal to another,” Macron said, but added that the JCPOA was just one aspect of the problems Iran presented. He said that while the JCPOA restricted Iran’s major nuclear activities until 2025, a new deal would go further, imposing a permanent check on those activities, while also limiting the country’s development of ballistic activities, and its military operations across the region, particularly in Syria. The new agreement would include regional powers, like Russia and Iran, who are involved in the Syrian conflict. The French president said his White House discussions with Trump “make it possible to pave the way for a new agreement”. He also insisted: “France is not naive when it comes to Iran. We also have a lot of respect for the Iranian people … but we do not repeat the mistakes of the past.” In their remarks, Trump and Macron both hinted heavily that they were close to an understanding. Referring to his decision on 12 May on whether to continue signing presidential sanctions waivers, Trump suggested he had confided his intentions to his French counterpart. “Nobody knows what I’m going to do on the 12th,” he said, turning to Macron and adding: “Though Mr President, you have a pretty good idea.” “We can change and we can be flexible. In life, you have to be flexible,” Trump concluded at the end of the joint press conference. Macron said that US and French officials were working “intensively” together to fashion a new common approach to Iran and the region. “Regarding Iran, we have a disagreement regarding the JCPOA but I think we are overcoming it by deciding to work towards a deal, an overall deal.” At one point, however, Trump issued a blunt warning: “If Iran threatens us, they are going to pay a price like few countries have ever paid.” The US president was also asked about previous hints that he will withdraw US troops from Syria, where he, Macron and Theresa May recently coordinated airstrikes in response to the regime’s use of chemical weapons. “I would love to bring our incredible warriors back home,” he said. “But Emmanuel and myself have discussed the fact that we don’t want to give Iran open season to the Mediterranean, especially since we really control it to a large extent … We are discussing Syria as part of an overall deal.” The US president’s upcoming meeting with the North Korean dictator, Kim Jong-un, was also in the spotlight. In comments earlier on Tuesday, he raised eyebrows by describing Kim as “very open” and “very honourable”. Later Trump denied that the US had made any concessions in agreeing to the talks. “The end result is: we’ll see. Maybe good things will happen and maybe we’re all wasting a lot of time.” Pressed on what denuclearisation meant, he said: “It means they get rid of their nukes. Very simple. They get rid of their nukes … It would be very easy to make a simple deal and claim victory. I’m not going to do that. I want them to get rid of their nukes.” Meanwhile Trump admitted that Dr Ronny Jackson, his choice to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs, would soon make a decision on whether to withdraw after the emergence of allegations about inappropriate behavior on the job and overprescribing prescription drugs. “It’s totally his decision,” the president said. “I told Admiral Jackson just a little while ago, I said, ‘What do you need this for?’ This is a vicious group of people that malign and they do and I lived through it,” Trump said. “I said, ‘What do you need it for?’ He’s an admiral, he’s a great leader. And they question him about every little thing.” Jackson’s hearing had been set for Wednesday at the Senate veterans affairs committee but was indefinitely postponed amid the allegations. Trump, Macron and their wives attended a state dinner on Tuesday night. Although French diplomats dismiss media talk of a “bromance”, this is the sixth time the two presidents have met, with the most notable being Trump’s trip to Paris for the Bastille Day parade on 14 July last year. Since Macron came to power, the two presidents have had about 20 phone calls together, according to the Elysée Palace. At the end of their opening remarks on Tuesday, Trump declared: “I like him a lot.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/apr/26/you-cant-just-keep-saying-sorry-readers-on-amber-rudd-and-windrush","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-26T11:03:02Z","webTitle":"'You can’t just keep saying sorry': readers on Amber Rudd and Windrush","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/apr/26/you-cant-just-keep-saying-sorry-readers-on-amber-rudd-and-windrush","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/apr/26/you-cant-just-keep-saying-sorry-readers-on-amber-rudd-and-windrush","fields":{"headline":"'You can’t just keep saying sorry': readers on Amber Rudd and Windrush","bodyText":"‘You can’t just keep saying “sorry”’ I can’t see how Damian Green had to resign over a relatively trivial matter, yet for this hostile environment issue and the deep trauma it has caused for so very many people, no one has yet fallen on their sword.

If there were a fresh election soon, this series of scandals would be enough, probably, to put this government into opposition for much longer than Tony Blair achieved with the previous Tory government! I wouldn’t shed a tear at that passing. TimMellor ‘Clearly May is rattled’ Responsibility is a strange thing, isn’t it? Governments tell voters that they should take more responsibility for their own destiny yet as soon as something like this Home Office scandal erupts, they rush to find a scapegoat. A fine example of behaviour to present to the country. It is never their fault. Clearly May is rattled. Escapee99 ‘The architect of this scandal now resides in 10 Downing Street’ This is a scandal bubbling beneath the surface for some years, and the culprit and architect of it now resides in 10 Downing Street. The public service is now riddled with spurious, meaningless targets, but this one has nasty effects on the people caught up in them. Years ago, May warned her colleagues not to be seen as the “nasty party”. How ironic, because that is exactly what they have become. foryniner ‘Is it any wonder we’ve therefore allowed a “hostile environment” approach?’ This was always the inevitable conclusion of the entire anti-immigration rhetoric of UK politics for the last decade. “Oh but isn’t it horrible” wail the tabloids, who did the most to stir it up. The entire immigration “debate” has been boiled down to “how much do you hate immigration” in the mainstream. So when people complain that “you’re not allowed to debate immigration” they’re right, but in entirely the opposite way to what they think. Nobody, literally nobody, in the mainstream makes the case that immigration is a good thing, and yes that includes the Labour party for the full length of that time as well. Is it any wonder we’ve therefore allowed a “hostile environment” to take hold and deport innocent citizens?

One tweeter likened them to the cast of some new ITV crime drama; another Photoshopped the image to look like an ad for ambulance-chasing personal-injury lawyers. “Manic Street Teachers” was another cutting bon mot. And this gig becomes a lesson in snarling intellectualism, beginning in typically wordy fashion before the band have even appeared, as a quote from Albert Camus hangs on the big screen in ominous red capital letters. “The modern mind is in complete disarray,” it reads. “Knowledge has stretched itself to the point where neither the world nor our intelligence can find any foothold. It is a fact that we are suffering from nihilism.” Finding things to say has never been a struggle for this Blackwood secondary school-formed trio, not least for the band’s gangly, mouthy, sunglasses-wearing bassist and lyricist Nicky Wire. Their 14th album Resistance Is Futile is rich with familiar existential ponderings through a prism of art, literature and leftwing politics, touching on all from Yves Klein, Francis Bacon and David Bowie to the doomed marriage of Dylan Thomas and Caitlin Macnamara, and lots of ruminations on the current information-saturated human condition foreshadowed by Camus. But it feels like some of the melodic and performative conviction that typically fires their ideas has faded, as the galloping clip of the band’s remarkable latter-career renaissance period perhaps inevitably starts to slow. Opener International Blue is a classic glam-banging Manics single, distinguished by one of those rifle-fire guitar riffs at which frontman James Dean Bradfield so excels. But of the four other new songs they play tonight, Distant Colours and People Give In included, it’s hard to imagine any of them sticking around their setlist any longer than current promotional duties necessitate. The rest is a mixture of the reliably magnificent, the obscure and the curiously judged. Motorcycle Emptiness roars like a battle cry in memory of the genius and cheekbones of the band’s missing-presumed-dead guitarist Richey Edwards, who is “here with us tonight” Wire promises. In an amusingly wimpy climax to a song about Welsh International Brigade volunteer fighters in the Spanish civil war, confetti cannons salute the final chorus of If You Tolerate This Your Children Will Be Next. Rarity 4 Ever Delayed is one for the “trainspotters” in the Manics fanbase, as Bradfield puts it, while the rousing Masses Against the Classes is another lesser-aired treat. Bradfield’s solo acoustic versions of Sleepflower, Faster and Kevin Carter, however, don’t exactly prove the kind of crowd-pleasing singalongs to ensure participation even in the cheap seats. Unperturbed, Wire – a man who you can always count upon to look like he’s gotten dressed in a charity shop in the dark – seizes the chance for a costume change, swapping an unusually understated black ensemble for silver spandex trousers, a plum-coloured suit jacket and a panama hat. A Design for Life proves the only moment that all present seem to agree upon as being truly essential. But then, the day when hearing this national treasure bellowed back at the Manics fails to raise the hairs on your neck is the day to question whether rock’n’roll gigs are still for you.

Speaking at a budget preview forum hosted by Industry Super Australia in Melbourne on Thursday, the Industry Super chief economist, Stephen Anthony, said the federal budget position had improved due to business receipts and cuts to personal benefit payments, particularly the disability support pension. “The problem here of course is we’re seeing this spill out on to our streets in terms of homelessness,” Anthony said. “I’d say there’s a bit of a false economy occurring there and I’d ask the tax office to consider the models that they’re using and their reliability because the flipside of what they’re doing is causing a lot of social damage and social harm.” The Turnbull government has tightened the eligibility criteria for the disability support pension, which the Australian Council of Social Services (Acoss) says resulted in a 63% drop in successful claims for the the pension between 2010 and 20116. People who are not successful in claiming the disability support pension but are still unable to work have been pushed on to unemployment benefit Newstart, which pays $170 less per week. • Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Anthony said the Turnbull government was on track to deliver a small surplus in 2021, pending “significant terms of trade windfalls and lots of good luck”. “So much of the government’s’ projections are based on a no slow-down scenario, no shock scenario, no foreign policy events that could knock us off course scenario,” he said. “[It is reliant on] very high terms of trade. We still have a large embedded structural deficit, we’re not really factoring in any sort of slow down that could come off the property market in Melbourne and Sydney or any sort of slow down that’s imported from China, so there are risks around the budget.” He said even a modest surplus was dependent on the government resisting the temptation to spend money in what is likely to be the last budget before the next federal election, saying “we don’t want to see tax cuts … we need tax reform, not necessarily tax cuts”. The treasurer, Scott Morrison, this week announced he had scrapped a planned $8.2bn increase to the Medicare levy to fund the national disability insurance scheme, saying strong economic growth in the past 18 months meant it was no longer necessary. The government has also telegraphed a personal income tax cut to address cost-of-living pressures in an environment of stagnant wage growth. Anthony said the current budget parametres anticipate that annual wages growth will return to more than 3%, a projection that he said is unlikely to be met."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"culture/2018/apr/27/what-to-see-this-week-in-the-uk","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-27T08:00:18Z","webTitle":"What to see this week in the UK","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/apr/27/what-to-see-this-week-in-the-uk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2018/apr/27/what-to-see-this-week-in-the-uk","fields":{"headline":"What to see this week in the UK","bodyText":"Five of the best ... films Avengers: Infinity War (12A) Anthony Russo, Joe Russo , 2018, US) 149 mins Marvel fans have spent 10 years building up to this almighty superhero battle – so it had better be worth the wait.

Then inject the drama of an EastEnders Christmas special or the high-energy camp of a panto and cram it all into a sweaty lycra singlet for your nan to scream at. Such a heady combo is akin to the idiosyncratic brilliance of British wrestling at its finest. This week ITV confirmed that World of Sport Wrestling (WoSW) is coming back to the channel for a 10-part series, three decades since the end of its original run. For 20 years, wrestling beamed into the living rooms and went head to head with the BBC, “engaging in a David and Goliath Saturday afternoon battle with Grandstand”. While World of Sport showcased other (arguably more legitimate) competitive endeavours during its Saturday show, it was the 4pm wrestling that really captured the imagination of its audience. In its prime, it drew millions of fans, from small children cheering for the babyfaces to OAPs shaking fists at the heels. It brought people together, and gave them the opportunity to get behind something innocent, eccentric and unmistakably British. In those days, grapplers such as Mick McManus, Klondyke Kate, Big Daddy and Giant Haystacks were household names, with the latter two developing a feud still revered as one of the greatest in wrestling history. When WoSW was dropped in September 1985, wrestlers stepped from the glow of telly limelight, into the social clubs and function rooms. American wrestling continued to thrive on the other side of the pond, with WWF superstars such as Hulk Hogan and the Ultimate Warrior taking the sport to a new level. But with little chance of the sport bringing fame and fortune to Brits, the UK scene went underground, with wrestling heroes having normal 9-to-5s, shedding their day-to-day attire for spandex and baby oil at the weekends. To be a wrestler, you had to really want it. Those desperate to be at the top of their game evolved their style. Promotions such as Fight Club: Pro are drawing thousands of fans at venues such as Birmingham’s NEC, and PROGRESS is gearing up for its biggest show at the SSE Arena Wembley – playing to passionate audiences. The WWE has seen the UK talent and their potential, giving them a global platform on which to showcase their abilities worldwide. Hardworking Pete Dunne from Birmingham, the fierce Welsh wonder Steffanie “Nixon” Newell, Dudley’s Tyler Bate and Trent Seven, a moustachioed powerhouse from Wolverhampton, are all regulars on the global WWE Network. While hopefuls once dreamed of one day making it to America to compete, now the US is looking to us for the best talent in the world. Popular Netflix series GLOW, a comedy based on the real-life Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling franchise, and movies such as The Wrestler and British wrestling film Walk Like a Panther prove there’s still a wider cultural interest in the sport. Now ITV has potentially found the perfect time to remind the wider, British audience of WoSW magic. Filmed in front of live audiences in Norwich in May, it promises to “combine the best of the past with incredible talent available today”. On New Year’s Eve 2016, the channel screened a one-off episode, testing the water and introducing the nation to stars such as the masked El Ligero, the world-class Viper and its star men Grado and man mountain Dave Mastiff. One of the main criticisms levelled at it by living room sceptics was that it wasn’t real, and that the outcome of the bouts are pre-determined. When Giant Haystacks was going at it with Big Daddy, the fact that the matches were a “work” was unknown to most. But turning away from wrestling for being fake is as ludicrous as writing off a Steven Spielberg blockbuster for being staged. Wrestling asks nothing of you but to suspend your disbelief for an hour or so, and allow yourself to watch a story unfold. When WOS Wrestling returns to our screens, take an hour to sit down with the kids to revel in an old, but not quite forgotten, British tradition. A lot of things have changed in the last 30 years, but our ability to scream blue murder at a hairy bloke in pants, hopefully, has not."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"stage/2018/may/01/british-theatre-stars-storm-the-nominations-for-2018-tony-awards","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-01T13:58:17Z","webTitle":"British theatre stars storm the nominations for 2018 Tony awards","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/may/01/british-theatre-stars-storm-the-nominations-for-2018-tony-awards","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/may/01/british-theatre-stars-storm-the-nominations-for-2018-tony-awards","fields":{"headline":"British theatre stars storm the nominations for 2018 Tony awards","bodyText":"Four British actors will battle it out at this year’s Tony awards in New York, leading a strong charge of UK talent that saw Harry Potter and the Cursed Child and the National Theatre’s revival of Angels in America showered with nominations. Jamie Parker (Harry Potter and the Cursed Child), Mark Rylance (Farinelli and the King), Tom Hollander (Travesties) and Andrew Garfield (Angels in America) will compete against the sole American, Denzel Washington (The Iceman Cometh), in the best actor category. British actors, playwrights, designers and directors have all been recognised in this year’s nominations. Glenda Jackson is up for best actress for her acclaimed performance in Edward Albee’s psychodrama Three Tall Women, which marked the former Labour MP’s return to Broadway after an absence of three decades. Jackson will compete against Amy Schumer (who starred in Steve Martin’s comedy Meteor Shower), Condola Rashād (Saint Joan) and Lauren Ridloff (Children of a Lesser God). The National Theatre’s much-revered revival of Tony Kushner’s two-part “gay fantasia” Angels in America, set in 1980s New York, received a total of 11 nominations: Marianne Elliott is in the running for best director, Nathan Lane is nominated for his performance as Roy Cohn, former attorney to Donald Trump, and Susan Brown and Denise Gough are both up for best actress in a featured role in a play. Gough said she was pleased that the British import of the American play had been so well-received on Broadway. “We’re doing New York’s play! That is a total privilege,” she said. “Wouldn’t that be terrible if we came back and you were all like, what have you done with our play?” Ian MacNeil and Edward Pierce are shortlisted for their scenic design for Angels in America, which features three revolving sets, and Paule Constable’s lighting design – which includes a number of striking fluorescent tubes – has also been nominated. Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, which is currently running in London’s West End with a different cast while its original stars perform in the Broadway transfer, received 10 nominations. They include best play, best director (John Tiffany), best scenic design (Christine Jones), best costume design (Katrina Lindsay) and best choreography (Steven Hoggett). Noma Dumezweni, who plays Hermione, is nominated for best performance by an actress in a featured role in a play. Set 19 years after the last Harry Potter book, with Harry’s son Albus struggling through a new term at Hogwarts, the two-part play is written by Jack Thorne, based on an original new story by JK Rowling, Thorne and Tiffany. In her five-star review, the Guardian’s New York critic Alexis Soloski called it “exuberantly, flabbergastingly theatrical”. It has broken box-office records on Broadway and the London production, still one of the West End’s hottest tickets, became the most decorated show ever at the Olivier awards last year, taking nine prizes. Anthony Boyle, who won an Olivier for best supporting actor for his portrayal of Scorpius Malfoy, son of Draco, is nominated for a Tony this year. The best director category includes nominations for Joe Mantello for Three Tall Women, Patrick Marber for his staging of Tom Stoppard’s exquisitely intricate comedy Travesties and George C Wolfe for a revival of The Iceman Cometh, Eugene O’Neill’s towering drama set in a New York saloon. Lucy Kirkwood is nominated for best play for her post-apocalyptic drama The Children, starring Deborah Findlay (also nominated for her performance), which originally ran at the Royal Court in London. Also in the best play category is Claire van Kampen’s Farinelli and the King, which opened at the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse back in 2015 and then transferred to the West End before heading to Broadway. Two new American musicals share the tally for most Tony nominations this year: Mean Girls, based on Tina Fey’s 2004 teen movie, and SpongeBob SquarePants: The Broadway Musical, based on the animated TV show set underwater. Both have received 12 nominations each. The Band’s Visit, a new musical about a group of Egyptian musicians who travel to a remote Israeli town, and a revival of Rodgers and Hammerstein’s Carousel have received 11 nominations each. A new stage version of Disney’s animated box-office smash Frozen receives three nominations including best music and lyrics for husband-and-wife team Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez. Earlier this year, Robert Lopez became the first person to achieve “double EGOT” status , recognised for twice winning Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony awards. Special Tony awards will be presented this year to John Leguizamo, “for his body of work and for his commitment to the theatre, bringing diverse stories and audiences to Broadway for three decades”, and to Bruce Springsteen for his one-man show Springsteen on Broadway, which combines music and storytelling. As previously announced, the 2018 special Tony award for lifetime achievement in the theatre will be presented to Andrew Lloyd Webber and Chita Rivera. The Tony nominations were announced on 1 May by actors Leslie Odom Jr and Katharine McPhee.

They have been travelling for weeks, marching up to 16 hours a day in the sweltering heat and charging through Mexican immigration checkpoints despite orders to stop. The marchers claim to be fleeing gang violence and collapsing governments in Central America, and they hope to find refuge in Mexico and the US. If you’re Donald Trump, you might think I’m describing the migrant caravan that has dominated conservative news coverage in recent days. But actually I could be describing any of the 20-odd caravans that have passed through Mexico in the last decade. That Trump is just discovering these Central American caravans now demonstrates just how little he understands a refugee crisis that has been years in the making. In 2015, I marched with a migrant caravan myself. I was in Mexico on a Fulbright fellowship, and I joined a caravan of over 400 people to document the human rights abuses that Central Americans face while travelling through the country. I know from personal experience that Trump’s characterizations of the current migrant caravan are flat-out wrong. To start, migrant caravans often go by another name in Spanish: the “Viacrucis Migrante”, or the Migrant Stations of the Cross. In Latin America, the Stations of the Cross, which reenact Christ’s last steps and crucifixion during the Easter holidays, are an important part of religious ceremonies. Migrants, by organizing their own Viacrucis, are explicitly comparing their own persecution to the suffering Christ endured during his last moments on earth. Their march is as much peaceful pilgrimage as it is civil disobedience. Migrant Viacrucis marches started over ten years ago specifically to protest the increasing militarization of US and Mexican borders. In 2014, the US began quietly paying Mexico over $100m a year to catch and deport Central Americans along its border with Guatemala.Suddenly Mexican border enforcement was big business, and Mexico’s new anti-immigration program, dubbed the Southern Border Plan, was born. Within a year, detentions of Central Americans rose 79% under the plan, and detentions of child migrants ages 10 and under skyrocketed an astounding 541%. Mexico deported many migrants without due process, which is against international human rights mandate and, technically, Mexican law. Assaults, kidnappings, and murders of migrants have also increased largely because, under the plan, border enforcement has forced Central Americans to cross in increasingly dangerous and isolated areas run by gangs and cartels. Conditions on any migrant Viacrucis are rough, but after the plan, they became miserable. Not only did we have to walk hundreds of miles, but we slept exposed in town courtyards and had little access to toilets or showers. Sanitary items like toilet paper, diapers, and tampons were scarce. We scavenged in the jungle for mangoes and avocados and relied on the generosity of small pueblos for anything more. I lost fifteen pounds in two weeks, which I could afford, but there were worries about malnutrition and dehydration with our toddlers and elderly. I was also bitten by a brown recluse spider while sleeping in the open and required emergency surgery after I had an allergic reaction to the venom. Still, travelling with a Viacrucis is often the safest way to cross Mexico as a migrant. Many in our group were single mothers, toddlers, and even pregnant women. The Viacrucis had a disproportionately high number of LGBTQ migrants, who are assaulted and murdered at extremely high rates in Mexico and Central America. I was also surprised by how many people had already lived in the US. Ruben, a pastor in Los Angeles, moved to California over twenty years ago when he was just a teenager. Milton was working in Manhattan during 9/11 and sheltered ash-covered pedestrians in his apartment. Axel had lived on Long Island since he was a baby but was deported for the first time after a woman rear-ended him while he was driving his son to school. Because of these human stories, migrant Viacrucis marches routinely make Mexico’s national news each Easter. For years they were part of the novelty news cycle, curious human-interest pieces that only mildly annoyed Mexican officials, if they even registered on their radar in the first place. After all, a handful of nonviolent Central American immigrants on pilgrimage was but a blip in a country dealing with much more pressing issues like state-wide corruption and warring drug cartels. But after the plan, everything changed. When news coverage of the 2015 Viacrucis made headlines in Mexico City, approximately 100 Mexican federal police were sent to detain us. When the Viacrucis did not comply, the police beat everyone. Three vertebrae in one man’s neck were fractured after a policeman struck him with a baton, and another woman’s foot was shattered. The assault – which was later deemed illegal by the Mexico’s National Human Rights Commission, though no officer was ever held accountable – was ostensibly funded by the US government through the Southern Border Plan. Eventually, some migrants were granted temporary visas as a kind of official apology for the attack, but they expired after 20 days, leaving most people stranded once again in Mexico. These are the same visas Mexico is reportedly distributing to members of the new Viacrucis today. Regardless of migrant caravans’ effectiveness, it is important to keep in mind that the Viacrucis is a product of militarized borders and increased deportations, not the cause of them. Marching migrants are not part of a hostile take over, but rather the effect of one. They are the ones who have seen their countries and lives crumble under US intervention. During a traditional Viacrucis reenactment in Latin America, Christ cries out as he is crucified: “My God, why have you forsaken me?” Trump, and his evangelical base, must now decide if they will forsake the migrant Viacrucis as well."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/may/06/melissa-broder-why-i-lied-to-my-therapists","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-06T08:00:15Z","webTitle":"Why I lied to my therapists","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/06/melissa-broder-why-i-lied-to-my-therapists","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/06/melissa-broder-why-i-lied-to-my-therapists","fields":{"headline":"Why I lied to my therapists","bodyText":"I remember the exact moment when I realised my therapist could not stop death. I had just watched a man die – my boyfriend’s step-father, the first death I’d ever seen up close – and it became achingly clear to me that I, too, would one day face the dying process. It wasn’t that I was previously unaware of my own inevitable death. I’d talked about it, written about it, and joked about it as much as any respectable poet should, which is to say, a lot. When I wasn’t pontificating glibly about taking the big dirt nap, I’d been greatly haunted by the reality of my own demise – particularly when coming down off psychedelics or following an all-nighter on speed. Yet in those other instances, it was as though I had a choice as to whether or not to look death in the face. Even on drugs, I was always eventually able to pull the curtain down and think about something else. But now it was as if the barrier between me and death-awareness had vanished. There was no curtain left to pull down, no blinder left to put on. I feared that it was finally happening: the bats in my belfry had at last taken over and I would be trapped permanently in this state. Seated on my therapist’s avocado-green replica of a midcentury modern sofa, I told her about my existential terror. She replied to me using words meant to soothe, but I do not recall what she said. All I could hear were my own thoughts: my therapist cannot change the fact that I’m going to die. She can’t even change the fact that she is going to die. Compared with death, my therapist is just a crappy pound-shop hairbrush. In that moment, I felt a great loneliness. I tried to pacify myself with the idea that every human being faces death eventually. But who cared what those other people would be doing? My death was mine, and mine alone. There remained a whole layer of my being that no one, not even my therapist, could touch. I’ve found it easiest to be honest about myself when I am anonymous, disembodied, not sitting across from another human being. About six years ago, I started an anonymous Twitter account called @SoSadToday, because I was going through a cycle of anxiety and depression that therapy, medication and everything else I’d used to treat it in the past, weren’t working. What began as a small gesture of tweeting into the void in a dark corner of the internet has now amassed more than half a million followers. In many ways, I feel more connected to them than I have ever felt with a therapist. We all come from different backgrounds, but there is a universality of feeling among us. While the account is no longer anonymous, I still pretend it is. It’s as though I have my hands over my eyes and am playing the game of “If I can’t see you, then you can’t see me.” People often ask me if I am always sad or if @sosadtoday is a character. I’d say that, in totality, I’m not always sad. But I’d also say the account is not a character or a persona either. Rather, @SoSadToday reflects one part of me – the part that I have difficulty showing others, including therapists, in my daily life. After 18 years of therapy I decided to take a break this year to see if I would be OK on my own, and digest some of what I’ve learned. Prior to this hiatus, I’ve seen a range of different therapists and, while some were more effective than others, I’ve always felt there were parts of me that were untouchable to all of them. In many ways, this has been my own doing as I’ve gone to great lengths to avoid being fully seen. As an alcoholic in my early 20s, I would go to therapy drunk so as to assuage the tremors and rapid heartbeat that came with facing another individual sober. If my therapist knew I was steeped in alcohol, she never let on. Nor did I ever discuss my drinking problem with her. We would talk about my mother, sex, physical anxiety. Sometimes I would even have vodka-enhanced revelations, or “breakthroughs”. But these were built on shifting sand. So what was the point of even going to therapy if I couldn’t be honest? Why bother sitting in her office drunk when I could just be at the bar? I continued to go because I did want to get well. I just wanted to get well without giving up alcohol. It was alcohol, I felt, that gave me the courage to go and participate in my own “healing”. I wanted to be OK, but was scared to reveal how deeply I wasn’t. After getting sober at 25, I then spent my late 20s and early 30s in New York in psychodynamic therapy, attempting to find relief from the chronic panic attacks that still plagued me. Sometimes I would have a panic attack right in the middle of a session, the perfect opportunity to really take a look at the physical experience with someone who was supposed to understand. And yet, whenever the attack happened during a session, I would say absolutely nothing. I would talk right around it instead. I told myself the reason for my reluctance to reveal the panic attack was that I didn’t want to hurt the feelings of whichever therapist I was seeing. Wasn’t therapy supposed to be a “safe space”? Why was I having a panic attack there? I didn’t want to make her think she was bad at her job – a therapist who triggers anxiety in people. In truth, I was afraid that if I was having a panic attack in therapy, then there was something incurably fucked-up about me. If I wasn’t OK in a therapist’s office then how could I be OK anywhere else? So I suffered my shortness of breath, sweating palms and dissociation on my own, all the while bantering about my childhood. I felt much less vulnerable conveying an intellectual understanding of my family history than saying: “Right now, I feel like I’m suffocating.” I preferred to woo a therapist with my sense of humour, self-knowledge and intellect – thus convincing myself that I was at least sane enough to charm. I’ve had plenty of therapists say: “If you need me you can call me.” But I’ve never taken them up on that. To me, that kind of vulnerability – to really need someone in a time of crisis – felt unsafe. Better not to be the needy patient, a person who is “too much”. Better to call an anonymous hotline instead. At least the voice on the other end had no idea who I was. It may sound strange to attend therapy, all the while only allowing the therapist into the foyer of my consciousness. But as a person with anxiety disorder, I figured that some therapy was better than no therapy. For all of the discomfort of being misunderstood, there were times when I received great solace and help – in romance and family life – from therapy. What’s more, I couldn’t imagine not being in therapy. As an American, a Jewish woman and a New Yorker, it was just what you did. I once had a mediocre therapist in New York for seven years, because I was afraid to break up with her. She was a kind old lady, a 1970s abstract artist who provided Jungian analyses of my dreams. But if I tried to discuss my eating disorder, she’d say: “What if you eat a nice hardboiled egg?” Or, if I wanted to explore my body dysmorphia: “Just put calamine lotion on that zit.” I wanted to say: “Listen, it’s not about the zit. It’s about my feelings of self-worth as they are hyper-related to a minor physical flaw.” But I never did, because it seemed easier to just accept the useless advice than confront her. In the end, it took me moving 3,000 miles away to make the final break. Therapists often use the in-office relationship as a mirror of the way their patients are in the world. They will read deeper meaning into an innocuous action, like when I am 10 minutes late and spend the rest of the session discussing whether the lateness was intentional – if there was something I was avoiding. Sometimes, there was just traffic. But when it comes to a fear of disclosure – of being honest with the person hired for that purpose – I do think it can be a reflection of the patient’s life. My reluctance to be fully honest with therapists reveals an ingrained expectation of rejection or judgment on a more universal level. My inability to speak up for myself conveys a fear of confrontation, of saying no, of not being liked. It also depicts an innate fear of scarcity – that if I speak up, then I will be cut off and left out in the cold with no one. What’s more, there is a self-centredness in my reluctance to break up with someone who isn’t a good fit. It’s as though I perceive myself as so important to another person that the impact on their life left by my leaving will be devastating. The therapy modality that has had the most profound effect on my anxiety disorder is a mindfulness-based form of cognitive behavioural therapy called acceptance-commitment therapy. I like the fact that there are worksheets and homework, as though I am merely collecting data on thoughts and their related feelings for analysis. When I bring in the data to my therapist, I feel a level of detachment – as though we are scientists conducting a study. Together, in the lab, my fellow scientist and I parse which thoughts are true and which are fantasy. But on a more personal, humanistic level, there is some kind of existential need in me to avoid touching my own unknowableness. It is as though I fear that I, like the whale in Moby-Dick, can never be seen in totality or understood fully. Thus, by only revealing pieces of myself, I preclude facing that vast enormity of the self. At times, I feel that a stranger walking down the street could tell me more about myself in 10 seconds than I could ever really know. Maybe, despite the best efforts of psychology, we aren’t ever entirely knowable to ourselves. When people ask us how we are, we lie for different reasons. Sometimes we say, “I’m OK,” because it’s just easier. Who wants to be the person that responds: “Well actually, I’ve been staring into the dead centre of a gaping existential hole. Thanks for asking!” Other times we have no idea we’re lying. We say “I’m OK,” because we don’t know that we’re not. The Pisces by Melissa Broder is published by Bloomsbury at £16.99.

The FIA confirmed on Tuesday the rule changes would be implemented next season, subject to approval by the World Motor Sport council, although it is understood there was opposition from a majority of teams. The FIA had begun investigating the difficulties in passing after this season’s opening race in Australia, where there were only five overtaking manoeuvres. The key changes are: a simplified front wing intended to direct air inward rather than outside the front wheels, reducing the turbulent air for following cars; a wider and deeper rear wing, to allow a larger wing flap and increase the effect of the DRS; simplified front brake ducts with no winglets. “The studies indicated a likelihood of a positive impact on racing and overtaking,” the FIA said. The proposals had been discussed at the Bahrain Grand Prix but no agreement was reached, with Albert Park being notoriously difficult to pass on being cited. Nonetheless research continued, with the teams taking part. A vote was held on Monday, the final day that regulation changes can be enforced without unanimous approval. Williams are the only team to have publicly supported the changes but it is understood Mercedes, Force India and Sauber were also in favour. The proposals are based around the research the F1 sporting director, Ross Brawn, has conducted while planning for the major regulation change in 2021. Given the sport adopted new rules last year and is to do so again in two years, there was opposition based on maintaining the status quo for stability. The proposals have been pushed by the FIA and F1’s owners, Liberty Media, in an effort to improve the show. The last major regulation change in 2017 made for faster cars with higher downforce but created considerable turbulent air in their wake. This reduces downforce for pursuing cars and prevents them from closing. Lewis Hamilton is among many drivers who have been critical of the situation. After pursuing Sebastian Vettel in Australia, he said: “I couldn’t for the life of me, with all my abilities, all my tools, I just couldn’t get close enough to be in fighting range.” Brawn described it as “an important step”, and one taken after considerable analysis. “It’s important to note that the decision has been taken after an intense period of research into the FIA’s proposals, which were made with the support of Formula One and, conducted by a majority of the teams,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/may/03/mercedes-sieffs-recipe-for-super-spring-green-salad","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-03T05:00:33Z","webTitle":"Mercedes Sieff’s recipe for super spring green salad","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/03/mercedes-sieffs-recipe-for-super-spring-green-salad","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/03/mercedes-sieffs-recipe-for-super-spring-green-salad","fields":{"headline":"Mercedes Sieff’s recipe for super spring green salad","bodyText":"This salad is my go-to dish whenever I need a boost of energy and green goodness.

Drummed out of the Home Office, she can now spend more time in her constituency of Hastings: the same seaside resort she found irresistible because “I wanted to be within two hours of London, and I could see we were going to win it”. Yet Rudd loves her electorate, rhapsodising about some of them as people “who prefer to be on benefits by the seaside … they’re moving down here to have easier access to friends and drugs and drink”. Relax. I come neither to praise nor to bury Rudd, but to analyse her. Or, rather, to place her in context. What stands out about this latest crash-and-burn is how well it represents the current Westminster elite, even down to the contempt for the poor sods who vote for them. Rudd exemplifies a political class light on expertise and principle, yet heavy on careerism and happy to ruin lives. All the key traits are here. In a dizzying ascent, she went from rookie MP in 2010 to secretary of state for energy in 2015, before being put in charge of the Home Office the very next year. Lewis Hamilton would kill for such an accelerant, yet it leaves no time to master detail, such as your own department’s targets. Since 2014 Sajid Javid, Rudd’s replacement, has hopped from culture to business to local government, rarely staying in any post for more than a year. Margaret Thatcher kept her cabinet ministers at one department for most of a parliamentary term, but this stepping-stone culture turns urgent national problems – such as police funding and knife crime – into PR firefighting. Another hallmark of this set is the disposability of its values. Cameron hugs Arctic huskies, then orders aides to “get rid of all the green crap”. As for Rudd, the May cabinet’s big liberal vowed to force companies to reveal the numbers of their foreign staff, stoking the embers of racism in a tawdry bid to boost her standing with Tory activists. Praised by Osborne for her “human” touch, she was revealed this week privately moaning about “bed-blocking” in British detention centres. And when things get sticky, you put your officials in the line of fire. During the Brexit referendum, Osborne revved up the Treasury to generate apocalyptic scenarios about the cost of leaving. While doomsday never came, his tactic caused incalculable damage both to the standing of economists and to the civil service’s reputation for impartiality. Rudd settled for trashing her own officials for their “appalling” treatment of Windrush-era migrants. None of these traits are entirely new, nor are they the sole preserve of the blue team. At the fag end of Gordon Brown’s government, the sociologist Aeron Davis studied the 49 politicians on both frontbenches. They split readily into two types. An older lot had spent an average of 15 years in business or law or campaigning before going into parliament – then debated and amended and sat on select committees for another nine years before reaching the cabinet. The younger bunch had pre-Westminster careers that typically came to little more than seven years, often spent at thinktanks or as ministerial advisers. They took a mere three years to vault into cabinet ranks. This isn’t “professionalisation”. It is nothing less than the creation of a new Westminster caste: a group of self-styled leaders with no proof of prowess and nothing in common with their voters. May’s team is stuffed full of them. After conducting more than 350 interviews with frontbench politicians, civil servants, FTSE chief executives and top financiers, Davis has collected his insights in a book. The argument is summed up in its title: Reckless Opportunists. Davis depicts a political and business elite that can’t be bothered about the collective good or even its own institutions – because it cannot see further than the next job opportunity. In this environment, you promise anything for poll ratings, even if it’s an impossible pledge to get net migration down to the tens of thousands. Good coverage matters more than a track record – because at the top of modern Britain no one sticks around for too long. Of the 25 permanent secretaries in Whitehall, Davis finds that 11 have been in post less than two years. Company bosses now typically spend less than five years in the top job, down from eight years in 2010. Over that same period, their pay has shot up from 120 times the average salary to 160 times. Bish bash bosh! There is one field that revels in such short-termism: the City. What emerges from Reckless Opportunists is the degree to which City values have infected the rest of the British elite. Chief executives are judged by how much cash they return to shareholders, even if that means slashing spending on research and investment. Ministers either come from finance (Rudd, Javid) or end up working for it (Osborne and his advisers). Promise the earth and leave it to the next mug to deliver. Crash around, cash out and move on to the next job. State these new mantras, and you see how Jeremy Corbyn, whatever his other faults, can’t conform to them. You can also see how he poses such a threat to a political-business elite reared on them. Soon after May moved into No 10, she famously declared: “If you believe you are a citizen of the world, you are a citizen of nowhere. You don’t understand what citizenship means.” The press wrote it up as her threat to migrants. Yet the more I think about it, the more accurately I believe it describes her own shiny-faced team, her own poisonous politics, her own self-serving elite."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"stage/2018/may/01/tony-awards-2018-nominations-spongebob-mean-girls-harry-potter","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-01T16:51:24Z","webTitle":"Tony awards 2018: glitzy nominations reflect Broadway's blockbuster year","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/may/01/tony-awards-2018-nominations-spongebob-mean-girls-harry-potter","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/may/01/tony-awards-2018-nominations-spongebob-mean-girls-harry-potter","fields":{"headline":"Tony awards 2018: glitzy nominations reflect Broadway's blockbuster year","bodyText":"A humble sponge is feeling pretty good right now, though Katharine McPhee, one of the presenters of the 2018 Tony nominations, managed to mispronounce SpongeBob SquarePants: the Broadway Musical at least two different ways. (Leslie Odom Jr, the other presenter, also mangled the phonics, though this may have been a show of support.) In her defense she had to say it often: the jaunty tale of an absorbent undersea hero was nominated for 12 Tony awards, a tie with Mean Girls. Angels in America, The Band’s Visit, My Fair Lady and some English wizards also have plenty to celebrate. This was a strange-ish year on Broadway, with fewer than usual musical revivals and few new plays (with a couple of adaptations and one-person shows to make up the numbers). Hardly any musicals had all the critics cheering and much of the play acclaim has gone to two imports, as brilliant as they are long: Angels in America and Harry Potter and the Cursed Child. The nominations are a reminder that Broadway has mostly become a pricey tourist attraction. Though the majority of its tickets are still sold to locals, it is designed to appeal for a here-on-a-holiday crowd, with kid’s shows, movie adaptations and star vehicles dominating. These days, musicals are a surer bet than plays; adaptations and revivals are seen as safer than originals. Name recognition is seemingly a must. That strategy is working, in financial terms at least. This was another year for gangbuster Broadway receipts. Plays, especially those without stars – and even those with them – struggle at the box office. Many of the theaters that could house new work are filled with long-runners. With three Disney shows running, plus Wicked and Anastasia, there’s lots here for shorter patrons, but less to appeal to grown-ups. The 2018 Tonys have lavished plenty of love on shows that are trying to split the difference, between parents and their children, shows that decided to take entertainment seriously and exuberantly. The goofy, effervescent SpongeBob is the feelgood surprise of the morning. Though squishy at the box office, it’s a show unashamed of its silliness, and ambitious in its theatricality. While it likely will lose the big award to the grown-up melancholy of The Band’s Visit, the critical darling of the season, it has some strong possibilities for performance and design awards, maybe even a best director. They only other real contender is Mean Girls. It has a generic score and a merely adequate production, but Tina Fey’s witty book is a pleasure and there are some knockout comic turns. Angels in America, the prestige hit of the season, garnered 11 nominations. Cursed Child, a show that many had initially dismissed as a franchise affair, racked up 10, a testament to its strong cast, astonishing design and ingenious, exuberant direction. Looking across the categories, many of the nominations went as expected, though there were a few surprises, like an original score nod for Angels in America. There are precedents for this, of course, but it still points to the weakness and scarcity of new musicals. A choreography nomination for Harry Potter’s Steven Hoggett, also deserved, flashes the same indicators. Unusually, six female actors were nominated for a leading role in a musical. Katrina Lenk (The Band’s Visit) and Lauren Ambrose (My Fair Lady) were all but assured, with Hailey Kilgore (Once On This Island) likely. They have been joined by LaChanze (Summer: The Donna Summer Musical), Taylor Louderman (Mean Girls), and Jessie Mueller (Carousel), a Broadway favorite who some critics thought miscast. The stars of Frozen were shut out entirely and overall the show received only three nominations, which is cold. Pour a pina colada out for Escape from Margaritaville, which received none at all. Which is fine. Other no-hitters: The Parisian Woman, Marvin’s Room, Time and the Conways, M Butterfly, John Lithgow: Stories by Heart, Prince of Broadway, The Band’s Visit, Home for the Holidays. If The Terms of My Surrender was eligible, it was likewise not honored and the Bruce Springsteen solo, which chose not to put itself in contention, will receive a special award, as will John Leguizamo for Latin History for Morons, which also rounded out an anemic best play category. Unexpected nods included Amy Schumer – in a category that might as well be renamed This One’s for Glenda Jackson – for the tepidly received Meteor Shower and Deborah Findlay for strong work in the underrated The Children. (Francesca Annis ought to have joined her.) Summer’s Ariana DeBose and Carousel’s Renée Fleming were both mild surprises in a featured actress category that also includes Diana Rigg, who essentially received a nod for just showing up splendidly. There weren’t too many snubs, though James McArdle was ignored for his featured actor work in Angels in America, with nods going instead to his colleague Nathan Lane and two Lobby Heroes, Michael Cera and Brian Tyree Henry, as well as Iceman’s David Morse. Alex Newell, a Once On This Island favorite, did not crack featured actor in a musical. Some of the most interesting categories look to be the directing ones, with voters asked to compare the wildly different work of David Cromer and Tina Landau for best direction of a musical. In other years play directors Marianne Elliott or John Tiffany wouldn’t have much competition, but this year they have each other. Among the angels, wizards, teen witches, shellfish and melancholy musicians, it ought to be quite a night."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"film/2018/may/03/theres-this-idea-that-mothers-are-completely-selfless-diablo-cody-on-tully-and-the-juno-backlash","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-03T14:30:43Z","webTitle":"'There's this idea that mothers are completely selfless': Diablo Cody on Tully – and the Juno backlash","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/may/03/theres-this-idea-that-mothers-are-completely-selfless-diablo-cody-on-tully-and-the-juno-backlash","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/may/03/theres-this-idea-that-mothers-are-completely-selfless-diablo-cody-on-tully-and-the-juno-backlash","fields":{"headline":"'There's this idea that mothers are completely selfless': Diablo Cody on Tully – and the Juno backlash","bodyText":"Motherhood isn’t all it’s cracked up to be. Or at least it isn’t black and white, more of a stretched, washed-out, flesh-coloured maternity-bra shade inbetween, according to screenwriter Diablo Cody’s new film Tully. A decade on from her Academy Award-winning teen pregnancy rom-com Juno, Cody has created another lead who is expecting, this time turning Charlize Theron into baggy-eyed mum Marlo, who is one frozen pizza dinner away from the edge. She shouts. She accidentally drops an iPhone on her baby’s head. She slumps in front of her children, post-birth belly hanging out, much to their horror. Deflated, running on empty, she resembles a whoopee cushion being sat on in slow motion. Parenting has never looked so relatable. “The expectations [on] women are out of control,” says Cody, who takes our call in her garage, the only place in her LA home where there’s any quiet. She is herself juggling the Alanis Morissette musical she has scripted and which is about to open in Boston, a pilot for ABC that she is currently cutting, and being a mother of three. “I can’t believe the disdain towards women who have ‘let themselves go’. Why can’t I? I’m taking care of three small children; why am I also supposed to be skinny and hot?” Cody, 39, says she is a different Diablo from the one who sashayed down the 2008 Oscars red carpet in head-to-toe leopard print to collect her award for Juno’s screenplay. She wrote the rom-com in a month while sitting in Starbucks, and it took her from part-time stripper-blogger to star overnight. Her projects since Juno haven’t quite matched that film’s pop culture-puncturing potential: Megan Fox horror dud Jennifer’s Body; a Spielberg-produced TV series, United States of Tara, which lasted three seasons; underrated rock comedy Ricki and the Flash; brilliant but cancelled Amazon Prime series One Mississippi, which she co-created with standup Tig Notaro. But one aspect that has remained constant is her focus on creating female characters that defy the ordinary. Meryl Streep’s ageing rocker in 2015’s Ricki and the Flash, based on Cody’s mother-in-law, was particularly important – “a woman who had chosen to pursue her passion at the expense of her children, and she was viewed as a monster because of that,” she says. “We’re surrounded by men who have made that choice and are not demonised in the same way.” Tully is the third film in her trilogy with Jason Reitman, and the second with Theron after Young Adult, and again offers a view on the female experience that Cody rarely sees onscreen. And so there are money issues, a sexless marriage with a fairly useless husband, the exasperation at not knowing how to care for a young son with undiagnosed special needs. Sensing her desperation, Marlo’s brother buys the baby shower gift that every strained mother dreams of: help. Tully is a night nanny who breezily glides in, all toned abs and tanned limbs, to do the twilight shift so Marlo can rest. She’s a Manic Pixie Dream Girl version of Maria von Trapp, but also a device to help Marlo question what parts of herself have been lost under the tummy-huggers. Cody can relate. After having kids, she says, the question of “How do you access the person that you once were?” is something she grapples with. “I feel like a completely different human being on a cellular level since having children.” Not just through a loss of identity – in the film, Marlo is also suffering from postnatal depression, which Cody says there’s still a stigma around. She doesn’t say whether she had post-natal depression herself but does confirm she felt “that emptiness” for a while. “We’re told that we should feel completely blissed out after we have a baby, and that’s not always how women feel. It comes down to this idea that mothers are supposed to be completely selfless and if you’re indulging feelings of sadness or depression, that could be perceived by other people as selfish.” Tully isn’t just about parenting, however: “It’s about the great and intense transformation of middle age. It’s waking up and going: ‘Oh my God, I’m 40 – what happened?’” Is she feeling apprehensive about that coming milestone? “Yeah, and it’s strange. For years I’ve been regarded as ‘a young screenwriter’, or someone who has achieved a lot for her age. But no one’s going to give you a cookie for achieving something at 40. At this point, the pressure’s on me to perform and to sustain that. And also, we all know how older women are regarded, particularly in Hollywood. So it’s a little scary to think: ‘Oh, I will be discarded – that’s going to happen.’” Talking to Cody about these pressures, you wonder why she hasn’t been much involved in the wider public conversation about women in Hollywood that has occurred in the past year. Reading old interviews with her, Cody was outspoken and outraged, but recently her voice has been eerily absent; she quit Twitter in 2015 and hasn’t considered rejoining. “I’ve been expressing my viewpoint in my art for more than a decade now, so everybody knows that I’m a feminist,” she says. “I don’t think my voice would’ve been valuable in that conversation because, honestly, I don’t think Twitter is desperate for another quirky white woman spouting her opinion. Let’s hear from voices we don’t hear from.” Still, she is encouraged by the Time’s Up movement, even if she initially doubted its staying power. “I’m such a cynic that, when it first started happening, I was on a group text with a lot of my girlfriends, and they were all so excited and I was like: ‘This won’t last. Men in power are going to shut this down so fast.’ And then it didn’t, it just grew and grew. So I’m glad that I was proven wrong.” Cody says she is “heartened” too by the progress that Hollywood is making with “the types of roles that are being written for women. When I started out, a TV show or a film about a difficult woman was a hard sell, and now it’s something that people are soliciting from me.” But she finds it frustrating that women aren’t allowed to fail in the same way as men. “It drives me crazy that if a woman directs a movie and it doesn’t perform, people say: ‘Oh, they shouldn’t have let a woman direct it.’” . Cody’s own directorial debut, the 2013 comedy drama Paradise, was made while she was pregnant, and was subsequently panned by critics. “If a man directs a movie and it flops, there’s literally no discussion of the director’s gender,” she adds. “As a woman in a field where women are underrepresented, you often feel like you are representing women, and that’s ridiculous.” With Tully, Cody does seem to have come full circle since Juno. Knowing what she knows now about childbirth, would she have done anything about her first film differently? “In terms of pregnancy, no,” she says. “But I don’t feel I was clear enough in terms of why Juno chose to not have an abortion. It was simply because she did not want to.” The film was criticised by some for portraying abortion in a “negative” light. “It was not about any type of feeling that abortion was wrong – I’m pro-choice,” Cody says. “So for it to be interpreted as an anti-choice movie, that’s upsetting to me.” The Juno backlash is one reason that she has become “more private”. She refuses to self-censor – “it hasn’t affected my writing” – but says: “It’s certainly affected the way that I talk to people about the projects. I’ve become very boring because I want to protect myself and my children. I would like to just keep a low profile and continue to work, and I’ve had to really stay under the radar in order to accomplish that.” It’s depressing that a forthright person such as Cody has been forced to retreat from the public eye. But, like Marlo, she sees a “joy” in embracing a life more ordinary. “I take great pride in my boring life, because it’s not easy for me to be sedate. I’m a naturally curious, impulsive, self-destructive person. And I’ve had to put all that aside as a mum. I’m proud of that because it’s required a lot of discipline.” • Tully is released on 4 May in the US and the UK, and 10 May in Australia"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/blog/2018/may/01/roma-liverpool-believe-champions-league-vincent-candela","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-01T14:27:06Z","webTitle":"Stadio Olimpico will be an inferno: everyone here believes Roma can do it | Vincent Candela","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/may/01/roma-liverpool-believe-champions-league-vincent-candela","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2018/may/01/roma-liverpool-believe-champions-league-vincent-candela","fields":{"headline":"Stadio Olimpico will be an inferno: everyone here believes Roma can do it","bodyText":"In the last few days the city has been trembling with excitement. No one speaks about anything else: there is only Roma v Liverpool, in the bars and in the restaurants, among friends or on the metro. It will be a great celebration of sport with an extraordinary atmosphere: trust me, the Olimpico will be an inferno. For Roma it is only their second time in a European Cup semi-final, and therefore something historic: the climate inside the stadium will be even hotter and even more fiery than what we saw against Barcelona. Roma are famous around the world for their fans: they have passion, love and heart. I witnessed it and it was something wonderful. Against Liverpool you will see the same total support for the team: the stadium will be completely clad in red and yellow, the fans will sing for 90 minutes and then it is up to the team to do the business. The Roma fans are amazing. Even today, 15 years later, they stop when they see me and start to sing the song they sang about me when I was playing: it is incredible. They stop me everywhere, even at restaurants when I am out eating. They still salute me every day. They were the first fans to make a banner saying “I love you” to a team in the 80s and there is an incredible passion for the players who play for the team. The players are also fans of the team so there is total love between the supporters and the players and you will see the result of that against Liverpool on Wednesday night. Everyone here believes that Roma can get through, just as they should. The two late goals at Anfield have given everyone hope and I believe too. They have to play the perfect game, just like they did against Barcelona because Liverpool are better than Barça in my opinion. If everything goes our way then Roma can do it. In the capital everyone is hoping and believing. Liverpool, of course, have a former Roma player in their team, Mohamed Salah, and he will get a great reception. He did so well in the Roma shirt and got close to the fans. He had to leave because of finances and he will be greeted like a champion on his return to the club. In the Premier League, with Liverpool, he has taken another step forward: here in Italy he played a bit deeper and did not score as many goals. As far as I am concerned he can win the Ballon d’Or: he is a fantastic player and it will all come down to who wins the Champions League. If he does that, then the Ballon d’Or could well go to Momo. As far as the home team is concerned I think Daniele De Rossi could be decisive. He is the heart of this Roma side and a romanista, the fans’ hero. Against Barcelona he had an amazing assist and also scored from the penalty spot to make people believe the amazing comeback was on. One additional thing with him is that he can animate the fans at the Olimpico. Then we shouldn’t forget about Edin Dzeko, of course. I have played at Anfield against Liverpool and that is an experience that is impossible to forget. The fans sing for 90 minutes and they are extraordinary. I brought my kids because you have to live that experience. At the Olimpico the fans are further away but the Roma supporters are just as good as the Liverpool ones. You will see the colours, how much heart they put into it and the choreography of the tifo to help the team. The Olimpico will be an extraordinary sight for this incredible night of Champions League football.

The UK Statistics Authority (UKSA) made the comments after a voter complained about the claim, first made by the Cabinet Office, and then repeated by the five local boroughs testing voter ID on Thursday: Bromley, Woking, Gosport, Watford and Swindon. The Cabinet Office said the trial for English voters was deemed necessary “after reports of alleged electoral fraud through voter impersonation more than doubled between 2014 and 2016”, citing Electoral Commission data. The voter complained that not only was the dataset tiny – a rise from 21 cases in 2014 to 44 in 2016 – but that the Cabinet Office failed to mention that the number of allegations then fell by more than a third in 2017, to 28. They also pointed out that in 2016, a year that included the EU referendum, more than twice as many votes were cast than in 2014, meaning the rise in cases was even more statistically meaningless. The voter complained to the UKSA citing the use of the statistic by Swindon, having initially seen the claim on a leaflet produced by the council. Even though the UKSA does not officially comment on local authority statistics, a staff member responded. In an email passed by the voter to the Electoral Reform Society (ERS), they wrote: “We have reviewed the evidence presented in your email and we would tend to agree that the presentation of electoral fraud statistics in the letter is misleading. The figures could have been presented alongside the statement for clarity.” The verdict from the UKSA, the official body tasked with ensuring government departments use statistics accurately and honestly, is another rebuff for a project which has been condemned for targeting an extremely rare problem while potentially disenfranchising vulnerable groups such as older people and the homeless, who might not have the necessary ID. It has also emerged that none of the five trial areas have recorded any cases of voter impersonation in recent years, with one expert characterising the scheme as “a solution in search of a problem”. This week the ERS said it believed the plans were deeply flawed and represented a “calculated effort by the government to make voting harder for some citizens”. Darren Hughes, chief executive of the ERS, said the verdict of the statistics watchdog illustrated the “dodgy foundations” for the scheme. He said: “Ministers are grasping at straws, and their draconian push to make ordinary voters show their papers before using their right to vote now looks desperate. The government must stop trying to trick voters and come clean.” On Thursday voters in Bromley, Woking and Gosport will have to show photo ID, or two items showing their address from a list of approved documents. If they don’t possess these they can apply in person for a document allowing them to vote. Those in Watford and Swindon must bring their polling cards, while there are separate tests connected to postal votes. The Cabinet Office, which is leading the trial, argues that voter ID had been sought by the Electoral Commission and in a report on voting fraud by Tory MP Eric Pickles, and that voters in Northern Ireland have had to show ID since 2003. The Cabinet Office declined to comment on the use of the statistics, saying in a statement: “The Electoral Commission has been clear that it wants to see the introduction of voter ID as a priority. Electoral fraud is unacceptable on any level, and vulnerabilities cannot be allowed to continue and undermine the integrity of our democracy.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jul/23/why-database-of-syrian-atrocities-may-hold-key-to-future-justice","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-07-23T04:00:23Z","webTitle":"From kidnap to torture, the database rigorously logging every Syrian atrocity","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/23/why-database-of-syrian-atrocities-may-hold-key-to-future-justice","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jul/23/why-database-of-syrian-atrocities-may-hold-key-to-future-justice","fields":{"headline":"From kidnap to torture, the database rigorously logging every Syrian atrocity","bodyText":"On the third floor of a nondescript office block in downtown Copenhagen, about 2,500 miles from Damascus, a server gently hums. Its 600,000 gigabytes of data is comprised of thousands of photographs of men, women and children, witness accounts, ages, causes of death, place names, military ranks and weapon types. The database holds the story of Syria’s slide from authoritarianism into a civil war that, in the course of eight long years, has cruelly morphed into an international conflict with a scarcely imaginable human cost. This memory bank may also amount to the best hope many Syrians have of getting justice. The database is owned by the Violations Documentation Center in Syria (VDC), a non-governmental organisation founded by the lawyer Razan Zaitouneh, a Syrian human rights activist who was well-known even before the revolution erupted in 2011. As Bashar al-Assad clamped down on the initial protests and the opposition started to fracture, with new players emerging, Zaitouneh wanted to record every breach of international humanitarian law within the Geneva conventions, Hague conventions, relevant treaties and case law. From imprisonment to torture, murder and kidnap, everything was to be marked. The victims were to be identified wherever possible and the perpetrators, no matter their allegiance, sought out and registered. Forced in 2012 to flee her home town of Damascus fearing discovery by Assad’s regime, Zaitouneh moved to Douma, six miles north-east of the capital. There, the 36-year-old was abducted on 9 December 2013 from her home by the Jaysh al-Islam, an Islamist militia group, along with her husband, Wael Hamadeh, a fellow lawyer and poet, Nazem Hammadi, and Samira al-Khalil, an activist previously imprisoned for her views by the regime of Assad’s father, Hafez al-Assad. That December day was the last time the so-called Douma four were seen. But their careful forensic documentation has been continued by others. The jigsaw pieces stored by the VDC in Copenhagen will not ever offer the satisfaction of a complete picture. The centre’s 35 paid staff in Syria and its huge network of volunteers do their best to have eyes and ears in all communities, both in opposition areas and the growing territory controlled by Assad’s regime. The testimonies and raw data are sent to a team of 15 legally trained verification officers peppered around Europe, who use their larger networks and personal contacts in Syria to refine what they receive and demand more information before sending it on to those inputting it in the database. But the information coming from Islamic State-held parts of Syria remains sketchy and often second-hand due to the dangers of operating there. The database is fluid, updated as fresh information arrives from witnesses, sightings in prisons, medical records, victims’ families or even Imams performing their daily burials. It is estimated that more than 500,000 people have been killed in Syria as a result of the war. The VDC has documented 188,957 of those deaths and its records suggest 77% were potentially killed in contravention of humanitarian law by the Assad regime. A further 12% of the documentation relates to deaths by armed opposition groups, 4% by Islamic State (Isis) and the extremist Nusra group, 3% by the Russians, and 1.4% by the US-led international coalition. Turkey and the Kurds, along with other peripheral actors, are believed to be responsible for the rest. Two-thirds of the documented deaths were of civilians. In the early years, arrests, torture and executions made up the bulk of the data. Today, the VDC mainly documents shelling and barrel bombs dropped by helicopters filled with high explosives, shrapnel and oil. The targeting of hospitals and bakeries in opposition-held areas is a notable trend, particularly since the regime’s capacity was improved by the arrival of the Russians. Of the 804 deaths documented in April alone, 420 were named and 384 registered as unknown. The VDC records the causes of death as: 127 by aerial attacks and barrel bombs, 105 by firearms and snipers, 103 by tanks, cannons and mortars, 85 by chlorine, 66 by landmines and car explosives, 10 by torture in Syrian government detention centres and two by torture while in the hands of kidnappers. This year, Husam Alkatlaby, 36, the human rights activist who took over from Zaitouneh as the VDC’s executive director, received upsetting news, but news that also gave him reason to continue. “When Jaysh al-Islam left Douma for the last time, we were able to receive fresh information about Zaitouneh,” Alkatlaby says. “We can’t say for certain, and we still have hope ... The analysis we have for now indicates that she may not be alive, but we are still working to uncover her fate and to legally prosecute those responsible ... We have lost 12 now, including the four colleagues kidnapped in Douma.” At the same time, the VCD has signed, along with 28 other Syrian NGOs, an agreement to share information with the UN’s international impartial independent mechanism (IIIM) for prosecuting those responsible for the most serious crimes. The UN’s security council members, in particular Russia, has been accused of blocking the building of prosecutions. The new vehicle offers a chance to circumvent the Kremlin and arm national courts with the evidence they need. “The main goal for me and the team is to keep a record for the next generation,” Alkatlaby says, “but there is a concrete result that we are trying to achieve: to build criminal cases, to hold people to account.” Alkatlaby, whose parents were in Hafez al-Assad’s prisons for almost the entirety of his childhood, left Syria in 2008 for the Netherlands after friends from universities in Aleppo and Damascus were arrested. In recent months, the VCD has been helping prosecutors in Germany and France to piece together the activities of Syrians in their sights, and the chains of command of military groups. But Alkatlaby says: “I believe we have to work on the high-level perpetrators. From what we understand the IIIM is interested in building the big cases, not the individual cases. We believe that justice will not make all the perpetrators accountable but what is most important for justice is to get the high level of the opposition, the generals, the close circle around Assad, and Assad himself. That is what we are looking for.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/03/justin-trudeau-phony-war-against-inequality","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-04T03:00:11Z","webTitle":"Justin Trudeau is waging a phony war against inequality | Luke Savage","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/03/justin-trudeau-phony-war-against-inequality","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/may/03/justin-trudeau-phony-war-against-inequality","fields":{"headline":"Justin Trudeau is waging a phony war against inequality","bodyText":"Last month, in a speech to France’s National Assembly, Justin Trudeau raised one of his favourite themes: inequality. This, he declared, was “eroding not only the standard of living of the middle class, but also the confidence of the population in world trade, international cooperation and liberal democracy”. It wasn’t the first time Canada’s 23rd prime minister had raised these issues with an international audience. Last year Trudeau made similar remarks to a dinner for civic and business leaders in Hamburg. “When companies post record profits on the backs of workers consistently refused full-time work – and the job security that comes with it – people get defeated,” he said. “And when governments serve special interests instead of the citizens interests who elected them – people lose faith.” While not exactly the stuff of Woody Guthrie songs, rhetorical maneuvers such as these have successfully convinced many observers that the Trudeau government is serious about reducing economic inequality from a leftwing, anti-austerity position. “A lurch to the left” was how the Atlantic’s David Frum described Trudeau’s victory in 2015, going so far as to compare him to socialists Bernie Sanders and Jeremy Corbyn. This sentiment has largely been echoed within Canada, where commentators have variously gushed about the return of progressive government, or warned about the impending injection of “populism” into the Liberal agenda. Despite such bluster, though, Trudeau’s carefully choreographed crusade against inequality has always been more affectation than reality. Consider the disjuncture between Trudeau’s rhetoric and his actions. In 2015, the Liberals promised to raise taxes on “the wealthiest 1% while cutting them for the middle class”. The pledge sounds attractive enough in principle, but in practice amounted to a small tax increase for top earners and a corresponding tax cut, the major gains of which went to people making between $89,200 and $200,000 a year. With a median family income in 2015 of $70,336, the beneficiaries are not exactly Canada’s “middle class”, let alone its working poor. Some of the country’s wealthiest corporate executives, meanwhile, got to keep a lucrative tax loophole allowing them to pay a 50% lower rate on compensation earned through stock options – despite the Liberal campaign pledge to cap it. His embrace of Keynesian economics has been equally ethereal. In 2015, apparently rebelling against the prevailing economic orthodoxy of austerity, the Liberal leader pledged to stimulate the economy through modest, deficit-financed social investment. Upon implementation, however, some $15bn was channelled into an “infrastructure bank”, geared to attract private financing. The promises of “socially useful, non-commercial projects like childcare or affordable housing to cash-strapped cities” will take a back seat to those with “revenue-generating potential”. And while investors are likely to see big returns, it is the public who will shoulder much of the risk. Trudeau has also remained ambivalent towards the kind of big programs that could actually redistribute wealth in a meaningful way. On childcare, for example, he favours a means-tested approach, rather than the universal, public provision of a desperately needed service. And in a 2016 conversation with a low-wage worker he dismissed the prospect of raising the minimum wage, echoing the talking points of the Canadian business lobby: “Maybe everything just gets more expensive or we have jobs leaving. We have to be very careful about that.” (A 2011 University of California, Berkeley study found the effects of raising the minimum wage on prices to be negligible at best. And the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives has argued that service sector jobs that tend to pay the minimum wage are by their very nature immobile, which suggests the threat of mass job flight is a myth.) Besides the obvious disjunctures between record and rhetoric, a closer scrutiny of Trudeau’s actual attitude towards economic inequality is perhaps even more instructive. In a 2013 article for the Globe and Mail, “Why it’s vital we support the middle class”, he issued a warning to Canadian elites: “National business leaders and other wealthy Canadians should draw the following conclusion, and do so urgently. If we do not solve [the problems facing the middle class and low-income earners], Canadians will eventually withdraw their support for a growth agenda. We will all be worse off as a consequence.” Rising inequality, he said, could lead to “deepening divisions” such that Canadians might “begin to vote for leaders who offer comforting stories about who to blame for our problems, rather than how to solve them”. This is plainly the language of technocratic management, not moral urgency; first and foremost an appeal to the self-interest of elites rather than a coherent political demand directed at the powerful. In Trudeau’s war, it seems, inequality is a faceless and abstract enemy – a puzzle to be solved rather than an injustice to be stamped out. And while the prime minister calmly informs struggling workers that raising the minimum wage may have unintended consequences, the country’s wealthiest corporate executives get to keep their cushy tax advantages. The phony war rages on."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"travel/2018/may/01/send-us-a-tip-on-an-early-summer-break-in-france-for-the-chance-to-win-a-200-hotel-voucher","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-01T14:18:43Z","webTitle":"Send us a tip on an early summer break in France for the chance to win a £200 hotel voucher","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/may/01/send-us-a-tip-on-an-early-summer-break-in-france-for-the-chance-to-win-a-200-hotel-voucher","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2018/may/01/send-us-a-tip-on-an-early-summer-break-in-france-for-the-chance-to-win-a-200-hotel-voucher","fields":{"headline":"Send us a tip on an early summer break in France for the chance to win a £200 hotel voucher","bodyText":"As spring turns to summer, a trip across the Channel has added allure.

The reason, of course, is wine and service. Wine, in particular, is contentious. On the face of it, the mark-ups appear huge for what seems essentially just opening and pouring a bottle, but they reflect the costs involved: investment in stock, storage space, glasses and staff training all adds up. What I find hard to swallow, however, is that those mark-ups presumably also include service, and then (with the occasional rare exception such as Tate Britain) service is charged again on the whole bill. This seems like a broken model, but it’s the main way restaurants make their money, so I don’t see it changing any time soon, particularly in the current tough trading climate. That said, an increasing number, such as M restaurants in London, have a retail outlet, too, and on quieter nights offer wine at shop prices; others offer BYO at least one night a week. With less enlightened establishments, though, it pays to know how to negotiate a list. First, it’s worth dispelling a widely held myth that it’s the second or third wine on the list that’s the least good value. More to the point, it’s the wine you’re most likely to have heard of, so beware French classics such as sancerre, chablis, saint-émilion and – don’t get me started – champagne, which is often offered at the beginning of a meal as if it were a gift and then turns up on the bill at £14 a glass (plus service). A good guiding principle is to go for grape varieties and wine regions that you may not have heard of – grapes such as falanghina, zweigelt and bobal, for example, or from lesser known areas of Italy, France and Spain. Wines from countries such as Greece, Hungary, Romania and Portugal generally represent good value, too, while unfashionable wines such as sherry (yes, still, amazingly) and muscadet are also rarely overpriced (though previously out-of-favour beaujolais is creeping up). Finally, you might like to be reminded that, if a wine is corked or just tastes a bit tired, you should tell your server as soon as you taste it. Sometimes it may come from a bottle that’s been kept open too long. If it doesn’t seem right to you, don’t be palmed off by an “It’s supposed to be like that” response. That could be true with natural wines, but they should have flagged that up when you ordered it.

This phenomenon though is not unique to Russell Group universities, with The Times reporting on more than 50,000 cases of cheating at British universities in a three-year period between 2013 and 2016. Based on the current state of higher education in this country though, this should come as no surprise. For students, the pressure to succeed has never been greater due to the increased cost attached to learning as well as the seeming necessity for students to get jobs as soon as they graduate. Both of these factors have led to an environment where results and grades are more important than scholarship and intellectual development and ultimately undermine the entire purpose of universities, turning them into nothing more than exam factories with degrees seen as little more than a route into a profitable job. The increase in tuition fees to £9,000 marked a watershed moment in higher education. The relationship between student and staff was fundamentally changed from an intellectual one to a business transaction. The government even justified the increase by claiming that students will end up earning more if they go to university, thereby reducing a degree to a means to an end rather than an end in and of itself. As seemingly nothing more than customers, students have been forced to focus more on quantifiable outcomes such as grades rather than the joy that academic stimulation can provide. This has had a number of knock-on effects, with an increase in the rate of cheating undoubtedly being one of them. Students, instead of being able to focus on their academic development, are forced to think about little more than the impact their final grade will have on the rest of their lives and so some turn to cheating in order to ensure the best possible result. Coupled with this is the apparent need for students to get a well-paying job as soon as they graduate, most of which require at least a 2:1 if not better. The inclusion of graduate prospect statistics in university rankings has necessitated this, with universities selling themselves on the success of their recent students on finding a job within six months of graduation. This is all in spite of the fact the former head of Ucas described such rankings as “unhelpful”, noting the “huge stress” felt by students who did not secure a well-paying job. Nonetheless such rankings exist, further fuelling student anxieties, with a recent YouGov poll showing that eight in 10 students feel pressure to get a job within six months of graduating, with 23% citing paying off their student debts as a major factor behind their decision to find some form of employment. It must be emphasised that students who do cheat are not bad people, and more often than not do so because they simply lack confidence or are desperate. This view has been echoed by Jack Wallington, community director at The Student Room, who claims students often resort to cheating due to the pressure under which they find themselves. What is abundantly clear is that there is a wide variety of reasons why one might choose to cheat in an exam or on coursework and while those people who choose to do so should not be applauded for their decision, more work needs to be done to eradicate the causes behind the cheating rather than to merely dismiss it as students being lazy. Perhaps it’s time to change how we think about higher education and learning. Rather than an unhealthy fixation on final exams and coursework, universities should instead focus on the intellectual development of their students and look to create more well-rounded graduates who would arguably be better suited to contribute positively to any workplace they might enter.

RBS said the job losses were the result of a deal made with the European Union last year that meant the Edinburgh-based bank would no longer be forced to sell 300 branches. Instead 60% of them will be shut down. The EU had demanded the sale, to increase competition, as a condition of the RBS taxpayer bailout in 2009. RBS resurrected the Williams &amp; Glyn name for the branches it put up for sale – which were RBS banks in England and Wales together with NatWest branches in Scotland. However, it was unable to find a buyer. The closures affect branches across England and Wales, from Truro to Colwyn Bay and Barrow-in Furness, with 11 in London. The bank said 109 brancheswould close in July and August and 53 would shut in November, with 792 staff to be made redundant. The latest closures come after years of shutting down branches, which have prompted political outcries and warnings about the end of high street banking. Only five months ago RBS announced it was closing 259 branches with the loss of 680 jobs. After the latest round of cuts the bank will have 859 branches remaining, about 1,000 fewer than at the end of 2014. Nicky Morgan, chair of the influential Treasury committee, criticised the RBS decision, and said the government may have to intervene if closures worsened financial exclusion. RBS is still 71%-owned by taxpayers. She said: “In recent years, retail banks have made decisions to shrink their branch network on the grounds that more people are banking online. But branches remain vital for many, particularly vulnerable people and those in rural areas. “As a result of RBS’s decision, there is a risk of increased levels of financial exclusion. It’s important for the government to monitor this trend. If financial exclusion is increasing, the government may be required to intervene.” Jonathan Reynolds, Labour’s shadow City minister, said: “These closures and job losses are devastating for RBS staff and the communities they serve. Concrete plans must be put in place to ensure vulnerable customers do not suffer as a result. “Under a Labour government, there would be mandatory consultation around the closure of bank branches which includes the regulator. We cannot abandon communities by leaving them without the basic banking infrastructure they need.” The Unite union called on RBS to halt its “disastrous plans”. It claimed that in 71 out of the 162 locations slated for closure, customers will be forced to make return journeys of about 25 miles. Unite’s national officer, Rob MacGregor, said: “The TSB computer systems crash last week has demonstrated without question that the banking system needs its branch network more than it ever has. Unite is calling on the Royal Bank of Scotland management not to abandon their responsibilities to communities across the country.” RBS said the majority of branches marked for closure were within 0.6 miles of another RBS or NatWest branch, pointing out that all of them were within 2.5 miles of another branch. The bank also said the number of branch transactions in England and Wales had fallen 30% since 2014, while mobile transaction numbers had surged 74% over the same period. The number of customers using mobile banking has risen by 53%. Last week, RBS reported first-quarter profits had more than trebled to £792m. The bank pledged to increase telephone banking services and improve online and app messaging services. It has created a specialist taskforce to help customers learn to use the new banking technology. The Federation of Small Businesses said the closures would deal another blow to small firms and high streets. The FSB’s national chair, Mike Cherry, said: “It’s thoroughly disappointing to see RBS using the failed sale of Williams &amp; Glyn as an excuse to further decimate the UK’s bank branch network. “This fresh round of closures will hurt high streets all over the country at a time when thousands of small firms are already struggling. When a bank branch goes it means less footfall, less cash in the local economy and less revenue for local small firms as a result. He added that if small firms cannot easily deposit their takings, it makes them targets for theft. “Many small business owners have built relationships with branch personnel that go back years – that’s not something that can be replaced by an app.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/01/tories-latest-campaign-tactic-blaming-labour-hepatitis","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-01T15:31:55Z","webTitle":"The Tories' latest campaign tactic?

Blaming Labour for hepatitis","bodyText":"I’m aware this could be considered a discordant view, but – bear with me – I am impressed with the Conservative party. Very impressed. I have never known a party – and this includes the college parties where an earnest guy whips out an acoustic guitar; or the sixth-form party where someone loses their virginity in a garage on a cobwebbed camping mat; or the primary school party in which the ritualised anxiety that is musical chairs lasts for 45 minutes – that is so unrelentingly, unquestionably awful. Since the 2017 election (and let’s not dwell on that campaign, because there’s way too much fodder to take the piss out of), the government has lost five members of its cabinet. I fully got bored assembling a cabinet in my new flat, decided 10 screws would be fine rather than the mandated 18 (madness), and that cabinet has still held longer than this government’s front bench. Then there’s the institutional racism of the Home Office’s hostile environment policy (architect: one Theresa May), where British citizens have had to pay through the nose to apply for citizenship they already hold, but foreign oligarchs are fast-tracked for citizenship if they cough up what amounts to little of their net worth. We have a liability for a foreign secretary; a circus of clowns for a Brexit committee; and a bunch of opaque policies always outlined by the PM with “let me be clear”. But we have now reached peak theatre of the absurd. In the run-up to Thursday’s local elections, a leaflet was produced on behalf of Kamran Razzaq, a prospective Tory councillor for Dudley council, which blames Labour for … hepatitis. Actual hepatitis. The precise wording is that Labour has “delivered” hepatitis. Please, if you could, imagine a stork carrying an often symptomless STI. The other thing Labour has delivered is “decline of our area”, which is so vague as to be meaningless, and is also a description of everyone’s personal grooming atrophy in winter. Razzaq is a former member of the hepatitis-spreading Labour party who made the switch to the Tories, a disease of its own kind, which doesn’t usually take hold until middle-age. But there is more gold to be gleaned from the leaflet. Including that Razzaq is “fighting for our commnunity”. COMMNUNITY. Hey, who loved that show, COMMNUNITY? Who doesn’t love a feel-good commnunity spirit? There is also shade thrown at Ukip, for the apparent sin of installing defibrillators. Defibrillators are an unquestionable good thing, given that their public installations frequently save the lives of members of the public having a cardiac arrest. But Razzaq isn’t having any of it. But, returning to hepatitis, as I think we’ve all been keen to do: there is actually a context here. There has indeed been an outbreak of hepatitis A in the Cradley and Wollescote ward (the ward Razzaq is standing for, there are 24 in total), as the Stourbridge News reported. But it’s not concocted by Labour. It is in fact down to pockets of poverty and poor sanitation, with one example being the utterly depressing fact that 25 people were found to be using a single toilet. Now, this would have been a salient point for Razzaq to make. Although what with the Tories’ lust for austerity, 25 people to a single toilet looks a little too much like luxury living. Who can really rule out the possibility that the Tories’ next move wouldn’t be to replace that toilet with a chamber pot and a single roll of loo paper? Anyway, I would say good luck to Razzaq, the Superman to hepatitis’ Lex Luthor. But after Christian Calgie, a Conservative parliamentary aide, brought the leaflet to widespread attention on Twitter, because he was embarrassed, Razzaq has been suspended and an investigation opened. Razzaq is yet to comment, but it’s possible he was too busy booing people entering a local GUM clinic. Pete Lowe, the local Labour leader, told HuffPost that the leaflet was “the most bizarre I have seen in my 30 years in politics”. He stopped there, after commenting: “words fail me”. As far as we know, that’s not a sign of hepatitis.

They began to work together in 1972. “He was very vague about [my job],” she remembered. “He didn’t specify what I was going to do.” Her daily responsibilities show she was a multitasker of the highest order. They included everything from helping decide on the colour of a collection (“Yves has a phenomenal sense of colour, but he needs me to jerk it out of his system,” she said), to the casting of models (she encouraged the house to use Kate Moss), designing the jewellery and walking Saint Laurent’s French bulldog, Moujik. Principally, however, De la Falaise was there as a taste check, someone to try ideas on – sometimes literally – and to brainstorm with. “She is charm, poetry, excess, extravagance and elegance all in one blow,” said the designer. “We make a stewing pot. Things bubble and brew.” De la Falaise’s style is now the stuff of legend – and Pinterest boards. Headscarves and turbans became her trademark – on her wedding day in 1977, she married Thadée Klossowski in a white turban with coral-red tassels – while her attitude to dressing could be summed up as: “Why wear one skirt/sweater/necklace if you can wear four?” As with all style icons – from Jane Birkin to Kate Moss and Rihanna – a frustratingly indefinable flair was at the heart of it. “I’ve always longed to pull off wearing a couture dress with a bit of old tat from a flea market,” says De la Falaise’s sometime associate Nicky Samuel in Petkanas’s book, “but only a few women succeed.” De la Falaise was one of them. If De la Falaise was part-inspiration at Saint Laurent, she was also there to gee up the famously troubled designer, with her trademark light disposition. Betty Catroux, who is also described as a Saint Laurent muse, says De la Falaise “saw everything through rose-coloured glasses. She was our Prozac”. As with many people who present as sweetness and light, De la Falaise had her own troubles. Born in the UK to the French writer Alain de la Falaise and socialite Maxime Birley, she and her brother Alexis were sent to live with a couple in rural France as children. De la Falaise’s first fashion-show experience was being taken to Paris as a child by her aunt, Gloria Swanson, and she was friends with Andy Warhol by the time she was 15. She used drugs and alcohol, and developed hepatitis in her 20s; she died three years after Saint Laurent, in 2011, at the age of 63. While she had started her own label after parting ways with Saint Laurent when he retired from the house in 2002, it is for her associations with the designer that she will be remembered – muse or not. Her importance was summed up by Paris Match after she died. The headline? “The second death of Yves Saint Laurent.” Loulou &amp; Yves by Christopher Petkanas is published by St Martin’s Press, at £35.

The company’s shareholders have voted to approve the deal to add the Daily Express, Sunday Express, Daily Star and Daily Star Sunday newspapers, as well as magazines including celebrity title OK!, to its national titles the Daily Mirror, Sunday Mirror and Sunday People. However, Matt Hancock, the culture secretary, has called in Ofcom to investigate whether there are concerns that the takeover could impact freedom of expression and opinion and editorial decision-making at the Express and Star newspapers. He has also ordered the Ofcom to examine whether the deal, which will result in the combined company becoming the UK’s second-largest national newspaper group, owning nine of 20 titles, raises issues of a sufficient plurality of views in the market. “I have written to the parties today confirming my decision to issue a public interest intervention notice (PIIN) on both grounds,” Hancock said. Hancock, who wields the power to block the deal or force a sell-off of some titles, has given Ofcom until 31 May to complete its investigation. He has also asked the Competition Markets Authority to report back on any wider competition issues the deal may raise by the end of the month. “I will then consider whether or not to refer the merger for a more detailed investigation, or whether to accept undertakings-in-lieu of such a reference,” Hancock added. Simon Fox, the Trinity Mirror chief executive, has repeatedly pledged that his Labour-supporting Daily and Sunday Mirror will keep Desmond’s Brexit-supporting titles editorially independent. “The Mirror is not going to go rightwing and the Express is not going to go leftwing,” he said. “They will absolutely all have editorial independence.” As the deal completed, however, the editors of the Daily Express and Daily Star resigned. Trinity Mirror immediately announced the appointment of two of its executives – Sunday Mirror and Sunday People editor Gary Jones, and Daily Mirror associate editor Jon Clark – as replacements. Trinity Mirror maintains that it believes the deal does not raise issues of a reduction in media plurality. “Each newspaper brand will continue with its current editorial positioning, and that there will not be any detrimental impact on competition as a result of the acquisition,” the company said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/may/01/risk-and-revivals-english-national-opera-2018-19-season-andrew-clements-comment","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-01T13:51:45Z","webTitle":"Risk and revivals – ENO's new season gets the balance right","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/01/risk-and-revivals-english-national-opera-2018-19-season-andrew-clements-comment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/may/01/risk-and-revivals-english-national-opera-2018-19-season-andrew-clements-comment","fields":{"headline":"Risk and revivals – ENO's new season gets the balance right","bodyText":"If the current season at English National Opera has marked a low point in the company’s recent fortunes, with fewer shows and a shorter season than any other in recent memory, then the 2018-19 programme, just announced, suggests a modest upturn. It’s the first put together by music director Martyn Brabbins and artistic director Daniel Kramer, and at first sight they seem to have got the balance between mainstream works and more adventurous projects just about right, without tempting fate at the box office too often. It’s always an encouraging sign in any opera company’s season when new work outnumbers revivals, though in ENO’s case that may also be partly the result of the sheer lack of enduring, recyclable shows in their recent repertory. At the Coliseum next season there will be five brand new productions, and four that have been seen before. Gershwin’s Porgy and Bess will get the most attention – the first staging by a mainstream UK opera company since the famous Trevor Nunn production seen at Glyndebourne and Covent Garden in the 1980s, and the latest of ENO’s co-productions with the Metropolitan Opera in New York – and with it conductor John Wilson will get the opportunity to display his talents in the kind of repertoire in which he excels. It’s more than 10 years since Strauss’s Salome has been at ENO, too, though The Merry Widow seems to have come around again just a bit too soon – it’s only a decade since John Copley’s production there was new, and that hasn’t been revived extensively. The first of the more risky ventures comes in the shape of Kramer’s staging of Britten’s War Requiem, timed to coincide with events to mark the centenary of the end of the first world war in November, but looking like an unnecessary indulgence. Conducted by Brabbins with a fine trio of soloists, though, it should be a musical success at least. And at the end of the season, with Brabbins and Kramer again, there’s the Jack the Ripper opera by Iain Bell, who seems now to be regarded as one of the safest pair of operatic hands in British contemporary music, a composer who can come up with dramatically cogent stage works that are not too challenging musically. Among the revivals, the return of Jonathan Miller’s highly effective production of La Bohème rather than the more recent, disappointing one by Benedict Andrews is no surprise, while Simon McBurney’s Magic Flute, much admired by many – if not by me – is a reliable revenue earner. Whether the appetite for Philip Glass’s operas can take another run of Phelim McDermott’s Akhnaten, which was not quite in the same class as his earlier Satyagraha for the company, remains to be seen, but it is good to have David Alden’s production of Lucia di Lammermoor back. Alden continues to provide a link with the era in which ENO really was the most radical force in British opera."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/may/07/anna-jones-toast-topping-brunch-recipes","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-07T11:00:48Z","webTitle":"Anna Jones’s toast-topping brunch recipes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/07/anna-jones-toast-topping-brunch-recipes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/07/anna-jones-toast-topping-brunch-recipes","fields":{"headline":"Anna Jones’s toast-topping brunch recipes","bodyText":"We have reached peak avocado on toast. Avocado has had its moment and, while I will always love it, the time has come for something else. This winter in LA (the same temperature as midsummer in the UK), I went to Kismet, a small restaurant on the city’s east side famed for its Californication of Middle Eastern food. The dish du jour? Broccoli toast. I was sceptical. Broccoli, I thought, lacks the requisite creaminess to be a good toast topping. I was wrong. Teamed with a tahini layer and some spice, it was all I could have asked for. Here is my version, plus five more toast toppings. Step aside, avocado. Broccoli on toast (pictured above) Good toast and leafy stemmed broccoli are key here, although standard (calabrese) broccoli will stand in if you slice it thinly enough. If you are using a grill rather than a griddle pan, be sure to turn the broccoli regularly: the result will be charred, crisped leaves that soften when they cool. Prep 5 min Cook 10 min Serves 4 400g stem broccoli, purple sprouting or Tenderstem 4 tbsp thick Greek yoghurt 4 tbsp tahini 1 unwaxed lemon Salt and black pepper Extra-virgin olive oil 4 slices sourdough 100g sunflower seeds, toasted 1 tbsp za’atar Boil a large pan of generously salted water, and blanch the broccoli for three to four minutes, until it has lost its rawness but still holds its shape. Drain and set aside. Mix the yoghurt with the tahini, a good squeeze of lemon, some salt and pepper, and a drizzle of olive oil. Taste, and balance with more lemon, salt and pepper as necessary. Heat a griddle pan or grill to maximum and, once hot, char the broccoli on all sides, until the edges crisp. Once you are happy with the broccoli, take it off the heat, then char the toast on both sides using the same griddle or grill. Spread the hot toast with a little olive oil and the tahini yoghurt, then top with the warm, charred broccoli, the toasted seeds and a good pinch of za’atar. Five toast toppings for quick spring eating Here are a further five toast toppings that just might supersede standard avo toast. None takes more than 10 minutes to make. Radish, butter and mint Mix a little butter with flaky salt and spread on toast as thickly as you dare. Top with sliced radishes, their leaves and some torn mint leaves. Peas and preserved lemon Mash or blitz cooked peas with olive oil, Turkish chilli pepper flakes (or dried red chilli) and the chopped rind of a preserved lemon. Top the toast with feta and then the pea mixture. Avocado on toast, reinvented Mash an avocado with a squeeze of lemon juice, a teaspoon of red-wine vinegar, a teaspoon of grainy mustard and half a teaspoon of honey or maple syrup, then stir in some chopped dill, season and pile on to toast. Soft egg and Persian cucumber Boil an egg for six and a half minutes, then cool under cold running water, peel and slice. Top the toast with egg, olive oil, slices of cucumber, chopped capers and cornichons, a few chopped soft herbs and some lemon zest. Ricotta, strawberries and basil Slice a spring onion, squeeze half a lemon over it, then set aside. Spread the toast with ricotta, then top with sliced strawberries, the lemony spring onion, basil leaves and lemon zest. Food styling: Anna Jones. Prop styling: Anna Wilkins.

It’s a win-win: vital career experience and extra cash for students, and an important source of labour for universities. But what should be a mutually beneficial role too often takes the form of exploitative, casual and poorly paid work. As an associate lecturer and PhD student, I have personally experienced some of these problems at my university, and heard worse from fellow students. Late or non-existent payment for teaching, delays in getting proper contracts, inadequate office facilities and a lack of formal training, induction and support for new staff are just some of the problems faced by PhD students teaching at my institution. Across the country, when all work is properly accounted for, whether it be prep, marking or dealing with students’ enquiries, many PhD students are doing considerably more than they are paid for. It’s not unusual for PhD teaching assistants to earn around £5 an hour – below the minimum wage – when prep time is factored in. This was confirmed by a 2012 National Union of Students report, [pdf] which stated that “almost one in three postgraduates who teach earn below minimum wage in real terms”. Almost half of respondents felt their pay was “unfair”, particularly given how many students are forced to teach as a condition for receiving funding. Recent research by the University and College Union shows how much the university sector relies on this form of employment – on average more than a quarter of staff delivering teaching for universities (not just postgraduates) are on hourly paid contracts. The union also found that at least half of all academic staff have insecure employment. Too often the response to these issues within academia is resigned acceptance: unpaid labour is necessary to climb up the academic career ladder. It is part and parcel of the broader marketisation process ravaging university campuses. But this is perhaps one of the more insidious manifestations of corporate culture: senior staff pay in the stratosphere while frontline staff toil for a meagre sum, often on insecure contracts. This is compounded by the fact that many PhD students fall through the cracks of formal representation systems. Some students’ unions keep PhD student employment rights at arm’s length because they fear that campaigning on their behalf is not “in line with their charitable objectives” of campaigning only on student issues. Staff unions can feel their hands tied if these students are not formally employed by the university or a member of the union. There’s no specific national representation within the NUS either, though a motion was passed at its most recent conference calling for a review of postgraduate representation. Postgraduate students need a coordinated campaign to challenge exploitative employment practices. This should be run by local activists and alliances, but led by the NUS and UCU nationally. Universities should be ashamed of the appalling treatment of many postgraduate students. Sadly, they’re not – so it’s up to us to make them. The recent wave of activism on university campuses, kick-started by the USS pensions dispute, shows what can be achieved when students and staff work together. Postgraduate research students blur the lines between these two groups, and too often this means they are neglected by both. It’s time to foster a culture in which it is clear where they belong, and where they are defended and empowered by everyone.

The Democratic Unionist Diane Dodds and Ulster Unionist Jim Nicholson, two of the three MEPs representing Northern Ireland, declined the invitation to meet Michel Barnier when he visited Derry on the second day of his trip to the country. It was left to the third MEP, Sinn Féin’s Martina Anderson, to greet Barnier when he arrived at the Guildhall on Tuesday. Anderson said: “I think it’s political bad manners that the MEPs – and I have to say the two council leads from the DUP and UUP – were both invited here this morning, and neither of them have turned up.” On Monday, the DUP leader, Arlene Foster, said Barnier did not understand or respect unionism and was more allied to the Sinn Féin position on Northern Ireland. The DUP is implacably opposed to regulatory alignment on the island of Ireland if it creates barriers between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, while Sinn Féin has called for a special status for the region so it can remain allied to the customs union and single market. Anderson said: “All three of us should be maximising the opportunity when Michel Barnier is in our constituency. “On the one hand, while they say they don’t want a hard border in Ireland, I think what it does do is send a signal to the constituencies that are living adjacent to the border that maybe they don’t care too much.” Dodds said she had not snubbed Barnier but had committed to meetings in London and could not meet him. She told the BBC she had met him in Brussels “a few weeks ago” and insisted it was important to provide input at the Brexit discussions in London. Nicolson said he would take “no lessons” in manners from Anderson pointing out Sinn Fein snubbed Prince Charle’s visit last October. “I have not, nor do I intend to snub Mr Barnier now or at any time in future,” he said. Nicolson said the invitation to meet Barnier was issued at 5.30pm on Friday and he felt it was a “missed opportunity” for a wider gathering. “Martina Anderson won’t dictate who I meet, when I meet them or where I meet them. I shall be meeting with Michel Barnier at the earliest possible opportunity for him to brief me on what his findings were.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/may/02/pavel-kolesnikov-review-wigmore-hall-london","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-02T11:14:50Z","webTitle":"Pavel Kolesnikov review – self-consciously clever programme negates a huge talent","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/02/pavel-kolesnikov-review-wigmore-hall-london","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/may/02/pavel-kolesnikov-review-wigmore-hall-london","fields":{"headline":"Pavel Kolesnikov review – self-consciously clever programme negates a huge talent","bodyText":"There was no doubt that a lot of thought went into the planning of Pavel Kolesnikov’s latest Wigmore recital programme, a carefully arranged sequence of miniatures in the first half, followed by something more substantial after the interval. In a disembodied (pre-recorded?) spoken introduction, Kolesnikov described the pieces in his sequence as dramatic characters brought on to the stage in turn. Those “characters” were the movements of Debussy’s suite Children’s Corner, interleaved with pieces from Helmut Lachenmann’s Ein Kinderspiel. There was some Chopin (a mazurka and a study), Liszt’s La Campanella and the C sharp minor Prelude from the second book of Bach’s Well-Tempered Clavier in the mix, before it all ended with Feux d’Artifice from Debussy’s Préludes. Some of the performances were striking – La Campanella was delicate and dazzling, without a hint of empty bravura, Children’s Corner was delicately shaded, Feux d’Artifice almost angrily explosive. But if these were characters who were meant to relate to each other, they didn’t do so in any meaningful way, and even the rationale for the order of the sequence remained entirely elusive. Why, for instance, did Kolesnikov play Lachenmann’s Schattentanz, in which only the rattle of fingers hitting the piano keys is heard, twice? And why was there a break for applause in the otherwise seamless sequence before the final two pieces – the naggingly repeated clusters of Lachenmann’s Filter-Schaukel and Feux d’Artifice? If such questions eventually became a distraction, then Kolesnikov began the second half with another teasing juxtaposition, prefacing Schumann’s C major Fantasy with a piece by Louis Couperin, Le Tombeau de M de Blancrocher. Their connection proved to be the plodding way in which he approached both pieces, so that sections in the Couperin became totally detached from each other, and one of Schumann’s most daringly original formal designs lost most of its coherence and poetic power. There were still flashes of the immensely talented pianist that Kolesnikov certainly is, but here the self-conscious cleverness of his programme almost entirely negated them."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"books/2018/may/10/shapeshifters-gavin-francis-review-cultural-history-bodies-humans","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-10T07:59:07Z","webTitle":"Shapeshifters by Gavin Francis review – bristling with insight into our bodies","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/10/shapeshifters-gavin-francis-review-cultural-history-bodies-humans","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/may/10/shapeshifters-gavin-francis-review-cultural-history-bodies-humans","fields":{"headline":"Shapeshifters by Gavin Francis review – bristling with insight into our bodies","bodyText":"“My aim is to sing of the ways bodies change.” Ovid, in The Metamorphoses, provides one of six epigraphs to Gavin Francis’s ambitious book on the same theme. Among the other authors Francis quotes at the outset are Hume, Thoreau and Marina Warner, who writes: “Metamorphosis governs natural phenomena.” He might also have invoked John Berger’s 1967 study of the work and life of a country doctor, A Fortunate Man. Writing about that book a few years ago, Francis noted that a sensitive physician “is rewarded with endless opportunities for experiencing the possibilities inherent in human lives”. Shapeshifters is an effort to inventory some of that potential, both glad and malign. It’s a book that bristles with insight into human bodies and the ways they remake themselves, or undo their owners. Change may seem a broad category inside which to corral the infinitely detailed ways our bodies work, don’t work, develop and decline. But feeling, or appearing to be in some way altered is surely the fundamental experience of being embodied. There is no static corporeal condition in life, or in death. (As John Donne puts it in his Devotions: “Variable, and therefore miserable condition of man! This minute I was well, and am ill, this minute.”) Francis, who works as a GP in Edinburgh, is interested in physical changes wrought by time, illness and accident – hormonal slumps and rages, anorexia’s chilling progression, the fantastical inventions of a florid psychosis – but also in the bodily metaphors that have “preoccupied poets, artists and thinkers for millennia”. While his literary reference points are mostly classical, he includes Borges on memory, Ursula K Le Guin on menopause and the essayist Anatole Broyard on the black comedy of his prostate cancer. In a consideration of the ambiguities of human gender, Francis turns to TS Eliot’s version of Tiresias, “throbbing between two lives”. Poetry, myth and fiction connect easily with some of the more extravagant transformations Francis considers – though it is sometimes hard to say which came first: the symptom or its abstraction into word and image. Take the werewolf. As he reminds us, the first transformation described by Ovid is of man into wolf. It seems that 70% of mental-health professionals today think the full moon influences certain of their patients, but there is no credible evidence for the belief. Francis describes the illness (porphyria) that may well account for legends of lycanthropy and lunar transfiguration; he links such tales (and contemporary cases) to Virgil’s Eclogues, Kafka’s The Metamorphosis and the long tradition of humanised animals in children’s literature. In medicine and imagination, we are never quite ourselves: Francis recalls being introduced, as a medical student, to a patient who had a two-inch horn growing out of her forehead. He is well schooled in the literature of medical curiosities, from Galen to Sir Thomas Browne and beyond. But Shapeshifters is at its best, and strangest, when dealing with mundane translations: puberty, pregnancy, menopause, the not so simple facts of our being sexed beings. Francis has an engaging way with medical-cultural history, drawing us close, for example, to Leonardo’s depiction of the moment of conception, a picture complete with conjectured channels from breasts to womb, and an obscure duct connecting brain, spine and penis. Stray details fascinate: I wonder how many happy parents-to-be, sharing ultrasound scans of their babies, know the technology was pioneered by Ian Donald, a Glasgow professor of midwifery who had seen it used in the steel industry. “In the summer of 1955,” Francis writes, “Donald drove down to a boiler manufacturer’s in Renfrew, his car boot full of buckets of ovarian cysts and uterine tumours.” Such is the breadth of Francis’s interests that Shapeshifters is never less than intellectually ener getic, with each of the 24 chapters blending the sort of knowledge mentioned above with accounts of the doctor’s own patients. I would love to read Francis at greater length on sleep, the scalp, jet lag, bonesetting, prosthetics and gigantism. But the brevity of many chapters contrasts with moments when he conveys something profound and complex about his patients. If he doesn’t exactly attain the simple intensity of Berger in A Fortunate Man, the task is similar: to recognise that in each case, behind each array of presenting symptoms, there is a whole world of feeling and a style of understanding. At times, these embodied ways of seeing can appear delusional: Harry, a steroid abuser whose muscles are enlarging, testicles shrinking and temper veering out of control, tells Francis: “I know what I’m doing. I’ve never felt better.” In other cases, Francis, whose precision can pivot pleasingly to lyricism, captures his patients’ anxieties, as with a young woman unexpectedly pregnant for the third time: “The lilt of her accent rose up and down, lifting and dropping like a needle on a running stitch.” Shapeshifters is Francis’s fourth book: the first two detailed his time as doctor and traveller in the Arctic and Antarctic; the third, Adventures in Human Being, brought together case studies and reflections on aspects of the body and medicine – the brain, the pulse, the structure of the human foot. In some extraordinary passages in this new book, the author leaves aside the familiar synthesis of case study with cultural history, and aims for something more exact and unsettling in his prose. Towards the end he attends an autopsy, and describes with delicacy and daring what he sees: the creamy grey brain flopping into the corners of a metal tray is an image that will not fade quickly – a gripping description of our final transformation. • Brian Dillon’s Essayism and In the Dark Room are published by Fitzcarraldo.

Police and passersby were left perplexed and concerned after a burned-out car was found dangling precariously from a Toronto bridge as traffic rumbled overhead. Soon after the blue sedan was spotted during rush-hour traffic on Wednesday, police, firefighters and paramedics showed up to assess the mysterious car. Strung up by a cable, it floated over a grassy area and posed no danger to public safety, officials said. City police at first said it was a prop for a movie shoot. But after speaking with city officials, they retracted this explanation. No movie shoot had been authorised, they said, and police were now investigating how exactly the car ended up suspended in mid-air. The hollowed-out Honda Civic appeared to be scrubbed of all identifying markers; it bore no licence plate, several windows were missing and its underbelly had been stripped. “I just saw some of the pictures myself and I was mystified as to how the car ended up there,” Toronto’s mayor, John Tory, told reporters on Wednesday. “You’re always very puzzled as to how a car would have got into that particular situation.” Social media stirred with speculation. “What’s weirder: the fact that there’s a car dangling from a wire below a bridge, or that nobody has the slightest idea why or how the car got there in the first place?” wrote one person on Twitter. Another pointed to the confusion over whether the car was linked to a movie shoot, asking: “Are the cameras, cast and crew hiding? Did they finish filming and simply forget the dangling car?” A myriad of theories soon sprung up online to explain the car, linking it to everything from aliens to a student end-of-year prank – a nod to a 2001 prank that saw engineering students at the University of British Columbia suspend a red Volkswagen beetle – outfitted with a Canadian flag – from San Francisco’s Golden Gate Bridge. Hours after the car in Toronto was spotted, the city’s fire department managed to safely lower it to the ground. Police said they were continuing to investigate."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/may/02/kane-mayor-knox-county-tennessee-wwe-glenn-jacobs","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-02T17:17:00Z","webTitle":"WWE star Kane wins Republican primary in Tennessee mayoral race","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/02/kane-mayor-knox-county-tennessee-wwe-glenn-jacobs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/may/02/kane-mayor-knox-county-tennessee-wwe-glenn-jacobs","fields":{"headline":"WWE star Kane wins Republican primary in Tennessee mayoral race","bodyText":"Glenn Jacobs, a 7ft wrestler who was one of WWE’s biggest draws during the early 2000s, has won the Republican primary in Knox County, Tennessee, and is set to become a candidate for mayor. Jacobs, known as Kane for most of his wrestling career, claimed victory by just 17 votes and will run against Democrat Linda Haney in August’s mayoral election if the result is certified later this month. Knox County’s current mayor, Tim Burchett, is a Republican and the area has gone to the GOP candidate in every presidential election since 1944. Jacobs appeared as various characters in WWE, including a dentist called Isaac Yankem, before achieving fame as Kane who the wrestling organization described as teh half-brother of The Undertaker and “a monstrous abomination that seems to have been extracted directly from your childhood nightmares.” The 51-year-old Jacobs was born into a military family and studied English literature at college, where he also played basketball and football. He has been vocal about his libertarian views throughout his wrestling career and on his campaign website says he aims to keep taxes low and put forth “a fresh outlook on limited government”. Jacobs supported libertarian Ron Paul in the 2008 presidential election and said he would like to see “the IRS eliminated and ... income tax ended”. In 2014 he spoke to Fox Business about his political views. “There are things that I can agree with from both sides: perhaps the civil libertarian issues of the left and also the economic freedom issues of the right while still rejecting the big government tendencies of both sides of the political spectrum,” he said. “The great thing about libertarianism is it really is the American Dream: It’s the ability of everybody to live their life and build their life according to what they want, so long as they don’t hurt anybody else.” If Jacobs wins the mayoral race he will follow the lead of former WWE star Jesse “The Body” Ventura who became mayor of Brooklyn Park, Minnesota, in 1991 before being elected the state’s governor in 1999.

Speaking on the eve of the poll, with Labour hoping to make strong gains in London, McDonnell said that seven years of Conservative spending cuts had primed the public for a different approach. “What people are saying is, the fabric of our community isn’t what it was and it needs addressing,” he said. “The council tax issue is interesting. People have raised the issue of council tax on the doorstep. There’s often Tory councillors saying they’re freezing them. We’re getting on the doorstep, ‘I’d rather pay a bit more to get a decent service’. I think there’s a wisdom of crowds, people are saying, after eight years you can’t carry on like this. You can’t just throw a bit of tarmac over a pothole. It’s got to be repaired properly and that takes money.” With 4,350 seats being contested across 150 local authorities in England on Thursday, Labour’s campaign has focused on Tory cuts to schools budgets, policing, social care and other public services. “It’s the general rundown of the fabric of society, both physically, but in terms of support mechanisms as well,” McDonnell said. However, he played down expectations that Labour could seize the Conservatives’ flagship boroughs of Westminster, Wandsworth, and Kensington and Chelsea. “It will be a good night, but we’re being set up by the Tories and the media, so if there’s a single Tory councillor left in this country we’ll have failed,” he said. “Taking individual councils is difficult - I think it’s really difficult - I know that in my own patch. In Wandsworth there’s a real grassroots campaign going on there. But we’ll have to see how that goes on the night.” He added: “Local elections are idiosyncratic, in a way that others aren’t. And I’m worried about the weather, too – today’s absolutely freezing. It all depends on turnout.” In London, Labour also hopes to take control of Barnet council, but McDonnell acknowledged concerns about whether the recent crisis over antisemitism in his party could hit votes in strongly Jewish areas such as Golders Green, Hendon, and Finchley. Having canvassed in Barnet recently, he said: “I’m concerned about the whole issue, I have been quite tough on it all the way through. I’m worried that people have been turned off.” McDonnell blamed the sluggish implementation of the Chakrabarti review on antisemitism for issues such as the backlog of outstanding cases, including that of Ken Livingstone, the former mayor of London and close ally of Jeremy Corbyn. Asked about the Livingstone case, he said: That will come. That’s why some of us got quite angry about why it hadn’t been dealt with before now, why the resources weren’t in place.” Despite the focus on London, McDonnell said Labour was taking its anti-austerity message outside the capital. “Where did we build up the votes last time? It was London and the metropolitan areas, basically. So the issue for us is how do we consolidate that, but in the other areas, those small towns, coastal towns and rural areas, how do we start connecting again on any scale?” He said local campaign organisers, currently being recruited, would help. “They will be working alongside our candidates - parliamentary candidates, local candidates - so we get back to a situation where every councillor, every parliamentary candidate or MP, every member if we can, becomethe community leaders. It’s deep, deep, campaigning.” McDonnell said whatever the results Labour hoped to use them as a springboard for the next general election. “I think they will be pretty good. Then we get back to the detailed work, constituency by constituency, and that’s what we’re aiming at now. We’ll use use these results as a platform to challenge the government.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2018/sep/16/dalsland-pilgrim-trail-sweden-walking-holiday","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2018-09-16T10:00:22Z","webTitle":"Pilgrims’ progress: an ancient walking trail in Sweden","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/sep/16/dalsland-pilgrim-trail-sweden-walking-holiday","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2018/sep/16/dalsland-pilgrim-trail-sweden-walking-holiday","fields":{"headline":"Pilgrims’ progress: an ancient walking trail in Sweden","bodyText":"When a friend and I set out to tackle West Sweden’s Dalsland Pilgrim Trail, we expected we’d have a pleasant enough time of it. We’d be wandering through vast forests, swimming in (and drinking from) lakes and cooking over a fire at night. Neither of us had entertained the thought that the most striking memories would involve a moose on a mission, a five-storey flour-sack chute and an incident with a Canadian canoe that would make me the poster boy for hubris. The trail follows the route taken by medieval pilgrims from Västergötland in west Sweden to Nidaros (now Trondheim) in Norway, site of the tomb of St Olaf. The faithful trudged this way for 500 years, until 1527 and the start of the Swedish reformation, when King Gustav I declared the pilgrimage illegal. There’s now a plan toreopen the whole route, although so far only a southern stretch – Vänersborg to Edsleskog – is fully waymarked. The first part of this is along roads, so we joined it at the small town of Mellerud. For the next 56km the trail follows footpaths, forest tracks and, on occasion, orange blobs daubed on tree trunks. We’d come overland from the UK, taking the train from London to Mellerud through northern Europe. Thus we were already firmly in pilgrim mode when we read on our first trail information board that our medieval predecessors were occasionally picked off by wild beasts. Imagine our excitement when,a few hours in, a moose came charging straight at us … Actually, it staggered comically on spindly legs (it was an infant, thankfully) and at about 15 metres away it stopped, stared at us in bemused incomprehension, then turned and lurched off. Our opening day of gentle farmland and woods ended in the small village of Upperud. Here, beside a lake, stands the imposing Upperud 9:9, a 100-year-old grain silo converted into a hotel. Opened last year, it has five immaculate little flats, each created out of an individual grain store. Charlie, son-in-law of the owner Kerstin and the architect of the conversion, took us up to the top floor to show us the silo’s workings. “And that,” he said, pointing to a hole in the floor, “is the sack chute, for sacks of flour. You can go down it if you like.” Which is how we found ourselves on a steep, thrillingly narrow helter-skelter, hurtling down five storeys to pop out in the ground-floor cafe, dizzy but strangely elated. I need one for my flat. Next day, after a trawl around Dalslands Konstmuseum, Upperud’s public art gallery – a lot of blood and guts – we set off for the three-night wilderness section of our trek, our food supplies augmented by Kerstin’s energy bars and containers full of silosallad, her own concoction of grains, harissa, grilled veg and salad. In medieval times, pilgrims could stay for free in specially built shelters. On the trail north from Upperud, this tradition has been rekindled. Half-a-dozen rustic wooden constructions dot the route, three of which are brand-new pyramid-shaped affairs with braziers inside. Each sleeps half a dozen, but as we only once saw any fellow walkers – naturally, they passed as I was engaging in a sneaky skinny dip – we had them to ourselves. The trail proved bumpy rather than hilly, through forests and up rocky ridges, where butterflies distracted us from views of myriad lakes amid an ocean of trees. We eventually reached Högelund, where there’s not only a new pyramid shelter but a shiny compost loo. Having been caught in a heavy shower, we dried our footwear by a toasty fire and downed a medicinal shot of rum. The next couple of days were spent in blissful sunny solitude. Never before had we seen so many lupins – at times it felt like the whole countryside was dressed in their purples, pinks and whites. This being Sweden in summer, the days were long, so we had plenty of time to get to a shelter before nightfall. When we reached the one at Tansjön, we sat alone by the lake as it turned a glorious salmon pink at twilight, while deer sounded their cough-like bark somewhere off in the forest. We returned to civilisation with the village of Edsleskog and its wärdshus (guesthouse), run by Hanneke and Johan Postma. They are Dutch exiles who moved here with their children after years of holidaying in the area; the guesthouse enjoys views over Lake Edslan and a sun-trap terrace on which we ate all our meals. Johan also has a canoe that guests can borrow. Keen to continue following the old pilgrim trail north, albeit on water, I asked if I could take it out solo, my companion having retired for a post‑prandial nap. “I’ll be fine alone,” I assured him. “I’m an old hand – I canoed across Scotland in five days, you know.” And off I went. Three hours later, Johan arrived in a car with his teenage son and his teenage son’s teenage girlfriend – neither of whom felt the need to hide their amusement – to rescue the canoe and the idiot Englishman from the lake’s western shore. A strong wind had battered me there and, despite my ever more frantic efforts, the waves insisted on driving me back to the banks. My mortification was complete when, half an hour after we got back, the lake had become as smooth as a mirror. Being a pilgrim is harder than it looks, you know. • Rail travel was provided by voyages-sncf.com (0844 848 584, which offers Interrail pass valid for five days’ travel in a 15-day period for £235 per adult, youth (12-26 years) £186 , children under 11 travel free.

While the others were identified with a name and their country’s flag, Y Mardini was identified by a white flag emblazoned with the Olympic rings. A beep, and they were curving into the blue pool. Mardini was slightly ahead for the first length, but lost momentum on the turn. She struggled to catch up to the Grenadian swimmer next to her – until the last few strokes, when, like her childhood hero Michael Phelps, she found a final burst of speed, and touched the wall first. The butterfly is a powerful, uncompromising stroke, and head-on pictures of Mardini in full flight only underline this: delicate face furious with focus, big shoulders lifting arms like wings. But what was more powerful, for millions watching, was the flag, and why she was competing under it: Mardini was swimming in her first Olympics as a member of the refugee team, travelling on a document that enabled her to go anywhere except her home country of Syria, from which she had literally swum away. Butterfly tells the story, in Mardini’s own (ghostwritten) words, of how she got to that starting block. It is a story full of so much incident, put so plainly and at such a pace, that the reader begins to feel just as Mardini does about her late teens: “Things happen so fast there’s no time to reflect.” The swimmer, now 21, was born in Damascus. Her father competed for the national swimming team until he had to do military service; all ambition was then transferred to his two daughters, Sara and Yusra. He threw them into pools when they were still tiny, fishing them out again under their mother’s horrified gaze. Later, he insisted they keep training even when Sara’s shoulders began to give under the strain, when Yusra had fainting spells, or ear infections, or, one day, when a weight-training machine, released unexpectedly by a team-mate, split her cheek open. “Dad wants us to be the best swimmers. The very best. On Earth. Ever,” writes Yusra, who, frightened, obeyed his autocratic requirements, swimming two hours a day under an unsmiling portrait of President Bashar al-Assad. Sara made the national team, and won a medal at the Pan-Arab Games; a picture is taken of her, with her medal – and Assad. The Arab spring rumbles in the distance, comes closer and closer, until it spills into Syria. They wait for it to pass, “and while I wait, I swim,” Yusra writes. “Swimming is the best distraction.” But one day they turn into their street to find three tanks squatting at the end of it, and a soldier takes direct aim at their car. Not long afterwards, their father is arrested in a case of mistaken identity, hung upside down and beaten. Their home is flattened, and they are at the mercy of landlords who take advantage of their vulnerability to rack up rents. Mardini watches as the stadium where she trains is destroyed by a shell. Then one day, as she is swimming elsewhere, there is a sound of shattering glass, shouts – and in the suddenly clear water, an unexploded bomb. Sara already knows she must leave Syria; Yusra now realises it, too. So, leaving their mother and much younger sister in Damascus, they set out for Turkey and the Mediterranean. Their dinghy is turned back once by the Turkish coastguard. When they set off again the sea is no longer flat under the sun, but full of “churning teeth”. Fifteen minutes in, the engine fails. The boat is full and riding low so they throw anything out that they can. Then one of the men, a non-swimmer, bravely goes over the side, and hangs on. The dinghy lifts. Sara goes in, too, then Yusra. The sisters don’t physically pull it to shore, as has been widely reported – 10km (six miles), in high seas, with a heavy boat, is impossible even for two national-level swimmers – but they hold it steady, feeling for currents, keeping it on course, telling joje and smiling so as not to worry the six-year-old who is still on board. Night falls. Yusra was the sister who captured the public imagination, but Sara is really the hero here – plucky, confident, charismatic, a natural leader given to reckless irreverence in the face of muscled, humourless men abusing their scraps of power. Yusra’s arc, though, is so improbable, so narratively neat, that it is not surprising there’s a film, directed by Stephen Daldry, already in the works. She has met Barack Obama, and the pope. The account of the sisters’ travels after they land on Lesbos is a litany of faithless smugglers, prisons, border after border, trains that stop in the middle of a European nowhere while passengers wait, hearts in mouths, for the police to crash in – a litany predictable, not just from the recent refugee crisis but from film after book after memoir throughout the 20th century. They could be Armenians, or Poles, or Jews escaping Germany – except this time, Germany is where they’re heading (they even, disconcertingly, find themselves billeted in a camp where Rudolf Hess was once held). The weekend they arrive in Germany they are two of 20,000 similar arrivals. Vastly grateful for individual kindnesses, Mardini is nevertheless shocked at the degree to which all that she is – Damascene, swimmer, girl becoming woman – is collapsed into one word: refugee. She fears that she is only competing at the Olympics out of pity. Yet she agrees to race in order to demonstrate her individuality – and that of all other refugees. To say, on bigger and bigger stages: “A refugee is a human being like any other.” • Aida Edemariam’s The Wife’s Tale is published by 4th Estate.

While taxpayer-funded finance has increased, and the private sector has stepped up with some initiatives, the amount raised could still fall short of the goal of providing $100bn a year to the developing world by 2020. The 2015 Paris agreement on climate change re-stated the $100bn financial target, but Oxfam says the taxpayer-funded finance from rich countries in 2015-16 stood at about $48bn, or nearly half the amount promised for 2020. In a 28-page report published Thursday, entitled Climate Finance Shadow Report 2018: Assessing Progress Towards the $100bn Commitment, Oxfam says funding announced by donor countries involves projects and aid not directly related to climate change. The aid organisation found that only $16-$21bn of the overseas aid commitments fell under the strict definition of climate finance – if what was counted was just assistance directed towards reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and towards adaptations for climate change effects rather than economic and social development more generally. Tracy Carty, senior climate-change policy adviser at Oxfam, said the money flowing to the world’s poorest and most vulnerable to tackle climate change was “sadly inadequate”. At the Commonwealth summit held in London in April, governments from the Caribbean and Pacific islands – which make up close to half of the Commonwealth’s members – made impassioned pleas for assistance in dealing with storms, floods, droughts, sea level rises and other effects of climate change. Carty said: “There’s no reason why rules for calculating climate [finance] should be more lax than those for [general overseas] aid. Governments have to agree new accounting standards for climate finance under the Paris agreement. This is an opportunity to agree fair and robust standards.” Governments from around the world are meeting in Bonn this week and next under the auspices of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change to discuss how to implement the 2015 Paris agreement in practice. Climate finance is a key, though contentious, subject under discussion. Rich countries say that when contributions from the private sector are taken into account the amounts of climate finance are in line with the Paris commitments. But Oxfam said there was “no common methodology” to account for the contributions."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"teacher-network/2018/may/12/secret-teacher-the-exodus-of-older-teachers-is-draining-schools-of-expertise","type":"article","sectionId":"teacher-network","sectionName":"Teacher Network","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-12T06:30:24Z","webTitle":"Secret Teacher: the exodus of older teachers is draining schools of expertise","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2018/may/12/secret-teacher-the-exodus-of-older-teachers-is-draining-schools-of-expertise","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/teacher-network/2018/may/12/secret-teacher-the-exodus-of-older-teachers-is-draining-schools-of-expertise","fields":{"headline":"Secret Teacher: the exodus of older teachers is draining schools of expertise","bodyText":"There is a teacher at my school who is adored by students and staff. He’s a dedicated and efficient educator with years of experience who once taught some of our pupils’ parents. The school benefits from his expertise daily, from the way he handles tricky content to how he manages difficult behaviour. In many ways, he is irreplaceable. Sadly, we’re losing him. Forced to record data that’s never looked at and deliver subjects focused on rote-learning that leaves students uninspired, he feels unable to do the job he signed up for. But he’s just one of the older, more experienced teachers leaving the profession. The average age of teachers is falling. In 2013, the OECD teaching and learning international survey found the average age of teachers in secondary schools in England was 39 – almost four years younger than the global average. Government figures show that the number of older teachers has dropped significantly since 2010. The impact of replacing older, experienced teachers with younger, inexperienced individuals is difficult to measure. But it’s clear that students, younger teachers and the wider profession will be affected. In a few years’ time, I’ll be a teacher of above average age for England, with the corresponding seniority and expectation of expertise. Yet I feel hopelessly unprepared to become the new “old guard”. My students enjoy their lessons and do well enough, but I rely on advice from older colleagues in my practice. Nuggets of wisdom – about how to arrange my classroom on the first day of term and then adjust it for behaviour, for example, or the level of detail needed when teaching certain topics – have made a big difference to how I work. Their insights have helped me make my lessons more meaningful to students. There is an experience vacuum being created in our schools that robs junior teachers of the role models they need to help them improve. Formal teacher training is the equivalent of being told how your parachute works before being chucked out of a plane at 12,000 feet. Becoming a teacher takes years: it’s a lifelong apprenticeship, with best practice passed from experienced colleagues to new recruits. Newly qualified teachers have many strengths, such as energy and adaptability, but they’re not experts in the art of teaching – and nor should they be expected to be. I fear that by losing our top tier of experienced professionals, overall quality will drop, generation on generation. The only way to reverse the declining average age of teachers is by changing the culture of the profession and giving people incentives to stay in the job. But any real shift will come too late for teachers like me, who have enjoyed only a handful of years in the presence of colleagues with decades of experience. Without their guidance, confidence and expertise, we’ve got a knowledge gap about what works in teaching – and that’s a problem.

Working from a studio in their home town of Arnhem in the Netherlands, the brothers bring a surplus of exuberance to their creations, which are richly animated, expressive and – how better to put it? – human, even when they aren’t quite human. “If we have to make a reconstruction,” says Adrie, “we always want it to be a fascinating one, not some dull white dummy that’s just come out of the shower.” In the 10 or so full-sized reconstructions completed during their career they have run the gamut of human history, from “Lucy” – the earliest known hominin fossil – to Homo erectus, Neanderthal man and, of course, Homo sapiens. Just last week, they put the finishing touches to a model for St Fagans National Museum of History in Wales. Due to be unveiled in October, it will be the third Kennis &amp; Kennis work on display in the UK. The process is exhausting. First, they rebuild the skeleton, sometimes using fossils from several different sites, with the help of computer scans and 3D printing. The skeleton is suspended with wire cables and the spine is made flexible using silicone cartilage between the vertebrae. “We use a kind of paraffin wax clay to sculpt the muscles,” says Adrie, “and we make arteries using small ropes which lie over the muscles.” Layers of another clay are then wrapped around the sculpture as skin, and a mould is made to replicate the sculpture in silicone. “We do five layers of silicone to make the skin colour,” explains Adrie, “because real skin is translucent.” To achieve the remarkable accuracy and individuality of each of their sculptures, the Kennis brothers draw deeply from two reservoirs of inspiration. First, they are students of the science behind human anatomy and evolution, constantly educating themselves about the relative merits of the human and Neanderthal pelvis, and painstakingly rebuilding skeletons and musculature for each new sculpture. Fortunately for them, their career has coincided with huge leaps in DNA testing, allowing them to accurately recreate genetic traits such as hair type and eye colour. (Earlier this year, a heated political debate broke out after a Kennis model portrayed the earliest Briton, known as Cheddar Man, with dark skin.) Second, they are keen amateur anthropologists, and their sculptures are influenced as much by modern tribal peoples as they are by the fossilised skulls of their actual subjects. By studying people from more isolated or primitive societies, the brothers believe they can see through a window into the past. “They live outdoors, with completely different rules from ours. If you see pictures of the Tehuelche people of Patagonia, they walk nearly naked in snow. They have totally adapted to those conditions. And if you imagine going much further back in time, imagine how different those people would be…” For this reason, Kennis models often exhibit unique hairstyles and tribal tattoos, and strike poses that appear startlingly modern, provoking strong reactions. “We bring it to the museum, and many times the museum directors are shocked, because they find it too extreme, too alien.” This alien-ness is tempered, however, by their particular skill for facial expressions, giving life and personality to the clay. Each full-sized reconstruction takes half a year, but a face alone can take a whole month, and although the brothers refuse to refer to themselves as artists, this is obviously the area that gives them the greatest artistic freedom and satisfaction. “There are some things the skull can’t tell you,” admits Adrie. “You never know how much fat someone had around their eyes, or the thickness of the lips, or the exact position and shape of the nostrils.” This personal quality is what makes Kennis models so captivating, and so desirable to museums: they don’t simply depict a generalised early man, but a specific man or woman, an effect that allows onlookers to glimpse human prehistory with immediacy, even familiarity. But while curators and museum-goers are sometimes surprised by the vivid, emotive features of the Kennis models, there is only one person Adrie needs to impress: “If Alfons doesn’t like the face, I am disappointed. But if he likes it, if we are both satisfied, then we can handle the whole world.” Homo sapiens and Neanderthal side by side (pictured at top of article) Natural History Museum, London These two reconstructions demonstrate the differences between an early human – in this case taken from a Czech fossil – and his distant relative the Neanderthal, reconstructed from Belgian remains. “We made them as a pair, to compare,” says Kennis. “That’s why they are in a relaxed pose, never a cliched hunting or making-fire pose, because then you can’t see the anatomical differences between them.” For the same reasons, the models are unclothed. “We like to keep them naked because then you can see the features clearly: the Neanderthals were short with big hands and a broad pelvis, the first Homo sapiens were very slender.” This has been another source of controversy in the brothers’ work. “Chris Stringer, the head of anthropology at the NHM, gets emails all the time, usually from fathers, saying it’s scandalous that his daughter had to see a naked guy in the museum. It’s always parents that make the problems Cheddar Man Natural History Museum, London, United Kingdom “Cheddar Man”, Britain’s oldest complete skeleton, was a mesolithic hunter-gatherer living around 10,000 years ago. Kennis and Kennis made the reconstructed head for a Channel 4 documentary earlier this year, using the skull found in Cheddar Gorge in 1903. Contrary to previous assumptions, DNA analysis revealed that Cheddar Man had dark skin and wavy hair, and the model was met with some controversy. “Many people were surprised by his dark skin,” says Kennis, “but for us, it was not a big surprise. At least three other hunter-gatherer skeletons have been found in Europe from around the same time, and DNA tests show they all have that strange combination of dark skin and blue eyes.” Neanderthal woman and child Gibraltar Museum This pair of Neanderthals, commissioned by the Gibraltar Museum in 2016, display the Kennises’ commitment to marrying scientific accuracy with human characteristics. “When we put the skeletons together,” recalls Adrie, “we used two life models standing for us. The child model happened to put her arms around her grandmother, and the grandmother’s face was suddenly so proud – proud of her granddaughter. It was such a nice idea, the woman looking proud while the child hangs around her waist.” Not much is known about the Neanderthal sense of community, but Kennis imagines a civilised species: “Neanderthals were quite modern. In la Sima de las Las Palomas [a Neanderthal cave in southern Spain] they were found buried, aligned together, with a panther claw on their chests. They had some art, they had bigger brains than us; I think the Neanderthal community was not so different from [that of] Homo sapiens.” Early European man from Peştera cu Oase, Romania Neanderthal Museum, Mettmann, Germany “This is the first western European Homo sapiens,” says Kennis, “reconstructed from the skull of a young adult, about 34,000 years old.” At this point in prehistory, humans had migrated to Europe from Africa via the Middle East, and Neanderthals had only recently become extinct. “Modern humans [those who left Africa around 70,000 years ago] have up to 4% Neanderthal DNA, but this man has about 9%. His ancestors had bred with Neanderthals only six generations before.” As is often the case with Kennis &amp; Kennis, the sculpture has raised curious questions about race. “If you ask people to pinpoint what continent he comes from, people say such different things,” says Kennis. “But he actually comes from Romania.” Ötzi the iceman South Tyrol Museum of Archaeology, Bolzano, Italy, 2011 More recent than most of Kennis &amp; Kennis’s subjects, Ötzi lived in the Tyrolese mountains 5-6,000 years ago, during the copper age. Because his body was mummified in ice, much more can be deciphered about his physiognomy and lifestyle. “He was 45, which is quite old,” says Adrie, “and he was very sick when he died, with stomach problems. His skull has an underbite, and his face points downwards: not a pretty face. Some people who see the reconstruction say: ‘Wow! It’s good!’ because he looks like shepherds who live high in the mountains and spend their lives out of doors.” Not everyone, however, was so thrilled with the Kennis version of Ötzi. “We did some research around the village where he was found, and many people thought he was young and handsome – a Johnny Weissmuller kind of guy. You should have seen how disappointed they were when they saw our reconstruction.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/may/13/bordeaux-wine-reign-is-over-david-williams","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-13T11:00:06Z","webTitle":"Is Bordeaux’s reign as the king of wines over? | David Williams","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/13/bordeaux-wine-reign-is-over-david-williams","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/13/bordeaux-wine-reign-is-over-david-williams","fields":{"headline":"Is Bordeaux’s reign as the king of wines over?","bodyText":"News from Bordeaux used to dominate this time of year. It’s the season when producers in the region host their equivalent of the Cannes film festival – the en primeur tastings. Samples of wines harvested the previous autumn are shown off to thousands of members of the wine trade and press, whose reactions help shape the wines’ release prices, which traditionally emerge, after much feverish speculation and debate, during the early summer. In recent years the whole circus has begun to seem a little tired. Prices for the top few dozen chateaux have escalated, even for less impressive vintages – a 700% rise in three decades – meaning a generation has grown up without getting to know what are still among the finest wines around. Of the 20 wine merchants I chatted to at an event in London just before en primeur week, only one was making the journey to the Gironde estuary this year. The rest scratched their heads trying to remember the last time they’d been and, as one master of wine who’d last made the journey for the much-hyped 2005 vintage, asked: “What is the point any more, for business or pleasure?” Whatever sadness these refuseniks may feel about how the most famous wines of Bordeaux and, to perhaps an even greater extent, Burgundy have been turned into investment vehicles for the 1% is mitigated by the opportunities now available elsewhere in the world. Some of these regions – the biggest names of California, the Rhône and the Italian trio of Barolo, Barbaresco and Brunello di Montalcino – have in fact already joined Bordeaux and Burgundy on the list of things that most wine lovers will never be able to buy. Others, however, are still at that point in their development where prices have yet to catch up with sometimes exceptional quality. These may be wines from reinvigorated Old World regions: in France, the red wines of Beaujolais, and of Cahors and Madiran in the south-west; the white chenin blancs and red cabernet francs of the Loire; the red and white blends from hillside sites in the Languedoc and Roussillon; in Italy, the southern renaissance of Puglia, Sicily and Campania; in Spain, the new-wave of garnacha from the mountains of Madrid and the hills of Catalonia, and the red mencía and white godello and albariño of Galicia. Or they might be the result of the newfound focus on the local and specific in the formerly somewhat homogenous New World. Argentina’s Uco Valley; Chile’s Itata; Australia’s Adelaide Hills; New Zealand’s Gimblett Gravels; South Africa’s Swartland … these are just a handful of the names whose rise has made a mockery of the old obsession with Bordeaux. The en primeur king is dead! Long live wine’s new and future queens! Zorzal Eggo Tinto de Tiza Malbec Gualtallary, Argentina 2015 (from £15.49, strictlywine.co.uk; hic-winemerchants.com; greatwinesdirect.co.uk) Argentine malbec has developed enormously in the past decade with producers looking to express specific vineyards and districts, such as this very fine silk-textured wild-flavoured rendition of Gualtallary high up in Tupungato in Mendoza’s Uco Valley. El Hombre Bala Old Vine Garnacha Madrid, Spain 2015 (from £18.90, thebottlebank.co.uk; prohibitionwines.com; theguildfordwinecompany.co.uk) The reputation of the garnacha grape has been transformed in Spain in recent years, with the Gredos mountains near Madrid at the forefront of its restyling as a perfumed “pinot noir of the south” in wines such as this herby, red berry-scented gem. Domaine Ratron Cuvée Tradition Clos des Cordeliers Saumur-Champigny, France 2015 (£10.50, thewinesociety.com) Thanks to improvements in both vineyard and winery, the Loire’s best cabernet franc red wines, such as this delightful example from Saumur-Champigny, are, in good vintages, a match for bordeaux in their mix of graphite and curranty freshness. Mother Rock White Swartland, South Africa 2016 (from £14.95, slurp.co.uk; hedonism.co.uk) With its exotic cast of grape varieties built around chenin blanc, and with its arresting combination of taut, tangy acidity, apple and stone fruit, this is a fine example of a distinctive, bona fide 21st-century classic wine style: the South African white blend. Le Soula Blanc IGP Côte Catalanes, France 2010 (£28, Waitrose) A key wine in the emergence of the Languedoc-Roussillon as a producer of fine wines in the past couple of decades, Le Soula Blanc is a gorgeously rich, evocative and age-worthy blend of varieties that sings of the wild, high-altitude Fenouillèdes region. Craft 3 Adelaide Hills Chardonnay Australia 2016 (£60 for case of six, Marks &amp; Spencer) This is excellent value for a wine that shows off so much of the elegant best of modern, cooler-climate Australian chardonnay, expressive and balanced, with clean lines, juicy apple and pear flavours, and peach-downy texture."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/2018/may/02/lost-in-translation-macron-thanks-australian-pms-delicious-wife","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-02T17:04:28Z","webTitle":"Lost in translation: Macron thanks Australian PM's 'delicious' wife","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/02/lost-in-translation-macron-thanks-australian-pms-delicious-wife","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/02/lost-in-translation-macron-thanks-australian-pms-delicious-wife","fields":{"headline":"Lost in translation: Macron thanks Australian PM's 'delicious' wife","bodyText":"Was it a verbal faux pas, or a jeu de mots gone wrong? We will probably never know, but Emmanuel Macron’s choice of English words certainly set Australian tongues wagging. “I want to thank you for your welcome,” the French president said to the country’s prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, at the end of a joint press conference in Sydney on Wednesday. “Thank you and your delicious wife for your warm welcome.” The more charitable among the Australian media present reckoned Macron, who was in Australia for trade and regional security talks before visiting the French territory of New Caledonia, was already thinking of his lunch. Turnbull had just observed that the president had to rush off for a meal with the French community in Sydney. “Yes, for French gastronomy, for the French winery,” Macron replied, moving on to describe his host’s wife too as “delicious”. Others said the French president, who prides himself on speaking fluent – though not flawless – English, might have fallen foul of a faux ami, the French term for a word that sounds similar in another language but carries a different meaning. The French word délicieux, while often employed for the taste of food, would be better translated as “lovely” or “delightful” when used to describe a person. Still others thought Macron may have been attempting an albeit slightly obscure joke referencing Donald Trump’s visit to Paris last year, when the US president was caught on camera telling his host’s wife, Brigitte, that she was “in such great shape ... beautiful”. Whatever the explanation, Macron’s English is an improvement on that of his predecessors. “I’m sorry for the time,” Nicolas Sarkozy once said to Hillary Clinton. That is one meaning of the word temps, but he meant another - the weather. François Hollande also came in for criticism after he signed a letter of congratulation to Barack Obama following his 2008 election with the words: “Friendly, François Hollande”. That was a direct translation of amicalement, meaning “warm regards”. But faux amis can also work the other way. The former British prime minister Tony Blair, who speaks pretty good French, was once caught out when he tried to say, “I envy you” to his French counterpart, Lionel Jospin. Instead of “Je vous envie”, he said: “J’ai envie de vous” – “I want you.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/may/04/friday-best-tv-friday-night-dinner-episodes-high-dry","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-04T05:20:14Z","webTitle":"Friday’s best TV: Friday Night Dinner; Episodes; High & Dry","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/may/04/friday-best-tv-friday-night-dinner-episodes-high-dry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/may/04/friday-best-tv-friday-night-dinner-episodes-high-dry","fields":{"headline":"Friday’s best TV: Friday Night Dinner; Episodes; High & Dry","bodyText":"Friday Night Dinner 10pm, Channel 4 Ah, the joy; the return of Robert Popper’s always very funny sitcom about a Jewish family’s ever-thwarted efforts to settle down for a customary Friday-night meal.

Ty Cobb will retire at the end of the month and reportedly be replaced by Emmet Flood, a veteran lawyer who represented Bill Clinton during his impeachment. Cobb told the New York Times on Wednesday that he informed Trump of his decision weeks ago. “It has been an honor to serve the country in this capacity at the White House,” he was quoted as saying. “I wish everybody well moving forward.” Cobb has been the point man dealing with special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation. In one memorable incident last September, the lawyer was overheard by a reporter talking about the case with John Dowd, another member of the legal team, at a steak restaurant near the White House. Dowd quit in March, just days after Trump had insisted on Twitter: “I am VERY happy with my lawyers, John Dowd, Ty Cobb and Jay Sekulow. They are doing a great job...” Of the three, now only Sekulow survives. Media reports suggested that Trump had become dissatisfied with Cobb’s conciliatory approach and was looking for lawyers who are more combative, in the mold of his former mentor, Roy Cohn. His newest recruits, Rudy Giuliani and now Flood, who also represented former vice-president Dick Cheney in a private capacity, are expected to fit the bill. Cobb’s retirement comes as the president’s personal legal team has been negotiating the terms of a possible interview of Trump by prosecutors and a day after Dowd revealed that Mueller’s team in March raised the prospect of issuing a grand jury subpoena for Trump. The New York Times this week published a leak of 49 questions it said the special counsel wants answered. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said on Wednesday: “For several weeks Ty Cobb has been discussing his retirement and last week he let Chief of Staff Kelly know he would retire at the end of this month.” Referring to the investigation as a “witch hunt”, she later confirmed: “Emmet Flood will be joining the White House Staff to represent the president and the administration against the Russia witch hunt. Ty Cobb, a friend of the president, who has done a terrific job, will be retiring at the end of the month.” Meanwhile, Trump appeared to threaten to get involved in a dispute between the deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein, and Republicans in Congress on Wednesday. In a tweet, the president said: “A Rigged System – They don’t want to turn over Documents to Congress. What are they afraid of? Why so much redacting? Why such unequal ‘justice?’ At some point I will have no choice but to use the powers granted to the Presidency and get involved!” They seemed to refer to Rosenstein, who said in public remarks on Tuesday that “the Department of Justice will not be extorted” after being asked about articles of impeachment reportedly being prepared against him by some congressional Republicans. The threat of impeachment is being used as leverage for Republican to get more information about the federal investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 election as well as Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server as secretary of state. Earlier in April, the justice department handed over a redacted document about the origins of the Russia investigation to the House intelligence committee after its chair, Devin Nunes, publicly mused about holding law enforcement officials in contempt of Congress or even impeaching them for not cooperating. Rosenstein said on Tuesday that “if we were to just open our doors to allow Congress to come and rummage through the files, that would be a serious infringement on the separation of powers”. Trump’s tweets echoed remarks he made last week in a telephone interview with Fox News in which he said “they have this witch-hunt going on with people in the justice department that shouldn’t be there. They have a witch-hunt against the president of the United States going on”. He added: “I’ve taken the position, and I don’t have to take this position, and maybe I’ll change, that I will not be involved with the justice department.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/may/03/world-cup-fiver-japan-vahid-halilhodzic","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-03T11:05:15Z","webTitle":"World Cup Fiver | The chances of a spectacular implosion have definitely lengthened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/03/world-cup-fiver-japan-vahid-halilhodzic","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/03/world-cup-fiver-japan-vahid-halilhodzic","fields":{"headline":"The chances of a spectacular implosion have definitely lengthened","bodyText":"VAHID REASONING Japan have attended the last five World Cups and been perfectly nice about it. But the “Blue Samurai” haven’t exactly marked the tournament’s history. Even when they helped stage the thing in 2002 they were eclipsed by their co-hosts, as South Korea rode a wave of zany refereeing all the way to the semi-finals. So, apart from a couple of slick displays in 2010, Japan’s international achievements boil down to four Asian titles and unparalleled success in the Kirin Cup, an annual competition run by a brewery and whose other past winners include the United Arab Emirates and Scotland. There were high hopes that Ethics 2018 might be different, that this would be the year Japan treated us to something really memorable. But then they went and sacked head coach Vahid Halilhodzic last month, lessening the chances of anyone from the Land of the Rising Sun generating a funk akin to Roy Keane’s or that of a whole posse of French mutineers in 2010. Halilhodzic, also fired by Ivory Coast on the eve of a previous World Cup but a success with Algeria in 2014, is a magnificently austere taskmaster who liked to announce his team selection from a lectern and had spoken of his wish to make Japanese players “more aggressive, street-smart and vicious”. Now he’s gone, the spoilsport Japanese FA ousting him lest his no-nonsense approach lead to under-performances or a tremendous ruckus on the global stage. “Communication and trust with players became weakened,” explained the Sports Hochi newspaper, “and a sense of unity was lacking.” Halilhodzic disagreed, naturally. “I am in shock,” he fumed. “It’s very difficult for me to accept this decision. Believe me, I didn’t deserve it. There was a very good atmosphere in the squad and results were good.” Well, results weren’t that good – three wins in 12 matches – and performances have been meek, although Halilhodzic suggested that’s because some of the country’s star players, such Shinji Kagawa and Keisuke Honda, aren’t as hot as they used to be. There were whispers that Japan might try and persuade Arsène Wenger to step in but instead they went a completely different route and appointed Akira Nishino, a well-spoken veteran whose glory days seem to be in the distant past. Nishino, in fairness, has previously overseen one of the proudest feats in Japanese football history, a victory over Brazil at the 1996 Olympics. He also made Gamba Osaka Asian champions in 2008. And in 2012 he wrote a lovely treatise on “the thrills of attacking football” and got some positive online reviews. “Even if it only increases the chances of winning at the World Cup by one or two per cent, we had to act,” wibbled Japanese federation president Kozo Tashima. Maybe the chances of Japan beating Colombia, Senegal or Poland this summer have increased a tad; the chances of a spectacular implosion have definitely lengthened.

Their feet like to run through the soil finding the good stuff. If you want tender beans you need at least 38cm of topsoil or compost before you hit any sort of compaction and a good layer of mulch to keep their feet well fed and wet through the growing season. Space plants 15cm apart with 45cm between rows. You need a further 1.5m between double rows. If you’ve limited space, use a wigwam. Runner beans grow up to 3m tall, so the support needs to be strong enough to take all that leaf and bean weight in the wind. Or there are a number of dwarf varieties: the bicoloured ‘Hestia’ is my favourite, or ‘Jackpot Mixed’ (all the colours from red to peach), that grow fantastically well in pots and look lovely in flower beds. If grown in the ground they’ll need low support, otherwise the beans sit on the soil and get munched by slugs. You can also artificially dwarf tall cultivars by nipping out the growing tip of the plant when it’s about 20cm high and then nipping out any sideshoots after the second leaf. This will also promote earlier cropping. We love runner beans so much in the UK that there has been endless breeding. You can have fire-engine-red flowered forms such as ‘Firestorm’ or ‘Scarlet Emperor’, or purest white such as ‘Czar’, ‘Moonlight’ (crossed with french bean for tenderness) or ‘Snowstorm’ (again crossed with a french bean), or bicoloured such as ‘Painted Lady’ or the patriotic ‘St George’ . I like the white and bicoloured best as they have white seed, which is much more attractive for drying. If runner bean flowers make your heart sing, try ‘Sunset’, a peachy glow of a flower, or ‘Celebration’, paler peach, both pretty enough to be in the flower garden. Likewise the Real Seed Catalogue’s ‘Gigantes’, with its extra fat seeds, is perfect for slathering in tomato sauce. It’s still not too late to sow, particularly dwarf varieties that are quick to crop. Rather than get stuck with a whole row of the same variety, see if you can swap with friends. Red- or white-flowered forms mixed with a bicolour look particularly arresting. Flower setting – after pollination when the flowers start to fruit – can be an issue. If they don’t set – usually caused by very hot, or very wet, windy or cold weather when bees don’t appear – you don’t get pods. In hot weather, watering in the evening will make a huge difference. Alternatively, ‘Firestorm’ and ‘Snowstorm’ are self-fertile varieties that set whatever the weather ."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/may/06/syria-worlds-war-rain-netflix-my-year-with-tribe-tv-review","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-06T07:00:15Z","webTitle":"The week in TV: Syria: The World’s War; The Rain; My Year With the Tribe; Mountain","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/may/06/syria-worlds-war-rain-netflix-my-year-with-tribe-tv-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/may/06/syria-worlds-war-rain-netflix-my-year-with-tribe-tv-review","fields":{"headline":"The week in TV: Syria: The World’s War; The Rain; My Year With the Tribe; Mountain","bodyText":"Syria: The World’s War (BBC2) | iPlayer The Rain (Netflix) My Year With the Tribe (BBC2) | iPlayer Mountain (BBC4) | iPlayer Homs, Aleppo, Raqqa, Daraya. The names leach from our radios in the morning, adorn our nightly news programmes – the camerawork always a little graphically sanitised, even post-watershed – and have been doing so since 2011. The woeful misnomer that is the Syrian “civil war” has now been storming our confused, conflicted consciousnesses longer than the second world war, and Lyse Doucet, the BBC’s Canadian-born chief international correspondent, has been there or thereabouts pretty much all along. In Syria: The World’s War she was thus uniquely positioned, with unsanitised footage and access to the higher echelons of talking heads, to give us a back-take on the whole shebang. The horrors – the dust and the torture – were all there but so were the tiny ways in which families tried to clean themselves, dress, go to markets, as if bombs weren’t falling around them. Crucially, she also set it in context, marvelling almost applaudingly at the human capacity for venality, blind revenge and descent to further atrocity. Even she, you feel, can’t quite believe that what began as a hopeful protest against some injustices perpetrated by Bashar al-Assad has been allowed to morph into quite such a blithering grand guignol of failed conflicted diplomacy, at times threatening to engulf the wider Middle East, and then wider still. We saw here how, from such optimistic spring beginnings, a month’s robust torture could turn once-peaceful protesters into hardened rebels. How successive years brought successive game-changers, by which I probably just mean better fighters – first Hezbollah, then Isis, then the Putin machine. How the official “regime” continues to wheedle and to lie: as she interviewed Syrian generals and foreign ministers there was something almost sweet in their outraged refusal to admit to bombings of civilians (despite Doucet’s gentle acres of evidence), like short-trousered kiddie-morons. We saw the aftermath in late 2013 of Obama’s dithering over the crossing, yet again, of one of his “red lines”. We felt, viscerally, the disappointment in the hearts of Syrians; saw, viscerally, the deaths that resulted. Not his finest hour, especially when coupled with Westminster’s pompous doodlings. None said it better than William Hague: “I thought a line had been crossed where we had to take action. After that point, we had almost no influence over the Syrian crisis. It was as if we had walked away and slammed the door and said: ‘You can do what you want. You can kill as many people as you like, with any weapons that you like, there’s nothing you can do to provoke us.’” More than ever, he looks like the best Tory leader we’ve had this century, spat out too soon. This was a remarkably unshowy couple of nights, unspoilt by intrusive music, whizzy special effects or mawkish heart-tuggy grandstanding and all the more powerful for it. Just a good reporter getting on with telling a vile story, still without end. And quietly letting another one tell itself: how those, rebels and government both, who most claim to speak for “the people”, to have “the people’s interests” at heart, have been the very first to shell, bomb, gas, sniper and torture “their” Syrian people. More than 7 million internally displaced. More than 5 million refugees. These are old figures. With all this going on, horrors hardly have to be invented – but invented they imaginatively are, especially in Scandinavia. The latest chills arrive courtesy of The Rain, a Netflix special that brings a nice post-apocalyptic froideur to the lowlands of Denmark. The opener is frenetic, as perhaps needs must. No sooner is Simone preparing for a school exam than her dad hustles her out into a mysterious bunker. The rain falls, and she watches her schoolmates die, infected by some filthy maddening waterborne virus. Then her mum, similarly. Her dad leaves the bunker for tasks unstated: is he accidentally responsible for the virus? Simone and young brother Rasmus are in the bunker for six years. All this in the opener, and it’s time to give a loud “whew” and calm your trembling heart. It settles rather nicely thereafter to some survivalist teens left to wander, questingly. There are great shots of a deserted Copenhagen, nature reclaiming, the Tivoli Gardens grungy, everyone still petrified of the rain, hungry gangs roaming. So far, so standard post-apocalyptic. It all sounds (and looks) rather promising but I can’t work up the enthusiasm, and the other teen survivors are less than charming. Perhaps I’ve just been spoilt: after seeing the apocalypse that befell Aleppo it’s increasingly hard to care about the fake. There was a tremendous closer to My Year With the Tribe, in which, over three episodes, Will Millard has essentially laid bare the dreadful cynicism with which film crews have, for years, exploited the “treehouse-dwelling” – ha! – Korowai tribe of western Papua. And the equal cynicism with which the Korowai have exploited them back. As an anthropological study of a tribe on the very cusp of transition to western, cash values, it could hardly be bettered. Similarly, as an anthropological study of how western film crews have grown increasingly desperate to find just one tribe living deep in any jungle – living in trees, wearing penis-gourds and the rest – and to pay handsomely for the footage, no matter how staged, it was a revelation. Millard – ever companionable, brave, honest, if a little heartbroken by the end – has done us all a service by showing Papua through both ends of the telescope. His alleged friend August turned childishly cruel in this last episode, demanding escalating thousands of dollars, then a boat, then the payment of all his random debts, just to let Will and crew leave the village, or venture further to say a final farewell to two ageing, ill friends. Personally, I would have suggested he go hide his penis-gourd in an anthill. A sublime find on BBC4 was Mountain, in which mountains were filmed, and filmed lovingly. Even if, as the narration (co-written by Robert Macfarlane no less, and voiced by Willem Dafoe with just the right mix of arch chocolate revenance) said: “Mountains don’t seek our love. Or seek our deaths.” We were vouchsafed the keys to a laughably ancient mystery: mountains indeed see time differently from us. Haunting, beautiful, not least in the intercuts of drone shots with music. The “specially curated” (it says here, in the latest press-released atrocity from the BBC) soundtrack included Arvo Pärt, Greig and, notably, Vivaldi’s The Four Seasons, which, for all of its well-worked dependability, retains a surprisingly apt capacity to delight, especially during one searing, slow-mo montage of people falling off cliffs. It’s not often I use the term awesome but this deserves watching again, at least once weekly. You might even be able to take your mind off Syria."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/may/07/hard-sudoku-brain-ageing-beneficial-notes-queries","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-07T10:30:47Z","webTitle":"Is trying to do sudoku good for the brain even if you fail?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/07/hard-sudoku-brain-ageing-beneficial-notes-queries","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/07/hard-sudoku-brain-ageing-beneficial-notes-queries","fields":{"headline":"Is trying to do sudoku good for the brain even if you fail?","bodyText":"When I can’t complete your hard sudoku, is the process of trying still beneficial for my ageing brain?

The company has complained to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards about the conduct of Iain Wright, the former Labour MP for Hartlepool, who chaired the business, innovation and skills select committee during the last parliament. The 2016 inquiry into working practices at the firm was launched after a Guardian undercover investigation exposed how the company was paying staff less than the legal minimum wage. The MPs concluded that Ashley had been running Sports Direct like a “Victorian workhouse”, building his success on a business model that treats workers “without dignity or respect”. Sports Direct and its employment agencies - Transline and The Best Connection - were subsequently named and shamed by the government for paying workers less than the legal minimum wage. The three companies also agreed to award the company’s warehouse workers around £1m in back pay. In the latest development, Sports Direct has complained that Wright, who stepped down as an MP before the last election, failed to act objectively during the select committee inquiry by not fully explaining a donation he received from the Unite trade union, which supplied evidence to the investigation. The retailer also says that Wright misled the company about when the committee would carry out an unannounced inspection of Shirebrook. The visit, in November 2016, ended in further controversy amid claims Sports Direct staff had placed a covert recording device in a room where the MPs were meeting. The transcript of the parliamentary hearing records Wright as opening proceedings by declaring his receipt of a donation from Unite. Later, when Wright asked Ashley if his committee could show up uninvited to inspect the group’s controversial Shirebrook warehouse, Ashley replied: “100%, 24/7”. Wright, a former accountant who now works for the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW), added: “I’m more than happy that he is flagging up what I think was a really good piece of work. My colleagues, who were cross party, worked well together to highlight a list of appalling practices. This is obviously still eating him up and he can’t let it go”. Kathryn Stone, the parliamentary commissioner for standards, now has to determine whether the complaint is within her remit, and whether the evidence justifies an investigation. If she feels Sports Direct’s complaint has cleared those first two hurdles, the rules state that as the complaint is about a former MP, Stone must then also consult the committee on standards, which oversees her work and is staffed by MPs and members of the public."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/shortcuts/2018/may/02/professional-drinkers-must-admit-problem","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-02T16:19:21Z","webTitle":"Do professionals who drink need to admit they have a problem?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/shortcuts/2018/may/02/professional-drinkers-must-admit-problem","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/shortcuts/2018/may/02/professional-drinkers-must-admit-problem","fields":{"headline":"Do professionals who drink need to admit they have a problem?","bodyText":"A study released by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) has found that the most regular drinkers are those in professional jobs, with 69.5% of professionals reported having drunk in the last week, compared with 51.2% of people in routine or manual occupations. When looking at income, 78.9% of those earning more than £40,000 reported having drunk in the last week, as opposed to 46.5% of those earning less than £10,000. It’s also likely, noted the ONS, that people underestimated their alcohol consumption. The figures are not surprising to Katherine Brown the chief executive of the Institute of Alcohol Studies. “Data has shown for a number of years that people in managerial and professional positions are more likely to drink alcohol, and they’re more likely to drink more heavily than people in routine and manual positions,” she says. Nobody, she adds, has been able to give “concrete answers for why this is, but there are a number of theories”. It may be a hangover from student drinking culture; those in professional careers now are more likely to have gone to university, though the ONS study showed younger people are drinking less. “If they adopted heavy drinking practices, and associated their social life with alcohol it could be that this carries on in later life,” says Brown. The professional cultures are also an issue: “In some, such as the finance sector and the legal profession, we have seen recent shifts: drinking at lunchtime is less acceptable than it was.” Last year, Lloyds of London banned drinking during working hours. “However we haven’t necessarily seen a similar reduction in out-of-office-hours drinking cultures; client entertainment often revolves around alcohol.” Are people working in stressful jobs relaxing with alcohol? “We don’t have very strong evidence but it’s a plausible theory,” says Brown. “We know that people work longer hours and perhaps harder than previous generations. Alcohol seems to be the nation’s favourite drug when it comes to self-medicating stress.” The relationship between alcohol consumption and socioeconomic status is complex – it is also the case that alcohol-related mortality is higher in deprived areas – but Brown says stereotypes “around who are problem drinkers need to be dismantled. People can be drinking at levels that are harming themselves, their families and colleagues [by drinking] at what can be deemed socially acceptable levels.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/02/trumps-doctor-is-a-warning-to-all-the-footsoldiers-and-loyal-colluders-itll-come-back-to-bite-you","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-02T15:43:43Z","webTitle":"Trump's doctor is a warning to all the footsoldiers and loyal colluders | Zoe Williams","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/02/trumps-doctor-is-a-warning-to-all-the-footsoldiers-and-loyal-colluders-itll-come-back-to-bite-you","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/may/02/trumps-doctor-is-a-warning-to-all-the-footsoldiers-and-loyal-colluders-itll-come-back-to-bite-you","fields":{"headline":"Trump's doctor is a warning to all the footsoldiers and loyal colluders: it'll come back to bite you","bodyText":"Two years ago, give or take, the US election seemed to hang on the health of the candidates. A video surfaced of Hillary Clinton, seeming to wobble and almost faint as she got into a car. Your head said: this is trivial thing, if it were serious she would have bowed out, it’s probably one of those diseases like labyrinthitis or flu that you don’t believe exists until you get it yourself. Your gut said: this is very bad, voting is primal; no one lines up behind anyone who looks as though they’re about to fall over. Trump, meanwhile, was in rude health, which was plain from his overall rudeness, and also, a letter from his physician, Dr Harold Bornstein. It was like a note you forge from your mum, in reverse: Donald Trump can go swimming, because he is in the best health ever, his level of wellbeing is unlike any you may have encountered in a swim-eligible child. It turns out there was a reason. “He dictated the whole thing,” Borstein told CNN on Tuesday. “I just made it up as I went along,” he unclarified, but I think we can call this an idiomatic US/UK difference: over there, the phrase clearly means: “I wrote down what that other person was saying.” Dig into the text, and this much is obvious: his physical strength and stamina were “extraordinary”. “If elected,” Bornstein made up as he went along, “Mr Trump, I can state unequivocally, will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency.” Healthier than Obama, who could shoot hoops while smoking; healthier than Kennedy, who could fry eggs just by looking at them with his vigorous eyes. “The healthiest ever” may have been the red flag, but the dead giveaway was the “astonishingly excellent”. There can never have been any real doubt that, as Bornstein now admits, “Trump dictated the letter and I’d tell him what he couldn’t put in there.” Ah history, you tantalising discipline. I would give all the ancient pots of Mesopotamia to know what Trump said that couldn’t go in. “He is so healthy that all my medical mind struggles to believe he is human, and not of the gods.” It’s given us all a laugh, except the doctor; he may just be struck off for making false statements. Wherever he ends up, it will be somewhere below “qualified and respected physician with a license to practise”. In what should – given his astonishing good health – become his band name when he remakes himself as a global rock star, Ye Shall Know Trump By His Trail of Indictments. In the investigation into Russian links, Robert Mueller has already secured a series of guilty pleas: Michael Flynn (former national security adviser), George Papadopoulos (former campaign adviser), Richard Pinedo (a “private citizen”, which I think is code for “all-purpose rich person”) and Dutch attorney, Alex van der Zwaan, who has already served 30 days in prison and been fined $20,000. It must, from the inside, look like a game of musical chairs, again in reverse; if you can get out of the one that situates you anywhere near Donald Trump in time, you’ll be OK. This is not how the law sees it. Painstaking and a little pedantic, it will go after anyone who has ever been implicated in anything, starting with the low-hanging fruit. By the time it gets to the high-hanging fruit, its appetite is often sated. After the Watergate scandal, 69 government officials were charged, and 48 of them found guilty. President Nixon was not among them. Their sentences (some as high as 40 years) were a lot longer than the prison time they served (mostly a couple of months), but that’s not the point; the point – for foot soldiers, collaborators, loyal colluders – is that you’re all going down. If you got out today, it wouldn’t be soon enough, but it would be sooner than tomorrow. In local elections, no one wins, especially the local electorate Ah, local elections: the world’s most unwinnable contest. If you are the party of government, you’re expected to do badly, but there’s always a psephologist somewhere who’ll come out of the woodwork tosay you shouldn’t have done as badly as this. If you are the party of opposition, you’re expected to do well, but there will always be a decade in someone’s memory when you did better and still didn’t win the general election, and somehow polite opinion will immediately congregate around the truism that you should wipe that smile off your face because you won’t win where it counts. If you’re neither of those parties, everyone will ask why you’re standing, unless you don’t, in which case they’ll ask why you’ve given up. As if that weren’t dispiriting enough, you are competing for offices of state in which the only real power vested is to enact the will of the government which – if the government’s will is to strip local areas of any cash they may have had the power to allocate – is a thankless task for which “lack of thanks” will probably be the best-case scenario once your period of office grinds to an end. And when it’s all over, everyone always claims to divine some message from it, which this year will be more vexing than ever; whatever the “triumph”, leavers and remainers will both fashion it into an amorphous victory for themselves, a fundamentally inconsequential one, except if the consequence is to annoy each other, as we’re all already managing quite well. And yet, if these are the elections in which to send a message, what a mountain of messages there are: a message against the Windrush scandal, against voter ID, against standing in a stupid way with your legs apart. It’s worth it for that. Even if it is raining. Size of our climate problem is brought close to home The Thwaites glacier in west Antarctica will melt, over the coming generation, unless urgent action is identified in time to save it. Being the size of Britain, that could push the sea level up a metre and a half. There was a time when bad things were the size of football pitches. Then they were the size of Wales. This is the first time that I can think of that the anything untoward has been as large as our whole land mass.

It was a bit of a leap in the dark, for we’d only experienced the island from our honeymoon and holidays and we knew it would be a one-way trip because we could not now afford a home on the mainland. My husband and I had been renting a tiny flat in Edinburgh and we swapped that for a three-bedroom, 18th century house on the harbour front on Orkney for which the rent was 40% less. My salary nosedived, however. I had been manager of a tour company in Edinburgh earning £16,000 a year. When we decided that we were tired of city life I worked freelance for a while, earning about £6,000. I then got a job with Orkney Islands council looking after the 12th century St Magnus Cathedral. I’m now on £17,000. We have very little disposable income and, because on Orkney winters are long and prices high, we live in borderline fuel poverty. There are only six hours of daylight in the depths of winter and our electricity bill is £2,000 a year. Solid fuel costs us £25 a week. When we made our lifestyle change we accepted that we would have to be more self-sufficient and spend less on clothes and nightlife and non-essentials. Prices are higher here because everything has to be brought across the water, and locally produced things tend to be high-end and more expensive. Yet I find it easier to live frugally here than in Edinburgh. It’s the Orcadian tradition to make do and mend. It was part of the deal that we would keep hens and grow vegetables and after five years of renting we bought a one-bedroom cottage for £120,000. It’s tiny. You can just about fit four people in the living room. But it has a third of an acre and 360° views over the Atlantic, the mainland mountains, the island and lochs. We make our own wine, cook meals from scratch, spending about £60 a week on ingredients, and go out for dinner only a couple of times a year, but our social life is better than it ever was in the city. In winter especially people will take a cake round to each other’s houses. The local hall does monthly quiz nights for £1.50 which includes a cup of tea and sandwiches, and I play in a folk band. I’m also chair of the Orcadian Storytelling Trust, organising an annual festival. As a storyteller and tourist guide I can earn an extra £500 to £1,000 a year. Holidays are a couple of visits a year to family on the mainland and we usually stay with them or in a tent. B&amp;Bs or hotels are a last-night luxury. Our two cars are the biggest expenditure. They are essential because public transport is very limited and my commute to work is 20 miles each way. The mortgage repayments are £400 a month and council tax £1,300. I pay £20 for a monthly mobile phone package and we have a basic telephone and broadband deal. £40 a month goes to charity. I wish I understood more about money and how it works. I have two degrees and a management diploma and work a 40-hour week running almost all aspects of Orkney’s biggest tourist attraction. Public sector pay increases do not keep up with inflation so in real terms I am getting less each year and I worry about when I retire. I pay £100 a month into AVC pension contributions and put £300 a month into savings accounts. I’m not advocating communism but I have never understood why some jobs are worth 10 times more than others. I feel I should be earning more. I’d like a bigger house with an extra bedroom so we can have friends to stay and space for the hundreds of books I have in storage. And I’d love more land so we could start a smallholding. Having said that, our quality of life is very high if you love ancient monuments, fantastic scenery and wildlife, and a rich social and cultural life. I’m happier here than I’ve ever been anywhere."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"}]}}
