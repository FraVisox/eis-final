I’m just disappointed. When I heard Rita Ora was coming out with what has been called a “bisexual bop” I had high hopes. Ora collaborating with Cardi B, Charli XCX and Bebe Rexha to sing about the joys of snogging women? What was there not to like? As it turns out, a lot. While Ora’s latest single, Girls, released last Friday, is catchy, it has also taken a lot of flak for perpetuating problematic bisexual stereotypes. Such was the backlash to Girls that Ora apologised on Twitter for the song’s content. She clarified that she has “had romantic relationships with women and men … [and] would never intentionally cause harm to other LGBTQ+ people”. But what harm did she cause, exactly? Well, as the singer Hayley Kiyoko (also known as “lesbian Jesus”) wrote in a viral tweet, the song’s lyrics “fuel the male gaze while marginalising the idea of women loving women”. These lyrics include lines such as: “Yeah, we got with the dude / I saw him he was lookin’ at you,” and “Red wine, I just wanna kiss girls, girls, girls.” The song panders to the straight-male fantasy that female bisexuality consists of straight girls getting drunk and making out for a guy’s attention; it furthers the misconception that bisexuality is just about sex, not love. As Kiyoko wrote: “This type of message is dangerous because it … invalidates the very pure feelings of an entire community.” I hate to wheel out the sanctimonious phrase “as a”, but as a “bisexual”, I agree with Kiyoko. I put bisexual in inverted commas because, despite having dated men and women, I’ve always been loth to describe myself as bisexual. The word has terrible connotations. It’s rarely taken seriously, for one thing, with both lesbians and straight men assuming bisexual is synonymous with “fickle and promiscuous”. At least, that has historically been the case. While bisexual erasure – the active process of questioning the legitimacy of bisexuality – is still a problem, the conversation around bisexuality has significantly progressed in the 16 years since I came out as queer. In a 2015 YouGov poll, 49% of 19- to 24-year-old Britons identified themselves as something other than 100% heterosexual. And an increasing number of celebrities are being outspoken about their own sexual fluidity. In an interview with the Guardian last year, for example, Kristen Stewart said: “You’re not confused if you’re bisexual. It’s not confusing at all. For me, it’s quite the opposite.” Last year also saw the song Bad at Love, by the bisexual singer Halsey, hit No 5 on the Billboard hot 100 chart. The song recounts various failed relationships with men and women. It treats relationships with both sexes with equal weight. It doesn’t reduce loving a woman to a drunken romp conducted for a man’s pleasure, like Ora’s Girls does. I can’t remember when I first heard Bad at Love, but I do remember that hearing it moved me to tears. Listening to a woman singing about loving another woman in a way that was heartfelt and personal (and on Spotify’s top-hits list) felt like progress. If songs like that had been in the charts when I was a teenager struggling to come to terms with an identity I didn’t see reflected in the mainstream, it would have made my life a lot easier. Pop culture is important; it helps us define our identities. It makes us feel as if we belong. It shifts cultural norms. So, as Kiyoko, wrote in her viral tweet, it is important for artists to use their platforms “to move the cultural needle forward, not backwards”. Are short men more aggressive? Size doesn’t matter, we are always told. Science, however, would beg to differ. A study by researchers at Vrije University in Amsterdam, suggests that the “Napoleon complex” is real; short men are measurably meaner than their taller peers. The researchers came to this conclusion after gathering a collection of males of varying heights and observing their performance in a money-sharing experiment called the “dictator game”. Smaller men, the academics observed, were more inclined to act aggressively in the game when there was no threat of repercussion. “It’s probably smart for short men to be like this because they have fewer opportunities to get resources,” the lead researcher, Jill Knapen, told New Scientist. If you’re a man feeling personally threatened by this study, worry not, I also bring good news. Research has shown that short people live longer than their lankier friends. Further, while numerous studies would seem to suggest tall men have an inherent advantage in life, there is also plenty of evidence that in today’s technology-driven economy, short men face very few barriers to success. They’re amply represented in magazine rich lists, anyway. Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos are both a relatively modest 5ft 7in (170cm), and both are among the 10 wealthiest men in the world. There have also been studies rebutting the idea that short men are more likely to be temperamental than tall men. Indeed, in 2007, research by the University of Central Lancashire found that taller guys were more belligerent than their shorter counterparts. All of which is to say that headline-friendly “scientific studies” about size probably don’t matter that much. How the 1% are prepping for doomsday The Wall Street Journal recently published a piece on “the upmarket way to prepare for doomsday”. After all, when the (ever-more-imminent) apocalypse finally arrives, one ought to greet it stylishly. Forget bulk-buying baked beans, says the Wealthy Person’s Journal, Armageddon should be upmarket. Rather than panic-buying pulses, the members of the richest 1% the Journal has interviewed seem to be buying things like the Tesla Model X car (cost: at least £72,000), which features a climate-control setting called “bioweapon defense mode”. They are also kitting themselves out in pricey End of Worlds jeans, which are advertised as being “slash-resistant and virtually impossible to rip by hand”. The jeans are not flameproof, however. So, if it’s death by lava for us all, I’m afraid even the dearest designer denim can’t save you."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"music/2018/may/15/the-charlatans-review-memorial-court-northwich","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-15T10:33:19Z","webTitle":"The Charlatans review – north country boys make euphoric homecoming","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/15/the-charlatans-review-memorial-court-northwich","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/may/15/the-charlatans-review-memorial-court-northwich","fields":{"headline":"The Charlatans review – north country boys make euphoric homecoming","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Although the Charlatans started out in the West Midlands and were initially associated with the “Madchester” scene, their spiritual home is the pretty market town of Northwich, Cheshire. The formative lineup decamped here after recruiting resident singer Tim Burgess from the Electric Crayons, beginning the journey towards becoming one of Britain’s most enduring bands. Although they haven’t played here since 1990, they have pulled the stops out for their return. A 10-day Charlatans “takeover” sees events ranging from an exhibition of memorabilia to public interviews. Specially picked bands are playing at the Salty Dog pub, and the Charlatans’ favourite chippy, the Seafarer, even adapts the band’s Up to Our Hips album title for their Up to Our Chips banner. Echo and the Bunnymen did something a bit like this in 1984, when their Crystal Day coaxed fans to cycle around Liverpool on a route shaped like a rabbit’s head – but it’s certainly unusual to see a small town being invaded by armies of followers in “North by Northwich” T-shirts. The first of the band’s four nights at the Memorial Court – from where they were once banned after causing the stage to sink – is different, too. Because the shows are going to vary each night, songs appear from deep down the well. Bird was last played in 2010 and the defiant I Never Want An Easy Life has only been played once in 22 years, while the new, sweetly melodic Totally Eclipsing and Indefinitely in Your Debt are unveiled for the first time. This career-spanning setlist settles into their trademark wistful euphoria. Since they were last here, they have endured the deaths of two members, an imprisonment and a nervous breakdown, but they have emerged as an indefatigable unit, musically and personally solid. Songs such as the thunderous One to Another hinge on the musical collisions between guitarist Mark Collins and Hammond organist Tony Rogers and the fearsome, almost northern soul rhythm section of bassist Martin Blunt and former Verve drummer Pete Salisbury (in for the late Jon Brookes, whose drum kit features touchingly in the exhibition). Burgess, meanwhile, is more talisman than frontman. Surely the only 50-year-old British male who can sport a peroxide version of the bob haircut modelled by Joanna Lumley in The New Avengers, and look fantastic, he never stops dancing and repeatedly raises an arm in the air to galvanise the crowd. Several songs – Come Home Baby, North Country Boy – are uncannily suited for the occasion, and the ageless singer touches his heart as artist and audience yell the “I’m coming home!” line in an ecstatic Just When You’re Thinkin’ Things Over. Talking in Tones (2015) and Different Days (2017) are moodier, channelling Burgess’s love of New Order. Other songs offer uplifting, psychedelic soul, and a storming Let the Good Times Be Never Ending lies somewhere between Brian Auger and the Trinity and Sly and the Family Stone. By the time the set ends – as do numerous Charlatans shows – with the surging Sproston Green, named after a place near Northwich, the crowd are going crazy, and the town’s once bustling high street will receive a much-needed boost from the extra footfall. Why don’t bands do this sort of thing more often? At Memorial Court, Northwich (16, 17 and 18 May, sold out); then the Great Estate festival, Cornwall, 2 June. Then touring."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2018/may/15/chinese-double-amputee-conquers-everest-on-fifth-attempt","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-15T11:55:11Z","webTitle":"Chinese double amputee conquers Everest on fifth attempt","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/15/chinese-double-amputee-conquers-everest-on-fifth-attempt","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/15/chinese-double-amputee-conquers-everest-on-fifth-attempt","fields":{"headline":"Chinese double amputee conquers Everest on fifth attempt","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A Chinese mountaineer who lost both feet trying to reach the summit of Everest 43 years ago and then had his legs amputated due to cancer has successfully climbed the mountain on his fifth attempt. Xia Boyu on Monday got to the top of the world’s highest peak with a group of 13 others more than four decades after his first crack at it. The same day Steve Plain, an Australian, also reached the summit, setting a speed record for climbing the highest mountain on each of the world’s seven continents. Xia, 69, was part of a 20-man Chinese team that tried to scale the 8,848m peak in 1975. About 200m from the top the climbers were forced to turn back due to high-altitude storms. They were descending in difficult conditions when Xia, then aged 26, gave up his sleeping bag to an ill climber, according to Chinese media. He discovered the next morning he had frostbite in his feet, requiring both to be amputated. Speaking from the summit this week, Xia was quoted by the People’s Daily telling a friend he had been preparing for the moment for 43 years. “It’s not been easy for me to reach the peak of Mount Everest which I’ve dreamed of,” he said. Xia used prosthetic limbs to begin climbing small mountains around Beijing and going on long hikes, but learned in 1996 he had contracted lymphoma and would need both legs amputated beneath the knee. By 2014, Xia was ready to tackle Everest again, but his attempt was undone by ice avalanches. Another climb the following year was aborted after the Nepal earthquake. In 2016, he came within 100m of the peak but again had to turn back due to poor weather. His attempt this year was nearly derailed by the Nepal government, which in December banned double amputees and blind people from climbing Everest, part of a raft of restrictions it claimed would make the mountain safer. The Nepal supreme court said the order was discriminatory and stayed it in March. A month before his fifth attempt, Xia told Agence France-Presse that climbing Everest was his dream. “I have to realise it,” he said. “It also represents a personal challenge, a challenge of fate.” About 7.30am on Monday, Xia finally reached the peak. “Boyu finally won his 40-year-long battle for Mount Everest,” Mingma Gyalje Sherpa, the managing director at Imagine Treks, who accompanied the Chinese climber, told the Himalayan Times. He is the second double amputee to climb the summit after the New Zealander Mark Inglis, who reached the peak from the Tibetan side in 2006. Santiago Quintero, who had half of each foot amputated during a climb in south America, also reached the peak in 2013. Xia reached the peak on Monday only a few minutes after Plain, from Western Australia, became the fastest person to climb the “seven summits” – the tallest mountains on all seven continents including Antarctica’s Mount Vinson. Plain, 36, who broke his neck in a bodysurfing accident nearly four years ago, climbed the 4,892m Vinson on 16 January. In the 117 days that followed he summited Mount Aconcagua in South America (6,961m), Mount Kilimanjaro in Africa (5,895m), Puncak Jaya (4,884m) in Papua province, Indonesia, Mount Elbrus in Europe (5,642m) and Denali in North America (6,190m). “Three and a half years ago I was lying in hospital with a broken neck and at that time set myself the goal,” he wrote on Facebook after reaching the summit. He beat the previous speed record by nine days and was presented with an award at the peak. Xia and Plain are among 500 climbers from 38 teams attempting to reach the summit this season."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/may/17/courtney-barnett-on-coping-with-fame-homophobia-and-thinking-she-still-sucks","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-17T15:02:32Z","webTitle":"Courtney Barnett on coping with fame, homophobia – and thinking she still sucks","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/17/courtney-barnett-on-coping-with-fame-homophobia-and-thinking-she-still-sucks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/may/17/courtney-barnett-on-coping-with-fame-homophobia-and-thinking-she-still-sucks","fields":{"headline":"Courtney Barnett on coping with fame, homophobia – and thinking she still sucks","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Many people approach US customs officers with an unreasonable sense of guilt. But it must have been writ large on Courtney Barnett’s face when she handed over her O-1 visa to the officer at Chicago O’Hare International Airport at the beginning of her 2014 tour. “Are you any good?” he demanded. “Not really,” she replied. “Just giving it a go.” He glared through the glass. “You’re supposed to be an ‘alien of extraordinary ability’. Why should I let you in?” It’s hard to imagine a more stellar trajectory than Barnett’s, but she has always been fame’s accidental tourist. Her 2016 debut album, Sometimes I Sit and Think, and Sometimes I Just Sit, was a string of worry beads – about social disconnection, overthinking and neighbourly relations – that was nominated for a Grammy and a Brit, and won the Australian Music Prize and four Aria awards in her home country. “Put me on a pedestal and I’ll only disappoint you,” she warned in Pedestrian at Best – but that warning fell on deaf ears. “Even now I’m like: ‘Aw, I suck!’” she laughs uncomfortably. “It’s ingrained.” Barnett is stretched out on a chair at her desk at the HQ of Milk! Records, the label she started back in 2012 to release her own EP. Now it’s home to a roster of about 10 acts and situated in the Melbourne suburb of Coburg at an office between warehouses, sari shops and Middle Eastern restaurants. Today, as always, she walked the 40 minutes to Milk! from the home she shares with her partner, musician Jen Cloher. (Lore has it that a star-struck Barnett yelled out a proposal at one of Cloher’s gigs, years before they met.) She follows Merri Creek some of the way, the grasslands for which she and Cloher put on a conservation benefit gig in 2016. Sometimes lyrics come to her as she walks. Other times she will listen to her demos, or Oprah’s SuperSoul Conversations podcast. The front room of Milk! is the factory floor: shelves stacked with merch and albums. In the back office there is a rack of 10 guitars belonging to Barnett and Cloher. Barnett’s astronaut suit from her Need a Little Time video dangles from a clothes hanger. Some of her second album was written here: Tell Me How You Really Feel delves deeply into interpersonal relationships and social contracts. “Jen was saying to me that I never tell her how I really feel, and I have close friends that I keep quite an emotional distance from,” Barnett explains. “It’s feeling that disconnect, and how it’s not very helpful.” Despite her guarded nature, Barnett’s skill is in making even her most specific lyrics relatable. It’s unlikely that the audiences who saw her perform Depreston on The Ellen DeGeneres Show and The Tonight Show were familiar with the Melbourne suburb of Preston, yet she has tapped into a generation literate in depression and anxiety, as well as an older crowd reared on the fine-tuned melancholy of Lou Barlow and Kurt Cobain. Barnett still sings with the baffled shrug of her previous record, but Tell Me How You Really Feel is a more intense album: take the kettle whistle at the beginning of Hopefulessness, which turns a domestic scene into an existential scream. Then there’s the song Crippling Self-Doubt and a General Lack of Confidence. By way of explanation, she says: “When I’ve done shows and interviews, I’ve noticed myself doing that female thing, of trying to please people even when they say rude things, not speaking up for myself. Small things, which add up and manifest as a bigger self-hatred.” Barnett at least fought back when it came to internet trolls, writing the single Nameless, Faceless, which features the riposte: “He said, ‘I could eat a bowl of alphabet soup and spit out better words than you.’ But you didn’t.” She says that watching mates like Camp Cope challenge inequality in the music industry has made her more inclined to speak her mind. “I’ve always shied away from verbalising things, and apologising almost for even having an opinion. I’ve realised that’s a weird way to be.” Not long after the release of Nameless, Faceless, Apple rolled out its Australian iPhone X campaign, which set a video of people celebrating the country’s legalisation of gay marriage to Barnett’s cover of INXS’s Never Tear Us Apart. The YouTube clip received so much negativity that comments were disabled. Barnett says: “I really ummed and ahhed about it, but I did that [advert] because it’s such a mainstream company, just to shove it in people’s faces, and then I saw the most fucking homophobic comments on it.” On top of this, there’s the inevitable expectation that Barnett and Cloher will create a Dylan-and-Baez-style self-referential canon, particularly because Cloher’s 2017 self-titled album spoke of the challenges of living with a partner whose career has just gone into warp-drive. But Barnett insists her album is not a “response”, even if Cloher sometimes queries if a song is about her. She’s relieved that the pair now share the same management team and can coordinate schedules. It’s not only about the difficulty of maintaining a relationship when someone’s in the US for three months; Barnett also plays guitar in Cloher’s band. Cloher had previously founded I Manage My Music workshops to help people run their own careers, and has brought her organisational skills to Milk!. They have two casual staff and a bookkeeper, and Barnett works on online elements when she’s on tour. She is used to multitasking. When she first moved to Melbourne from Hobart, she worked in a shoe store, then behind the bar at the Northcote Social Club, and after that an admin job for the Victorian Electoral Commission (“folding the letters that the fines were in”), all the while playing in bands. Having studied drawing and photography at art school, she also designs her own album covers. Now she and Cloher prefer to think of their label as an “artist-run collective”, and it has earned them a dedicated following. Barnett also found time last year to release the album Lotta See Lice, a collaboration with US songwriter Kurt Vile. A month after we speak, as a warm-up for the launch, Barnett plays a secret album preview show with around 100 people crammed into Milk! HQ. Under a string of fairy lights, Cloher introduces Barnett by acknowledging all the things her partner would likely not: the huge crowds she has played to and taken in her stride, and the immense pressure she had been under to write the “difficult second album”. In our interview, Barnett had anticipated there would be interest in that pressure, but she also insisted that any interpretation of her songs tends to be a projection of the beholder. Barnett appears without fanfare. Tonight her band plays Tell Me What You Really Think from start to finish, and in this live setting she is at ease, immersed in her performance. The discomfort snaps back in between songs, so she makes a joke of rushing to the next in order to avoid conversation. The set winds up with Sunday Roast, a pep-talk to a friend with a sweet “keep on keeping on” refrain that Barnett says she wrote as a pre-teen. The guitar strap is off her shoulder and she is out of the spotlight before the last chord has finished ringing. Tell Me How You Really Feel is out tomorrow through Barnett’s own label Milk! Records and Remote Control."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"film/2018/may/15/bohemian-rhapsody-first-trailer-queen-freddie-mercury-biopic","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-15T13:30:55Z","webTitle":"Bohemian Rhapsody: first trailer of Queen and Freddie Mercury biopic released","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/may/15/bohemian-rhapsody-first-trailer-queen-freddie-mercury-biopic","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/may/15/bohemian-rhapsody-first-trailer-queen-freddie-mercury-biopic","fields":{"headline":"Bohemian Rhapsody: first trailer of Queen and Freddie Mercury biopic released","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The first full trailer of the long-gestating Queen and Freddie Mercury biopic, Bohemian Rhapsody, has been released onto the internet. Starring Mr Robot’s Rami Malek as Mercury, the band’s exuberant lead singer who died in 1991, anticipation had been stoked on Monday with a short teaser on Queen’s official Youtube channel. The film has been in the works since at least 2010, when it was announced that Sacha Baron Cohen was to play Mercury; however, Baron Cohen left the project in 2013 citing “creative differences” with Mercury’s former bandmates, with guitarist Brian May later calling Baron Cohen “an arse”. The project later ran into further difficulties when its director, Bryan Singer, was fired after reportedly taking too much time off for “health concerns”. Eddie the Eagle director Dexter Fletcher was drafted in to replace him midway through production. The official synopsis describes the film as follows: Bohemian Rhapsody is a foot-stomping celebration of Queen, their music and their extraordinary lead singer Freddie Mercury, who defied stereotypes and shattered convention to become one of the most beloved entertainers on the planet. The film traces the meteoric rise of the band through their iconic songs and revolutionary sound, their near-implosion as Mercury’s lifestyle spirals out of control, and their triumphant reunion on the eve of Live Aid, where Mercury, facing a life-threatening illness, leads the band in one of the greatest performances in the history of rock music.” Bohemian Rhapsody is due for release on 24 October in the UK, 1 November in Australia and 2 November in the US."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2018/may/15/glenn-branca-punk-composer-minimalism-maximal-tribute-guitarist-composer","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-15T09:28:59Z","webTitle":"Glenn Branca: punk composer who turned minimalism maximal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/15/glenn-branca-punk-composer-minimalism-maximal-tribute-guitarist-composer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/may/15/glenn-branca-punk-composer-minimalism-maximal-tribute-guitarist-composer","fields":{"headline":"Glenn Branca: punk composer who turned minimalism maximal","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The experimental guitarist and composer Glenn Branca died on Sunday at age 69, leaving a weighty and singular legacy. Branca helped define New York cool. Even among the many underground artists, musicians and misfits who populated downtown Manhattan in the 1970s and 80s, he stood out as one of the weirdest. His music – with its stark sheets of minimalism and overwhelming guitar-oriented symphonies – filtered into rock and noise, and it’s hard to imagine bands such as Sonic Youth and Swans without him. Originally trained in theatre, with no formal musical education, he brought intense drama to experimental music. Branca’s sound was “the most radical, intelligent response to punk and the avant garde I’ve ever seen”, says Lee Ranaldo, who played with Branca many times, including on his essential early albums Symphony No 1 (Tonal Plexus) and The Ascension. “He could sneer better than anyone,” recalls Ned Sublette, who also played on those records. Branca – with his shock of unruly hair, upturned collar and theatrical presence – cut a distinct figure on the streets of Manhattan. “He was the archetypal downtown character. He was like what you would imagine New York was supposed to be like,” says Dan Selzer, whose label Acute Records reissued several of Branca’s albums, including those of his earlier group Theoretical Girls. Branca’s sound was heavier and louder than many of his contemporaries. “‘New music’ had this John Cage, Zen-like minimalism, as well as this sort of static pattern minimalism of the next generation of composers who got called minimalists, for better or worse,” says Sublette. “It was almost anti-dramatic – there was an emphasis on Buddhism, meditation – but Glenn was all about sturm und drang and climax, and how long can you prolong that climax. It was very dramatic music.” The Ascension, released in 1981, still stands as Branca’s best work, but the recording doesn’t quite replicate the immensely powerful sound Branca and his bandmates experienced when it was made. “No one has heard The Ascension really the way we heard it,” says Sublette. “We recorded it at the Power Station, the great studio in New York, where Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards [of Chic] were working regularly, where Bruce Springsteen recorded.” Branca and his co-conspirators managed to get the studio on the cheap during the overnight shift, and carefully set up in the space, getting all the amp settings just right. Sublette explains a typical example of Branca’s approach at that time. “All the strings on every guitar would be tuned to E,” he says. “If everybody plays an E – you get four people with four guitars playing 24 different E’s at once – you get this choral sound. It’s not like any other E.” The composer Rhys Chatham also emerged with some similar ideas at around the same time, crafting guitar symphonies, but Chatham and Branca each had a very distinct sound and approach. “This was a sound that no one in the world had ever heard,” laughs Sublette, about his time recording with Branca at the Power Station. “As we played it, there was a guy standing in the back listening, and it was Ian Hunter from Mott the Hoople, standing there listening with his mouth open.” Though Branca achieved a level of mainstream success in his later years – performing at big festivals such as Primavera Sound in Barcelona and upscale venues such as the Philharmonie de Paris – he remained defiantly underground. “He definitely had this ‘no sellout’ vibe,” says Selzer. At a Branca show I once witnessed in a grungy basement in the East Village, Branca played to an audience of maybe a dozen people. It was an overpoweringly loud and intense experience – and utterly surreal to see a legend like Branca performing in a dive bar, melting people’s minds. He wrote numerous symphonies over his life, inspiring musicians across many genres. “I think he had an ambition with the first symphony to be perceived not as noise from a New York rock’n’roll guy, but as legitimate new classical music,” says Selzer. “Branca’s music and approach changed what I thought was possible with writing music for the guitar,” says guitarist William Tyler. “Before him I didn’t think you could really ‘compose’ for that instrument, and he blew it wide open. Somewhere between prog rock cadences, the liberty of punk and the droning attack of the great minimalists, he proved the electric guitar is just as versatile of a concert instrument as the piano or cello.” Branca’s death is a major loss, but that electric guitar will ring on."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"crosswords/quiptic/966","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-20T23:00:09Z","webTitle":"Quiptic crossword No 966","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/quiptic/966","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/quiptic/966","fields":{"headline":"Quiptic crossword No 966","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"business/live/2018/may/15/german-growth-slows-trade-uk-unemployment-wage-growth-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-15T16:35:10Z","webTitle":"UK real wages rise, but drop in EU workers could hurt NHS – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2018/may/15/german-growth-slows-trade-uk-unemployment-wage-growth-business-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2018/may/15/german-growth-slows-trade-uk-unemployment-wage-growth-business-live","fields":{"headline":"UK real wages rise, but drop in EU workers could hurt NHS – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Markets were struggling for direction for most of the day, with the exception of Wall Street which moved sharply lower on renewed worries about the US/China trade talks, a rising dollar and falling bond yields.

As for Brent crude, it is up 0.63% at $78.72 a barrel, having earlier touched $79.47. On that note, it’s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we’ll be back tomorrow. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is now down 246 points. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: Equity benchmarks are in the red as traders become more hawkish. The jump in US government bond yields is prompting traders to switch out of stocks and into bonds. US indices have reached multi-week highs recently on optimism about the US and China coming to a trade deal, and today investors are banking their profits. With Wall Street down as the dollar rises, the FTSE 100 is not benefiting as much as might be expected from the weak pound. The UK’s leading index is up just 0.3%, perhaps because of the dip in the oil price. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: A dominant dollar helped lead to a seriously down in the dumps Dow Jones this Tuesday, while the FTSE lost its lunchtime momentum. Though not quite as strong as analysts’ were expecting, the latest US retail sales figures were solid enough to give the dollar a hefty hawkish boost. The greenback was propelled 0.7% higher against the pound, with cable nearing sub-$1.348 2018 lows, while against the euro it was up 0.8%, forcing the single currency under $1.185. This, combined with the USA’s ambassador to China Terry Branstad stating that the two countries were still ‘very far apart’ on the issue of trade, caused the Dow Jones to have an absolutely miserable time of it after the bell. The index plunged nearly 200 points as the session got underway, trudging back towards 24700 having almost grazed a 2 month high of 25000 on Monday. Normally the sight of a cable-collapse would be like catnip for the FTSE. And yes, the UK index did manage to climb 25 or so points as the day went on. However, that the FTSE can perhaps feel aggrieved that it couldn’t wring more juice from sterling’s slide. Beyond the bearishness plaguing the Dow Jones, the fact Brent Crude has pulled back from its $79 per barrel is potentially responsible for the index not fully taking flight; but even then, BP and Shell are still up around 1.5% apiece, showing investors are still willing to drink down the oil colossi even if the black stuff is off its 3 and a half year peak. Investors may simply have slight reservations about sending the FTSE much higher than it currently is, given that it the index didn’t last long at its 7800-teasing peak back in mid-January. The strengthening dollar after the retail sales figures has taken some of the shine off the oil price, with Brent crude now in negative territory for the day, down 0.17% at $78.10 a barrel. At its peak during the day, Brent hit $79.47, which analysts saying $80 or even $100 could be on the horizon. Back with the UK employment figures and the fall in EU workers, and the Press Association has more details: Labour market data released by the Office for National Statistics showed the fall [in the number of EU nationals] was driven by a steep drop in the number of workers from the eight eastern European countries that joined the EU in 2004. In the latest period, there were an estimated 917,000 nationals of the so-called EUA8 countries - Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia - in work in the UK. This was down by 91,000 compared to January-March in 2017, the largest annual decrease since comparable records started in 1997. Jonathan Portes, professor of Economics at King’s College London, said: “Today’s labour market statistics show a year-on-year fall in the number of European nationals working here, for the first time since the aftermath of the recession. “A combination of factors - a slowing economy here combined with recovery on the continent, but also the political and psychological impact of the Brexit vote - have made the UK a significantly less attractive place to live and work.” Lord Green of Deddington, chairman of Migration Watch UK, pointed to figures for EU-born workers, which he said were 155,000 higher than in the same quarter before the referendum. He said: “These new labour force figures dispose of any claim of a Brexodus.” Madeleine Sumption, director of the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford, said: “The employment rate of A8 migrants in the UK is close to record highs, at more than 85%. Despite that, the number of A8 migrants working in the UK has declined. “These figures are consistent with the possibility that there has been net emigration of A8 citizens but don’t show it conclusively - we’ll need a few more months of data to see whether this is a short-term blip or a real trend. “We do know from other migration figures that over the last couple of years, net migration from A8 countries has fallen proportionally more than it has from the other parts of the EU....” The year-on-year dip in EUA8 workers was not mirrored across other groups of member states. There were 355,000 Romanians and Bulgarians employed in the UK between January and March, up from an estimated 297,000 in the first three months of last year. It is the second highest figure recorded since restrictions on citizens of the two countries working in Britain were lifted in January 2014. The number of nationals of 14 long-term EU member states including Germany, Italy, Spain and France also showed a slight increase - but remained at just over one million. Donald Trump’s surprise move to support Chinese group ZTE over the weekend prompted hopes of progress in trade talks between the US and China. But ahead of new meetings in Washington, US ambassador to China Terry Branstad has said the two sides were still “very far apart,” prompting an opening fall on US stock markets. So despite the reasonable US retail sales figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 151 points or 0.59% while the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.42% lower and the Nasdaq Composite down 0.67%. The retail sales figures have lifted expectations of a series of US rate rises this year, and helped push the dollar higher. Sterling has slipped to a new low for the year of $1.3457, down 0.7%. A US spending boom could be getting underway, says Nordsea’s chief analyst: US retail sales edged up in April with signs of wage growth and the recent tax cuts helping to offset some of the pressure on consumer spending from higher petrol prices. Sales grew by 0.3% last month, in line with expectations, but the March figure was revised up to show a 0.8% surge compared to the initial estimate of a 0.6% rise. Core retail sales, excluding cars, petrol, building materials and food services, climbed by 0.4% in April. Year on year, sales rose 4.7%. Economist James Knightley at ING Bank said: US retail sales have been heavily distorted over the past 6-9 month, but we are finally getting some “cleaner” data that suggests households are in good spirits and are spending in the new season. US retail sales rose 0.3%MoM in April, which was in line with expectations, but there were some nice upward revisions to March’s data from 0.6% growth to 0.8% growth. Importantly, the “control” group, which excludes very volatile items such as food, autos, building materials and gasoline and supposedly better matches consumer spending within GDP, was up 0.4% after a 0.5% gain in March. February was revised up a tenth of a percentage point too. Retail sales have been difficult to interpret for much of the past year. In particular, Hurricanes Harvey and Irma caused extensive damage that triggered a wave of spending as households replaced lost items in Sep-Nov 2017. In fact retail sales soared a cumulative 3.5% during the period only to fall back in Dec, Jan and Feb (although Feb has now been revised up to being flat). Now that these distortions are out the way we expect upcoming data to show households continuing to spend strongly. Employment is rising, wages are growing and tax cuts means there is more cash in people’s pockets. With consumer confidence at strong levels, consumer spending growth is a key factor behind our above consensus 3% GDP growth forecast for the US this year. In turn, this leads us to look for a further three Federal Reserve rate rises in 2018. Over in the financial markets, the oil price has hit a new three and a half-year high. Brent crude is changing hands at $79.30 per barrel, the highest since late 2014. Prices have been rising since America pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal last week - a move likely to take some Iranian oil production off the market. Crude prices have jumped by 75% since June 2017, which has led to higher transport costs and petrol price at the pumps. That in turn pushed up inflation, and is one reason why real wages in the UK had been shrinking (although not any more) The drop in the number of EU workers in Britain could also be a warning sign for UK firms. The UK labour market certainly looks tight, with inactivity and employment both at record highs - and employers facing 806,000 vacancies in the last quarter. Gerwyn Davies of CIPD, the professional body for HR and people development, says bosses may find it harder to recruit staff: “Employers need to be better prepared for a changing and tighter labour market. Labour supply looks set to fall further in the coming months, partly due to an abrupt plateauing in the number of EU citizens in employment in the UK, as this morning’s figures show. Greater investment in skills is needed to offset recruitment difficulties and increase productivity growth alongside more workforce planning activity.” Britain’s hospitals and social services could be hurt by the 28,000 decline in EU workers in Britain over the last 12 months. So warns Dr Heather Rolfe of The National Institute Of Economic and Social Research. She explains: This represents a reduction in arrivals and increase in departures of EU citizens, which employers explain by uncertain futures and hostility. The reverse trend is shown by non-EU nationals in employment who increased in number by 20,000. This may be explained in part by employers making more use of the visa system when faced with skills shortages.... “These trends, in particular the fall in EU nationals working in the UK, are likely to affect the UK’s economic performance and also services, with the NHS and social care under particular pressure”. According to FullFact, EU immigrants make up about 5% of English NHS staff, and 10% of all doctors. The Resolution Foundation have sent over some useful charts, showing the state of the labour market: Stephen Clarke, Senior Economic Analyst at the Resolution Foundation, sums up the picture: “Britain started 2018 as it has spent much of the last decade, with more impressive jobs growth but little prospect of recovering from its disastrous record on pay. “Employment has hit a record high, driven by male employment breaking the 80 per cent barrier for the first time in nearly three decades. “While the return to pay growth is very welcome it remains anemic and wages are still over £700 a year lower than they were a decade ago. The stark fall in productivity in recent months suggests that a strong pay recovery remain some way off.” Britain’s finance minister has welcomed the news that wages are outpacing inflation. Chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond said: “Growth in real wages means that people are starting to feel the benefit of more money in their pockets; another turning point as we build a stronger, fairer economy. “We can be proud of our record on jobs. The unemployment rate is at its lowest in over 40 years and with our National Living Wage we are making sure that the lowest-paid feel the benefit with an extra £2,000 a year. “Now the focus has to be on ensuring that wages keep rising faster than inflation, so that living standards increase.” I suspect that final sentence could be a coded warning about Brexit. Hammond will attend a crunch meeting of the government’s Brexit sub committee this afternoon to discuss customs arrangements, where there’s no sign of agreement. Theresa May’s ministers are split over two options -- a customs partnership, where the UK would collect tariffs on behalf of the EU, or a “max fac” model, which would use technology to police the border. My colleague Andy Sparrow will be tracking all the action in his Politics Live blog: Panmure Gordon analyst Simon French suspects Britain’s labour market may be peaking - chiming with the IoD’s warning earlier. Nearly two years after the Brexit vote, we can now see that the number of citizens from other European Union countries working in Britain has fallen. The ONS reports that the total EU workforce in Britain fell by 28,000 over the last year. That’s the first annual decrease since January to March 2010, when the UK has fallen into recession after the financial crisis. Here’s the details from today’s labour market report: There were 28.73 million UK nationals working in the UK, 417,000 more than for a year earlier. There were 2.29 million EU nationals working in the UK, 28,000 fewer than for a year earlier. There were 1.25 million non-EU nationals working in the UK, 20,000 more than for a year earlier. The employment rate (the proportion of people aged from 16 to 64 years who were in work) was 81.9% for EU nationals, higher than that for UK nationals (75.6%) and higher than that for non-EU nationals (63.0%) There was a sharp fall in the number of workers from Eastern European countries who joined the EU in 2004. The Press Association’s Ian Jones has the details: The proportion of UK men in work has hit 80% for the first time since 1991 - despite fears that robots will eliminate millions of jobs: The Institute of Directors fears that companies are now struggling to find properly skilled and qualified workers. Seamus Nevin, the IoD’s head of policy research says: “Yet again we’ve seen great employment figures as the number of people in work increased and the number of people without work decreased. All of this suggests, however, that access to staff may be peaking as the labour market tightens. “Employers are finding it increasingly difficult to recruit the people they need. Given access to skills is currently one of the highest concerns for IoD members, today’s figures also highlight the imperative for government to reform the Tier 2 visa cap to allow employers to recruit the overseas workers they need to grow in the short term.” Disappointingly, UK productivity is falling again. Productivity (broadly, how much we each produced) shrank by 0.5% in the first three months of 2018, the ONS says. That’s because Britain’s growth rate slowed in the last quarter (to a measly 0.1%), even though companies created more jobs - meaning the amount of hours worked in the economy rose by 0.6%. Ergo, we were less productive: John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, says the UK economy is a mixed picture -- job creation remains strong, but productivity is a mess. “The great British job-creating machine kicked back into life in the first quarter of 2018, taking the employment rate to a new record high. Unemployment edged down further and regular pay growth continued to edge up as the labour market has tightened. Real pay growth, excluding bonuses, is now firmly back into positive territory. “All of this good news stands in marked contrast to the subdued GDP growth of just 0.1% estimated for the first quarter. This estimate could be revised up later but, taken at face value, it suggests that productivity growth turned significantly negative again after a couple of quarters when it seemed to be perking up. Geraint Johnes, professor of economics at Lancaster University Management School, is disappointed that total pay growth (including bonuses) slowed to 2.6% from 2.8% a month ago. Professor Johnes, who is also research director at the Work Foundation, says this shows some weakness in the labour market: This is a disappointing result, in that it represents a fall from the 2.8% figure achieved in February, and it means that we have to wait still longer for real wages to recover. The single month measure shows a year-on-year growth of just 2.3%. This continued flatness in wages provides justification for the Bank of England’s decision not to raise interest rates – despite the buoyancy of the employment figures, the recovery in the labour market is quite simply not there, and rising wages clearly present no threat in terms of inflation.” This chart, from Fidelity International, shows how Britain is emerging from its second pay squeeze in a decade: Tom Stevenson, investment director for personal investing at Fidelity, say: “British workers are feeling marginally better off after wages grew in real terms for the second month on a trot.” Economists are welcoming the news that basic pay in Britain is accelerating. It could even spur the Bank of England into raising interest rates by August - although, after policymakers left rates on hold last week, who knows for sure? The percentage of people in Britain classed as ‘economically inactive’ has fallen to just 21%, its lowest level since records began 45 years ago. That means that more people are either in work, or looking for a job. The ONS says: There were 8.66 million people aged from 16 to 64 years who were economically inactive (not working and not seeking or available to work), 115,000 fewer than for October to December 2017 and 171,000 fewer than for a year earlier. Today’s jobs report also shows that Britain’s cost of living squeeze is easing. Basic pay (excluding bonuses) rose by 2.9% in the first quarter of 2018, up from 2.8% a month ago. That means that wages are rising faster than inflation (which fell to 2.5% in March). So real basic pay (adjusted for inflation) is now growing at around 0.4%, after shrinking over recent months. However, total pay (including bonuses) only grew by 2.6% during the quarter (again, down from 2.8%). But before anyone celebrates, lets not forget that Britons are basically poorer than before the financial crisis. The Office for National Statistics says: average regular pay (excluding bonuses) for employees in Great Britain was £460 per week before tax and other deductions from pay, £13 lower than the pre-downturn peak of £473 per week recorded for March 2008 average total pay (including bonuses) for employees in Great Britain was £489 per week before tax and other deductions from pay, £33 lower than the pre-downturn peak of £522 per week recorded for February 2008 Newsflash: Britain’s jobless rate remained at 4.2% in the first three months of 2018. The latest Labour Force statistics, just released, show that unemployment is at its joint lowest level since 1975. The report also shows that the employment rate is at a record high (the data goes back to Ted Heath’s reign as prime minister): The Office for National Statistics says: There were 32.34 million people in work, 197,000 more than for October to December 2017 and 396,000 more than for a year earlier. The employment rate (the proportion of people aged from 16 to 64 years who were in work) was 75.6%, higher than for a year earlier (74.8%) and the highest since comparable records began in 1971. There were 1.42 million unemployed people (people not in work but seeking and available to work), 46,000 fewer than for October to December 2017 and 116,000 fewer than for a year earlier. More to follow! Bulgaria and Poland have both posted solid growth figures: The German Federal Ministry for Economics Affairs says the country’s economy remains strong, despite growth slowing in recent months. In a statement, it says: “Private consumption remains strong. Companies are upbeat on their trade prospects in the light of overall favourable conditions.” The ministry also suggests that the drop in government spending may be due to the five-month hiatus of negotiations to form Angela Merkel’s new coalition. Just: The Netherlands economy has slowed, but not as sharply as Germany. Dutch GDP rose by 0.5% in the first three months of this year, down from 0.7% in October-December 2017. Finland has outperformed Germany, by posting 1.1% growth in the last quarter. This suggests the eurozone’s most northerly neighbour is shaking off its recent stagnation, despite the slowdown in other countries. Shares in some of Germany’s biggest companies have dipped in early trading. The DAX index has dropped by 0.3%, or 38 points, to 12,939 in Frankfurt, following this morning’s disappointing growth figures. Pharmaceutical giant Merck is the biggest faller (-2.8%), followed by industrial conglomerate Thyssenkrupp (-2.4%, despite reporting higher profits this morning). At just 0.3%, this is Germany’s weakest quarterly growth since the third quarter of 2016. ING economist Carsten Brzeski says Germany had a ‘stumbling start’ into 2018, for a variety of reasons: Trade and government consumption were a drag on growth. Also, don’t forget that a couple of one-off factors like the cold winter weather, early Easter vacation and strikes probably distorted first quarter data. Brzeski says we shouldn’t panic - he thinks that Germany’s economy still has underlying strength, including its manufacturing base: Despite some minor leveling off, capacity utilisation is still close to record highs, assured production in the industry is close to all-time highs and the high stock of orders and historically low inventories all bode extremely well for industrial production in the coming months. So this growth slowdown is “no more than a black eye”, Brzeski concludes. The news that Germany’s growth rate halved in the last quarter is causing a stir. Economist Ulrik Bie blames the drop in exports by German firms: Tom Barfield of the AFP newswire says it will raise fears about the health of the European economy: Pantheon Macroeconomics’ Claus Vistesen believes the eurozone will tick along at a more steady rate this year: Oliver Rakau of Oxford Economics warns that Germany has lost momentum, and may struggle to bounce back in the coming months. Newsflash: Germany has suffered a growth slowdown after being hit by weak trade. The eurozone’s largest economy expanded by just 0.3% in the first three months of this year, official figures show. That’s a sharp slowdown compared to Germany’s 0.6% in the final quarter of 2017. It is also below the 0.4% which economists had expected. The Federal Statistics Office says: The German economy continued to grow at the beginning of the year, though at a slower pace. The slowdown was triggered by “less dynamic” foreign trade, as “both exports and imports decreased compared with the previous quarter”. Government spending also fell, for the firs time in five years, dragging growth back. But capital investment did rise during the quarter, suggesting companies are still investing in equipment and factories. Domestic consumption also made a positive contribution. Although Germany is obviously still growing, these figures do indicate that the eurozone economy has lost some steam in recent months. They also suggests that fears of a trade war, triggered by Donald Trump’s tariffs on steel and aluminium, are causing worrying ripples in the global economy. Reaction to follow.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Today we get a new healthcheck on Europe’s economy, with a fresh estimate of eurozone GDP for the first three months of this year, plus growth figures from Germany and the Netherlands. Last month’s ‘flash’ data showed the eurozone economy grew by 0.4% - investors will be concerned if this is revised downwards today. Britain’s labour market is also in focus. The latest unemployment figures are expected to show the jobless rate remains at just 4.2%, its lowest level in over 40 years. But will there be any progress on wages? Economists predict that basic pay growth rose to 2.9% in the first three months of this year - up from 2.8%. A strong reading might give the pound a lift, and reignite speculation that interest rates might rise in August. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says: Given that inflation in March was 2.5%, wages growth of 2.9% or higher would be an encouraging sign that domestic inflation will slowly start to pick up, potentially reviving the possibility of a Bank of England rate rise later in the year and pushing sterling back towards $1.37. Traders will also be tracking events in Italy, where talks to form a new government are still continuing.

Umesh Pandey, who has held the position since July 2016, said the board of directors had asked him to “tone down” the newspaper’s reporting and editorials on the actions of the military government, particularly over their suppression of freedom of speech and the delays over long-promised elections. “When asked to tone down I did not budge and was blunt in letting those who make decisions know that I would rather lose my position than bow my head,” said Pandey in a written statement on Monday night. “The axe finally came down on me just 60 days before my two year contract ended.” The Bangkok Post board is made up of some of the most powerful figures in Thai business and education, many with close ties to the government; one member, Wuttisak Lapcharoensap, was floated as education minister last year. Neither Pandey nor members of the Bangkok Post board responded to requests for comment. Press freedom in Thailand has been notoriously restricted since the military junta took over in a bloodless coup in 2014, with numerous journalists arrested under laws which ban views the government considers to be “inconsistent with the truth” or under the strict lese majeste laws, which prevent any criticism of the King. Soldiers have been known to turn up at newspaper offices to ask about certain stories and in the 2016 Freedom House report, media in Thailand was certified as “not free”. However, in the past 18 months Pandey was seen to have pushed the boundaries of the paper’s coverage, and in his departure statement, Pandey spoke of his pride at the “hard-hitting news” that he and his team had produced. An editorial from 14 May, in which the paper criticised the banning of all broadcasts by pro-democracy Peace TV, was said to have been a particular source of contention. The paper slammed the ban as a “blatant and poorly thought out act of censorship” and added: “The charge used to once again shut down the only popular outlet of a major political force is ludicrous.” Pandey had also recently wrote a damning op-ed on the military government, who rule as the National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO), led by prime minister General Prayuth. “The momentum has already started to build against this government and any smart politician or military strategist would know it is futile to go against the trend,” wrote Pandey. “It is therefore advisable Gen Prayut and his band of democracy-robbers wake up before the situation deteriorates to a point of no return.” It follows a recent incident where the editor of ChiangMai City Life magazine was almost jailed, and the publication accused of blasphemy, after they posted an image on the publication’s Facebook page, which showed three Thai kings wearing gas masks, in an attempt city to highlight to city’s problems with pollution. The governor of Chiang Mai accused editor Pim Kemasingki of violating the Computer Crime Act, and she was only cleared after taking the image down and publicly apologising. Ed Legaspi, of the Southeast Asian Press Alliance, said it was “very sad that toning down content is still very much a concern of the media in Thailand, so as not to draw the attention and pressure from the junta. “What happened in Bangkok Post reveals the degree of self-censorship that media outlets have to do in order to survive in this repressive atmosphere.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/may/15/nannup-mystery-cult-suicide-possible-but-not-proved-coroner-rules","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-15T05:23:20Z","webTitle":"Nannup mystery: cult suicide possible but not proved, coroner rules","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/may/15/nannup-mystery-cult-suicide-possible-but-not-proved-coroner-rules","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/may/15/nannup-mystery-cult-suicide-possible-but-not-proved-coroner-rules","fields":{"headline":"Nannup mystery: cult suicide possible but not proved, coroner rules","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Four people who disappeared from a tiny Western Australian town in 2007 in connection with a new-age spiritual cult may be dead, a coronial inquest has found, but there is not enough evidence to prove their deaths beyond a reasonable doubt. The group, led by the British spiritualist Gary Felton, disappeared from a property near Nannup in WA’s south-west around July 2007, telling friends and neighbours they were moving to Brazil. None of them has been seen since 16 July 2007. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon There is evidence to suggest they formed a suicide pact but not enough to rule out the possibility that they are still living, somewhere, possibly under assumed names. Felton, then 45, was born in the UK and had been going under the name Simon Anthony Kadwill since stealing the original Kadwill’s birth certificate in 1986. He had a UK passport under that name and travelled extensively in the 1990s as part of a “spiritual awakening”. He wrote a number of books, which the coroner, Barry King, said he had “briefly skimmed” for the purpose of the three-day inquest in December 2017, describing some of the assertions they made as “bizarre”. The books spoke of a selfless few ascending through death from the three-dimensional physical plain to a five-dimensional “vibrating plane” called the Aquarian age. In 1997 Chantelle Jane McDougall attended a seminar held by Felton in Melbourne and became a follower. In 2001 they had a daughter, Leela, and in 2003 they moved to the rental property in Nannup. Another man, Antonio Konstanin Popic, bought a caravan and moved on to the property in 2006. Both Popic and McDougall were subservient to Felton, who spent most of his time communicating with his followers on online forums. In May 2007 Felton told one of those followers that the group had a “plan for a family suicide with a quick-acting drug”. He later told the same follower that he was planning to kill himself and he did not want MacDougall to know. Felton was not seen, in person or online, after 24 June. As July approached, MacDougall and Popic sold their cars, began withdrawing money, sold their dogs, rehomed their chickens and said goodbye to their families. They had been stockpiling drugs that could have been used as a fatal cocktail. MacDougall was last seen on 15 July. Popic is believed to have travelled to Perth that day and on to Northcliffe or Kalgoorlie. On 16 July Popic’s brother received a package from him containing power of attorney forms, bank statements, superannuation policy details and a note apologising for being a “crap brother”. About the same time, the landlords of the Nannup property arrived to find it vacated but in pristine condition, with a note saying the group had left suddenly owing to a lack of sleep created by the electromagnetic field given off by a new transformer, which Felton in particular had objected to. The note instructed them to sell off any remaining furniture if they wished. Another note, in Popic’s caravan, told the landlords they could keep the caravan. In lengthy findings released on Tuesday, King said there was evidence pointing toward the group’s collective suicide but other evidence — particularly a lack of a formal declaration of suicide by Felton, whose death would have been a “powerful message” to his followers, indicated he may still be alive. “I have not been able to find that the death of any of the members of the group has been established beyond a reasonable doubt,” he said. “To be clear, this does not mean that I have found that any member of the group is alive.” • Crisis support services can be reached 24 hours a day: Lifeline 13 11 14; Suicide Call Back Service 1300 659 467; Kids Helpline 1800 55 1800; MensLine Australia1300 78 99 78"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/may/16/labor-right-pushes-for-conference-majority-as-shorten-faces-test-of-leadership","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-15T18:00:26Z","webTitle":"Labor right pushes for conference majority as Shorten faces test of leadership","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/may/16/labor-right-pushes-for-conference-majority-as-shorten-faces-test-of-leadership","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/may/16/labor-right-pushes-for-conference-majority-as-shorten-faces-test-of-leadership","fields":{"headline":"Labor right pushes for conference majority as Shorten faces test of leadership","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The right faction of the ALP believes it is on track to command a majority at the looming national conference, a development that would make life easier for the federal party leader, Bill Shorten, as he faces the challenges of a mini-election season over the coming weeks. Spurred by the left faction almost securing control of the last ALP national conference in 2015 for the first time since the mid-1980s – a development that made the last conference hair-raising for Shorten to manage – the right factions in New South Wales and Victoria have launched a major organisational effort spearheaded by the NSW party secretary, Kaila Murnain, and the assistant national secretary, Sebastian Zwalf. Several well-placed sources report the right is currently on track to secure a majority in its own right at the July conference after increasing its representation in both NSW and Victoria, or at least command an effective working majority by calling on support in contentious votes from a substantial delegation from the Construction, Forestry, Maritime, Mining and Energy Union. But some other insiders insist that it is too soon to be definitive about which faction can ultimately command the floor with results still outstanding from Queensland, where the left is now dominant, and the right faction split. As the right is moving behind the scenes to gain the conference ascendancy, there are already complaints in Victoria about the national conference delegate election ballot in the state. The secretary of Victorian Labor independents, Eric Dearricott, has circulated a critical missive seen by Guardian Australia that says delays in people receiving their ballots caused “significant problems”. Dearricott says members who did not receive ballot papers were able to request that they be sent new ballots, and towards the end of the voting period were allowed to authorise a person to collect their reissued ballot on their behalf from state office. He says more than 1,000 party members requested re-issued ballot papers, with one-third of the re-issue requests coming from members in 11 branches, with two of the branches requesting more than 60 replacement ballots. “The process for re-issuing ballots clearly needs to be reviewed,” Dearricott says. As well as tensions behind the scenes about conference delegate selections, Guardian Australia understands there are now a number of rule changes currently in circulation. The right is pushing for a prohibition on serving frontbenchers nominating themselves to run to be the ALP president. A decision by the shadow climate change minister and prominent left faction powerbroker Mark Butler to seek a second term as Labor president has caused a stink with the right. Butler, who is facing off against the former Rudd and Gillard government treasurer and Queensland rightwinger Wayne Swan, is running on a platform of party democratisation. The right traditionally opposes democratisation proposals in the belief increasing grassroots participation boosts the power of the left in party forums. The proposed rule change currently in circulation is payback for Butler’s perceived provocations in the presidential contest. Other contentious proposals being worked up behind the scenes include a refashioning of the relationship between the Chifley Research Centre, a Labor thinktank, and the party. There has been a running stoush behind the scenes for a number of years about the relationship between the Chifley operation and the party, with some party figures objecting to the left-domination of the thinktank’s board. Some party sources also point to a poor relationship between the chair of the thinktank, the trade unionist Linda White, and Shorten. Also in circulation is a proposal to create a position of party treasurer, elevating the status of the chair of the finance committee, and a proposal to appoint a returning officer by a two-thirds majority of the national executive. The left also intends to circulate changes to the party rules but the proposal have not yet reached the drafting stage. There are also concerns in the left that the right will revive a contentious proposal designed to limit the size of the Tasmanian delegation to the national conference. The Tasmanian delegation is dominated by leftwingers."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/may/15/commonwealth-games-athletes-to-seek-asylum-after-going-missing","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-15T06:47:34Z","webTitle":"Commonwealth Games athletes to seek asylum after going missing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/may/15/commonwealth-games-athletes-to-seek-asylum-after-going-missing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/may/15/commonwealth-games-athletes-to-seek-asylum-after-going-missing","fields":{"headline":"Commonwealth Games athletes to seek asylum after going missing","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Athletes who absconded from the Gold Coast Commonwealth Games are expected to seek asylum when their visas expire on Tuesday night. A Sydney-based refugee group has already provided assistance to a “significant number” of the athletes, among whom are eight from Cameroon, two from Uganda and one from Rwanda. The 11 athletes disappeared from the Gold Coast at various times over the course of the Games. All the Cameroon athletes, except for boxer Christian Ndzie Tsoye, had competed. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon Sarah Dale, principal solicitor with the refugee group, Refugee Advice and Casework Service (Racs), declined to provide details, but said a common experience for people seeking asylum in-country in Australia was to first make contact with their Australian-based community. Dale said it was “always advisable” to seek asylum before a person’s visa – of any type – expired, rendering them an “unlawful non-citizen” subject to detention. Policy would dictate that a bridging visa should be issued while a protection claim was assessed, she said. “There is no information to suggest they waited until the last minute,” she said. “The reality is that assistance is unfunded ... Often the delay is an inability to get legal advice.” Racs assisted hundreds of asylum seekers with their applications for protection each year, and there was a waiting list, she said. “The men, women and families who are recognised as needing protection in Australia are allowed to remain only after a complex and difficult process,” Dale said. “For many, this process would not be fair or efficient without Racs’ vital legal assistance. We endeavour to assist anyone who contacts us who would not otherwise have access to legal advice ... With none of this work funded by government in 2018, we rely on our volunteers, partners and supporters to make sure people who seek asylum have an opportunity to live a life in safety.” The chairman of Sydney’s Northern Beaches Refugee Sanctuary, David Addington, said some of the athletes had already been interviewed by immigration officials. “I know that some of them have already been given bridging visas ... so you don’t get detained,” he said. Addington’s organisation assisted some of the Sierra Leone athletes who successfully sought asylum after absconding from the 2006 Melbourne Commonwealth Games. He said he wasn’t personally involved with these athletes’ cases but had spoken to advocates who were. The Sierra Leone athletes were among 40 who absconded from the Melbourne Games. Two weightlifters from Cameroon, Francois Etoundi and Simplice Ribouem, were both granted refugee status and competed for Australia in 2018. Earlier on Tuesday the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, urged the athletes to present themselves to authorities, and warned they could be deported for breaching visa conditions if they did not “self-declare”. “If people have claims to make, or they have submissions to put to the department, then we’ll consider all of that in due course,” Dutton said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/may/15/damning-report-finds-ndis-complaints-ignored-for-months","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-15T08:42:15Z","webTitle":"Damning report finds NDIS complaints ignored for months","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/may/15/damning-report-finds-ndis-complaints-ignored-for-months","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/may/15/damning-report-finds-ndis-complaints-ignored-for-months","fields":{"headline":"Damning report finds NDIS complaints ignored for months","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"People with a disability are waiting months for simple callbacks when they complain of errors or inadequacies with their national disability insurance scheme support plan, the ombudsman has found. The commonwealth ombudsman on Tuesday released the findings of its investigation into hundreds of complaints about the National Disability Insurance Agency’s ability to handle requests for reviews of support plans. Reviews are typically requested when a plan or a decision is thought to be inadequate or contain an error – for example, if a person has been denied funding for wheelchair car modifications. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The ombudsman found a significant backlog in dealing with review requests. The NDIA was, as of February, dealing with about 8,100 reviews and receiving about 620 new review requests per week. Some reviews are taking nine months to complete. The ombudsman linked the problem to a lack of resourcing, competing priorities and pressure on the NDIA to meet its rollout targets. The finding is likely to be seized on by Labor, which has long complained that the staffing cap imposed on the NDIA is hobbling the rollout of the landmark scheme. The ombudsman has warned that failing to address the significant problems would mean reviews would continue to be “unwieldy, unapproachable and the driver of substantial complaint volumes” for participants. The ombudsman said it had received 400 complaints at least partly about the NDIA’s ability to handle reviews, which made up 32.5% of all NDIS-related complaints. Delay and a lack of communication were constant sources of frustration. In one case study cited in the report, a woman who complained of errors in her plan in December 2016 was promised a callback by the NDIA. She heard nothing until February 2017. The ombudsman acknowledged the NDIA was working to address the delays but found: “Without significant efforts to improve the timeliness of NDIA’s administration of reviews and communication with participants, there remains a risk that participants’ right to review will be undermined and review processes will continue to lack fairness and transparency and continue to drive a high volume of complaints.” The report said the NDIA was wrongly treating requests for an internal review as requests for an unscheduled review, a different process altogether. This delayed them from being able to take their complaint to the administrative appeals tribunal, the report said. Damian Palmer, an academic with Charles Sturt University, has experienced significant difficulties with the scheme since his daughter became a participant in 2016. He told Guardian Australia his request for a review for his daughter’s plan was inappropriately handled by the NDIA and considered as an unscheduled review. “One outcome of this is they took away $20,000 funding for an assistance dog that had been allocated in the plan that was being reviewed, and we were basically left with no way of protesting this,” he said. “I lodged a complaint with the NDIA some time in the second half of 2017 about the fact that the NDIA didn’t follow their own operational guidelines and clarify with me what kind of review we wanted. There has been no follow-up to that complaint.” The report also found systemic problems in communicating with participants during the review process. The NDIA said it “accepts the merit” of each of the ombudsman’s 20 recommendations and had already begun work on improving its handling of reviews. It has also established a dedicated team to work through the backlog. “The NDIA acknowledges issues raised in the issues paper and appreciated your recognition of the unique operating environment during the period of transition to full scheme,” the agency said. “The NDIA is committed to improving its administration of reviews and acknowledges the review mechanisms … are an important feature of our legislation that provide participants with the right to seek a review of a decision made by the NDIA.” A spokesman later told the Guardian the NDIA had undertaken a “significant program” to improve the NDIS rollout through two major projects in the past 12 months: the independent pricing review, and the participant and provider pathways review. “The NDIS is a world-first reform, the size and scale of which means the scheme will not be without challenges,” the spokesman said. “The NDIA is committed to working to address concerns and delivering a significantly better way of providing support for 460,000 Australians with a disability, their families and carers.” The shadow social services minister, Jenny Macklin, said the report showed people were waiting up to nine months for decisions that “impact their daily life”. “There is a backlog of more than 8,000 NDIS reviews and it is getting worse,” Macklin said. “The NDIA is getting around 620 new review requests each week – that’s nearly 100 review requests each day. Only about 200 reviews are getting cleared each week. So the problem is just growing and growing.” The social services minister, Dan Tehan, said the recommendations of the ombudsman had been accepted by the NDIA. “Significant work to improve the NDIS review process has already started, including the establishment of a dedicated team to manage outstanding reviews, the Participant and Provider Pathways Review and the Independent Pricing Review,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/may/15/in-pursuit-of-perfection-cameron-smith-a-champion-in-every-sense","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-15T05:03:34Z","webTitle":"In pursuit of perfection: Cameron Smith a champion in every sense | Nick Tedeschi","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/15/in-pursuit-of-perfection-cameron-smith-a-champion-in-every-sense","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/may/15/in-pursuit-of-perfection-cameron-smith-a-champion-in-every-sense","fields":{"headline":"In pursuit of perfection: Cameron Smith a champion in every sense","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Cameron Smith’s time representing Queensland and Australia is over. The captain of the Maroons and Kangaroos shocked the rugby league world on Tuesday by announcing his immediate retirement from all forms of representative football. He retires from the representative arena as the most successful player and captain in the history of the game. No player has produced a more stellar career resume in higher level rugby league than the incomparable Smith, universally regarded as the finest hooker to play the game and widely considered the finest captain the sport has known. For most of the greats that have graced a rugby league field, they have been defined and remembered by moments, by individual games, by runs of form: Andrew Johns’ try in the 1997 grand final; Clive Churchill’s famous performance in the 1954 decider; Wally Lewis carrying Queensland on his back in the 1980s. For Smith though, it is different. His career is defined by the whole, the accumulation of success at every level that no player in the long and storied history of the game has come even close to matching. Smith’s game and contribution isn’t about individual moments of brilliance. It is about a sustained level of excellence. It is about the pursuit of perfection, the refusal to tolerate defeat, the understanding of both the role of the individual and the needs of the team. Smith was a marathon runner who could not be beaten, running to his own time, dictating through his ability to keep on pushing. Even the greats had costly errors or runs of poor form. Not Smith. He didn’t make errors. He has never lost form. Sign up to receive the latest Australian sports stories every day From group success to individual accolades, Smith achieved more in representative football than even the most Peter Pan of dreamers could conjure. His record speaks for itself. No player has run out for more State of Origins and his 26 wins for Queensland is an Origin record. Wearing maroon, he won seven man of the match awards and captained Queensland 21 times. Four times he was awarded the Wally Lewis medal as Queensland’s best. Smith’s Queensland story though is more than numbers. His rise didn’t match the Maroons rise from the brink – his ascendancy drove the golden era of Queensland rugby league. The Maroons’ 10 series wins in the last 11 years is a sustained period of success that sits below only St George’s fabled run of 11 straight premierships in the pantheon of great teams. Smith was the one constant, the most important contributor both on and off the field. His record with Australia is near-perfect, winning 49 of 56 Tests for the Kangaroos. Those 56 appearances – 33 as skipper – rank second behind only Darren Lockyer. Smith captained Australia to two World Cup wins along with a Four Nations crown. Australia lost just three Tests under Smith’s leadership. There has been no greater winner in rugby league than Smith. And there has also been no better footballer. The game has seen better athletes, particularly in the last quarter century where the game became truly professional. There have been players capable of more wow moments. There have been prettier players, faster players, stronger players, bigger players, more famous players, more loved players, more lauded players. But there has never been a more complete player. Smith has risen above them all though with his intelligence, drive, leadership and relentless pursuit of perfection. His smarts are without peer and are shown in the subtleties of his game that is anything but flash. He shirks no issue, fends off no task. Team-mates love him. He cannot stomach failure. An era has ended with Smith’s retirement. The centrepiece of Queensland’s golden era has bid farewell. Australia’s finest captain has passed on the baton. He leaves with his legacy secure though – as rugby league’s most complete footballer with a resume that will never be matched."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/may/19/theres-no-excuse-for-wage-theft-on-the-frontline-of-worker-exploitation","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-18T23:44:25Z","webTitle":"'There's no excuse for wage theft': on the frontline of worker exploitation","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/may/19/theres-no-excuse-for-wage-theft-on-the-frontline-of-worker-exploitation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/may/19/theres-no-excuse-for-wage-theft-on-the-frontline-of-worker-exploitation","fields":{"headline":"'There's no excuse for wage theft': on the frontline of worker exploitation","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Toni Buckley says being a victim of wage theft in the hospitality industry “more times than I care to remember” prompted her to take legal action in the small claims division of Melbourne magistrate’s court against her former cafe employer. A 58-year-old widow with a mortgage, she had been working in the hospitality industry for 20 years when her most recent employer told her and her eight co-workers, with five days’ notice, that they would be unemployed. “I contacted the Fair Work Ombudsman but was told they really couldn’t do anything as they only act as mediation between the two parties,” Buckley tells Guardian Australia. “The employer refused to pay redundancy or pay in-lieu-of-notice and had not paid the compulsory superannuation contributions.” She took the cafe owners to court and a settlement was reached, but she is not allowed to speak about the business negatively as a condition of that settlement and so the cafe cannot be named. “The exploitation within the industry is rampant and something needs to be done,” Buckley says. “I encourage anybody who is in this position to persevere with their claim.” A lecturer in work and organisational studies at the University of Sydney business school, Dr Stephen Clibborn, says the Fair Work Ombudsman does not have the funding or the power to deal with the tens of thousands of hospitality workers such as Buckley whose wages and superannuation are stolen by their bosses each year. “Unfortunately the ombudsman has never been adequately resourced to fulfil that job on its own and it has been going backwards in its funding,” Clibborn says. “The revenue the ombudsman receives from government is considerably less now than five years ago. Part of addressing growing wage theft is having a strong and well-funded labour enforcement agency.” But not everyone has the time or knowledge to navigate the court system either, he said, especially migrant workers with language barriers or backpackers who might only be in the country for a few months. Laura Meek, who came to Australia as a backpacker from Scotland in 2015, tells Guardian Australia she has worked at more than a dozen hospitality businesses in Australia. Only one paid her properly. “I have been legally entitled to superannuation payments, a minimum wage, payslips, legal break allowances and penalty rates,” she says. “In three years of working full-time, mainly in Melbourne, for 16 different companies, my superannuation balance to date sits at $3,000. I have met hundreds of people along the way in these jobs who have been treated exactly the same, and we all know that this is just the norm.” A paper published in the Australian Journal of Human Rights found despite exploitation of temporary migrant workers becoming a significant human rights concern, ombudsman processes were not designed to help the hundreds of thousands of exploited migrant workers who are each owed many thousands of dollars. In 2014–2015, a migrant worker who lodged an request for assistance had a one-in-10 chance of recovering their wages, with a 40% chance they would recover less than $1,000, the paper found. “When the likelihood and quantum of a successful outcome are weighed against the time, effort, costs and risks to immigration and/or employment status, it appears rational that individual migrant workers are not seeking remedies even if they are being significantly underpaid,” the paper concluded. A co-author of the paper, law lecturer Dr Laurie Berg from the University of Technology Sydney, says the ombudsman was configured to encourage workers to self-help. While the ombudsman sometimes provides mediation, these mediations are independent and not designed to “take sides” with the employees, even if they are being exploited, Berg says. “We have been suggesting more intensive assistance needs to be provided by either the ombudsman or an external agency if more people are ever going to try and recover wages owed,” she says. “Unions are also trying to assist but sectors like food services have become so hard to organise, because there are so many small operators, it is extremely difficult for unions to organise workers in a space employing a lot of backpackers and international students, as they are transient and from foreign contexts where there is far less faith in unions, and language barriers as well.” She added that some workers hold the false belief that they are better off being paid cash-in-hand. “The backpacker tax, which came in one year ago, is also potentially a creeper issue, where backpackers who used to have the benefit of a tax-free threshold are now required to pay 15 cents per dollar earned and employers are required to register that they employ backpackers. “But it is better to be paying that tax than receiving tax-free cash-in-hand payment, especially if you’re being paid $15 per hour but you’re entitled to $22.” In a comment piece written for Fairfax in April, an anonymous “industry insider” wrote that “good” cafe owners were forced to do the wrong thing in order to survive in a competitive industry. “While cafe owners may start wide-eyed and innocent, they are soon educated on how to play the game in order to survive,” the author wrote. “It’s been like this for decades with deceptive practices passed on from generation to generation.” But Clibborn says owners who cannot afford to pay a living wage to their workers should not be in business. “There’s a role for the compliant businesses to help highlight the issue by having a big sign out the front of their cafe advertising the fact that their business complies with employment law,” he says. “They could put it next to their ‘fair trade’ coffee sign.” The owner of Finders Keepers cafe in Hawthorn, Sean Minter, says he and his wife Kirsten have taken on dozens of staff from other cafes who were exploited by their previous employers. Minter says it is financially challenging to run the business, but he has no sympathy with the view that exploiting staff is necessary to survive. He describes wage-theft as “rife”. “We chose to open a cafe, we chose to work in this industry ... there is no excuse for wage theft,” he says. “There is no excuse for lining your own pockets with the money you should be paying your staff, for putting them at risk by not providing them WorkCover insurance, for limiting their future by not paying them super, or for putting a strain on our welfare system by pushing more and more staff towards claiming Centrelink payments.” Whenever Minter hires new staff he asks them what their previous employer was paying them. Not one person in the four years his cafe has been open have said they had previously been paid the award rate, he says. “One of the guys we just hired has come to us after having his shifts blacked out on the roster after asking to be paid penalty rates,” he says. Minter was recently advised by his accountant that his business may be audited by the Australian Tax Office as his profit margins were so low compared with the industry benchmarks that tax officers may assume he is “skimming” cash off the top. “The exploitation makes for an unfair playing field. It makes customers think we are charging too much when we are simply charging what we need to ensure that our staff are paid and our kids are fed,” he says. “We live week-to-week and regularly have to dip into our savings to pay our bills. But it is not up to us as cafe owners to determine who should and shouldn’t be paid correctly. We aren’t above the law.” Do you know more? melissa.davey@theguardian.com"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/may/15/bristol-city-women-v-chelsea-ladies-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-15T21:08:29Z","webTitle":"Jonna Andersson sets seal as Chelsea wrap up double with win at Bristol City","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/15/bristol-city-women-v-chelsea-ladies-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/15/bristol-city-women-v-chelsea-ladies-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Jonna Andersson sets seal as Chelsea wrap up double with win at Bristol City","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Chelsea celebrated being crowned Women’s Super League One champions with a game to spare after racking up their fourth successive win. The jubilant scenes on the pitch at full‑time made particularly splendid viewing for Emma Hayes, with the Chelsea manager, who is 35 weeks pregnant with twins, watching the victory over Bristol City from the comfort of her own home. Between popping the champagne corks and holding aloft the trophy – their second in 11 days after victory in the FA Cup – Chelsea made sure Hayes was part of it. “Her spirit was here, we Facetimed her as soon as we could and she was in bed, very excited,” Eni Aluko, the Chelsea forward, a late substitute in the 2-0 win, said. “For Emma to have led this team to a double pregnant I think says everything about her character and who she is. It’s a great message to all women around the world, in whatever they are doing, that women can do it.” Drew Spence’s first-half header and a Jonna Andersson strike were enough to seal the title in a game from which they required only a point; simply avoiding defeat was always going to be enough on a balmy evening in Bristol. Chelsea were never really required to turn on the style and, an early Millie Farrow effort aside, they never looked like ceding the chance to seal the crown. Chelsea had stormed to a 6-0 win on the opening weekend of the season in the reverse fixture but the Vixens were determined to prove they are a totally different animal these days – they had won their past two league matches, against Everton and Yeovil Town. In the end Chelsea’s class shone through, with the retiring captain, Katie Chapman, particularly influential. For Chelsea, who also reached the Champions League semi-finals, this sealed another double to go with the one from 2015, and they in turn ousted Manchester City from the throne this time around. “It’s an amazing achievement, we’ve done it again,” Aluko said. “Two doubles in three years is amazing. I am filled with pride; this team has gone up another level this season. I’m just so proud of my team-mates, the club. This team expects silverware and we’ve delivered it.” In Hayes’s absence her assistant Paul Green led the team alongside the first-team coach, TJ O’Leary, and he revealed they were in contact with the 41-year-old throughout. “She was glued in watching at home, occasionally on the phone to give her opinion on things, through one of the coaching staff,” Green said. “She was heavily involved as normal and I’m delighted we have delivered the double for her, given all her hard work. It’s special circumstances, medical teams wouldn’t allow her to travel to our last two away games but I think she’s done brilliantly well to get to this point. The players took care of themselves really.” After the final whistle Hayes tweeted: “Get in. A pleasure to watch that from home. Champions of England, we know who we are.” The trip to Prenton Park to face Liverpool on Sunday will provide her team with a chance to toast a brilliant double-winning campaign and to finish the 18-game WSL 1 season unbeaten. Victory here ensured a fifth trophy under Hayes – and a second in quick succession after sealing the FA Cup against Arsenal at Wembley. In truth Chelsea never looked like losing, with the quality of Ramona Bachmann, the Swiss winger, and Fran Kirby, the PFA player of the year, shining through. A sloppy backpass by Millie Bright afforded Farrow, the former Chelsea striker, a great chance inside five minutes but she poked wide. That jolted Chelsea out of cruise control. Bachmann combined with Spence early on, the latter heading wide before a similar move resulted in the opening goal after 11 minutes. Ji So-yun swept a ball into the box from the right and found Spence, who glanced her header into the net, beyond Sophie Baggaley, the City goalkeeper, who will have been disappointed not to keep it out. After a slow start, that goal settled any nerves, with Chelsea finding their stride. After the break Gemma Davison, another Chelsea substitute, added further guile in search of a second, which came two minutes from time through Andersson, at the end of a low-key second half. Maren Mjelde, the Chelsea defender, made a bruising but fair challenge on Lauren Hemp, while Hedwig Lindahl was forced into a smart stop to deny Liv Fergusson, The City head coach Willie Kirk’s first roll of the dice, a leveller. “We made it difficult for them tonight and we actually had chances to take the lead,” Kirk said. “It was fine margins and we didn’t take our chances.” But when Kirby danced along the right flank, it spelled danger. She picked out the on-running Sweden defender Andersson and, with a rasping shot from distance, Chelsea had wrapped up the title."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/may/16/what-makes-a-woman-review-a-show-that-asked-extraordinarily-complex-questions","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-16T22:05:11Z","webTitle":"What Makes a Woman review – a show that asked extraordinarily complex questions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/may/16/what-makes-a-woman-review-a-show-that-asked-extraordinarily-complex-questions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/may/16/what-makes-a-woman-review-a-show-that-asked-extraordinarily-complex-questions","fields":{"headline":"What Makes a Woman review – a show that asked extraordinarily complex questions","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A nurse wipes a patient’s tears from her face, the general anaesthetic takes effect and her face is taken off.

The nurse is at the 2pass clinic in Belgium, the patient is Munroe Bergdorf, the maker of this documentary, and her face is, for her, too much of a reminder of the sex she was assigned at birth – male – in a life in which she now identifies as female after six years of treatment. Now, even before the facial surgery, she – as the clinic might put it – “passes” and has become one of the highest-profile (if you’ll pardon the pun, and there’s no reason you should) activists for trans rights. But is she a woman? Pauline, a member of a focus group convened for the purpose of Bergdorf’s film, What Makes a Woman? (Channel 4), and maybe a generation and a half older than her, isn’t sure. “You don’t look mannish at all … When I’m talking to you, I think you’re a woman. But when I know how you started out, part of me thinks you’re a man.” Others are surer. Bergdorf sits in the audience at a meeting of radical feminists who think that “men performing men’s idea of what it is to be a woman” does not make a woman, and that “self-identity [professing yourself to be female despite your male biological birth sex and especially before any kind of transition treatment and/or gender reassignment surgery] reduces what it is to be a woman to a feeling in a man’s head”. Parsing the differences between these three stances – Bergdorf’s, Pauline’s and the feminists’ – and asking how we approach an increase in understanding between them all could have helpfully taken up more of the film. The political and philosophical questions raised by the idea of feeling like a man or woman trapped in a wrongly sexed body are quite possibly infinite. But the few posed overtly here – primarily by Venice Allan (known as Dr Radfem on her YouTube channel and recently suspended from the Labour party for beliefs it deemed transphobic) – were not properly engaged with. What was most striking about the conversation between her and Bergdorf, in which Allan outlined her objections to proposed changes to legislation that would allow any cis man (that is, man born male and identifying as such) into any female space (toilets, changing rooms etc) simply by claiming that he identifies as a woman. This, she says, is the beginning of the erasure of hard-won rights and protections for women. Bergdorf argues that trans women experience much violence (from cis men, it is implied) and are not violent towards women. But this is, surely, not the fear? The fear is that it is precisely not trans women who will cause trouble, but the cis men bent on intimidating women who will use the new law as another way to do so. But instead of interrogating this – and possibly going into a wider examination of the apparent unwillingness to look beyond women (cis or trans) as the source of the problem – we moved instead to Bergdorf talking about how she was raped as she began transitioning. A terrible story, but unconsciously used here in place of a rigorous response. Another huge area for debate in the area of trans rights and politics, and more pertinent to the subject of what makes a woman, was touched on only lightly, at the beginning and end of the film, without any development in between. At a genderqueer fashion show, Bergdorf meets a model who says it’s “fine to be a tomgirl” even if you identify as female. You don’t have to perform, in other words, at the extreme end of femininity to be a woman. Bergdorf tells her it took her much longer to get there. In the closing minutes of the programme, Bergdorf remarks that: “I’ve never said that I’m a cisgender woman … I identify more with the female side in a world that gives me two options.” So, does society force you into being a woman if you don’t identify as masculine? We surely need, then, a sequel: what makes a man?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"books/2018/may/18/the-outsider-by-sephen-king","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-18T06:30:51Z","webTitle":"The Outsider by Stephen King review – an impossible alibi","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/18/the-outsider-by-sephen-king","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/may/18/the-outsider-by-sephen-king","fields":{"headline":"The Outsider by Stephen King review – an impossible alibi","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Stephen King finds himself in a unique situation: as he approaches his 60th novel, every book he releases is charting, his backlist is selling enviable amounts and a devout fanbase want more of the stories he is famous for telling. So how does he surprise his readers and draw new ones in? How does he, as the writer, surprise himself? Over the past few years, King has experimented. There was a sequel to what is arguably his most famous novel, The Shining; 2013’s Doctor Sleep eschewed the snowed-in torpor of the original in favour of a story that never took its foot off the pedal. He has written the Bill Hodges trilogy of crime novels – Mr Mercedes, Finders Keepers, End of Watch – in which he intended to shun the supernatural element (and stuck to this promise for nearly two of them). And last year’s Sleeping Beauties, written with his son Owen, was a more literary endeavour than his books usually are. From description alone, The Outsider sounds as though it could be King by numbers. When Terry Maitland – baseball youth coach, family man, all-round good guy – is accused of the horrific murder of a young boy, he is arrested and the town turns against him. (As seemingly every character says at one point: “He coached my son / grandson!”) The case is driven by Detective Ralph Anderson, a man who liked Terry and can’t believe that he would commit such an atrocity, but who also knows that all the evidence points to him being guilty. The story switches from King’s graceful head-hopping third-person narrative to a transcript of official statements from key personnel in the prosecution’s case, a formal change that nods to the statements and newspaper extracts King used throughout his debut, Carrie. A well-researched, finely tuned crime-cum-legal case novel forms a good chunk of the book, as Detective Anderson and the state prosecutor amass their evidence. They are then presented with a curveball: Terry doesn’t just have an alibi, he has been caught on video at a talk by Harlan Coben in another town at the exact time the murder took place. Unnecessary cameo aside, it’s a genuinely intriguing mystery, one that uses many of the tropes of both so-called “grip-lit” thrillers and more conventional forensics-driven crime fiction. Then, as so often in King novels, the rug is pulled out from beneath the reader’s feet: the airtight case remains airtight, but so too does the alibi, until Anderson, with the help of Holly Gibney, on loan from the Bill Hodges trilogy, starts to unpick Terry’s story. From that point on, the novel visits some very odd places – and I mean that as a compliment. The supernatural elements have more than a little in common with some of King’s most beloved creations, especially in the vague way he conveys what they actually are. He has always understood that the mystery – the question – is scarier than finding out the truth. But even then, the titular Outsider is not the strongest presence of evil in this book. There is an intriguing political undercurrent throughout: from mentions of the Black Lives Matter movement to the shadowy presence of Donald Trump, evoked by a crowd wearing Make America Great Again hats and baying for Terry’s blood. King also examines how society treats sex offenders. (As one of his constant readers, I find that the thought of Trump inhabiting the same fictional universe as Greg Stillson, The Dead Zone’s horrifying presidential candidate, is not a comforting one.) You could see The Outsider as King’s take on fake news, moving it from the political realm to something more personal. Lies being sold as truth: what form could that concept take? That’s not to say the whole novel works. It takes a couple of hundred pages for the weirdness to get started, and the sense of the uncanny pervading the entire novel means that the more horrifying elements fail to surprise when they eventually arrive. But The Outsider gives King fans exactly what they want at the same time as cramming in new ideas, proving the least surprising thing of all: that his novels are as strong as they ever were.

In this movie from French director Stéphane Brizé and starring the rumpled, grizzled screen veteran Vincent Lindon, a fictional but perfectly plausible strike assumes the personality of warfare. It’s a brutal, harrowing conflict in which only one side’s combatants have anything to lose. This is a stridently, bafflingly cacophonous movie which despite some smart, shrewd touches, is pretty much content with its single note of shouting acrimony and finishes by immolating itself in martyred self-pity. I can’t think of a more defeatist and bizarrely unhelpful ending for anyone who comes to this film interested in the prospect of workers’ rights over neoliberalism. Brizé’s previous Cannes entry with Lindon, The Measure of a Man, had similar ideas but with more subtlety and more heart. A French factory owned by a company called Perrin Industries is informed of its closure with loss of 1100 jobs. Those 1100 workers had two years previously agreed to a tough pay freeze – effectively unpaid overtime – on a promise that the management was committed to keeping the plant open, an agreement which also allowed the firm to help itself to state subsidies: tax money taken from the workers’ own tiny pay packets. The emoloyees’ efforts had contributed to a handsome company profit which had been divvied up among shareholders. Infuriatingly, the management insists on blandly seeing that as a kind of necessary expense (not a hard-won surplus which has anything to do with the impertinent workers), and to announce that the firm is not “viable”. Then they announce a sellout to a German company, who clearly made this purchase on condition of a lower wage bill. Each Perrin worker is offered €25,000 redundancy, or zero if they continue to strike. They strike. The union man leading the fightback is Laurent Amédéo, played by Lindon, a passionate speaker and rabble-rouser who is just the guy to lead the troops into a shouty confrontational strike which at first has the blandly mendacious bosses worried. With gleeful scorn, Amédéo rips into the besuited mandarins’ smugly dishonest claim that they are all in it together and their crocodile tears about the situation. He is ironically unimpressed when a German executive airily assures the union of his love for France, and how he loves spending time at his second home in Camargue. At this stage, the title assumes a second, and highly unfortunate resonance. But having whipped up the anger, Amédéo loses control of it. There is a violent incident against the German CEO. Public and union opinion turns against the now tragic and embattled Amédéo. At this point, anyone watching the film will be entitled to wonder how this fictional strike is going to end. And given its realist mien, with its toughly convincing TV news-style footage, what lesson is to be learned for people in real life who want to defend their jobs? What can a union leader finally do to shame the bosses into submission – or at least some concession? The ending here is just ridiculous, self-important miserablism: a failure of imagination on the part of Brizé and his co-screenwriter Olivier Gorce. As for Lindon, his performance delivers the required sweaty machismo and he is a resoundingly forthright tribune of the people. But this film rarely if ever lets Lindon shows his humour, his gentleness, his charm. It’s all about actors doing improv shouting in each other’s faces. This is film-making by megaphone."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/2018/may/15/kyle-edmund-rome-british-number-one-clay-beat-novak-djokovic","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-15T21:30:30Z","webTitle":"Kyle Edmund ready to calmly climb even higher after Novak Djokovic win","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/15/kyle-edmund-rome-british-number-one-clay-beat-novak-djokovic","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/may/15/kyle-edmund-rome-british-number-one-clay-beat-novak-djokovic","fields":{"headline":"Kyle Edmund ready to calmly climb even higher after Novak Djokovic win","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Kyle Edmund, the absurdly quiet man of tennis, might be ready to make some noise but solely with the “thwap” of his racket strings as he unleashes another withering forehand here this week and perhaps at the French Open starting on Sunday week. Even beating Novak Djokovic in Madrid a week ago to move into the top 20 for the first time failed to disturb his submarine‑level temperament. Unlike some others the young Yorkshireman has not had to learn quietude. Born in Johannesburg, nurtured in the East Ridings and residing comfortably in the Bahamas, he oozes calm. Efforts to get Edmund to find his inner Andy Murray have failed miserably. “It’s another win,” Edmund says of defeating Djokovic, without a trace of arrogance. “That’s my job: to win tennis matches. So, it’s not like I go crazy about it. But I respect the win in terms of who Novak is. He’s a legend in the game and in history.” Edmund has an acute appreciation of where he has come from and where he might be heading. He played his first clay match in Goole as a 12-year-old and has steadily fallen in love with a surface that, for many players outside Spain and France, appears on their radar with the menace of quicksand. If there is to be a surprise winner – or even finalist – in Roland Garros, it could be Edmund. While he knows he is British No 1 because of the absence of the recuperating Murray, Edmund is also aware that he is worth his place among the young contenders who are gathering to nudge aside the game’s long-time masters. “To be able to be on court, first of all, is sometimes a bit surreal when you are growing up,” he says. “But, as I’ve been on the Tour a lot more, you have to try and beat these guys – because that’s your job. It’s nice to be able to go on court with Novak and know you are able to beat him. It gives you confidence, for sure.” He will take plenty of that into the second round here on Wednesday, when he plays Lucas Pouille, who beat Andreas Seppi in three sets. If Edmund wins, he will almost certainly meet the defending champion, Alexander Zverev, on Thursday – and there could hardly be a greater contrast in temperaments. The German with the Russian genes is loud, explosive and dangerous. Zverev, who dismantled Djokovic in the final last year, opens his account on Wednesday against the Italian wildcard Matteo Berrettini, who shocked the rising American Frances Tiafoe. Edmund, meanwhile, is reluctant to tamper with his game – an uncomplicated expression of flat power on both wings, behind a big if temperamental serve – and says: “In terms of what you do, that doesn’t really change. You have the same thought process and work on the same stuff. It’s not like you suddenly change as a person, either.” He has won $1m this year and 16 of his 24 matches but should have lifted his first Tour title when he reached the final in Marrakech last month. But he could not get past the world No 355, Pablo Andujar, and was deeply disappointed. But unlike in the past there was no spirit-dip: three days after winning a doubles title with Cameron Norrie in Estoril Edmund beat Djokovic – then the world No 10, David Goffin. Here he dropped a set against the 34-year-old Tunisian Malek Jaziri but impressed with a strong finish. To guard against the possibility of future upsets against outsiders Edmund has brought in a former international sprinter, Darren Chin, to supplement the training regime of Ian Prangley. Chin worked with Usain Bolt in Jamaica for two years and will fill in when Prangley cannot tour. He has noticed areas where the player can improve his movement, identifying, “acceleration and body positioning”. Chin adds: “The way you lift your feet, being light on your feet, Kyle tends to hit the ground quite heavy. Over time we will try to get it lighter, and the stretching as well.” As for Edmund’s brief problems with his hip, when pain there stopped his progress in the semi-finals at the Australian Open, Chin says: “We definitely keep on top of his hips. That’s the thing with tennis: because you are playing pretty much every day, it is hard to get the quality training in.” None of which will faze Edmund. Although he recognises that the wider media pack is circling with each big win, he never forgets that tennis is his job. “I know that’s going to happen so, when it comes, it’s not I guess a massive surprise,” he says. “That’s just going to happen, I’ll just get on and do it, have my time training and preparing and trying to get myself in a good place and meet the requirements off the court. I guess that’s part of being a professional.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/may/16/julian-assange-treatment-irresponsible-ecuador-foreign-minister-guillaume-long","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-16T15:01:03Z","webTitle":"Treatment of Assange is unjust, says former Ecuador minister","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/16/julian-assange-treatment-irresponsible-ecuador-foreign-minister-guillaume-long","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/16/julian-assange-treatment-irresponsible-ecuador-foreign-minister-guillaume-long","fields":{"headline":"Treatment of Assange is unjust, says former Ecuador minister","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The Ecuadorian government’s action against Julian Assange in cutting his communication with the outside world is disproportionate and irresponsible, according to the former Ecuadorian foreign minister Guillaume Long. In an interview with the Guardian, he said the measures being taken against the WikiLeaks founder were not justified. On Tuesday, the Guardian revealed that the previous government in Ecuador had bankrolled a multimillion-dollar spy operation to protect and support Assange in its central London embassy. The current Ecuadorian government is denying Assange access to the internet and has installed a jamming device to prevent him from using nearby wifi. It has also put an end to the stream of visitors to the embassy, where he has been holed up since 2012, with only his legal team now allowed in. Assange’s supporters fear the ban imposed on 28 March will be indefinite and increase pressure on him to leave the embassy. Long said his government had also put in place similar restrictions on Assange in 2016 in response to WikiLeaks’ publication of Hillary Clinton’s emails and those of the Democratic party during the US presidential election campaign. But he said the current ban was based on a less substantial issue. “I do not think the measure is proportionate. I think Ecuador probably thought this has been done before, let’s do it again. And I do not think it has been done in a responsible manner,” he said. Long, who supports Assange’s right to asylum, was foreign minister from March 2016 until May 2017. The ban in 2016 was short, lasting only for the duration of the final stage of the White House race from 18 October until election day on 8 November. “We are seeing now access in general to Julian is being restricted. I understand it is open-ended. There is no set date for a reconnection,” Long said. Assange fled to the Ecuadorian embassy in 2012, seeking asylum amid a Swedish investigation into allegations by two women of sex crimes, which he denies. He said at the time that he did not fear the Swedish investigation, but if he were to return to Sweden, he would be extradited to the US. Long did not know about Ecuador’s surveillance operation on Assange but said he had visited the embassy many times and was conscious of being watched. Ecuadorian surveillance was imposed, Long said, before he became foreign minister and was not primarily about Assange, but the security of the embassy and its staff. Given the interest in Assange, it was a difficult working environment inside the embassy, he said, with concerns about the security of communications. If – or when – Assange leaves the embassy, he is likely to face a prison sentence in the UK for skipping bail, with estimates of the sentence varying from three to 12 months. Assange’s biggest fear is being extradited to the US, where he could be jailed for more than 40 years over WikiLeaks’ release in 2010 of tens of thousands of classified US military and state department documents. The Guardian understands the US has yet to formally request Assange’s extradition, though it is likely it would make such a request once he is in British custody. The Obama administration did not push the Assange issue, but there has been a change under Donald Trump. The US attorney general, Jeff Sessions, described Assange as a priority last year, and over the past few months, the FBI and others have been interviewing various people associated with WikiLeaks. Long said Ecuador’s president, Lenín Moreno, is not particularly favourable to Assange’s request for asylum, marking a shift towards returning to the US sphere of influence. He said the greatest pressure during his time as foreign minister came not from the US, but the UK. “The UK was the most aggressive. I had a number of meetings with UK representatives, [including with Foreign Office ministers]. The meetings were difficult. They were tense. There were strong disagreements,” Long said. “There were some sort of veiled and not so veiled threats it would affect relations not just with the UK, but the European Union, including when Ecuador wanted to sign a trade deal with the European Union. None of this was in writing but it was implied ... The UK wanted us to chuck him out of the embassy. That is pretty much what was required of us.” Assange became a naturalised Ecuadorian citizen in December, having spent more than five years in the embassy. On top of that, the Ecuadorian government offered him a position in December as a senior diplomat, complete with salary, which he accepted. But the UK Foreign Office refuses to recognise his status. The Metropolitan police deployed about half-a-dozen officers around the embassy 24 hours a day from 2012 to 2015 at a cost of £13.2m. When they were pulled out, partly as a result of embarrassment over the cost, they were replaced by covert surveillance. Assange’s supporters say the cost since would be roughly the same, making for a total that could be in the region of £26m. The police presence was stepped up again a few months ago, with marked cars positioned outside the embassy and another in a side-street, with one officer deployed on the pavement ready to grab Assange should he leave, his supporters say. At the time, having been made a diplomat, there were police concerns he might make a dash for an airport, claiming diplomatic immunity. His supporters are dismissive of the idea of flight as fantasy, given how well-known he is. The Foreign Office has retained his Australian passport, though the Ecuadorian embassy may have given him an Ecuadorian passport. A court battle is the more realistic option, one his supporters hope he would win if the UK was to baulk at the idea of sending Assange to the US for what could possibly be a life sentence."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/may/28/cape-cod-massachusetts-opioid-epidemic-addiction-sobriety","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-28T10:00:51Z","webTitle":"How America's go-to holiday spot became a shoreline of addiction","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/may/28/cape-cod-massachusetts-opioid-epidemic-addiction-sobriety","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/may/28/cape-cod-massachusetts-opioid-epidemic-addiction-sobriety","fields":{"headline":"How America's go-to holiday spot became a shoreline of addiction","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Cape Cod, Massachusetts is a difficult place to stay sober. In this “summer” community, the population hovers around 750,000 from late May to early September, and can spike to 1 million on the 4th of July. Post-Labor Day, however, only 250,000 residents call Cape Cod home, and it becomes one of the country’s most addicted stretches of coastline. Amid a national opioid epidemic, Massachusetts is designated as one of the top 10 states in the US with the highest rate of opiate addiction. Like Cape Cod’s economy, addiction can be seasonal. In the summer, the temptation, for some, to get high in a vacant beach parking lot or a rest stop bathroom can be easier to resist with the influx of jobs and tourists to keep addicts busy or unnoticed. But during the long winter months, the desire to stay sober or to seek treatment wanes, particularly for women who, unlike men, have fewer recovery resources available to them. Instead, women are often forced into sobriety when serving time in prison for being convicted of drug-related crimes. Upon their release, especially during the winter, many struggle to stay clean. Melissa Peace, though, has weathered the pressures that many who struggle with addiction here face. Peace came to Cape Cod in January 2010, newly sober and on parole. She secured a bed in an unmarked house, hidden behind pine trees and sand. This house is one of the only residential treatment programs for women in the area. And Peace has not left Cape Cod since. “I’ll never forget that day. It was 10 January 2010,” says Peace. She has a tiny dog named Prince who jumps into her lap whenever she sits down. “We got to the house and had a little bit of a meltdown. I was trying to hold onto the car door because I kept thinking, I can’t leave and walk home. This is so far away. We had to come over a bridge to get here.” Peace grew up in Tiverton, Rhode Island but was born in the neighboring town of Fall River, Massachusetts, which is as riddled with drug addiction as Cape Cod. She dropped out of high school when she was a junior but only did drugs occasionally. She preferred to drink. “When I was younger I met a guy who sold a lot of drugs,” says Peace. “At first, we were doing ecstasy and just doing coke and prescription pills to come down but then it changed to that we would do coke and pills all the time.” This transition would evolve into almost 12 years of addiction, during which Peace gave birth to two children. “My mom ended up adopting [them],” says Peace. “She had custody of them but it got to a point where no one could get hold of me so it was just like I signed my rights over. I think that was more of a reason why I didn’t bother getting clean because I knew they were safe and I didn’t even know how to approach it or how to stay clean once I got clean in prison.” Prior to coming to Cape Cod, Peace had only been placed in a recovery program one other time, and it was to serve her parole. She says she left after two days when she saw a pregnant woman shoot heroin. A few years after that experience, Peace was out of options and sought a treatment program to serve her parole for what she describes as “every subsequent charge related to cocaine”. She had never been to Cape Cod but the decision to venture over the bridge would change the course of her life. “I had no plans to stay on Cape Cod after I graduated from the program. But my family said I should stay out here. I had a job because you had to get a job in the program to get a cell phone and then I ended up getting a house through something Obama passed. I never left.” Peace hasn’t relapsed since moving to Cape Cod despite being routinely tempted by the addiction that surrounds her. She has a front seat to the opioid epidemic. “I didn’t think anyone did drugs on the Cape. I thought the Kennedys lived here!” says Peace. “But there are so many deaths on the Cape. It’s unbelievable. It’s just not published in the papers the amount of homelessness and addiction here, and how it’s a bigger problem in the wintertime. Even so, I’m terrified of getting high, and that’s what keeps me. I am terrified of not making it back.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/may/15/jack-wilshere-joe-hart-cold-england-key-world-cup","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-15T21:27:00Z","webTitle":"Jack Wilshere and Joe Hart in the cold after losing key to England door","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/15/jack-wilshere-joe-hart-cold-england-key-world-cup","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/15/jack-wilshere-joe-hart-cold-england-key-world-cup","fields":{"headline":"Jack Wilshere and Joe Hart in the cold after losing key to England door","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Jack Wilshere and Joe Hart appear to be the early casualties of Gareth Southgate’s England planning – two relatively young players who would have imagined an international future at the last World Cup. Wilshere got a chance in Brazil only once England had been eliminated, whereas Hart played in the first two games but made way for Ben Foster as Roy Hodgson rang the changes for the final match against Costa Rica. Both players went on to play in the calamitous defeat against Iceland in Nice that signalled the end of England’s Euro 2016 campaign and prompted Hodgson’s resignation, though neither is particularly tainted by the sort of tournament failure that has come to haunt teams from this country. Wilshere’s career has been bedevilled by injury, which is how he came to lose his place at Arsenal after an impressive climb through the youth ranks, and the season he spent on loan at Bournemouth after Euro 2016 could be regarded only as a qualified success. Once he was no longer integral to Arsenal plans he was no longer guaranteed an England call-up either and, if he does drop out of the reckoning for the World Cup in Russia, it will simply be the culmination of several seasons of disappointment. When Wilshere first broke through he looked so cultured and comfortable that people were talking in terms of a century of caps, or at least being a fixture on the international stage for a decade or more, which amounts to more or less the same thing. At 26, with 34 caps, it is now beginning to look as if he may not reach 50. He has undoubtedly been unlucky with the timing of some of his injuries, though it could also be said he has not always made the most of his opportunities. He has seen players such as Dele Alli, Eric Dier, Raheem Sterling and Jordan Henderson establish themselves through being more forceful on the pitch. In all probability Wilshere would have made it to Russia only as a squad player in any case and in that capacity his claims are now being challenged by Jesse Lingard and Ruben Loftus-Cheek. Hart’s is a completely different story. Though occasionally error‑prone with England, just as with Manchester City, the goalkeeper might still be clocking up appearances for both had not Pep Guardiola arrived and decided his distribution was not up to scratch – not just his ability with the ball at his feet inside and outside the box, but his accuracy with goalkicks and long clearances. Guardiola sets high standards for goalkeepers; he wants the complete package. Claudio Bravo, Hart’s immediate replacement at City, was hardly that – the Chilean was not in the England player’s league as a shot‑stopper – though now Ederson has been brought in with an immaculate range of goalkeeping attributes there are far fewer people arguing Hart has been harshly treated. Nonetheless the goalkeeper is at the moment looking for a club after failing to win a regular place at West Ham and not quite answering his critics when on loan at Turin the previous season. Hart has 75 caps and has just turned 31 – no age at all for a goalkeeper – yet more doors seem to be closing than opening and after very publicly failing to live up to the standards required by a succession of managers there must now be question marks over his confidence. Doubtless he could find a berth almost anywhere as a reserve goalkeeper, which is in effect what he became when on loan at West Ham, though the role does not suit everyone. If Hart wishes to continue in a first team, he may have to consider dropping down the league a little and finding a club who would be glad of his considerable experience. That might be hard to swallow for a player whose two league titles are still fresh in the memory, along with four golden glove awards from his time as No 1 at the Etihad Stadium, though it is already clear City have moved on. If Hart is to do the same, he needs to find regular football. With a bit of luck and the right club there may still be time left for a comeback."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/may/16/omar-beckles-shrewsbury-league-one-play-off-final-mental-health-football","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-16T12:37:06Z","webTitle":"Shrewsbury’s Omar Beckles: ‘I’d get back and be breaking down in tears’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/16/omar-beckles-shrewsbury-league-one-play-off-final-mental-health-football","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/16/omar-beckles-shrewsbury-league-one-play-off-final-mental-health-football","fields":{"headline":"Shrewsbury’s Omar Beckles: ‘I’d get back and be breaking down in tears’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Omar Beckles is speaking about the importance of speaking out; about the dark hole at the end of the downward spiral, how he would quietly break down in tears hours after a game and how he would grind and then clench his teeth following the death of his father, Linton. The passing at 59 of his father, a former singer with the jazz-funk band Central Line, when Beckles, after spells in Spain and on trial in Turkey, was playing for Aldershot Town in 2015, led to his problems. The Shrewsbury Town defender did not give himself time to grieve because he threw himself into “fight mode”, eager to help his family, particularly his widowed mother, Angela. “Dealing with the loss of her soul mate was not something I wanted her to go through alone; I didn’t want her to force herself into work,” Beckles says. “I wanted to be like: ‘OK, I can help her.’ I wanted to be the financial support that allowed her not to. But the burden I put on myself was my own burden. I created something that wasn’t really a thing.” At the two-bedroom family home in Walthamstow Beckles was at pains to be the “man of the house”, to look after his mother and younger brother Aaron, as well as his sister, Kamilah, who had moved back in. He shouldered the responsibility, which sharpened his focus, ultimately propelling his career forward. “But my mental capacity at the time was really bad. When I was at Accrington, there were times when I was playing, things were going well and I’d get back to my room and I’d be breaking down in tears. I kept putting pressure on myself.” It was to that east London council flat that Beckles returned after a third-round FA Cup replay defeat by West Ham United in January. “I’d gone from playing under the lights at the Olympic Stadium, leaving there after having a really good game and seeing reports that I had got like the best rating, to going home, climbing into the top bunk of the bed. It’s not as glamorous as everyone makes it out to be.” Talking during Mental Health Awareness Week, the 26-year-old candidly discusses his own struggles, the pressure he heaped on his shoulders but also how he hopes to make a difference through his Hub 365 foundation, recently set up to help those suffering in silence. “Each one of us goes through some kind of anxiety, depression or stress, and for me it is: ‘Can I help change this matter, this issue?’” Beckles, a devout Christian, is determined to help others – as his dad did. “Depression doesn’t discriminate, it doesn’t matter whether you’re rich, poor, whatever colour you are or whatever ethnicity you are,” Beckles says. “We all need to be able to open and express those things, especially as men. I feel like men tend to internalise a lot more, which obviously links to the suicide rates between men and women; it is far higher with men than women. You don’t really realise a space someone is in from how they express themselves externally. It’s vital to open up.” During his struggles his sleep was irregular. Beckles was grinding and then clenching his teeth to the point where Shrewsbury paid for an adequate mouthguard, the plastic one obtained at Accrington on medical advice no longer sufficient. As he says, it was no way for anybody to be living. “I would get locked jaw and in the mornings I literally wouldn’t be able to open my mouth for five or 10 minutes. I would have to do little exercises to loosen it and the doctor said that’s the tension of stress and maybe depression. For me, it was kind of like: ‘I need to get off this burden that I am carrying.’ I started opening up, speaking to my family and I just felt that release.” On Sunday week Beckles, who was released as a scholar by Millwall at 18, will play in the League One play-off final at Wembley. It will be his second visit there this season, after defeat by Lincoln City in the Checkatrade Trophy last month. He believes fate has afforded him the chance to play under that famous arch. His route there consists of 18 months alongside Sam Clucas and Jordan Hugill at Glenn Hoddle’s academy in Jerez, near Seville, as well as a trial at Kardemir Karabükspor in northern Turkey. “It was not glamorous at all – Istanbul is very much the lifestyle and image. I had done a medical and everything but there was this new rule about ‘active foreigners’ and I was never going to play in the first team, more of a prospect for the future, so if I went out on loan I would have been an ‘active foreigner’, so that killed that for me.” He returned to London and worked his way through non-league ranks after signing for Boreham Wood, obtaining his Uefa B coaching licence and futsal qualifications along the way. “Every season, for the past four seasons, I’ve gone up a league. And to be on the brink of being able to do it again with the team, rather than getting a move, is just surreal. I didn’t dream or fathom being in this predicament playing at Billericay or Hornchurch. I might have said a few blasé comments about getting into the Football League but I never thought I’d be able to experience playing at Wembley. I feel so, so blessed.” • In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org. In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255.

She’s not a bartender or a bouncer – she’s there to help patrons navigate the sometimes murky world of flirting, dating and hooking up in the wake of the #MeToo movement. Geib was hired by the Victoria Event Centre last month as a “consent captain” – a position believed to be the first of its kind in the country. The job joins a raft of other initiatives around the world aimed at fighting back against sexual harassment and assault – but also guiding those who are struggling to move forward. “Since the #MeToo movement, we now know what sexual assault is, and we’re like, ‘OK, we really don’t want to do that any more,’” she said. “But then there’s this whole grey cloud area around what acting in consent and consensual relationships are.” Geib – who has worked as a sex health educator across North America – came up with the position after attending a few dance parties held by a local collective at the centre. After hearing a raft of “icky” stories , she put her skills to work, creating a position where someone would be on the floor to address the issues as they happened. Then the Victoria Event Centre, which hosts everything from live concerts to burlesque shows, made contact. “They started noticing that our dances were better, more safe and more inclusive and accessible to folks,” she said. “So they approached me, saying: ‘Hey, would you want to come and do this for all of our events? What would that look like?’” The collaboration has transformed the space, which is now adorned with posters on consent and signs that spell out the house policy on the issue. Towards the beginning of the night, Geib often hovers by the door, introducing herself to people as they enter and letting them know that she’s there to chat or answer any questions about consent. Anyone who experiences behaviour that makes them uncomfortable is encouraged to speak with her. “Whether it’s a stare or a physical touch or dancing too close, they can come to me,” she said. As the night continues, she checks on those who seem heavily intoxicated, making sure they’re safe and offering to get them a glass of water or help them into a taxi if needed. In the few short weeks that she’s been on the job, she’s fielded complaints ranging from inappropriate comments to more explicit harassment. Her response depends on those who report the issues; Geib always asks whether they want her to speak to the people carrying out the offending behaviour. If they do, she launches into action. Often she starts by asking how their night is going and whether they need any support. “Depending on how those two questions go, I introduce myself, ‘I’m Tanille and I’ve just gotten some feedback about your behaviour. You’re making someone uncomfortable, do you want to have a conversation with that?’” Some have simply thanked her, saying they didn’t realise how their behaviour was coming across. Others have turned hostile, refusing to listen to her and forcing her to turn to her security team for backup. “We’ve had to kick out a couple of people,” she said. “But I always try and give them my card, and be like: ‘Hey, if you want to chat again, please do so and we would welcome you back into this space.’” Geib stressed that she’s not there to police people’s behaviour. “I’m not here to check in and make sure everyone has full consent. That’s not fun and I would not want that job.” So far the position seems to be having an impact, she said. “The biggest change that we’ve seen is more conversation around consent culture and how to have those conversations normally – without shame and guilt.” The idea has also faced some backlash: a male caller in a recent radio show suggested that she’s taking all of the fun out of a night out. Geib was quick to correct this view. “People are just scared, they’re thinking that all these rules mean no fun,” she said. “But actually the whole point is that I want people to have more pleasure and connection in their lives.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

This weekend, as Meghan Markle marries Prince Harry, Guy the beagle will launch into another chapter of his rather charmed life, as he officially becomes part of the royal family. “It’s a total fairytale,” said Alison Preiss of Pet Valu, the Ontario pet store where the rescue dog was adopted by Markle in 2015. “Here is this dog that was in a shelter, nobody wanted him, and through this wonderful adoption he’s now living in a palace, running around with the royal family.” Guy’s unlikely journey began after a shelter in the US sent an email to Dolores Doherty, who runs an Ontario-based organisation, A Dog’s Dream Rescue, which saves beagles slated to be put down in the US and brings them to Canada to be adopted. This time, a shelter in Kentucky was asking if she would be interested in a 17lb beagle that had been found in the woods. After he had spent days at the shelter, nobody had come forward to adopt him, and the dog was on the euthanasia list. “I always say yes,” said Doherty. “I can’t say no. I’m a sucker.” A network of volunteers helped transport the dog more than 500 miles to the Canadian border, each of them driving him for one hour before handing him over to the next waiting car. He hadn’t even been in Canada for a full day when Doherty brought him to an adoption event on the outskirts of Toronto. “He was just sitting there with those big beagle sad eyes, looking so depressed. He was irresistible,” said Doherty. Dozens of people had turned up to meet the 20 or so dogs up for adoption, including Markle, who at the time was living in Toronto while her TV series Suits was being filmed. Doherty – who had never heard of Suits – had no inkling of Markle’s celebrity status. The first hint of Markle’s fame came after Doherty said she would have to carry out a home visit to confirm some of the details listed in her application, such as the fenced-in backyard. Markle said it wouldn’t be a problem – but asked her to make an appointment for security reasons. Doherty never made it to Markle’s house. Instead, she followed Guy’s new life on Instagram, delighting in snaps of the beagle as he strolled the streets of Toronto next to Markle or curled up beside her at home, napping. After news broke of Markle’s engagement to Prince Harry, Doherty revelled in the idea that one of her dogs would now be joining the royal family. “It’s just beyond my wildest imagination,” she said. “How is that for a rags to riches story from a good old Kentucky beagle?” In November, Prince Harry’s communication secretary confirmed that Guy had moved to the UK and was living with Markle. Her other dog, Bogart, is believed to be too old to make the journey across the Atlantic and is staying with Markle’s close friends. While Guy now ranks as the most famous of her rescue dogs, he’s far from the only one with a remarkable story, Doherty said. Of the 1,600 or so dogs her organisation has rescued in the past seven years, some have gone on to become cancer detection dogs while a few support people who have depression or panic attacks. Others have found work as detection dogs along the Canada-US border. “The dogs that have come up here have really impacted a lot of lives,” she said. “So there’s a lot of happy endings, but his certainly is the most outstanding.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/may/15/recep-tayyip-erdogan-theresa-may-uk-state-visit-jailed-journalists-terrorists","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-15T20:23:00Z","webTitle":"Erdoğan ends UK state visit by calling jailed journalists 'terrorists'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/15/recep-tayyip-erdogan-theresa-may-uk-state-visit-jailed-journalists-terrorists","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/15/recep-tayyip-erdogan-theresa-may-uk-state-visit-jailed-journalists-terrorists","fields":{"headline":"Erdoğan ends UK state visit by calling jailed journalists 'terrorists'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has ended his three-day state visit to the UK by insisting that all the journalists locked in Turkish jails were terrorist criminals, ignoring a warning from Theresa May not to lose sight of democratic values as he sought to defend his country from “the extraordinary pressures of a failed coup and Kurdish terrorism”. At a press conference in Downing Street alongside May, Erdoğan made no reference to May’s remarks about human rights, but instead urged her to do more to extradite Turkish exiles from the Gulenist or Kurdish movements, saying that if she did not act act against terrorists, it would come back to bite her. May, eager to strike a post-Brexit free trade deal with Turkey, said the UK was always prepared to extradite Kurdish terrorists if the evidence was provided. Erdoğan believes that the exiled cleric Fethullah Gülen, currently in the US, was behind the 2016 failed military coup. May said that while it was right that those who sought to overthrow a democratically elected government were brought to justice, “it is also important that in the defence of democracy… Turkey does not lose sight of the values it is seeking to defend”. May added: “That is why today I have underlined to President Erdoğan that we want to see democratic values and international human rights obligations upheld.” But Erdoğan ignored her strictures, saying: “You have to make a distinction between terrorists and journalists. We are talking about ... those who have been caught red-handed bearing weapons, those who have been killing people. “Are we supposed to call them journalists just because they bear the credentials and identity cards? Currently, the Turkish judiciary is prosecuting and sentencing individuals who have been associated with terrorism and involved in terrorist actions.” According to the P24 press freedom group, there are more than 160 journalists behind bars in Turkey, most of whom were arrested under the state of emergency imposed after the coup attempt. May also hailed an agreement to improve cooperation over the extradition of foreign fighters arrested in Turkey. Turkey says it has detained 6,000 foreign fighters, mainly on the side of Islamic State inside Syria. The two countries are seeking to increase trade from $15bn a year to $20bn (£11.1bn to £14.8bn), with a defence partnership at the heart of the agreement. Rolls Royce is currently bidding to co-build the engine for Turkey’s new TFX fighter jet. Erdoğan has been using the visit, which included a meeting with the Queen in Buckingham Palace, as a backdrop for his campaign to win presidential elections on 24 June, but an important TV interview with Bloomberg backfired when said he wanted to retain closer control of interest rates after he was elected president with executive powers. His remarks plunged the Turkish lira to a new low against the dollar as investors were spooked by Erdoğan’s unconventional view that high inflation is best tackled by low interest rates. “I will take the responsibility as the indisputable head of the executive in respect of the steps to be taken and decisions on these issues,” he told Bloomberg. The country is suffering from double-digit inflation, and investors worry that political interference will prevent the central bank from taking the tough decisions on interest rates necessary to keep the economy from spiralling out of control. Outside Downing Street, a relatively small crowd of Kurds and free speech advocates protested against Erdogan’s visit."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/may/15/batter-royale-why-brits-and-americans-will-never-agree-on-hot-gloop","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-15T20:23:21Z","webTitle":"Batter royale: why Brits and Americans will never agree on yorkshire pudding","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/15/batter-royale-why-brits-and-americans-will-never-agree-on-hot-gloop","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/15/batter-royale-why-brits-and-americans-will-never-agree-on-hot-gloop","fields":{"headline":"Batter royale: why Brits and Americans will never agree on yorkshire pudding","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A perceived slight against the yorkshire pudding appears to have thrown the British public into a frenzy, thanks in part to the BBC’s shocking declaration that the “New York Times thinks Yorkshire pudding is a dessert”. According to BBC News: “confusion has reigned supreme on Twitter after the New York Times tweeted its version of a classic Yorkshire pudding – to be served with ‘syrup, preserves, confectioners’ sugar or cinnamon sugar’.” Let’s get the cold, hard facts out of the way: the US does not have yorkshire pudding. Grocery stores don’t stock Aunt Bessie’s between the frozen peas, ice cream and mozzarella sticks. Home goods stores don’t carry tins to make yorkshire pudding in alongside cake molds and pie pans. Instead, we fill the absence with biscuits, rolls and popovers – the yorkshire pudding’s American cousin. What we certainly don’t do is dress up the Sunday Roast staple in powdered sugar and jam and pretend it’s the same thing. That is a different dish, the Dutch baby, which when shared by the New York Times on Twitter inspired fierce protestations of: “That’s a Yorkshire pudding, mate.” The New York Times’s recipe, much like American grocery stores, does not include a mention of yorkshire pudding. And a keen observer would notice this particular dish is always much larger than the traditional yorkshire pudding – a Dutch baby calls for a large, paella-sized pan. Sure, giant yorkshires are available in the UK, but as my colleague Alex, a Yorkshireman, explained to me: “The point isn’t really eating a large one but eating a lot of them.” “They were actually made so that poor families could fill people up with yorkshire puddings so they wouldn’t eat as much meat for a Sunday roast,” he continued. “Yorkshire people always have them as a first course. I reckon I could put away six, easily.” But the size didn’t matter for some New York Times commenters, including one person who declared: “This is not a dessert! This is a thing of beauty that should be filled with beef and vegetables. Or sausage and mash. It is a Yorkshire pudding.” Interestingly, in a small, non-scientific survey of six British people, the question ‘have you ever had a yorkshire pudding with sweet, rather than savory, toppings’ was met with, yes, curse words, but also two tales of their families eating it cold with sugar and vinegar. So, in divisive times such as these, maybe the best thing for all of us to do is to gather around Morrisons yorkshire pudding pizza and accept that big batter-based vestibules can be for more than just gravy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"society/2018/may/16/failure-act-dangerous-midwives-resulted-deaths-report","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-15T23:01:34Z","webTitle":"Failure to act against 'dangerous' midwives resulted in deaths – report","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/may/16/failure-act-dangerous-midwives-resulted-deaths-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/may/16/failure-act-dangerous-midwives-resulted-deaths-report","fields":{"headline":"Failure to act against 'dangerous' midwives resulted in deaths – report","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Babies and mothers died after a health regulator failed to act against midwives suspected of providing dangerously poor care, despite the police raising concerns about their conduct, a damning report has concluded. The Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) did nothing for two years about information supplied by Cumbria police on maternity staff at Furness general hospital, an inquiry found. The NMC’s failure to instigate disciplinary proceedings against midwives at the hospital allowed them to carry on practising when they represented a danger to pregnant women and their offspring, according to the Professional Standards Authority (PSA). Up to 19 babies and mothers died at the hospital between 2004 and 2012 as a result of mistakes by staff of its maternity unit, in one of the biggest patient care scandals involving an NHS trust in England. A previous inquiry into the deaths concluded that 13 of the infants and women would have lived if they had received better care. The scandal involved six neonatal deaths, 10 stillbirths and three deaths of mothers at the hospital, which is one of five run by Morecambe Bay hospitals NHS foundation trust. The PSA’s review of the NMC’s handling of the scandal was commissioned by the health secretary, Jeremy Hunt. Cumbria police told the review: “We were really concerned that reports of the same midwives [of whom] we had the cases sitting in front of us were still practising at the hospital.” The PSA, which supervises medical regulators, found that the NMC was not prompted to do anything by the police reports, despite their seriousness. “In our view there was scope for the NMC to investigate the wider fitness to practise of the midwives concerned and the police expected them to do so at the time the information was sent,” the 80-page report says. “We saw no evidence that the NMC considered doing so. This was an opportunity missed, given that some of the midwives identified by the police were subsequently involved in adverse events at [Furness general hospital].” The NMC has admitted that its handling of cases involving midwives from the trust was unacceptable and has said it is “truly sorry”. Jackie Smith, the regulator’s chief executive since 2012, announced her resignation on Monday. Bill Kirkup, who led the inquiry into the scandal that reported in 2015, has criticised the NMC’s “lamentable failure” over its decision to clear two midwives of misconduct relating to the death in 2008 of Joshua Titcombe. He died nine days after his birth after midwives failed to spot he had a serious infection. In a scathing joint statement, Joshua’s father, James Titcombe, and two other bereaved parents, Liza Brady and Carl Hendrickson, said the report exposed “the truly shocking scale of the NMC’s failure to respond properly to the serious concerns and detailed information provided to them”. They said: “We were particularly horrified that even when Cumbria police directly raised significant issues, the NMC effectively ignored the information for almost two years. Whilst this was going on, serious incidents involving registrants [midwives] under investigation continued, meaning lives were undoubtedly put at risk. Avoidable tragedies continued to happen that could well have been prevented.” They also slated the NMC for being “defensive, legalistic and in some cases grossly misleading in their responses to families and others” and for its “culture of denial and reputational management”. The PSA’s report also reveals that the NMC mishandled its dealings with bereaved families, had very poor record-keeping and did not pass on to the PSA material that the latter’s inquiry team then found elsewhere. Smith, the outgoing chief executive, said: “Since 2014 we’ve made significant changes to improve the way we work and as the report recognises, we’re now a very different organisation. The changes we’ve made put vulnerable witnesses and families affected by failings in care at the heart of our work. But we know that there is much more to do.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/15/the-guardian-view-on-brexit-and-devolution-wanted-joined-up-thinking","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-15T17:42:22Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on Brexit and devolution: wanted – joined-up thinking | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/15/the-guardian-view-on-brexit-and-devolution-wanted-joined-up-thinking","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/may/15/the-guardian-view-on-brexit-and-devolution-wanted-joined-up-thinking","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on Brexit and devolution: wanted – joined-up thinking","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Britain’s Brexit argument began life as a dispute between remaining in the European Union and leaving it. After the vote to leave in 2016, that original dispute has gradually been overlaid by the battle between a hard and soft Brexit. The House of Lords debates on the EU withdrawal bill, which have significantly softened the bill, and which come to an end on Wednesday, can best be understood in that hard/soft context. When the bill returns to the Commons (Conservative factions are still squabbling over the terms) the arguments will continue along this same hard/soft axis. However, hard/soft is not the only axis. In the devolved nations there is a different issue. This asks which should have the final word on Brexit: Westminster or the devolved governments – and in what combination? The answers differ in each devolved country. Though Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU, its unionist leaders have backed Theresa May for a hard Brexit. After initial objections to Mrs May’s centralist approach, the Welsh government won concessions that were reflected in a government climbdown; it has now struck a deal. The Scots, however, said those were insufficient, so dispute still rages unresolved there. On Tuesday the Scottish parliament voted overwhelmingly to reject the Brexit bill altogether, with the Conservatives dissenting. This issue typically gets too little attention in England. Even a lot of Scots are relatively unmoved by what can be a dry dispute. Yet the argument ought to matter to all who care about the functioning of the UK. At stake are essential issues about the working of a devolved state, or even in time a federal one. The question of who decides about issues that were previously EU competences – such as GM crops, fishing quotas, state aid to industries, data protection, energy labelling and internet security – matters. So, though, do the mechanisms for resolving disputes and striking compromises with which all can live. The UK is not so practised at that. This summer the UK supreme court is likely to decide some rules. Both sides in the Scottish divide have arguments that should be respected. The SNP government leads a country that voted strongly to remain. It is right to fight its pro-European corner. But Westminster is also right to be concerned about protecting the UK single market from too much internal protectionism. The Brexit outcome must be harmonious with the devolution settlement, and not disruptive to either devolution or to the single market within the UK. Almost inevitably, these arguments are saturated with party politics. The SNP wants a confrontation that puts Scottish separatism back on the agenda. Labour and the Lib Dems, who both backed the SNP on Tuesday, want to compromise, but cannot risk being manoeuvred into alliance with the Tories. Ultimately, the current row reflects the SNP’s separatist yearnings, Mrs May’s fear of concessions that would split her party, and the other parties’ fear of being squeezed. In the short term, however, give and take will be needed. In the long term, Britain needs a devolved politics which, as in countries like Germany and Canada, allows standoffs of this kind to be resolved by rules of law as well as by raw politics."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2018/may/15/batteries-included-in-energy-storage-ideas","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-15T17:28:09Z","webTitle":"Batteries included in energy storage ideas | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/15/batteries-included-in-energy-storage-ideas","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/may/15/batteries-included-in-energy-storage-ideas","fields":{"headline":"Batteries included in energy storage ideas","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The WWF has been oversimplistic in its argument that no further gas-fired power stations are needed (Report, 14 May). The forecast increase in annual renewable electricity production is only just sufficient to balance the closure of coal-fired electricity generation and the fall in nuclear generation resulting from the retirement of many of our nuclear power stations (most of which are already working beyond their design lives). However, this does not mean more no more gas generation capacity is needed. Electricity demand varies, and renewables are intermittent. There has to be enough capacity to meet demand at all times. While pump storage systems and batteries are able to store enough energy to cope with short-term variations in demand and the availability of renewable generation, it would not be environmentally friendly, efficient or cost-effective to use such systems to store energy from summer to winter, or even to store enough to survive a long midwinter period of high pressure over the North Sea. We may not need to use more gas over the year, but with reduced nuclear output and no coal, the peak demand for gas-fired generation will be larger, meaning we will need more plant. We should not view electricity generation in isolation. We need to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from heating and transport too. Using excess electricity to generate hydrogen, injecting it into the gas grid (or into hydrogen vehicle fuel tanks), and then using an equivalent amount of gas to generate electricity when in short supply, is a viable method of long- or short-term energy storage. The extra gas generation capacity needed for that is cheaper than battery storage. Steve Bolter Gestingthorpe, Essex • Your article (Hydrogen is solution to excess electricity puzzle, say engineers, 9 May) based on a recent report by the Institution of Mechanical Engineers about heat from hydrogen, makes me wonder whether the IMechE are in the pocket of the gas industry. The best electrolyser conversion efficiency I’ve ever come across is about 0.76. If that produces hydrogen from electricity and it’s burned in a boiler with a gross “efficiency” of 0.9, that’s 0.68 units of heat per unit of electricity supplied. Oh, and there’s no hydrogen infrastructure yet. Is there an alternative? Yes – the best lithium-ion batteries have a round trip “efficiency” of 0.89. If that’s fed to a heat pump with an eminently achievable coefficient of performance of 3, that’s 2.67 units of heat per unit of electricity supplied – almost four times as much as can be gained from the hydrogen option. And the infrastructure for that already exists.

Chelsea have been trying to persuade the Belgium forward to sign improved terms for around a year and are willing to give him the most lucrative contract in their history worth around £300,000 a week. Hazard, whose deal runs to 2020, is settled with his family in Surrey and expects to be at the club next season, when they will compete in the Europa League, but he will commit only if satisfied Chelsea have strengthened sufficiently to mount a challenge for the title. Real Madrid have long been linked with Hazard, who has made no secret of his admiration for Zinedine Zidane, and Chelsea, who are expected to part company with Antonio Conte, would face the uncomfortable prospect of the Spanish club formalising that pursuit in the three-week period between the end of the English transfer window and that in Spain, on 31 August. Chelsea would resist a sale, conscious they would be unable to sign a replacement, but their stance would be undermined if Hazard’s head was turned. The 27-year-old knows his next contract could well be the last in his prime. “That’s why I’m taking my time,” he said. “It’s something big, so I need to think about a lot of things. But one thing is for sure: I’m happy here.” Asked to elaborate on the factors that would influence his decision, he added: “I’m waiting for new players next season. I want good players, because I want to win the Premier League next season. “Like I’ve said many times before, I think the FA Cup final is not my last game for Chelsea. It’s the last game of the season, that’s it. After the World Cup then we will be ready for the next season. But, for me in my mind, I’m here. I have one week to play now. Saturday is a massive game, I just want to win, for me and them also.” Hazard, who does not have an agent, declined to indicate when a decision on his future would be made. Conte’s side are seeking to salvage a disappointing Premier League season, which culminated in a 3-0 defeat at Newcastle on Sunday and a fifth-place finish, with victory against Manchester United at Wembley. “We are Chelsea and we need a trophy at the end of the season and, at the moment, we have nothing,” Hazard said. “We have not qualified for the Champions League, so this season has been bad. Now we can save a little bit this season, with this trophy. So we will give everything. “I don’t know [why it has been so bad this season]. It’s always hard after when you win the league. We saw that two years ago. This season was not good but you know – this is Chelsea. You never know what’s happening. But, no, I think this year we dropped too many points at Stamford Bridge. In this condition you can’t be in the top four, so it’s up to us now to save the season with the FA Cup. “We’ve had bad games, but also played a fantastic game against Liverpool recently, so I hope for Saturday the boys will be ready like we were against Liverpool last week. If we play all together, we can do something, especially against Manchester United.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"music/2018/may/19/one-to-watch-mellah-middle-england-ep","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-19T17:00:36Z","webTitle":"One to watch: Mellah","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/19/one-to-watch-mellah-middle-england-ep","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/may/19/one-to-watch-mellah-middle-england-ep","fields":{"headline":"One to watch: Mellah","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Liam Ramsden is Mellah, an outrageously talented south Londoner who plays several instruments, writes his own songs then directs videos for each of them.

At a time when our best bands retreat into roleplay or cynicism, there’s something deeply affecting about a writer unafraid to provoke genuine emotion (or “feelies”, as Ramsden would have it) regarding real, rather than imaginary, things. Throughout both EPs, the only two constants are Ramsden’s vulnerable, querulous yet weirdly authoritative vocals and his liquid guitar playing.

Another, wearing a trilby, is slightly lost, looking for something (perhaps mirroring the film title displayed behind him). A woman in a hijab seems to float above the kerb in the distance. Artist Chris Dorley-Brown, who has lived in east London for almost 40 years, has immortalised the area’s street corners in a new book. But rather than normal photographs, taken in one-sixtieth of a second, his are multiple exposures brought together: a simultaneous snapshot of events that happened over an hour. “I’m interested in challenging the dictum of Henri Cartier-Bresson, who defined documentary photography as being about a decisive moment,” he says. “I wanted to put several decisive moments into a photograph.” Roughly 100 photographs for each set-up are narrowed down to a handful of people and weaved together in Photoshop. It is a sort of staged scenario, yet true to life: “I’m trying to present a new way of looking at familiar territory. It’s a bit like making a painting, even though I regard them as documentary photographs: I don’t add anything that wasn’t there or take anything away.” Street corners are a fitting place for Dorley-Brown to capture the multicultural area’s diverse demographics and constant state of flux. The fabric shop is now an estate agent. The Rio, a Grade II‑listed art deco building, is one of Hackney’s last independent cinemas. Behind the photographer is a mosque; to the right, about a dozen Turkish restaurants and cafes. “East London for me has always retained some kind of edge: there’s a polarity there, opposing forces which make daily life interesting. Maybe they’re represented on street corners because there’s this intersection of cultural ideas – people are reorientating themselves, never really knowing what’s around the corner.” • The Corners by Chris Dorley-Brown is published by Hoxton Mini Press (£30).

None of the demonstrators posed any direct danger to the state of Israel or to its citizens. The killing of over 50 demonstrators and the thousands more wounded are reminiscent of the Sharpeville Massacre in 1960 in South Africa. The world acted then. We call upon decent members of the international community to act by demanding that those who commanded such shootings be investigated and tried. The current leaders of the Israeli government are responsible for the criminal policy of shooting at unarmed demonstrators. The world must intervene to stop the ongoing killing.

The majority of the demonstrators were indeed unarmed and largely unharmed. Overwhelmingly the people who lost their lives were rioters participating in violent riots, armed with slings, petrol bombs, explosive devices and, on Monday, live fire. The rioters destroyed the terminal through which Israel channels fuel, food and medical aid into Gaza. We can only imagine the massacre that would have ensued in Israeli villages if they had broken through the border. It is regrettable that the Guardian publishes what can only be described as propaganda articles inflaming the situation. Michel Norman Hod Ha’sharon, Israel • Since 30 March, each week has seen more protests by Gazans at the border with Israel and more killings of largely unarmed protesters by Israeli snipers using live ammunition. As of the morning of 15 May, Nakba Day, more than 100 Palestinians have been killed and some thousands injured. The position has been aggravated by the provocation of the opening of a new US embassy in Jerusalem, hammering another nail into the coffin of an already moribund peace process. The Independent Jewish Voices steering group wishes to express our horror at the flagrant disregard for the human rights of the Palestinians and the norms of international law, and our support for those many thousands who have been demonstrating their opposition around the world. We call upon the UK government to condemn the actions of the Israeli authorities, to demand an independent inquiry into the use of force on the Gaza border, to make clear that the UK embassy will remain in Tel Aviv, and to redouble all diplomatic efforts to bring the occupation to an end. Dr Anthony Isaacs, Dr Vivienne Jackson, Dr Katy Fox-Hodess, Dr Tamar Steinitz, Professor Jacqueline Rose, Ann Jungman, Merav Pinchassoff, Professor Adam Fagan, Professor Francesa Klug Independent Jewish Voices steering group • In the face of the bloodshed in Gaza, too many in the west have been quick to minimise or even excuse the state-sanctioned murder of unarmed protesters. The White House labelled the innocent lives lost at the hands of Israeli troops as “part of the problem”, as it celebrated its embassy move. The UK government and Labour Friends of Israel blamed the unarmed Palestinian people for daring to protest against their repression and raised the spectre of Hamas. Greens will continue to support the ideals of freedom, equality and respect for international law. And that includes supporting Palestinian people marking the Nakba by protesting against their illegal oppressors. We support a two-state solution but, with Netanyahu being appeased by the west at every turn, this has never seemed so far away. Keith Taylor MEP Green party, South East England • The true occupation army in Gaza is the over 10,000 soldiers in the Hamas militia. Recruitment is helped by the terrible economic conditions. Those conditions could be better if the Hamas leaders decided to cooperate with Israel rather than to chase an ephemeral dream of reclaiming Palestine and killing all the Jews. Gaza has no real clean water, no sewage system and almost no electricity. Why? Because Hamas spends whatever funding it receives on arms and building tunnels into Israel. There is another way, but neither Hamas nor any other Palestinian political leader seems prepared to even talk about it, much less act to bring it about. Aryeh Wetherhorn Elazar, West Bank • Letters in Tuesday’s Guardian (15 May) cut through the pain, hate, lies and misinformation about Israel/Palestine in the space of few column inches. Maybe there are enough of us prepared to move on as Ehud Barak proposed in July 1999, and work towards a “peace of the brave”? Joy Helman London • I was so annoyed by the editorial and reporting in the Telegraph on Gaza, that I – a lifelong reader – had to buy the Guardian to get the definitive report. Theirs showed little sympathy with the sufferings of Gaza, whose people were, for the most part, unarmed.

We never learn. In 2003 government-sponsored research into the quality of passive fire protection (PFP) in buildings included this comment in its final report: “Public safety is being impinged by incorrect PFP measures and we feel that a disaster caused by accelerated or unexpected fire spread could follow if no action is taken to improve initial standards and to define the responsibility of building occupiers to undertake correct maintenance.” Since then we’ve suffered two major fires and 78 deaths, yet “we” propose to leave the regulations as they are, it seems. The construction industry cannot be trusted to improve standards, as doing what they know is correct will be perceived to cost them business. It is almost a year since Grenfell, and it now looks as though nothing meaningful will be done, so it can all happen again as the PFP industry warned almost 20 years ago.

The blocking feature was launched in April, and seemed to constitute a big step forward in removing one of the most irritating aspects of the modern web: loud, sudden and unwanted autoplaying videos. But the update also broke a series of apps, games and interactive art in the process, preventing them from playing audio for alerts and other elements, and causing complaints from developers and users of these interactive web apps. One of Google’s project managers for Chrome, John Pallett, said: “We’ve updated Chrome 66 to temporarily remove the autoplay policy for the Web Audio API. “We’re doing this to give Web Audio API developers (eg gaming, audio applications, some RTC features) more time to update their code. The policy will be reapplied to the Web Audio API in Chrome 70 (October).” The change was greeted with scepticism by developers. Benji Kay, a developer of web games and audio tools, said: “Simply delaying the enacting of this policy doesn’t solve any of the major concerns that have been raised. “Come October, any existing software which utilises sound and which is not or cannot be any longer maintained will be broken.” Pallett said that the change will not affect Chrome’s silencing of most autoplaying video and audio on the web. But whether this loophole will end up being abused to autoplay video with sound and get developers to update their apps to avoid them being muted remains to be seen. The original muting of the nuisance videos within Chrome was designed to remove one of the annoyances that might have pushed users to install adblocking or other software, something Google wants to avoid as advertising is the primary source of the company’s revenue.

No Evertonian at the Philharmonic Hall in January needed to flick through Big Sam to confirm suspicions the latest chapter would end acrimoniously and swiftly. His was a desperate and ill-judged appointment, and his removal alone will not rectify the serious drift at Goodison Park. Allardyce leaves Everton after six miserable months with his reputation as a survival specialist intact. Therein lies the failure. Everton, as the 63-year‑old admitted when installed as Ronald Koeman’s replacement in November, represented the best opportunity of his club career to shatter preconceptions about his management style. He succeeded only in confirming they were legitimate. Wretched football on a weekly basis, taking responsibility for victory while abdicating it in defeat and an arrogant dismissal of supporters were not the basis for building consensus or hope for the future. Not that the Everton hierarchy have delivered on that score. Yes, Allardyce inherited a weak squad that, one year after the costliest recruitment drive in Everton’s history – costly in every sense – is in need of major reconstruction. But it was a squad clear from relegation danger by Christmas after a seven-game unbeaten start to his reign. Allardyce had five months to implement improvements in style, performance and results while showing he was invested in Everton for the long term. He did not deliver on any count. The anaemic defeat at West Ham last Sunday, coming after the manager had given players several days off in the buildup, was a fitting farewell to an appalling season from all concerned. In fairness to those who ignored Allardyce’s unsuitability and oversaw the unpopular appointment, there was a sensible economic reason for seeking insurance when the team floundered earlier in the season. Those behind the decision were Moshiri, the then director of football, Steve Walsh, and the directors Alexander Ryazantsev and Keith Harris, who were promoted to chief finance and commercial officer and deputy chairman, respectively, on Tuesday. Everton’s unexpected regression on the pitch coincided with the club negotiating with Liverpool city council and global financial institutions for the £500m required to build a new stadium at Bramley Moore dock. The strength of Everton’s case to lenders is based, in part, on being a safe Premier League concern that has been ever-present in the top flight since 1954. This was not the season to demonstrate the fragility of that proud record by even flirting with relegation. Progress has been slow on the project that will define Moshiri’s legacy, however, when it could have strengthened the case for Allardyce’s appointment in the short term. The council is yet to sign off a proposed £280m loan that could generate a profit of £7m a year in interest for the austerity-battered authority over 25 years. Allardyce’s detractors have argued Everton were never seriously in peril and his claim to have inherited “chaos” from a caretaker manager in David Unsworth who was “struggling to cope” was part of a self-serving PR strategy. There is an element of truth to both sides. Everton were 13th but only five points above the relegation zone following Unsworth’s final game in charge, a 4-0 victory over West Ham that Allardyce shamelessly claimed as his own. That and many other erroneous boasts fuelled supporters’ antagonism as much as football devoid of joy or entertainment. One undeniable statistic favoured by the former Everton manager pinpointed his impact. Everton conceded an alarming 27 goals in the 10 games before Allardyce’s arrival (he would insist nine games on account of West Ham) but the same amount over the next 20. Defensive organisation apart, his average points return over 24 Premier League matches was almost identical to Unsworth’s over five – 1.41 per game compared with 1.4 under the club’s under-23s manager. And there was not one impressive performance among them. His tenure will be remembered instead, if at all, for attempting to bring on a defensive midfielder, Morgan Schneiderlin, at 0-0 against Watford, only to summon a striker when Troy Deeney scored what proved the winner; for being content with a point at Swansea; for having the second-lowest number of shots on target in the Premier League season; and a style of play that one rival manager branded “Conference football” following a game at Goodison. Allardyce talked frequently of planning for next season but never convinced anyone that Everton was anything other than one brief, lucrative and possibly final job. He was up against it from the start in that respect. Moshiri initially offered him a six-month contract having been unable to prise Marco Silva from Watford. It took five weeks, culminating in a 5-1 home defeat by Atalanta and a 4-1 loss at Southampton in the space of four calamitous days, before the major shareholder bowed to Allardyce’s demands for an 18-month deal without a break clause. The manager would become a magnet for disenchantment among supporters fed mediocrity under Bill Kenwright’s ownership and now a lack of vision on the pitch under Moshiri. But Allardyce was emblematic of a deeper malaise at Everton, one the club’s board have to correct this summer. The club exposed Allardyce to ridicule with the survey that asked club members to rate his performance on a scale of zero to 10. It may have been a wide-ranging survey, it may have been a repeat of last year’s exercise under Koeman, but its publication this year, when Allardyce was regularly being told where to go during away games, reflected the leadership vacuum in a business getting the small details wrong. The Monaco-based Moshiri is expected to acquire a majority stake in Everton soon and can ill-afford his third managerial failure with the team regressing from the top six and the stadium vision yet to take shape. The rate of change occurring at Goodison is recognition of the need for improvement. PSV Eindhoven’s technical director, Marcel Brands, has been appointed as the new director of football in place of Walsh, who presided over a disastrous recruitment policy and will leave. The deputy chief executive, Denise Barrett‑Baxendale, has been confirmed as Robert Elstone’s replacement, with the chief executive switching sports to Super League after 13 years.

Lidington, effectively Theresa May’s deputy, said there had been “serious criticisms made about the technical details of both the models on the table” and said more work needed to be done by ministers in two working groups “over the next days and weeks”. May has announced plans to publish a Brexit white paper setting out her priorities for Britain’s future relationship with the European Union. However, her inner cabinet remains divided over two options for future trade – the customs partnership model, in which the UK would collect taxes on behalf of the EU, believed to be the prime minister’s favoured option, and the “max fac” option, which would seek to use technology to police the border instead, which Brexiters prefer. Ministers have been divided into working groups to examine both models. Lidington said the government was seeking legal opinion on both options, after reports suggested both could face legal hurdles. “What any government does is when we are putting forward ideas about new relationships with other countries, new treaties, that we test the legal risks, it’s a normal routine part of policymaking,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “This is what always happens when you talk about a treaty, you check it is compatible with other treaties to which you are party. This is not something special, it is a normal part of government business, analysing the legal risk.” Lidington said the government would publish its Brexit white paper next month, which could run to more than 100 pages and would be expected to include a blueprint for the government’s preferred customs options. though Whitehall insiders have insisted there is no formal commitment to do this. As well as customs, the white paper will cover the future security relationship, the financial services sector, aviation and fisheries. It will form part of ongoing negotiations with Brussels before a political declaration in the autumn. Lidington said the government wanted “to demonstrate that we have thought this through”, both to the British public as well as to the rest of the EU and business. “We did feel in government it’s time we set out our stall in much greater detail than we have until now,” he said. The government could be forced on Wednesday to publish the private papers that have been prepared for the inner Brexit cabinet to help break the deadlock in their negotiations. Labour has tabled a motion, with a binding vote, that would require Downing Street to hand over to MPs all the presentations and economic analysis put before the ministers on the two post-Brexit customs options since January. In an interview on Wednesday morning, the shadow Brexit minister, Paul Blomfield, suggested the party was “ruling nothing off the table” when asked whether it would eventually back Britain being part of the European Economic Area (EEA) after it quits the European Union. Blomfield repeatedly sidestepped questions over whether Labour would back the move when it goes before MPs in the Commons, though sources close to the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, appeared to rule out that possibility on Monday night after a private meeting of Labour MPs. Blomfield said the EEA had “problems associated with it” including binding the UK to EU regulation as well as continuing freedom of movement, but refused to definitively rule out supporting it. “We are going to make our decision on the amendments that come back from the Lords when the government brings the legislation back from the Lords,” he said. Under its current terms, EEA membership gives countries such as Norway and Iceland full access to the EU’s internal market, allowing it to trade goods with EU states without customs fees, except food and drinks, which are subsidised by the EU, but the terms mean accepting freedom of movement and, as a non-EU state, the UK would have to accept EU regulations with no seat at the table in Brussels."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/jun/01/capita-and-fdm-group-face-legal-action-from-former-employees-over-exit-fees","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-01T05:00:42Z","webTitle":"Capita and FDM Group face legal action from former employees over exit fees","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/01/capita-and-fdm-group-face-legal-action-from-former-employees-over-exit-fees","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jun/01/capita-and-fdm-group-face-legal-action-from-former-employees-over-exit-fees","fields":{"headline":"Capita and FDM Group face legal action from former employees over exit fees","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Outsourcing specialists Capita and FDM Group are facing potential legal action from former employees who were faced with demands for thousands of pounds in fees when they tried to leave. Both companies insist graduates and other job hunters carry out three or four months of training, for which they are not paid, before they are put forward for work with top companies. Trainees must then agree to work for two years or be liable for up to £20,000 in fees for the training courses, as first revealed by the Guardian last year. The campaigning barrister Jolyon Maugham QC, founder of the Good Law Project , who is backing legal battles over the legal affairs of Vote Leave and Uber’s tax bill, is to launch a high court action in a bid to have such practices outlawed. The team, which includes Sean Jones QC, who is also acting for Hermes delivery drivers and Tesco shop workers on employment rights cases, is attempting to raise £50,000 via the crowdfunding site CrowdJustice to support the case. Maugham said he believed charging such high fees acted as an “unlawful restraint of trade” as they did not legitimately reflect the cost of the training the companies had provided workers. He said all the contracts signed by those involved in the case levied the same obligation to pay right up until the last day of their two-year commitment. “We say this type of clause looks more like indentured labour than a reasonable balance between the interests of young graduates and these enormous professional services organisations,” Maugham said. He said young people were finding themselves trapped in jobs because of the fear of having to pay fees, causing problems when they needed to move on for family, health or professional reasons. Capita, which provides services ranging from electronic tagging of offenders to store card services for retailers and BBC licence fee collection, demands up to £13,000 from graduates who try to leave before completing their training and two years of work. Until last year it demanded up to £21,000 from trainees, who do not receive any pay while attending courses that last a few months. The case includes one former Capita trainee, who faced a demand for £18,500 when she left just over a year after completing her training after she made clear she could not take work outside Greater London. The company witheld her final month’s salary after she refused to pay up. A former employee of FDM, a FTSE 250 company that supplies technology professionals and management consultants to companies including Virgin Media, BP and the Home Office, faced a demand for £18,000 after trying to leave a few months after completing his training. One former FDM trainee told the Guardian that he had done unpaid training for two months, which included some general guidance on professional skills, such as how to write emails and make presentations, and followed by some IT training. He was then sent for interviews and placed with a company. “I wasn’t happy in the job but the problem with the contract is there is so much room for manipulation and coercion. The manager knows that you are stuck,” he said. He said the kind of training received by FDM was available online for a few hundred pounds and the training costs levied by the company was “a purely arbitrary fee to stop people leaving”. Tanya de Grunwald, the founder of careers blog Graduate Fog, which first revealed Capita’s four-month unpaid training scheme and has helped put together the case, said: “This grotesque practice needs to die now. No one should have to pay a penalty to leave a job they are unhappy in.” An FDM spokesperson said: “FDM Group’s training programme provides an opportunity for all graduates to gain and build a successful career in IT. “We provide an average of 10 weeks of training which equips trainees with the skills and knowledge and nationally recognised qualifications that are essential for them to become an IT or business consultant, across a number of service areas. “We have a clear and unwavering commitment for all trainees and employees to be treated and compensated fairly and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. Our employees also receive a competitive graduate salary that far exceeds national minimum wage levels.” Capita said it would be responding to a letter regarding potential legal action and declined to comment further."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/may/16/whisky-lovers-may-hit-the-rocks-as-japanese-producer-suntory-runs-dry","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-16T08:00:36Z","webTitle":"Whisky lovers may hit the rocks as Japanese producer runs dry","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/16/whisky-lovers-may-hit-the-rocks-as-japanese-producer-suntory-runs-dry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/16/whisky-lovers-may-hit-the-rocks-as-japanese-producer-suntory-runs-dry","fields":{"headline":"Whisky lovers may hit the rocks as Japanese producer runs dry","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Whisky lovers around the world will have to go without some of their favourite tipples after a major producer in Japan announced it was suspending sales of two prestigious whiskies amid surging demand. Suntory will stop selling its Hakushu 12-year-old single malt next month, according to IT Media, with sales of its Hibiki 17-year-old blend reportedly ending in September. Brian Ashcraft, co-author of Japanese Whisky: the Ultimate Guide to the World’s Most Desirable Spirit, said the imminent disappearance of Hibiki 17 – famously drunk by Bill Murray in Lost in Translation – was particularly “depressing”. “For something like the Hibiki 17, the youngest whisky in that blend is 17 years old, and 17 years ago people weren’t drinking that much Japanese whisky, so Suntory and (rival distillery) Nikka weren’t making much,” he told the Guardian. “Domestically, sales have turned around, but also internationally, especially in newer markets that didn’t really exist before. Unfortunately, increased demand with a scant supply will result in shortages.” The current shortage in Japan can be traced back to the slump in whisky consumption after it peaked in the early 1980s, when salarymen knocked back blended versions of the drink as highballs or watered down, mizuwari-style. That prompted distillers to reduce production – a decision that has left them short of aged whiskies today, according to George Koutsakis, a Japanese whisky specialist. Not even dramatic rises in the prices of aged Japanese whiskies has managed to dent demand, Koutsakis wrote on the Forbes website. “Bottles are bought up no matter how high the retail markup. With demand at an all-time high, several online retailers have even created ballots for extremely rare, well-aged releases.” Global interest in Japan’s “water of life” began about a decade ago when the country’s single malts and premium blends started outperforming Scottish whiskies in international competitions. Domestic demand surged in 2014, after the man acclaimed as the father of Japanese whisky, Masataka Taketsuru, and his Scottish wife, Rita Cowan, were the subjects of a popular daytime TV drama broadcast by NHK. The boom in inward-bound tourism has only added to pressure on major Japanese distillers, which are increasing production and capacity to meet future demand. Given that whiskies with age statements require maturation, Ashcraft speculated it could be “years until certain releases become widely available again”. But he was confident that the current shortage would do little harm to Japanese whisky’s global reputation, given that other high-quality labels are still widely available. “While Suntory and Nikka are experiencing shortages, a handful of newer distilleries have started distilling in Japan,” he said. “Their whiskies might be young, but they’re taking creative approaches that will, no doubt, help further define Japanese whisky.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/may/25/a-cycle-of-family-breakdown-i-asked-for-help-i-was-judged-and-my-kids-were-taken","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-24T18:00:27Z","webTitle":"A cycle of family breakdown: 'I asked for help … I was judged and my kids were taken'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/may/25/a-cycle-of-family-breakdown-i-asked-for-help-i-was-judged-and-my-kids-were-taken","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/may/25/a-cycle-of-family-breakdown-i-asked-for-help-i-was-judged-and-my-kids-were-taken","fields":{"headline":"A cycle of family breakdown: 'I asked for help … I was judged and my kids were taken'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"In the kitchen of her new home – hopefully the last one she’ll ever need to find – Helen is looking back over the years of “living hell” she spent in the NSW child protection system, first as a child and then as a mother. Helen’s four children were taken away from her, one by one, the youngest at 15 months. The children were placed in a series of different care arrangements, some with extended paternal family, some with foster carers, none together. One of her children, now 19, was “gone” for seven years; the baby was three and a half when Helen finally had parental responsibility returned by the family court. This social housing townhouse is a new start, the first time in years she’s had a stable place to live. Helen has arrived here the hard way, and knows how close she came to giving up. “If I had taken my own life, who was going to get them kids back together?” she says. “I was the only one who had the power to get those siblings back to one unit. Knowing that, as hard as it was, is what kept me alive. “They’d already been damaged – who was I to damage them even more and show them they weren’t fighting for? They were worth everything I went through, and I’d go through it all again just to have them home.” Helen and her partner had been taking and selling drugs. But she’d also been dealing with having been sexually abused as a child. She’d been in out of home care for a time as a youngster, and been through the court system as a kid for theft. “Something happened to me when I was 25,” she says. “Something that was going to be a secret for the rest of my life somehow came out, chewed me up and spat me out. I asked for help. I was dealing with things not in the right way, with a lot of memories coming back from my childhood, so I was judged and my kids were taken. “Anger, sadness and pain consumed my life for 26 years. I’m still judged to this day. I’m my own biggest judgment. “Noah was in care for seven years. My baby in care, Tyson – he was taken when he was 15 months – so Tyson would have been there just over two years. He was the quickest ... child I’ve ever gotten back.” Helen credits Grandmothers Against Removal (GMAR) with having her children returned. Her mum, Hazel Collins, was one of its founders. She helped set it up after Tyson was taken away and placed in out-of-home care. Collins couldn’t understand why she hadn’t been given the chance to care for her grandchildren, and she found there were many other Aboriginal grandmothers in the same situation. Since GMAR formed in 2014 it’s had a big impact on the child protection system in NSW, and similar groups are being formed in other states. “If GMAR hadn’t been formed when I lost my last baby, I wouldn’t have got my kids back to this day,” says Helen. “It wouldn’t matter what I’ve done, how far I’ve come. The 360 we do on our lives does not matter.” Helen’s life experience is pretty common in the child protection system: childhood trauma, often undisclosed, followed by addiction, family breakdown and trauma, which is passed on to the next generation in a continuous cycle. Helen says she did ask the family and community services department (Facs) for help, but its solution was not about keeping the family together. “There’s nothing, there’s no support structure, no policy, nothing where they have a support around mum and the kids,” she says. “They take our kids. They’re mad on doing these affidavits. They get into court real fast, and what they put in there about us … no one’s going to give a kid back to that person. “They’ve got your kids, so then they want meetings. And I didn’t know you needed a solicitor. So I was going to these meetings at this big round table. You’ve got all these people sitting there, and they’re all having their say about you. And you’re sitting there. If you get angry they say you’re mentally unstable or aggressive. You can’t defend yourself and you’ve just gotta wear it. It’s failure from word go. I wouldn’t have my kids back if it wasn’t for GMAR.” Helen believes families need early intervention, and a more streamlined way to seek help. When she disclosed that she’d been sexually abused as a child, she found it really difficult to seek help when Facs held so much power over her family’s life. “It was suggested I see a sexual assault counsellor,” she says. “I was very scared to do it; I was worried they might take the kids if [the counsellor] told them anything … It was scary, not a normal world to us. I didn’t know what they wanted. “Some parents don’t get to prove and show their kids that the department was wrong about them because they’re too damaged to show. Drugs take over people, alcohol takes over people. So many people aren’t as lucky as I am, and I’m just one determined person. “But it’s been shown that we can have a voice. As embarrassing as it is for me to admit about the drug use, about the drinking, about the prison, the whole lot – well, who’s anyone to judge? We’re not bad people. I’m living proof of that. And I just hope I show others that we can do it. Just don’t give up. Don’t let them beat us.” Her kids saved her life: “I never gave up, as much as I’d relapse and it’d beat me down, I keep coming back. “I’m trying my hardest, for everyone else to break that cycle. As hard as it is, we can. “Because how do you live without them? How do you sleep at night when your baby could be crying for you? Nobody’s kissing that baby. When that baby’s sick, who’s consoling them? “They aren’t given the love and affection that would come from us. Doesn’t matter if they’re with the best person in the world it’s not coming from us. And what a child craves and a child needs, is what comes from a parent. No one can fill that void. “Anger, sadness and pain consumed my life for 26 years. I’m still judged to this day.

Bowen used the opportunity afforded by a budget reply speech at the National Press Club to declare on Wednesday that Morrison was using the treasury as “a crutch to support government policies”. “There is a pattern of this treasurer commissioning treasury work, releasing it selectively to some journalists and not releasing the full work for full proper scrutiny,” Bowen said in response to questions after his speech. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon The shadow treasurer said that on at least one occasion Morrison’s office had claimed to have Treasury material when it turned out the work had been carried out in his ministerial office. Bowen appeared to be referring to an example in August last year in which News Corp tabloids published stories claiming “new modelling” from the parliamentary budget office and treasury showed Labor’s policies would increase the tax burden on Australian households by more than $100bn. The PBO promptly corrected the public record, saying it wasn’t involved in the analysis. Morrison later acknowledged the figures were not from new PBO modelling but were an extrapolation from work conducted in the previous year. Bowen said the conduct amounted to “a politicisation of the treasury, which is not on”. He said if Labor won the next federal election, he intended to pursue a “productive, professional working relationship with the Treasury, and I will not be engaging in the politicisation of the treasury like this treasurer has – used it as a crutch to support government policies”. The shadow treasurer used Wednesday’s speech to signal Labor would return the budget to balance in the same year as the Turnbull government before delivering larger surpluses over the forward estimates and the medium term in an effort to build a buffer against a potential global economic shock. Bowen also indicated Labor would increase the top marginal tax rate, reinstating a deficit levy the Turnbull government scrapped last year, and maintaining that position until the budget returned to a “sustainable surplus”. He didn’t define a specific number at which the surplus would be considered sustainable, but he said it would need to be more than 0.1% of GDP. The shadow treasurer also demanded the government release a new review of the GST distribution arrangements by the productivity commission so that voters can understand the consequences of any change on state and territory finances ahead of the looming super Saturday of byelections triggered by the high court’s decision last week in the Katy Gallagher case. “There is no excuse not to release it,” Bowen said. “I don’t expect him to release it on the day he got it. Fair enough. Take it home and read it. But then share it with the rest of us. “It doesn’t need weeks. It should be released this week.” Bowen also continued to call on the government to split the legislation for its $140bn in personal income tax cuts. Labor has signalled it will support the proposed tax cuts for low- and middle-income earners, but is continuing to hold out on stages two and three of the government’s plan which delivers benefits for high income earners. Morrison, who is on a roadshow selling the budget as the major parties prepare their campaigns of the super Saturday of byelections, was underwhelmed by Bowen’s press club pitch. “Their promises and pledges on balancing the books are unbelievable,” the treasurer said. “We’ve seen this movie before with Wayne Swan and his four magical surpluses he said he would deliver and never did – this is Wayne’s World two.” Guardian Australia has sought a response from the treasurer on Bowen’s argument about politicisation of the Treasury."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/18/michael-cohen-washington-fixers-bad-name","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-18T10:00:56Z","webTitle":"Michael Cohen is giving Washington fixers a bad name | Jill Abramson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/18/michael-cohen-washington-fixers-bad-name","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/may/18/michael-cohen-washington-fixers-bad-name","fields":{"headline":"Michael Cohen is giving Washington fixers a bad name","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Michael Cohen has pulled off the seemingly impossible. He has actually sullied the meaning of the term Washington fixer. I wasn’t the slightest bit surprised to see the sobriquet in a recent New York Times headline above a front-page story earlier this month: “How Michael Cohen, Trump’s Fixer, Built A Shadowy Business Empire”. For much of my career in journalism, I’ve specialized in covering Washington fixers, the lawyers, lobbyists and consultants who earn huge fees by selling their access to the powerful. I’ve watched presidents, from Jimmy Carter to Ronald Reagan to Bill Clinton, bring along their personal lawyers from back home to Washington, where these lawyers – the fixers – rotate through the capital’s infamous revolving door and earn millions opening doors to the rulers they once served. While prostitution may be the oldest profession in much of the western world, in Washington the oldest profession is another form of prostitution: influence peddling. I thought I had seen it all. One of Clinton’s lawyer pals from Arkansas, Webster Hubbell, followed him to the White House and a high post in the justice department, but then wound up in the slammer for overbilling law clients. Edwin Meese, Reagan’s consigliere in California, followed him to the White House and then became attorney general but got into ethical hot water during the Iran-Contra scandal. There were howls of protest when Jimmy Carter nominated his pal from back home in Georgia, Griffin Bell, to be attorney general. But Bell was sensitive to the criticism that he was too cozy with the president and actually publicly posted all of his communications and meetings with the executive branch each day. After leaving public office, these men were all paid by private clients to open doors in Washington. That’s what fixers are for, after all. And this is why so many former public officials remain in Washington long after their government service and make millions peddling their influence with those still in power. But Cohen, Donald Trump’s fixer, has sullied the fixing trade. Indeed, he skipped the public service part of the traditional fixer’s résumé, failing to win a federal appointment from his faithless client. But that didn’t stop him from signing up blue-chip clients, like AT&amp;T, who wanted favorable treatment from the Trump administration for a pending merger deal. Cohen, a personal injury and real estate lawyer, operated out of various offices around New York. One, pictured in the Times, was a building occupied by a yellow taxi company. Another, far tonier, was next to the boss in the Trump Tower. Courtesy of records revealed by Stormy Daniels’ lawyer, Michael Avenatti, we know that shortly before the election, Cohen set up a shell company with a most excellent name, Essential Consultants. Essential was the vehicle Cohen used to pay Stormy Daniels $130,000 to remain silent about Trump. Essential has been the recipient of some big checks: $1.2m from Novartis Pharmaceuticals and $200,000 from AT&amp;T. A private equity firm called Columbus Nova LLC, which has ties to the Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg, paid around half a million. Cohen reportedly has business dealings with Ukrainian politicians and business leaders. We do not know how all these dots connect, but we do know that Robert Mueller is keenly interested in Paul Manafort’s payments from Ukrainian clients and Russia’s efforts to disrupt the 2016 election and help Trump defeat Hillary Clinton. Normally, I believe in the confidentiality of the lawyer-client relationship and would view the government’s seizing of a lawyer’s private files as overly intrusive. Normally, I wouldn’t see the lawyer for a porn star as the beacon of truth. But these are not, as we must constantly remind ourselves, normal times. Ed Meese had years of public service in California before he joined the Reagan administration. Griffin Bell had been a federal appeals court judge and a partner at Atlanta’s most prestigious law firm, King &amp; Spaulding. Webb Hubbell had been managing partner of the Rose law firm and mayor of Little Rock, Arkansas. These were fixers with real credentials. After combing through thousands of pages of public documents, the Times found that Cohen’s legal work included flipping various real estate holdings for vast profits, ownerships of taxi medallions in New York City worth $250,000 a pop and a stake his uncle’s catering hall business, an establishment frequented, according to the Times, by “Russian and Italian mobsters”. Why would blue-chip companies like AT&amp;T and Novartis retain a lawyer with such sterling credentials? There is only one reason. He was Donald Trump’s longtime personal lawyer. Donald Trump is the first American president to be elected with absolutely no prior government or public service. This is why it is not surprising that none of his fixers, especially Cohen, have any real roots in Washington. But they have the one currency that matters, a phone that still connects them to Trump. But Michael Cohen, like Paul Manafort before him, is now presumably too hot for even the president to handle.

The inspector general of taxation, Ali Noroozi, announced he would review the use of the powers in an attempt to “restore public confidence” in the tax office. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon Noroozi’s probe follows an investigation by Fairfax and the ABC’s Four Corners program, which showed how the heavy-handed use of the powers was causing significant financial hardship to taxpayers and small businesses. The inspector general described the allegations as being of “serious concern”. “The allegations about the ATO’s inappropriate use of garnishee notices is of serious concern and, if not addressed, can affect community confidence in the administration of the tax system,” Noroozi said in a statement. “As the taxation ombudsman, I have a duty to independently investigate these allegations to restore public confidence.” Last month the financial services minister, Kelly O’Dwyer, said she was “deeply concerned” about allegations raised in the ABC’s Four Corners program. She had ordered an investigation by Treasury, and expected the inspector general and the small business ombudsman to cooperate. “The minister has requested a thorough investigation of all allegations raised and the government will be responding once it has had an opportunity to consider that in detail,” a spokesman said at the time. The inspector general investigated debt collection practices at the ATO in 2015. It found the ATO should have regard to taxpayers’ circumstances when recovering debt, and take proportionate action, Noroozi said. He said debt-related issues continued to account for 20% of all complaints to his office. Problems with garnishee notices were among “the top three issues raised”. “Cash flow is the lifeblood of small businesses and, if inappropriately disrupted, can have an unjustified and devastating effect on them,” he said. “My investigation will examine the accuracy of the allegations made, along with themes emerging from complaints to my office, with the aim of finding improvements where necessary and restoring confidence in the system.” An ATO spokeswoman said it would cooperate fully with the investigation. “We note the IGT has announced an investigation into the ATO’s use of garnishee notices and, as always, are committed to cooperating fully throughout the process,” she said. The shadow assistant treasurer, Andrew Leigh, said the government should update the public on the status of the Treasury investigation. “Genuine concerns have been raised and Labor will continue to ensure that a thorough investigation has been conducted,” Leigh said. “Labor also seeks clarification on whether the investigation addressed legitimate concerns that tax office staff have been left struggling as a result of staffing cuts by the Coalition.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/may/16/north-carolina-teachers-strikes-walkout-unions","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-16T11:30:42Z","webTitle":"North Carolina teachers join wave of strikes with one-day walkout","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/may/16/north-carolina-teachers-strikes-walkout-unions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/may/16/north-carolina-teachers-strikes-walkout-unions","fields":{"headline":"North Carolina teachers join wave of strikes with one-day walkout","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Teachers in North Carolina are launching a one-day walkout in the latest in a wave of strikes that have won significant victories across the US – and provided a jolt in the arm of the labor movement. Thousands of teachers and their supporters are set to rally at the state capitol on what will also be the first day of the session for the North Carolina general assembly. The walkout aims to highlight low wages and poorly funded public schools. Since 2009, real wages for teachers have fallen by 9.4% in North Carolina. Following a successful teachers’ strike in West Virginia in March, union organisers in North Carolina began discussing what they could do. Then they watched teachers in several other states go on strike too. “We saw Kentucky, Oklahoma and Arizona, of course, and that momentum that has been building in these ‘right-to-work states’ is inspiring,” said Kristin Beller, a teachers’ union leader in Wake County, North Carolina. It’s a bold move for North Carolina as teachers in in the state lack collective bargaining rights – something they hope helps launch a political movement. The strikes have worked in other states, In Oklahoma, teachers won an average $6,000-dollar raise. In West Virginia, the teachers’ strike won a 5% raise for all state workers. But the North Carolina one-day walkout is likely the final major strike of this school year, as teachers and students prepare to break for summer recess. Union leaders hope that a display of power in North Carolina could help keep momentum as teachers organize throughout the summer. Their successes so far have won plaudits for teachers across America’s labor movement and beyond. “These human shields, as I call them, have been incredibly important because they have changed the subject in a way that we have not been able to do since the recession about the importance of investment in public schools,” said Randi Weingarten, president of the 1.9 million-member American Federation of Teachers. “What has happened is that [the media] has had to report the individual stories of some of the thousands of people that have been in these capitals, and that’s why I call them human shields, because they have been a shield for kids,” said Weingarten. Indeed, teachers have won popular support for their cause, as polls in states where teachers have gone on strike have shown the public is solidly behind them. “These legislators are shaking in their shoes. They know that they are going to be held accountable for what they have given those students,” said Lily Eskelsen García, president of the 3 million-member National Education Association. “We are going to see something big, because everybody is talking about public schools and how that can’t be continued.” But challenges now loom for labor leaders hoping to keep their struggle in the public eye and keep their members organized over the summer. Already, as media attention from the initial strikes fades away, some GOP state legislators are moving back to roll back wages. State legislators in Oklahoma have already repealed taxes on hotel and motels that were passed to pay for teachers’ raises. In Tucson, Arizona, teachers are finding out that due to state funding formulas that they won’t be received the 9% raise that they were promised when they ended their strike. Teachers say that they intend to mobilize and keep a focus on legislators now backtracking on their promises. “We won’t be fooled,” said Garcia. In a potentially powerful show of political force, the two teachers’ unions have recruited a combined 400 teachers to run for office at the state level. The American Federation of Teachers plans to hold a massive convention with over 3,000 teachers starting on 13 July. The focus will be on training members to run for office and rebuilding union structure that has been dilapidated in so many states. Weingarten said she had never been so excited in her entire lifetime in the labor movement as she is now. “I come from New York, and I’ve watched us in New York keep the density [of union members], so I’ve been excited my whole life about the potential of the labor movement,” Weingarten said. “What is exciting is that in places where despair was a strategy, that seems to be pierced and that is huge.” Weingarten said it is now up to the labor movement to build an electoral infrastructure over the summer necessary to create lasting change in the fall. “I think a lot about the Arab spring and I think a lot about Occupy and how you move from this inspiring moment to enduring change,” she said. “And you have to take the next step of electing people who believe in these values.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/may/19/saturdays-best-tv-the-royal-wedding-inspector-montalbano","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-19T05:00:19Z","webTitle":"Saturday’s best TV: The Royal Wedding; Inspector Montalbano","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/may/19/saturdays-best-tv-the-royal-wedding-inspector-montalbano","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/may/19/saturdays-best-tv-the-royal-wedding-inspector-montalbano","fields":{"headline":"Saturday’s best TV: The Royal Wedding; Inspector Montalbano","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Royal Wedding: Prince Harry and Meghan Markle From 9am, BBC One, ITV After months of intense media scrutiny, Haz and Megz get their big day.

James Harrison does. Over six decades, the 81-year-old Australian, donated his exceptional blood 1,100 times. His blood is precious for a critical antibody used in the blood plasma medication called anti-D, given as injections to mothers with a negative blood group whose blood risks attacking their unborn babies. Now he has given his last donation, for fear giving more blood risks damaging his own health. In the UK, the NHS Blood and Transplant service is eager for new donors: although surgeons now use less, by cauterising bleeding, new donors are needed all the time to replace those who get pregnant, become ill or die. Needle-phobic? Amazingly, so was Harrison, but he overcame his fear after receiving a lifesaving blood donation. I have been giving blood for years, partly because my blood group is O-negative, shared by just 7% of the population, which is valuable as the only blood that can be given in an emergency before knowing the recipient’s own blood group. A newborn baby or an accident victim can take an O-negative transfusion. The blood donation service tells me now, with a bank holiday approaching, is a good time to give: air ambulances carry O-negative blood. Other groups urgently needed are African and African-Caribbean donors, since those with sickle cell disease need regular transfusions. Blood from smaller ethnic groups is also in short supply. I like giving blood: an hour, often less, of sublime calm and friendliness in the donation centre at Margaret Street, just off Oxford Circus, with a chatty cup of tea and biscuits. You can feel virtuous with minimal effort – there is a certain cosy smugness among donors, lying with our feet up for the average 15 minutes it takes to extract the blood from your arm. There is no age limit, the average age is 45. Men can give four times a year, women three. It is satisfying to receive a text to say your blood has just been used. The great sociologist Richard Titmuss, in The Gift Relationship, his study of altruism, used the blood-bank service as his prime example – where voluntary donation produces far better results than the US’s private blood market. It was his metaphor for the collective spirit of all public services.

It was often on the menu for dinner when someone else was cooking (next to the chicken wrapped in parma ham for the meat-eaters). It was a great option: a tasty ensemble of vegetables, beans and rice, inexpensive and easy enough for even the most kitchen-shy student to master. So great, in fact, that I thought it deserved a new lease of life as a burger and a comeback as one of the greatest hits of the kitchen. Vegetarian chilli burger with garlic ‘mayo’ It might feel a bit odd to knead the burger mixture with your hands, but it will come together much better than if you use a spoon. If you need to cook some thesome rice first, wash 75g basmati rice under the cold tap until it runs clear, then leave to soak in warm water for 10 minutes. Drain, put in a pan, cover with plenty of cold water and bring to a boil on a medium heat. Turn down the heat, simmer for 10 minutes until tender, then drain and leave in the sieve to cool. Prep 20 min Cook 1 hr Makes 8 1 x 400g tin kidney beans, drained 3 tbsp rapeseed oil 1 red onion, peeled and very finely chopped 300g peppers (ie, about 2), red and green, stems, pith and seeds removed, cut into 1cm dice 3 garlic cloves, peeled and minced 1 ½ tbsp tomato puree 1 tsp hot smoked paprika 1 tsp red chilli powder 1 ½ tsp ground cumin 1¼ tsp salt 200g cooked basmati rice 60g breadcrumbs 8 good-quality burger buns For the garlic ‘mayo’ 200g silken (or very soft) tofu, drained 1 garlic clove, peeled and roughly chopped ¼ tsp salt 2 tsp dijon mustard 1 tbsp lemon juice Lemon zest, to taste 3 tbsp rapeseed oil To serve Gem lettuce Sliced tomatoes Sliced red onion Caramelised onion chutney Put the kidney beans in a bowl and mash with a fork until paste-like (some texture is fine). Heat the oil in a large frying pan on a medium flame, then fry the onions and peppers for 15 minutes, stirring often, until the onions are soft and browning. Add the garlic, cook for two minutes, then add the puree and stir-fry for a minute. Stir in the paprika, chilli, cumin and salt, cook for a couple of minutes more, then mix in the beans. Transfer to a large bowl and leave to cool. Meanwhile, make the “mayo”. Put the drained tofu in a blender with the garlic and blitz to the consistency of cream. Pour into a bowl, stir in the salt, mustard, lemon juice and zest, then slowly whisk in the oil bit by bit, until the mixture thickens. Taste, adjust the salt or lemon if need be, and put in the fridge. When the burger mix is cool enough to handle, add the rice and breadcrumbs to the bowl and knead everything together with clean hands until it all comes together. Divide the mixture into eight and shape into patties: they should be firm enough to hold their shape (if not, add more breadcrumbs). To cook, fire up a barbecue and cook over an indirect heat until pleasingly striped (if cooking indoors, cook for four minutes a side on a hot griddle pan). Assemble the buns with liberal amounts of mayo, lettuce, tomato, onion and chutney, and serve hot.

The unanimous judgment by the Strasbourg court over Anthony Neilson’s play Stitching was welcomed by actors and directors as a victory for artistic freedom. The show has been performed in Britain although it prompted protest walkouts by some of the audience at the Edinburgh festival in 2002. When a Maltese company, Unifaun Theatre Productions, applied for a rating certificate from Malta’s Board for Film and Stage Classification in 2008, it was denied permission to stage the play. The board defended the ban, saying the play was blasphemous, showed contempt for the victims of the Holocaust, portrayed dangerous sexual perversions and referred to the sexual assault of children. Unifaun appealed and the ECHR’s judges on Tuesday ruled that the board’s decision violated article 10 of the European convention on human rights which guarantees freedom of expression. Lawyers for the Unifaun alleged that the board’s classification was based on a total misreading of the work and should not form a legitimate foundation for judging the moral standards of a play. The court awarded the company and four individuals €10,000 in damages and a further €10,000 in legal costs. “Justice has prevailed,” the producer Adrian Buckle told the Times of Malta, adding that the play will now be staged on the island. Malta’s justice and culture minister, Owen Bonnici, tweeted: “I welcome ECHR decision which overturned … #Stitching ban. At the time we were completely against the decision and once in government we radically reformed existing laws to increase artistic freedom, despite criticism from the opposition.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/may/15/buttler-and-bess-are-surprises-in-england-test-squad-as-vince-dropped","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-15T17:51:18Z","webTitle":"Buttler and Bess are surprises in England's Test squad as Vince dropped","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/15/buttler-and-bess-are-surprises-in-england-test-squad-as-vince-dropped","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/may/15/buttler-and-bess-are-surprises-in-england-test-squad-as-vince-dropped","fields":{"headline":"Buttler and Bess are surprises in England's Test squad as Vince dropped","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Jos Buttler has earned his Test recall on the back of his “unique gifts” as a destructive batsman. This was the view from Ed Smith when he named his first squad as England’s national selector and handed an opportunity to the uncapped off-spinner Dom Bess. While the 20-year-old Bess comes in on the back of the broken thumb suffered by his Somerset colleague, Jack Leach, on Monday, it was the decision to bring in Buttler as a specialist No 7 batsman that hogged much of the attention out of the 12 picked for the first of a two-match series against Pakistan at Lord’s on 24 May. The 27-year-old certainly represents a wildcard pick where talent trumps County Championship form, with the last of his 16 caps coming in India 18 months ago, no first-class cricket since last year and the first part of the season spent thrashing five successive half-centuries for Rajasthan Royals in the Indian Premier League. “The panel felt it was the ideal time to reintroduce Jos,” said Smith. “We felt that a player of his unique gifts – what he brings as a destructive batsman, as a competitive presence, as a dynamic athlete, as someone who has leadership skills and is playing with such confidence and flair – this was the right time. The decision has been made eyes wide open.” The starting point for Buttler’s inclusion was actually the promotion of Jonny Bairstow to No 5. While the Yorkshireman retains the gloves ahead of England’s one-day wicketkeeper – Smith cited his ability to perform both roles – it is hoped this will bolster the batting as the captain, Joe Root, returns to No 3 and James Vince misses out. While Mark Stoneman is afforded another chance as Alastair Cook’s opening partner, Vince’s demotion after 13 caps and an average of 24.9 comes despite a match-saving unbeaten 201 for Hampshire against Somerset compiled over eight and a half hours. Smith said: “When you see [Vince] bat well, boy does he look a Test player. However, there’s a bigger picture and this is what I said to him today: his cricketing history throughout his Tests and also levels below, he has not produced the runs he should have done. He has not defined enough matches in a way that a top-order batsman with his ability should.” On Root’s return to No 3 he added: “If you’d asked me, I’d have said I’d love Joe to want to bat there. Independently of that, Joe has said that’s what he wants to do – and I think it’s an excellent move. Joe wants what is best for the team.” The former Test Match Special commentator and Kent batsman went on to state that the door is not closed for Vince or Moeen Ali, who was dropped for the final Test of a harrowing winter both for England and personally, and has been at the IPL since. Instead Bess gets the spinner’s berth, having claimed 63 wickets at 22 apiece in his 16 games to date, albeit with only one of those games coming this season. Smith praised this excellent start to his career, the impression he made when with the England Lions and MCC during the winter and his sparky character. Commenting on the news of his first Test call-up, Bess said: “I was actually in Ikea with my girlfriend. I’ve just got a new house so we were looking for some sofas and I was having an argument with my missus. “I was really gutted for Leachy. He’s worked so hard. Luckily I’m very good mates with him and we work very well together at Somerset.” ECB and Surrey to meet over Hundred concerns The England and Wales Cricket Board has called a meeting with officials at Surrey in a bid to address any ongoing issues with the new 100-ball competition. Colin Graves, the ECB chairman, appeared to threaten the club with the removal of the Oval’s host status during an interview with the Daily Telegraph on Monday in response to perceived sniping about the controversial new format’s rather hapless launch. Richard Gould, the Surrey chief executive, described some of the public reaction to the tournament as “mirthful” over the weekend, prompting Graves to say: “If they don’t want it, fine. But if they do want it, they have to be 100% committed.” Surrey insist they remain determined to make The Hundred a success but, much like the Professional Cricketers’ Association, they are also keen to get more detail and see their questions addressed when they meet with the ECB in the first week of June."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"money/2018/may/16/average-person-will-need-260000-for-retirement-says-report","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-16T05:01:39Z","webTitle":"Average person will need £260,000 for retirement, says report","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/may/16/average-person-will-need-260000-for-retirement-says-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2018/may/16/average-person-will-need-260000-for-retirement-says-report","fields":{"headline":"Average person will need £260,000 for retirement, says report","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The average person will have to save £260,000 over their lifetime to enjoy a basic income in retirement, climbing to £445,000 if they are unable to get on the property ladder, according to a report by a former government pensions minister. In a gloomy assessment of the outlook for today’s millennial generation, Steve Webb said most savers in the government’s auto-enrolment scheme were likely to accumulate only half the target amounts. The report, Will we ever summit the pensions mountain?, from the pensions investment company Royal London, where Webb is director of policy, assumes that the average person will need to generate an income of just over £9,000 a year to top up their state pension at 65. But to achieve that income – with some protection from inflation – the person will have to save £260,000. Worryingly, younger workers who fail to buy their own home and face a lifetime of renting will have to save far more. Royal London said it expected that around one in three retirees would eventually be renting, and would typically need to find £6,554 a year to pay private landlords. This additional costs means they will have to accumulate £445,000 to fund their retirement. “We can no longer assume that we will be mortgage-free homeowners in retirement. For those unable to get on the property ladder during their working life, a large private rental bill needs to be factored in to retirement planning,” said Webb. Data on amounts saved in pension plans is incomplete, with many people having different pots of money while working for different employers over their career, but Webb said the average sum saved into pension pots was around £30,000 to £40,000. Except for a dwindling number of people enjoying final salary pensions, the large majority of private sector workers now have to rely on whatever amounts are saved into their company scheme. Historically low interest rates also mean the income from savings is at rock-bottom lows. “The pension mountain has grown by about 75% in real terms since 2002/03,” said Webb. “This is partly because we are living longer and partly because interest rates are much lower, so a given pension pot generates a smaller income.” In 2002/03, a pension pot of about £150,000 would have delivered a private pension of £9,000 a year through retirement, but the target has jumped to £260,000 today."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"books/2018/may/19/book-clinic-best-escapist-novels","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-19T17:00:35Z","webTitle":"Book clinic: novels to unwind with","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/19/book-clinic-best-escapist-novels","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/may/19/book-clinic-best-escapist-novels","fields":{"headline":"Book clinic: novels to unwind with","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Q: Please can you recommend some escapist novels to help me unwind after a day at work? Software developer, south-east London A; Rachel Joyce, author of The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry and The Music Shop I was never really very into stories about exotic islands and I’m not very good with superheroes either, but there are some novels that have lifted me to a good place when I have felt in a bit of a tough one – and that is surely the best kind of escapism. Top of my list is Tolstoy’s Anna Karenina. Anna is a beautiful, intelligent woman whose passionate affair with the dashing Count Vronsky leads to her ruin. Woven alongside her story is that of Konstantin Dmitrievich Levin (“Kostya “) striving to find contentment and meaning in his life. It is a rich and complex masterpiece: even Levin’s dog has a voice. Abide With Me by Elizabeth Strout is the tale of a good man’s struggles to lead a small town congregation and his young family, when he himself is lost. It’s a shimmering novel about love and loss, faith and hypocrisy and family secrets. In Travels With My Aunt by Graham Greene , Henry Pulling, a retired bank manager, meets his septuagenarian aunt Augusta at his mother’s funeral. She persuades him to travel with her and before he knows it, he’s mixing with war criminals, CIA men, smoking pot, breaking currency regulations and coming alive after a dull suburban life. Finally, Plainsong by Kent Haruf is set in the fictional landscape of Holt County, Colorado, and celebrates a small community doing its best to get by. What you are left with is a sense of the grace and hope of every human life. These are my perfect escapist novels because such is their wisdom and empathy, I believe in them. I hope they work the same magic for you.

She has since been involved in a variety of projects, including collaborations with Cuban pianist Roberto Fonseca, and with fellow Malians Amadou &amp; Mariam and Oumou Sangaré. And now, at last, comes her second solo album. Fenfo – which translates as “something to say” – is a classy affair that demonstrates her impressive musical range while leaving open the question of whether she has yet to substantiate her own distinctive musical identity. The album sees her in powerful voice covering a variety of styles, surrounded by a distinguished band. On her first album, the musicians included Toumani Diabaté, and here the cast includes his kora-playing son Sidiki, along with the French star Matthieu Chedid and that remarkable cellist Vincent Ségal. Her voice is more soulful and expressive than on her debut, and the songs range from cool, melodic Afro-pop to the gently bluesy Mama, the stomping funk of Negue Negue, and the charming acoustic guitar and cello duet that ends the set. It may be aimed at the international crossover market, but even at its most commercial this is an album that succeeds. And the lyrics – mostly in Bambara, with the occasional burst of English – tackle everything from migration to African identity and demands to end the ban on marriages between different ethnic groups. I suspect that Diawara will produce more adventurous work in the future, but this is an entertaining and welcome return. Other world music picks this month Dobet Gnahoré from the Ivory Coast is another charismatic singer-songwriter poised for crossover success. Her new album Miziki (LA Café) is a mostly restrained affair, with her cool, soulful vocals matched against a wash of guitars, electronica and percussion, though the driving title track should allow a demonstration of her celebrated dance skills when she appears at Womad. From Trinidad and Tobago, there’s So Calypso! (Because) from the remarkable Calypso Rose. Now in her late 70s, she follows her award-winning collaboration with Manu Chao two years ago with a set that matches her own compositions against songs that have inspired her, including a powerful treatment of the Nat King Cole lament Calypso Blues, in which a Trinidadian immigrant questions the American dream and longs for home."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2018/may/15/uk-elections-watchdog-calls-for-bigger-fines-for-rule-breaches","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-15T12:57:46Z","webTitle":"UK elections watchdog calls for bigger fines for rule breaches","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/may/15/uk-elections-watchdog-calls-for-bigger-fines-for-rule-breaches","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/may/15/uk-elections-watchdog-calls-for-bigger-fines-for-rule-breaches","fields":{"headline":"UK elections watchdog calls for bigger fines for rule breaches","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The chief executive of the Electoral Commission has told MPs that fines for breaches of election rules should be increased from their current level of £20,000 per offence as part of a wide-ranging drive to reform of laws that have become “old and fragmented”. Claire Bassett told the digital, culture, media and sport select committee that the existing structure of fines meant breaches of the rules were regarded by political actors as “a cost of doing business”. Concern about the state of election law grew after the 2016 EU referendum, and the commission is continuing to investigate whether Vote Leave breached its £7m spending limit by colluding with another pro-Brexit campaign in the weeks before the vote. “I don’t think it is any great secret that our electoral law is old and fragmented. It is something that has developed over the years, and right across the work that we do we struggle with the complexity that creates,” Bassett said. However, she added: “I wouldn’t go so far as to say it is not fit for purpose.” When asked by the committee chair, Damian Collins, to spell out specific examples, Bassett said: “We have repeatedly said that our maximum fine of £20,000 [per offence] is too low.” She did not spell out at what level she thought the maximum should be set. “That is for parliament to decide,” she said. Bassett also said parliament should consider extending the time period during which the spending of groups active in referendum campaigns is regulated. She said the existing window “creates challenges in a referendum setting” because groups could spend money in advance that could not easily be monitored. A week ago it emerged that Leave.EU received more than £12m of campaign services from a company controlled by the donor Arron Banks prior to spending limits taking effect in April 2016. Leave.EU’s referendum spending cap during the regulated period was £700,000. Electoral Commission executives said investigations into spending by the Vote Leave and Leave.EU campaigns were ongoing. Louise Edwards, the head of regulations, said both investigations were progressing very well and would be completed “definitely this year and hopefully by this summer”. Bassett said long-established rules that every printed political communication should specify who paid for it should be extended to digital media, a practice that Facebook has said it will voluntarily adopt around the world. She said the commission had no power to compel social media companies to hand over evidence outside the regulated period before any election, which she said “creates a real challenge”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/brain-flapping/2018/may/15/mental-health-awareness-is-great-but-action-is-essential","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-15T16:00:23Z","webTitle":"Mental health: awareness is great, but action is essential | Dean Burnett","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2018/may/15/mental-health-awareness-is-great-but-action-is-essential","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/brain-flapping/2018/may/15/mental-health-awareness-is-great-but-action-is-essential","fields":{"headline":"Mental health: awareness is great, but action is essential","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"It’s mental health awareness week, 2018. And that’s good. It’s important to be aware of something that affects literally everyone, and that a quarter of the population regularly struggle with. It’s weird that anyone wouldn’t be when you put it in those terms, but that does seem to the case. Perhaps the term is a bit misleading, or not specific enough. It’s not exactly mental health that people need to be made aware of, so much as the fact that mental health can, and regularly does, go wrong. And when someone’s mental health does falter or fail, they should receive the same concern and help that someone with a more obvious “physical” ailment should get, not scorn and stigma, as often happens. This is where awareness helps. If you end up with depression, anxiety, OCD or any other condition, it can be hugely debilitating, often consuming your daily existence. Having someone, be they a family member or total stranger, dismiss it outright or accuse you of “faking it” or similar can only make it worse, compounding the problem. This is how campaigns to raise awareness of the issues can be beneficial. Just like how increased exposure to people of different ethnicities or backgrounds has been shown to reduced feelings of prejudice and suspicion, so increased exposure to, or discussions about, mental health problems and what they mean for those who deal with them can enhance the understanding, or even just the patience, of those who don’t have to. The human brain, powerful as it is, can still be overwhelmed by the complex world we inhabit, so when it comes to creating mental models of how the world works, it operates a general “stick to what you know” policy. As such, things that are different or unfamiliar, especially if they’re confusing and uncertain or introduce an element of perceived threat or danger, are met with suspicion, doubt, dismissal and so on. All are defence mechanisms, in a way; it’s the brain saying “this is NOT how the world is meant to work, so I must dismiss this challenging new information”. But the brain is not that inflexible. Our idea of how the world (and those in it) works is adaptable and ever-updating, based on what we experience in our day-to-day lives. And if those experiences involve people discussing mental health and the issues around it, that’s more likely to become part of how we see the world and so has less chance of unsettling us overall. This is especially important for mental health, as opposed to more physical ailments, because mental health problems often affect people’s minds and understanding rather than their bodies (although there’s copious overlap). Basically, someone experiencing a mental health problem or crisis may not realise this. Many need help and assistance to even accept they have an issue that requires dealing with. And the more there are people around them who are “aware” of mental health problems and how they manifest, the more likely this assistance is. So, yes. Mental health awareness is good. But it’s not an answer in and of itself. And it can actually be detrimental in some circumstances. The main problem is, the human brain is very good at becoming aware of things, but it’s a lot harder for this awareness to lead to changes in behaviour. Abstract concepts and understanding can be useful, but things that cause strong sensory or emotional reactions carry more “weight” as far as our grey matter is concerned. For instance, dieting is hard because although we know the risks of high-calorie foods etc, we like pizza and cake. The sensory pleasure you get from the latter often outweighs the intangible understanding of the former when it comes to deciding what to do and what decisions to make. Cigarette packaging has been emblazoned with images of the ghastly consequences smoking can have for years, and yet smoking is still pretty common. Similarly, having an abstract awareness of mental health issues does not automatically translate to a willingness or ability to do anything about them. Someone may be newly aware of what’s happening when a friend is in the grips of depression, but they could also be aware that helping them is likely to be demanding, stressful and largely unrewarding. The latter could well be what sways their behaviour, compelling them to keep their distance rather than intervene. The point is, raising awareness of mental health is all well and good, but it doesn’t automatically follow that the problems and concerns around mental health will be affected in any appreciable way. Many people are “aware” that their clothes are probably made in sweatshops, or that their elected leaders are corrupt, or that their car is harming the environment, but do little or nothing about these things. The danger essentially lies in people thinking “raising awareness” is sufficient to deal with the issue, whatever it may be. In most cases, it isn’t. And this isn’t ideal. It’s a common complaint, about the people who, following a tragedy, change their profile pic on Facebook, or tweet “thoughts and prayers”, or sign a petition, or what have you. While an action like that may be 100% well intended, all it really achieves is making the individual feel better because they’ve “done something”. A sense of control in the face of unpleasant events in the world is restored: a sense of achievement at getting something “out there”. But in real-world terms, it changes nothing. And people feeling like they’ve done something when they haven’t is counterproductive when it comes to dealing with big, complex problems like mental health, because they’re less likely to feel motivated to do something else. Something that may be genuinely useful. Essentially, mental health awareness is fine, but action is what’s actually needed. Awareness is great for prompting those with issues to seek help, but effectively meaningless if there’s no help available. And with ongoing cuts and shocking provisions to mental health services, that’s where the real problems lie. If mental health awareness can be channelled in to actually dealing with the issues around it, then that would be great. But raising awareness is just the start of the process, not the end. There’s a lot of work that needs doing here. And that’s something we should all be aware of. Dean Burnett discusses these issues further in his new book The Happy Brain and his previous book The Idiot Brain, both available now."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/ng-interactive/2018/may/19/stephen-collins-on-fashion-and-the-royal-wedding-cartoon","type":"interactive","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-19T05:00:19Z","webTitle":"Stephen Collins on fashion and the royal wedding – cartoon","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/ng-interactive/2018/may/19/stephen-collins-on-fashion-and-the-royal-wedding-cartoon","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/ng-interactive/2018/may/19/stephen-collins-on-fashion-and-the-royal-wedding-cartoon","fields":{"headline":"Stephen Collins on fashion and the royal wedding – cartoon","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/15/islamophobia-semantics-word","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-15T13:02:16Z","webTitle":"Islamophobia is real.

Stop the obsession with semantics","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"“Islamophobia is a fiction to shut down debate,” railed Melanie Phillips in The Times. Phillips’ lament was a doubling down of her appearance on BBC Sunday Politics earlier in the week where she dismissed Islamophobia by complaining that “any criticism of the Muslim community is considered Islamophobic”. Others have also challenged the use of the term. Defending his bigotry, the far-right activist Tommy Robinson declared: “I’m not talking about Muslims, I’m talking about Islam.” Once again, we see Islamophobia being dismissed by deploying “straw man” arguments that refer to a shutting down of debate. It is quite astonishing to see this deliberate contortion of Islamophobia to undermine real concerns about bigotry through these semantic games. While writers such as Rod Liddle and Brendan O’Neil are natural bedfellows to Phillips, the unfortunate reality is that even the licence-payer-funded BBC has provided a platform to “debate” the very existence of Islamophobia many times. Yet while Phillips was rightly criticised for her bigotry by Jewish and Muslim groups, well-meaning liberals have been asking about the specific scope of Islamophobia. Such terms rarely are perfect, nor do they necessarily need to be – different wording makes little impact on the average bigot. But let us consider the term “antisemitism”, for example. Literally, it would refer to bigotry against Semites (defined by the Cambridge Dictionary as the Arabs and Jews of the Middle East). However, its meaning is defined and well understood to be bigotry against Jews in particular. Furthermore, the definition goes beyond simple hate and includes antisemitic tropes still commonplace in many sections of our society. If someone were to try to claim that an Arab could not be antisemitic because an Arab is a Semite, they would roundly and rightly be condemned as playing semantic games. Similarly, most people of good faith understand that Islamophobia as a concept or social phenomenon also goes beyond a literalist dictionary definition. The term was first popularised by the Runnymede Trust in a report published in 1997. The term had emerged following the need for a specific word to focus minds and lead to substantive action against growing anti-Muslim prejudice. It was initially defined as “unfounded hostility towards Muslims, and therefore fear or dislike of all or most Muslims” with the “phobia” element based on the common “xenophobia” framework in a similar way to homophobia. From the outset and in that Runnymede report, it has always been made clear that Islamophobia does not encompass disagreement, criticism or even condemnation of Islam. It is complete hogwash to pretend otherwise. Yet, in order to cast doubt on the premise of the term, detractors consistently try to conflate critique of the faith with the broader hostility towards the people of that faith. It must be noted, however, that there are some who hide behind “criticism of Islam” as they attempt to legitimise their bigotry, such as author Douglas Murray’s theory that less Islam is a solution to terrorism. While using the term “Islam”, what that implies is that we need fewer Muslims to keep British shores safe. It is difficult to understand how such a goal could be achieved other than through some form of ethnic cleansing or mass deportation. This is not “criticism of Islam” and falls well within the scope of Islamophobia. In order to placate those bullies wishing to delegitimise claims of Islamophobia, there are some who are now naively providing cover for this type of bigotry by calling for the use of the term “anti-Muslim hatred” instead, seemingly to ensure action against Islamophobia is not derailed by a discussion on definition. However, Islamophobia goes far beyond mere hatred. As the latest Runnymede report states: “Referring only to ‘anti-Muslim hate’ (or even ‘anti-Muslim prejudice and discrimination’) doesn’t fully capture the widespread (or structural) ways racial inequalities persist. It may also get things back to front: prejudicial attitudes about a group develop to justify the economic or political disadvantages experienced by that group.” The fact that 31% of young children think Muslims are taking over England; the fact that 37% of Brits would support a political party that would reduce the number of Muslims in the UK; the fact that Muslim men are 76% less likely to be employed than their white Christian counterparts; and the fact that half the British Muslim population live in the 10% most deprived areas in the UK. None of these can be constrained to hatred alone – but the contributing factors all fit under this broader umbrella of Islamophobia. Furthermore, Islamophobia as a term has become well established with this broader meaning of anti-Muslim racism. Its usage spans across the globe beyond academics and researchers, to mainstream communities, police and media, including our own prime minister, all of whom understand what the term means. Islamophobia is real, normalised in many sections of our society and appears to be on the rise in all its forms. Rather than delegitimising the term, we should call out if it is misused and more importantly, push our government to do something about it. In the end, the idea that those who engage in Islamophobia or deny its existence should be driving our word choice is ludicrous, and changing the term will not stop their bigotry. For those obsessed with the word, it appears they care far more about semantics than real-world hatred, violence and racism. They seem to think words can hide their own blatant bigotry. They can’t.

It was directly as a result of her enthusiasm and personal pressure on the then prime minister, Tony Blair, that the UK first mounted its bid and then subsequently won the competition to stage the event. As an MP in the House of Commons, Jowell was best known as the unfailing cheerleader for Blair’s leadership of New Labour: “The ultimate sensible loyalist”, as he described her in his memoirs. After the unexpected death of John Smith in May 1994, Jowell was one of the first Labour MPs to assert Blair’s claim to inherit the Labour leadership. Her steadfast support thereafter was rewarded with her uninterrupted tenure of a seat on the party’s frontbench for the next 18 years. “She is a great person, Tessa, just a gem,” wrote Blair. “She represents the best of political loyalty, which at its best isn’t blind, but thoroughly considered.” She nonetheless spoke her mind to the prime minister, notably over the Olympics. She upbraided him for having doubts about making a bid: “Of course we may not win,” she told him, “but at least we will have had the courage to try.” She was also one of those close to him who persuaded him not to stand down in 2004. Although she later tried to deny it, Jowell did once say of Blair in an interview: “I would jump in front of a bus to save him.” Jowell had been elected to the Commons as MP for Dulwich (later Dulwich and West Norwood), in 1992, only two years before Blair’s election as leader, but she had previously acquired 15 years of political expertise as a Labour councillor. She had also made a number of important social and political connections, moving as she did in a circle of increasingly influential Labour supporters, many of whom shared her belief in the need for a party shakeup. It was this emphasis on a new-look, modern Labour party that coalesced around Blair’s bid for the leadership and Jowell, who knew how to handle the media as well as the woman in the street, was in the vanguard. Blair recognised both her competence and the useful potential of her likeable personality. She exuded cheerfulness and gave even those she had only just met the sense of being one of her old friends. In consequence, in the course of her career she was handed some of the most testing social policy briefs in government, including dealing with broadcasting policy, licensing hours, gambling laws, equality legislation, tobacco advertising, the nation’s diet and the Queen’s golden jubilee. Her reputation as a “people politician” with the common touch led to her being given ministerial responsibility for helping the families of British victims of the 2001 attacks on the New York World Trade Center and in 2005 for those caught up in the July terrorist attacks on the London transport system. Her apparent straightforwardness – which disguised a sharp respect for political pragmatism – her genuine commitment to social justice and, above all, her demonstrated reliability to stick to the New Labour message in all circumstances, guaranteed her swift early promotion. She became known in the media, partly because of her government responsibilities for a range of domestic issues, as New Labour’s very own nanny. Unusually, in 1996 she had been confirmed as an adult into the Church of England. Peter Mandelson is godfather to one of her children. She did not escape controversy, but it didn’t happen because of her own lack of political skill. In the first instance she was embroiled in an early scandal of Blair’s new administration in 1997 when, as minister of state with responsibility for public health, she had to justify seeking to exempt Formula One motor racing from the proposed ban on tobacco advertising, having previously described herself as the “scourge” of the tobacco industry. It then emerged that the Formula One boss, Bernie Ecclestone, had made a donation of £1m to the Labour party’s recent election campaign and that Jowell’s husband, David Mills, had business links with one of the racing teams. There was no impropriety in the family connection, but Blair had to apologise for the government’s mishandling of the affair and promised to return the political donation from Ecclestone. More personally embarrassing was the later revelation that her husband, a millionaire tax lawyer, had accepted a gift of £350,000 from the disgraced former Italian prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, in exchange for allegedly giving false testimony in two trials. The couple separated in 2006, a move suspected by some as designed to save Jowell’s cabinet job. Mills was given a four-and-a-half-year jail sentence by the Italian courts in 2009, against which he appealed, but the sentence was overturned for technical reasons in 2010. The couple were reconciled in 2012. Tessa was the oldest of three children of Kenneth Palmer, a doctor, and his wife, Rosemary Douglas, a radiologist and an artist. Tessa was born in London but the family moved to Aberdeen when she was five and she was educated at the city’s St Margaret’s school for girls and the University of Aberdeen, where she studied general arts, sociology and psychology. She then did a further degree in social administration at Edinburgh University before moving to London, working as a childcare officer in Lambeth and then qualifying as a psychiatric social worker at Goldsmiths College, University of London. She worked at the Maudsley hospital from 1972 to 1974, then switched to the voluntary sector as assistant director of the mental health charity Mind until 1986. For the next four years she was director of a community care special action project in Birmingham. From 1990 until her election to parliament she worked for the Joseph Rowntree Foundation and was a senior visiting fellow at the health and social care charity the King’s Fund. She had joined the Labour party when she was 22, in 1969, jokingly attributing her interest in politics to her enthusiasm for the Stanley Kubrick film Spartacus. In 1971, she was elected to Camden council in London and within two years was chairing the social services committee. Later in her council career, from 1984 to 1986, she chaired the social services committee of the powerful Association of Metropolitan Authorities. In 1970, she had married the social scientist Roger Jowell, who was also a Camden councillor, but she then met and fell in love with Mills. They married in 1979. Tessa Jowell was picked as the Labour candidate in Ilford North to defend the party’s very narrow majority in what proved to be a key byelection in 1978, caused by the death of the sitting MP. It was a bitterly contested election, fought in difficult circumstances and the revelation of her domestic circumstances in the course of the campaign was an added and unwelcome distraction. Vivian Bendall won the seat for the Conservatives and the following year increased his majority over Jowell in the general election. During the 1980s, Jowell failed to secure selection as the Labour candidate for Bermondsey and for Hampstead and Highgate, but was selected for Dulwich in 1990. Jowell’s professional life had provided her with a considerable record of hands-on experience, which she would later bring to her government jobs at the Department of Health from 1997 to 1999 and, from 1999 to 2001, as minister of state with responsibility for women and as minister for employment, welfare to work and equal opportunities. She introduced health targets, maternity and paternity leave and the Sure Start initiative for improved childcare. “I moved from social care to government because it’s only in government that you can provide the big solutions,” she explained once. She was promoted to the cabinet as culture secretary in 2001, with the Olympics added as a special responsibility in 2005. Her period in the department was marked by much public debate about the future of television, about digital broadcasting and the structure and financing of the BBC. She oversaw the establishment of the media regulator Ofcom. During the phone-hacking scandal, which led to the closure of the News of the World, she revealed that her own phone had been hacked 28 times in early 2006. When Gordon Brown succeeded Blair as prime minister in 2007, he kept Jowell on as Olympics minister, but she was demoted from the cabinet. She was appointed minister of state and given the title paymaster general, but the trajectory of her career path had changed. In Labour’s last year in office before the 2010 election she was given the job of minister for London and she retained her responsibility for both the Olympics and for London until 2012. She stood down as an MP in the 2015 general election in order to campaign to win selection as Labour’s candidate for the post of London Mayor, a post for which she fought with characteristic energy and for which she was early favourite. She lost to Sadiq Khan, then MP for Tooting, who proposed a more radical agenda and comfortably won the selection in all three categories of the party’s electoral college. Jowell was made a member of the Privy Council in 1998 and a dame in 2012. She joined the House of Lords in 2015 and took up a number of academic appointments, including that of a senior fellow at the Institute of Government and a further senior fellowship at the School of Public Health at Harvard University. Jowell announced she had brain cancer last September and later vowed to find ways to make “better, longer lives for people with cancer”. In January, she received a standing ovation – breaking parliamentary protocol – in the House of Lords after giving a moving speech about her cancer in which she urged peers to support an international initiative to share resources, research and new treatments. Jowell’s speech led to a meeting in February with ministers, cancer campaigners and charities where some of her objectives such as measuring improvements in the quality of life lived with cancer were agreed. And she was hailed as an inspiration during a debate in parliament, when she came to the House of Commons to meet the health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, and his Labour shadow, Jon Ashworth, in her campaign for better support and access and more research to clinical trials for brain cancer patients. She is survived by her husband, their two children, Jessie and Matthew, and three step-daughters. • Tessa Jane Helen Douglas Jowell, Lady Jowell, politician, born 17 September 1947; died 12 May 2018 • This article was amended on 14 May 2018.

A draft report from the Department of Environment recommends that the clearing at Kingvale station on Cape York, which was authorised under the former Newman state government 2014, should be permitted to go ahead with conditions. This is despite the report finding that there were endangered species on the land to be cleared, and the government’s own consulting scientist warning that it would likely increase sediment runoff. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon The land is in the Normanby catchment and the river system flows into Princess Charlotte Bay, an untouched tidal wetland that has large seagrass beds, an important part of the reef ecosystem. Advice from the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, referred to in the report, warned “increases in sedimentation and nutrients may result in loss of biodiversity by promoting algae growth and reducing the light availability for coral, seagrass, and benthic organisms, which may result in detrimental impacts to the marine ecosystem.” The report by Dr Jeff Shellberg advised that the increase would come from a variety of cumulative sources on site: sheet erosion, rill and gully erosion, bank erosion, road and fence erosion, and possible sub-surface erosion (piping). He also warned that nutrient and herbicide loads could also increase; and that fine sediment pollution from Kingvale station is likely to be a contributor to poor water quality in the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage area. But another consultant said he thought the risks could be managed by ensuring the land clearing was restricted to areas with a gradient of less than 2%. The draft recommendation imposes conditions including keeping a buffer of vegetation around waterways, maintaining 50% native vegetation ground cover, and building contours to manage water flows during the rainy season. A period for comments ended last week, and the final decision now rests with environment and energy minister, Josh Frydenberg. Environmental groups say it is rare for ministers to overturn departmental decisions. The land clearing had already been authorised by the former Newman government in Queensland, without an environmental impact statement, on the grounds that it would create high value agricultural land. Since the referral, the Turnbull government has announced its $500m rescue package for the reef in this month’s budget, including $201m to deal with water quality. Green groups, including the Australian Conservation Foundation and the Wilderness Society are now lobbying furiously to pursuade Frydenberg to back up the governments spending promises with a refusal of this land-clearing permit. The Wilderness Society’s Queensland campaign manager, Gemma Plesman, said bulldozing the forest could accelerate runoff of sedimentation and nutrients into the Great Barrier Reef’s waters. “Allowing almost 2,000 hectares of native forest to be bulldozed in a catchment that drains into the Great Barrier Reef is incredibly risky. And even the proponents concede there is a range of endangered species on the land they want to clear,” Plesman said. “Over the past four years Queensland has cleared 1m hectares of native vegetation because the former Newman government axed important environment protections. This bulldozing plan is a hangover from this disastrous period and must be rejected by the federal government, she said. But the intervention of the Federal government has been contentious within the Coalition. The former agriculture minister Barnaby Joyce and the minister for resources and Northern Australia, Matt Canavan, both strongly opposed it, arguing that there was no proof the land clearing would damage the reef, and that it was a decision for the Queensland government."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/may/13/their-embryos-were-destroyed-now-they-mourn-the-children-theyll-never-have","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-13T10:00:04Z","webTitle":"Their embryos were destroyed.

Now they mourn the children they’ll never have","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The first time Kate Plants almost lost her fertility was in May, 2015, after learning she had ovarian cancer. Thank God I still have a uterus, she thought, when her left ovary had to be removed. Kate and her husband, Jeremy, had been trying to conceive when she was diagnosed. Thank God I can still get pregnant. The second time Kate Plants almost lost her fertility was in February, 2017, when doctors informed her she had uterine cancer. At the clinic that day, the look of horror on her mother-in-law’s face said it all: this was bad; Kate was in trouble. Driving home, Kate and Jeremy were crying so hard they had to pull over. Three months later, doctors removed her uterus. Thank God we still have our embryos, she thought after the hysterectomy – the couple had frozen five before Kate underwent surgery. For the second time, doctors had saved her life. Kate had no chance of ever becoming pregnant, but she was comforted by the fact that a gestational carrier could carry the baby created by one of the embryos she and Jeremy had safely stored. Then, two months ago, the Plants were told the embryos, along with thousands of others, had been destroyed. And with this news, Kate’s fertility was gone forever. On May 12, a Mother’s Day weekend memorial service at Woodvale Cemetery in Ohio honored the thousands of eggs and embryos that were destroyed when a cryotank at a fertility clinic in Cleveland malfunctioned, affecting nearly 1,000 patients. “What we lost will not be forgotten,” said Jeremy Plants, speaking to a crowd of couples and families standing under umbrellas. For the Plants, the service was a place to put to rest, once and for all, their last chance at having a biological child. The dark sky made for an unusually cold spring day, even for Cleveland. Those gathered huddled close together for warmth, many wiping tears from their eyes. “To the affected families,” Jeremy continued, his voice breaking as he looked into the crowd, “there is a place for you to come, always.” The nondenominational memorial service was organized by Kate Plants with help from Joe Giaimo, director of operations at Woodvale Cemetery. Several local businesses and organizations lent support, donating flowers, paper programs, and an inscribed granite bench that will serve as a permanent memorial. “In memory of the unborn / before I formed you in the womb, I knew you,” part of the bench reads. “Dedicated to the memory of the lost eggs and embryos of 2018.” “These children existed, even if they were the smallest form of children,” Kate Plants said, when asked why she wanted to organize a ceremony. “We’re telling the world that our embryos and eggs mattered.” Rachel Mehl, 40, lost 19 eggs in the storage malfunction. She drove from Pittsburgh to attend Saturday’s ceremony. Mehl had a unilateral mastectomy just two weeks ago. “It’s devastating to think I may never have children,” Mehl said, biting her lip to hold back tears. Halfway through the service, the sky opened and huge raindrops fell on the crowd. A husband pulled his crying wife in close; a grandfather gripped his granddaughter’s hand while she stood quietly, draped in her father’s suit jacket. The affected patients had each received a glass memorial candle and they held them now, the flames flickering in the rain. In the unprecedented storage failure, 4,000 eggs and embryos in the care of University Hospitals Fertility Center were damaged and later rendered nonviable when temperatures inside a liquid nitrogen storage tank rose to critical levels overnight. In an unrelated incident the same day, a cryotank malfunctioned at Pacific Fertility Center in San Francisco, compromising the eggs and embryos of nearly 400 patients. The unexpected temperature fluctuation was likely caused by both human error and equipment failure, University Hospitals has confirmed. The fertility center knew for weeks prior to the incident that its cryotanks, which contained frozen gametes and embryos stored in liquid nitrogen, were both malfunctioning. And a remote alarm system on the tank, designed to notify staff members of changes in temperatures, was turned off. “To lose [embryos] through what looks like human error just feels really unfair,” said Dr Alice Domar, a reproductive psychologist at Boston IVF. “And for the cancer patients, this is just a catastrophe on top of a crisis.” Losing eggs and embryos is a tragic, abstract loss, Domar said, but the memorial service offers a concrete way for the affected patients to come together and grieve. “I am so happy and relieved they’re doing this,” she said. Sierra Mathews, 22, was doing homework when her parents called to read the letter they’d received about the tank malfunction at University Hospitals and the fate of the eggs Sierra had harvested after being diagnosed as a teenager with a rare form of ovarian cancer. The fertility clinic later told Mathews, a junior at Bowling Green State University, that there was less than a 1% chance her eggs were still viable. Like so many women interviewed for this story, Mathews feels devastated that the option of having biological children was taken from her. “I feel like I’m so young and the possibility of not having kids shouldn’t be something I should have to stress and worry about right now,” Mathews said. After the cancer was removed in surgeries, she was left with just part of one ovary; doctors aren’t sure she’ll ever be able to conceive naturally. “I’m trying to finish college, so it’s just hard right now to sit in this limbo stage because I don’t know.” The day before the memorial service, Kate Plants sat cross-legged on the floor of the nursery in the single story mint-chocolate-chip-colored house she shares with Jeremy and their two kittens. “It’s like a sanctuary,” she said, opening and closing the empty drawers of the dresser that used to belong to her mother. “I sit in here and I think about kids.” Kate paused, stroking one of her kittens, Dutch, who had climbed into her lap. “I don’t know what it’s like to see your own flesh and blood walk around and know how fulfilling that is,” she said. The nursery’s empty crib belonged to Kate when she was baby. Raised by a single mother, Kate has wanted children for as long as she can remember. Growing up, she’d pretend to “cook” for her half-sisters, mixing juice and water to serve while they played with dolls. “Part of a woman’s identity is taken away when she can’t have children,” Kate said, reaching for a hat she crocheted for a baby she doesn’t have. The nursery, she says, has come to represent how she and Jeremy feel in the wake of the storage failure: “frozen in time.” “I don’t think I want to admit to myself how badly I want a family.” The mass embryo destruction reveals hidden vulnerabilities about the multi-billion-dollar US fertility industry, which is unevenly regulated. Systems and practices that help clinics safeguard their patients’ stored genetic material and protect against reproductive negligence are voluntary and sometimes ignored. Storage tank failures – an additional, unpriced hazard of fertility preservation – are a chilling reminder that egg and embryo freezing is far from a guarantee, even though many fertility clinics and doctors advertise it as such. Less than 24 hours before the memorial service, University Hospitals asked a judge to dismiss lawsuits filed against the hospital by patients affected by the storage tank failure. Forty-seven lawsuits have been filed against University Hospitals. Accreditation organizations and the Ohio Department of Health are still investigating the incident. The lawsuits will likely be a crucial tipping point as the courts are forced to wade into public policy and parents’ rights relative to embryos. “I’m disgusted beyond words,” said plaintiff Wendy Penniman, 41, in response to University Hospital’s filed motion. “My rage is just beginning.” Despite 11 miscarriages, Wendy, who holds a degree in biochemistry, and her husband Rick had two healthy children after pursuing treatment at University Hospitals. The couple had hoped to use their now-destroyed embryos to give their son and daughter biological siblings. “The audacity of the timing of the filing [on Mother’s Day weekend] is disturbing and shows the real University Hospitals and its attorneys,” Penniman said on Friday. “I’m disgusted they are still allowed to practice reproductive medicine. Where is the accountability?” The lack of oversight when it comes to monitoring fertility clinics, has, as a senior analyst at the American Medical Association put it in a report published in DePaul Journal of Health Care Law, “left a gaping hole for a booming, unregulated market fraught with fraud and abuse.” In a statement to the Guardian, University Hospitals said: “All of us at University Hospitals remain deeply saddened by this event and the impact it has had on our patients and their families. The health and well-being of our patients and others who use our services is our foremost priority. As we conduct our review of the event, we have taken action to improve our operations at the fertility clinic to help ensure an incident of this nature never happens again.” Fertility, we are often led to believe, is something we ought to be controlling and taking charge of. Infertility, then, is in many ways the ultimate loss of control. Grief – like forgiveness, like love – can be slow, hard work. It is a feature of humanity to honor the dead, but rituals sometimes have to take unusual forms. The affected patients who gathered for Saturday’s memorial service cannot bury their destroyed embryos in the ground. Instead, they will carry the potential lives lost deep in their bones. Before the memorial service came together, Kate couldn’t fathom how to process her cancers, her destroyed embryos, the loss of her fertility. Her mind was spinning and her heart empty. How to memorialize and grieve the loss of not just life but of fertility, of so much hope? The women, couples, and families needed a place to go. A space to put to rest any possibility of a biological child. A physical representation of potential life lost. A memorial for something as clinical as reproductive tissue and as monumental as unborn children. When Kate first toured the cemetery, she felt a tiny bit of joy return. The sun was shining, spring in full bloom. Kate took pictures with her iPhone, determined and eager to show the affected patients – a group of people she’d forever feel a kinship with – “there was something good coming for them.” This article was amended on 16 May 2018 to correct two errors: as of 15 May, 47 lawsuits have been filed against University Hospitals, not 170, as we originally said; and no sperm was destroyed, only eggs and embryos."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"football/2018/may/12/mikel-arteta-arsenal-managers-job-interest-max-allegri","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-12T21:31:31Z","webTitle":"Arsenal’s interest in Mikel Arteta grows but Max Allegri still in the frame","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/12/mikel-arteta-arsenal-managers-job-interest-max-allegri","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/12/mikel-arteta-arsenal-managers-job-interest-max-allegri","fields":{"headline":"Arsenal’s interest in Mikel Arteta grows but Max Allegri still in the frame","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Mikel Arteta has emerged as an increasingly strong contender to replace Arsène Wenger as the Arsenal manager, with members of staff at the club expecting him to be offered the job. Arteta, the former Arsenal captain, is building a reputation as a coach at Manchester City but he continues to be much admired by the Emirates chief executive, Ivan Gazidis, who is heading the drive to find Wenger’s successor. Gazidis said on the day Wenger’s departure was confirmed that it would be important to be bold with the choice while he also alluded to how Arsenal had placed their faith in a relatively unknown manager in Wenger in 1996. “When Arsène was appointed, I don’t think he was on many people’s radar screens,” Gazidis said. “We need to be bold in the appointment.” Gazidis remembers Arteta from his five years as an Arsenal player as the consummate professional and he knows the Spaniard from the Basque region would be able to represent the club around the world with dignity and be a convincing lead voice on the technical side. Arteta has learned a good deal under Pep Guardiola at City and would have no qualms about working within the structure Gazidis has put in place at Arsenal, with Raúl Sanllehí – like Guardiola a Catalan – and the German Sven Mislintat in key recruitment positions. On the other hand, were Gazidis to turn to Arteta, it would represent an enormous gamble. When the club appointed Wenger to the infamous “Arsene Who?” headline, he might have been unknown in England but he had won the French league title with Monaco and taken them to the European Cup Winners’ Cup final. Arteta does not have a single game in management to his name. Max Allegri is the other name that figures prominently on Arsenal’s whittled down shortlist but there is concern he could be minded to stay at Juventus for another season to chase his dream of winning the Champions League with the club. Arsenal will push to see whether he can be tempted but Arteta is a realistic option."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"global-development/2018/may/12/ais-sector-crackdown-war-zone-child-abusers","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-12T20:30:40Z","webTitle":"Aid sector urged to crack down on war zone child abusers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/may/12/ais-sector-crackdown-war-zone-child-abusers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2018/may/12/ais-sector-crackdown-war-zone-child-abusers","fields":{"headline":"Aid sector urged to crack down on war zone child abusers","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Sex offenders and paedophiles are travelling to the world’s conflict zones to prey on vulnerable children, the National Crime Agency has warned. Robert Jones, deputy director of the NCA’s child exploitation and online protection command, said offenders were exploiting the chaos of war and areas hit by natural disaster. He urged the aid sector to help make it as difficult as possible for individuals to commit crimes abroad. Jones said: “The challenge of impoverished children being exploited and people going to conflict zones to identify and exploit vulnerability needs a global effort to tackle it. People will identify vulnerability in a conflict zone, or an area hit by natural disaster. It’s a trait of their character that they will almost sniff that vulnerability out and then prey on it.” His comments coincide with calls for the UN to demonstrate leadership on the issue. On Friday a UK delegation travelled to New York to encourage support among UN security council members for the organisation, which has 100,000 uniformed peacekeeping personnel, to implement robust child safeguarding measures. Academics from the University of Reading and the London-based charity Keeping Children Safe have developed a toolkit they say will close a “gap in the UN’s protection agenda” and help safeguard minors from potential exploitation and abuse. Allegations of sexual abuse by UN peacekeepers have emerged in a number of countries in recent years, including the Central African Republic, Haiti and South Sudan, prompting concern over the organisation’s failure to hold those responsible to account. The scandal has also affected the charity sector, with Oxfam accused of concealing the findings of an inquiry into claims that staff used sex workers, possibly underage girls, while delivering aid in Haiti in 2011. The toolkit assesses safeguarding measures, trains staff and makes sure UN staff are aware of the laws in relevant countries. Professor Rosa Freedman, from the School of Law at the University of Reading, said: “Children in parts of the world affected by war, conflict or natural disasters are among the most vulnerable to abuse. We look to the UN, as the global leader, to protect the most vulnerable, and to make safeguarding of children a critical and visible element of all its work. We hope that world leaders will champion our call by tabling a UN resolution on child safeguarding.” Sarah Blakemore, director of Keeping Children Safe, added: “World leaders must take swift and concerted action to ensure organisations protect children from abuse and do all they can to ensure that the perpetrators of these horrific acts are brought to justice.” The NCA’s Jones welcomed the attempts to tighten protective measures in peacekeeping and humanitarian situations, and said that creating a “very strong misconduct regime in the aid sector” would help. He said: “We can prevent activity by making sure the actors involved have been through a vetting process. If they are going into a position of trust, then making sure references have been taken. “The crucial thing is that, if inappropriate behaviour has been detected, [staff] don’t just resign, move or reinvent themselves and travel to the next conflict to do what they have done before.” Jones added that any UK nationals caught abusing children in conflict zones or humanitarian emergencies would face legislation that allows them to be charged in Britain for sex offences committed overseas. The law was used in 2016 to prosecute Richard Huckle, a photographer from Kent, who posed as an English teacher and philanthropist in poor Christian communities in Malaysia to abuse up to 200 babies and children."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/may/12/one-million-students-call-vote-brexit-deal","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-12T19:30:38Z","webTitle":"One million students join calls for vote on Brexit deal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/may/12/one-million-students-call-vote-brexit-deal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/may/12/one-million-students-call-vote-brexit-deal","fields":{"headline":"One million students join calls for vote on Brexit deal","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Student organisations representing almost a million young people studying at UK universities and colleges are today joining forces to demand a referendum on any final Brexit deal, amid growing fears that leaving the EU will have a disastrous effect on their future prospects. Predicting a young people’s revolt over the coming months, student unions – representing 980,000 students at 60 of the country’s leading universities and colleges – are writing to MPs in their areas this weekend, calling on them to back a “people’s vote” before a final Brexit deal can be implemented. Student leaders said last night that they were planning action that would dwarf protests held in 2010 against the coalition government’s plans for student fees, and that they would not rest until they had been granted a say on their futures. They argue in the letter to MPs that there are large numbers of young people – estimated at 1.4 million – who were too young to vote in the June 2016 EU referendum but who are now eligible to do so, and that this group deserves a say. They also insist that promises made by the pro-Brexit groups during the campaign have not been kept and that only now, almost two years on from the narrow Leave vote, are most people beginning to understand what life outside the EU will look like. “Because of all this, we call on our elected leaders to deliver on a people’s vote on the Brexit deal so that young people can once and for all have a say on their futures,” the letter says. Among the university unions that have signed up are those representing students at Birmingham, Durham, Cambridge, Swansea, Leeds Beckett, Lancaster, St Andrews, Liverpool John Moore’s and Westminster. The joint letter and signatories were organised by the campaign group For our Future’s Sake (FFS). Amatey Doku, deputy president of the National Union of Students, said: “When over 120 elected student officers, representing nearly a million young people, call for something with one clear voice, they need to be listened to. Students and young people overwhelmingly voted Remain and cannot see how the government can deliver a Brexit deal that works for them. As an elected representative body of 600 student unions, NUS is calling for a people’s vote on the Brexit deal.” Both prime minister Theresa May and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn have refused to back putting any final deal to the public, insisting that the British people have delivered their verdict and want to leave the EU. But with May’s cabinet split over what form of customs arrangements the UK should propose for the post-Brexit period, and Corbyn facing an internal revolt by Labour MPs and peers – as well as signs of unrest over Brexit within the membership – an increasing number of MPs are coming round to the view that another national vote may be needed. Last night, Melantha Chittenden, the national chair of Labour Students, which has a membership of 30,000, put Corbyn under further pressure, insisting that he had to listen to, and represent, their views. “Students want the Labour party’s policy to reflect their views and that means having a proper debate and vote on Brexit at the Labour party conference this year. “It’s wrong to think students only care about student-specific issues like Erasmus – they care passionately about staying in the customs union and retaining freedom of movement, they understand the rights and protections that the EU affords us all and will do anything to defend that. That’s why young people voted Remain and it’s why we should get a say on the terms of the final deal.” Meanwhile, there were growing signs that some supporters of the grassroots Labour campaign organisation Momentum will push for a shift in party policy on Brexit at the Labour conference in the autumn. Michael Chessum, the former national treasurer of Momentum who is now national organiser of the leftwing anti-Brexit campaign group Another Europe is Possible, told the Observer: “The vast majority of Labour members – and the vast majority of Jeremy supporters – backed Remain in the referendum and haven’t changed their minds.” Chessum said it was wrong for Corbyn supporters to argue that remaining a member of the EU would prevent the party implementing radical leftwing policies such as renationalisation. “The idea that EU rules will prevent us from enacting a radical programme in government is a fiction. There is nothing in our 2017 manifesto that could not be done, or is not already being done, within the EU – and a Corbyn government could lead the charge against state aid rules and liberalisation in the medium term. On the other hand, if we get into government to find a crashed economy, a bonfire of rights and regulations, and a series of trade deals which bind us to the American model, we’ll really struggle to fulfil our promises.” He said he expected “a big push” at the Labour conference for a referendum on the final deal. New polling by Opinium, meanwhile, shows that Labour supporters are in favour of a people’s vote by 69% to 18%. The 18-34 age group support a people’s vote by a margin of 65% to 22%. Overall, 53% of the country supports the public having a vote on any final deal that the government agrees with the EU, compared to just 31% who oppose. This week, cabinet ministers will make a fresh attempt to break the deadlock over the customs arrangements they will propose to the EU as part of the final deal. In a message that signalled her determination to press ahead with a hard Brexit the prime minister said last night that people should trust her to deliver on Brexit. “I will ensure that we take back control of our borders. The public want their own government to decide on the number of people coming into Britain from across the European Union and that is what we are going to do,” May said. “I will ensure that we take back control of our money. We have agreed a settlement with the European Union and the days of vast contributions from taxpayers to the EU budget are coming to an end. “So Brexit means there will be billions of pounds that we used to send to Brussels which we will now be able to spend on domestic priorities, including our National Health Service.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/may/13/observer-sudoku","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-12T23:01:43Z","webTitle":"Observer sudoku","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/13/observer-sudoku","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/13/observer-sudoku","fields":{"headline":"Observer sudoku","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Click here to access the print version Fill the grid so that every row, every column and every 3x3 box contains the numbers 1 to 9.

On Thursday, the attorney general read the prime minister’s statement saying sorry for Britain’s complicity in the abduction of a free man to live through six years of imprisonment and torture at the hands of a dictator, through which we hoped to gain information. His crime? He was the enemy of a murderous regime which realpolitik dictated we temporarily befriend. Mrs May could scarcely have been more abject. “On behalf of her majesty’s government,” she wrote, “I apologise unreservedly… what happened to you is deeply troubling. It is clear that you were subjected to appalling treatment and that you suffered greatly.” She acknowledged implicitly that Britain colluded in systematic torture. Britain was even party to extracting information via the torture process, although the statement stops short of linking the seeking of information with knowledge of torture. “We should have understood much sooner the unacceptable practices of some of our international partners. And we sincerely regret our failures,” May declared. “We shared information about you… we should have done more to reduce the risk that you would be mistreated. We accept this was a failing on our part. “Later, during your detention in Libya, we sought information about and from you. We wrongly missed opportunities to alleviate your plight: this should not have happened.” The dictator was Muammar Gaddafi; the man was the Libyan dissident Abdel Hakim Belhaj and the year was 2004. Tony Blair’s government slipped the whereabouts of Belhaj and his pregnant wife to the CIA, who abducted them and organised their dispatch to Libya. Belhaj’s wife, imprisoned in a nearby cell, could hear his screams; after giving birth she was released to live in Libya under surveillance, never leaving her house. The allegation is that British agents were present at some of the torture sessions, hoping Belhaj could reveal possible links to al-Qaida. Belhaj, hearing the news in Libya, was gracious. After six years, at last “justice has been done… A great society does not torture; does not help others to torture; and, when it makes mistakes, it accepts them and apologises. Britain has made a wrong right today, and set an example for other nations to follow.” Here is hoping. It was because Belhaj refused a financial settlement, insisting on an apology while threatening a court case, that the scale of British involvement has been revealed – secured by the tenacity and skill of the human rights campaign Reprieve, and of Leigh Day, the law firm that represented him; and brilliant journalism from the likes of the Guardian’s Ian Cobain. Hats off to all of them – and to the British legal system that still confers justice, however slow, expensive and hard fought. That is not true of many countries. Yet for all that, Belhaj – and the cause of the rule of law – got lucky. If the Gaddafi regime had not collapsed in 2011, the crucial cache of documents, exposing how MI6 had colluded with both the CIA and the then Libyan secret service, on which the case pivoted, would never have come to light. Thanks here to Human Rights Watch. We would have taken the government’s denials that it was in any way involved, and those in particular from the then foreign secretary, Jack Straw, at face value. Huge issues now confront us. International law and the Geneva conventions ban the use of torture in any circumstance. The moral case is indisputable: it can never be right for one human being to abuse, inflict unbearable pain and abase another. There is also the practical case against torture. It actually undermines neurocognitive mechanisms by putting the brain under intolerable stress: the information that is provided is useless. It is for these moral, practical and international reasons that British law declares that evidence secured under torture is inadmissible – a view backed overwhelmingly by the British public in opinion surveys. Yet Blair, Straw and MI6 contributed to the abduction of Belhaj, an act they should have known might lead to torture. There is an acutely embarrassing fax from Sir Mark Allen, the then head of counter-terrorism at MI6, to Gaddafi’s head of intelligence, welcoming the safe arrival of Belhaj. Blair told his inner circle that he was not going to make the same mistake as Harold Wilson in not siding with the US over Vietnam, and said publicly in 2005 that the rules of the game on human rights had changed. Ken Macdonald, director of public prosecutions at the time, tells me that this attitude “fostered a shift in the moral landscape about our approach to national security. It came from a…wildly exaggerated view of the threat posed by al-Qaida to western nation states – degrading the agencies’ respect for traditional rights.” Yet, by suspending our standards, and turning what should have been an aggressive international policing and security reaction to terror into a “war”, seismic mistakes have been made – colluding in torture; invading a sovereign country, Iraq, on the flimsiest of pretexts; and dissimulating, even lying, about what is going on to the public. Today’s widespread distrust of politicians and the carnage in Iraq and Syria, prompting the refugee crisis that has gifted European politics to the populist right, are rooted in those extraordinary years. We are paying a high price for setting aside our professed belief in the rule of law, human rights and behaving according to moral, even Christian, principles. Straw’s mealy mouthed response was to declare: “I sought to act at all times in a manner which was fully consistent with my legal duties, and with national and international law.” He is not a bad man – but one profoundly compromised. A society, runs a Greek proverb, grows great when old men plant trees in whose shadow they know they will never sit. Straw should plant a tree. He should acknowledge the scale of what went on, that it was wrong and should never be repeated. Only thus is there any way back."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/2018/may/12/premier-league-farewells-final-day-rooney-toure-crouch-shaqiri","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-12T14:25:30Z","webTitle":"Premier League farewells: six players who may say goodbye on the final day","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/12/premier-league-farewells-final-day-rooney-toure-crouch-shaqiri","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/12/premier-league-farewells-final-day-rooney-toure-crouch-shaqiri","fields":{"headline":"Premier League farewells: six players who may say goodbye on the final day","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"It is the end of the Premier League season and inevitably it will be goodbye from some of the game’s big names, whether or not they realise it just yet. Not everyone gets to know when the curtain will fall on a top-flight career; some have everything planned, others are overtaken by events, while a few will rage against the dying of the light by seeking new contracts elsewhere. But when the 27th edition of the Premier League commences in August it is likely one or two familiar faces will be missing. Here are some of the high-profile performers whose Match of the Day days are in danger of drawing to a close – or already have done. whose Match of the Day days are in danger of drawing to a close – or already have done. 1) Yaya Touré (Manchester City) Definitely leaving Manchester City at the moment and hopeful of signing a short contract with another Premier League club in order to see out the last two years of his career in England. Two years is the 34-year-old’s own estimate and he is even advertising the fact that he will be fresh for next season as Ivory Coast will not be competing at the World Cup. Found it difficult to get a look-in with City this season, though not every up-and-coming Premier League side are as well stocked with bright young talent as Pep Guardiola’s City. There is no doubt Touré did the job he was brought in to do in his eight years in Manchester – the club wanted a Champions League winner in their midst to add gravitas and experience to their ambition – and he might yet be picked up by a team looking to boost their Premier League credibility. 2) Wayne Rooney (Everton) Is only halfway through a two-year contract at his boyhood club, but the return to Merseyside has perhaps not gone as well as expected – what exactly was expected? – and one last move to MLS looks increasingly likely. Rooney could have done that a year ago, but when the opportunity to rejoin Everton presented itself he found it impossible to resist. No one can blame him for that, but Everton have changed managers since, and neither Ronald Koeman nor Sam Allardyce found it particularly easy to identify a role for the former Manchester United player. At 32 he should have a couple of years left, though pace is everything in the Premier League and the lesson seems to be that if you are no longer quick enough to play up front you will not necessarily find it any easier to move back to midfield. 3) Xherdan Shaqiri (Stoke City) With a release clause of £12m and a considerable amount of talent, Stoke’s Swiss winger is already attracting attention from a number of Premier League clubs, so this might not be a permanent loss. He could disappear abroad, however. He has already played for Bayern Munich and Inter, so this is the time to acknowledge one of the best left feet in the business. Not everyone’s idea of a team player but at his best he is brilliant to watch and at 26 he still has the potential to shine if a leading side can offer him a regular place. 4) Peter Crouch (Stoke City) Contracted to Stoke until 2019, by which time he will be 38, the well-travelled striker confessed after the Potters were relegated that he did not know what the future held. Because of his age it is hard to see another Premier League destination for one of England’s most easily recognised players, yet he proved surprisingly resilient for Stoke, where he kept coming up with the goals despite advancing years. Crouch is now being linked with Rangers, though so is almost anyone Steven Gerrard has ever played alongside. If Crouch does leave the Premier League, he does so with a proud record of 169 goals and the most headed goals in the competition’s history. 5) Álvaro Morata (Chelsea) Not quite a household name after a single season at Stamford Bridge, though with even Cesc Fàbregas pointing out that Chelsea have not been scoring enough goals it seems the club’s search for an effective replacement for Diego Costa will begin again. The £58m Morata is being linked with Juventus, partly because he played in Turin before joining Real Madrid and partly because he has not exactly embraced English football with both arms, despite scoring 15 goals. Antonio Conte has frequently selected Morata on the bench, but even as an impact substitute he now finds himself in the shadow of Olivier Giroud. 6) Michael Carrick (Manchester United) Hanging up his boots at Manchester United to join the coaching staff, and according to José Mourinho the only player who will need replacing this summer. A reliable midfielder with over 650 Premier League appearances for West Ham, Tottenham and United, Carrick is also the only English player besides Wayne Rooney to achieve all six of the honours possible in club football. Despite Mourinho’s flattering comments about the hole he will leave in the side the 36-year-old has been used extremely sparingly this season, his defensive duties having been largely taken over by Nemanja Matic. Carrick was a midfielder of similar discipline, willing to stay back and protect the back four, and if anything his distribution and ball retention were superior."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/may/12/premier-league-2017-18-fans-verdicts-arsenal-liverpool","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-12T16:21:36Z","webTitle":"Premier League 2017-18 fans’ verdicts part one: Arsenal to Liverpool","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/12/premier-league-2017-18-fans-verdicts-arsenal-liverpool","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/12/premier-league-2017-18-fans-verdicts-arsenal-liverpool","fields":{"headline":"Premier League 2017-18 fans’ verdicts part one: Arsenal to Liverpool","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Arsenal Pre-season prediction 6th; Current position: 6th Having papered over the cracks with cup wins in recent seasons, there was no bridging the chasm between first and sixth this time. Grim away showings illustrated Arsène Wenger’s fading motivational capacity. But at least – after the hopes of a fairytale ending were quashed by Diego Simeone – we had a final bit of Wengerball against Burnley, giving Le Gaffer a fitting send-off at the Grove. All in all, though, 5/10 is about right. Stars/flops There were a few tantalising hints that Aubameyang might deliver. Otherwise the only positives were unexpected goals and assists from Monreal and the fresh blood: Reiss Nelson, Ainsley Maitland-Niles and Konstantinos Mavropanos. The rest went through the motions, while Hector Bellerín and Alex Iwobi went backwards. Summer targets We need a manager who’ll focus on building from the back. One who’ll hopefully prioritise a world-class, dominant presence between the posts, a replacement for Laurent Koscielny (if we haven’t already found one in Mavropanos – Sven Mislintat’s first discovery?) and a dedicated defensive midfielder whose only ambition is to protect and serve. Best and worst away fans The invasion of 20,000 Cologne fans certainly made an impression. Credit also to Burnley for their chorus of “Only one Arsène Wenger” (after chiding us with “You’re only here for the T-shirts”). Moment that made you smile For all the emotion of Arsène’s leaving do, there was huge relief at having been put out of his and our misery. For the first time in two decades, we’re going in to a summer feeling eager anticipation, without a scooby of what it might bring. – Bernard Azulay goonersdiary.co.uk; @GoonerN5 Bournemouth Pre-season prediction 10th; Current position: 12th It’s been a struggle – it feels like some of this squad may have had their last season here. But while it hasn’t been a comfortable ride, Eddie Howe did well to pull the team out of the bottom three, and there were great wins against Arsenal and Chelsea. One of the club’s biggest problems now, though, is keeping up with fans’ expectations. Just staying up is no longer seen as making progress. 6/10 Stars/flops Nathan Aké and Lewis Cook are the two players that really excelled, but Asmir Begovic and Ryan Fraser have had decent seasons, too. As for flops – Jermain Defoe never found his form. Apart for a brief flash against Crystal Palace, he hasn’t looked like he fits in yet with the team. Summer targets There have been lots of rumours about a £12m move for Bristol City striker Bobby Reid – but Howe also has to find some young defenders, even though our own Jack Simpson is ready to step up. In midfield, Chelsea’s Kenedy and Fulham’s Tom Cairney would be on my list. Best and worst away fans The worst were Stoke – they never have anything good to say about any other team, and they really won’t be missed. The best were Liverpool, who do show respect and are keen to talk football. Moment that made you smile Those interview analogies from Carlos Carvalhal were amusing – an improvement on the standard press conference lines. Shame he’s not sticking around. – Peter Bell afcbchimes.blogspot.co.uk; @CherryChimes.co.uk Brighton Pre-season prediction 10th; Current position: 14th A fantastic season. The brilliant group of players that got us promoted gelled with some superb new signings and they all worked their socks off under Chris Hughton, who must be manager of the year. Securing our Premier League status by beating Manchester United in our last home game was a dream come true. 9/10 Stars/flops So many stars … new boys Pascal Gross, Maty Ryan, Davy Pröpper, José Izquierdo and Ezequiel Schelotto. But then our oldies – Bruno, Gaëtan Bong and Glenn Murray – were outstanding, too, as were Lewis Dunk, Shane Duffy and Dale Stephens. Anthony Knockaert, meanwhile, saved it for the last game – he was on fire against United and should take that outstanding display into next season, when hopefully we will see more of Jürgen Locadia. Summer targets We could strengthen, but given the shrewd way the club is run and the success of our under 23s, we have probably got it all covered. And our 22-year-old goalkeeper Christian Walton, on loan at Wigan, won the League One golden glove. Best and worst away fans Everyone loves coming to the Amex. Manchester City fans were the happiest. Crystal Palace were the worst, again. Moment that made you smile We were 2-0 down at Huddersfield, it was snowing, and everyone sang: “If you hate Palace, take off your shoes,” and waved them in the air. – Steph Fincham Observer reader Burnley Pre-season prediction 14th; Current position: 7th It’s been absolutely brilliant – way beyond anything we could have dared hope for. Back in August I was just looking for us to avoid relegation worries, but it went way past that, and now we find ourselves in Europe. Sean Dyche continues to prove himself a tremendous manager for us. His decision in January to sign a new deal was the best news possible. 10/10 Stars/flops It’s always difficult to pick out stars here because it’s all based on team performance. But it would be wrong not to single out Nick Pope and James Tarkowski, who earned deserved England calls. The only possible flops are last summer’s signings Jon Walters and Nahki Wells – but both, particularly Walters, have been held back by injuries. Summer targets I’m sure we’ll have a central defender on the list, and we’ll probably also need another striker. It’s just about adding layers to build up the squad. Best and worst away fans Many have filled the away end and some added to the atmosphere. Manchester United were probably the noisiest. The worst were Swansea – they just didn’t turn up. Moment that made you smile Half-time on the opening day of the season at Chelsea, staring at the big screen showing the scoreline CHELSEA 0 BURNLEY 3. Even then, we couldn’t have known at the time just how good the season was going to be. – Tony Scholes UpTheClarets.com; @UTCdotcom Chelsea Pre-season prediction 2nd; Current position: 5th A frustrating nine months. Relationships have broken down between manager and board, manager and players and, to a degree, manager and fans. Antonio Conte has gone from charming to brooding, stubborn and scowling: it’s all rather familiar. The FA Cup is still up for grabs but, as we know only too well, José Mourinho has a habit of winning cups. Conte sadly doesn’t. 5/10 Stars/flops N’Golo Kanté once again shone, and Olivier Giroud made a difference. Eden Hazard has been inconsistent, though we’d be lost without him, while Álvaro Morata is our outstanding flop. Boy did he flop – dramatically, on to his backside mostly. Sometimes, you just know that the fit isn’t right. Summer targets As good as Giroud has been, we still need a striker – possibly even two. Players who have a firm grip on gravity, ideally. We also need some quality to replace Victor Moses (Davide Zappacosta is not the answer), a younger Cesc Fàbregas and some more steel: as a team we are too lightweight. We need players who are happy to mix it up when necessary – John Terry, Didier Drogba, Diego Costa, Michael Ballack, even Frank Lampard were never bullied. Best and worst away fans Roma were loud and energetic, showing how much grounds in this country have been sterilised. Arsenal were like tourists. Moment that made you smile Giroud’s FA Cup goal against Southampton – like an action scene from Platoon, the Saints players falling in his wake as our new favourite hipster took them out. And David Luiz’s fancy‑dress birthday party also guaranteed a snigger or two. Special mention to Pedro for going as Harley Quinn. Fully admire his “go big or go home” attitude. – Trizia Fiorellino ChelseaSupportersGroup.net Crystal Palace Pre-season prediction 12th; Current position: 11th As everyone knows by now, in mid-October we were on zero wins, seven defeats and zero goals. So to be going into the final day with a chance of a top-half finish is just astonishing. And it’s all happened despite the most crippling injury list ever seen at Palace, our only striker forgetting how to score, and a dire transfer window. What a job Roy Hodgson has done. 8/10 Stars/flops Wilfried Zaha has been the shining light: we didn’t win a game without him. Luka Milivojevic led by example, James Tomkins was a stalwart, and academy product Aaron Wan-Bissaka made a great start. As for flops: three goals from Christian Benteke all season is simply not acceptable, and surely means his departure. And if anyone knows why we signed Erdal Rakip from Benfica on loan in January, I’d love to hear it. Summer targets We’ve already lined up a very good keeper in Vicente Guaita, who joins in July. But strikers, more than one, are an absolute priority. Another winger wouldn’t go amiss either – someone like Michail Antonio or Ademola Lookman. The dream signing would be to bring in Ruben Loftus-Cheek on a permanent transfer. It’s been a pleasure to see him develop into a player who looks destined to board the plane to Russia. Best and worst away fans Huddersfield sang their hearts out, loving the 3-0 massacring they inflicted on us. But Man City gave their side no backing when they were under the cosh. Moment that made you smile Milivojevic giving Benteke the ball to take a late penalty in April when we were 4-0 up against Leicester. It almost brought a tear to the eye. – Chris Waters PalaceTrust.org.uk; @Clapham_Grand Everton Pre-season prediction 6th; Current position: 8th Back in August there was real optimism. With Ronald Koeman in charge from the start and plenty of new signings in, I was confident we’d consolidate this season, make it into the top six and do well in the Europa League. It didn’t quite work out that way. Two months later we were at the wrong end of the league, embarrassed in Europe, and looking for a new manager. David Unsworth came in as caretaker for a few games before the board picked Sam Allardyce – who is comfortably worse than both of them. 2/10 Stars/flops Jordan Pickford has been outstanding in goal, and should, without doubt, be England’s No 1 this summer. New signing Cenk Tosun has done well too, when he’s had some service. Allardyce has to be our top flop – he’s all “me, me, me” and just doesn’t get Everton. Yannick Bolasie, meanwhile, is a circus act. Summer targets Just one: a new manager. Anyone in place of Allardyce. Best and worst away fans The best were Huddersfield, who never stopped singing. Hajduk Split fans were awful. Moment that made you smile Seeing Séamus Coleman return to the side in January after his horrific broken leg. His last-minute sprint when he outpaced two players to get a cross in was wonderful. A marvellous Evertonian. – Steve Jones @BlueKippercom Huddersfield Pre-season prediction 16th; Current position: 16th Shutting out the champions then drawing at Stamford Bridge was quite some way to stay up. It’s the latest in a series of remarkable achievements over the last two years from a club that’s always being written off. David Wagner has given us this brilliant ability to come up with the goods when the chips are down. He’s not only the reason we survived, but he is why we’re here in the first place. Get that man a statue! 10/10 Stars/flops Last year’s play-off hero and demigod Christopher Schindler has been an absolute rock at the back and is one of the most underrated players in the Premier League. It didn’t work out for Scott Malone, though. He tore us apart last season when playing for Fulham, but has looked a long, long way off the level we’re at now. Summer targets If we could get Terence Kongolo on a permanent deal it’d be an absolute coup and solve our left-back problem. We also need serious pace up top and on the wings. Steve Mounié and Laurent Depoitre have been great but both are target men, so our play can get one dimensional. Best and worst away fans Liverpool were very disappointing considering their reputation. West Ham enjoyed thrashing us. “We’re West Ham United, we clap with our hands” in reference to our ‘clappers’ made me chuckle. Moment that made you smile Our FA Cup tie against Manchester United when the VAR system produced wobbly lines for an offside decision … Keep VAR out of our beautiful game. – Alex Taylor @AlexJT27 Leicester Pre-season prediction 7th; Current position: 9th On the surface it looks like a relative success, but our league position belies our quality. I predicted that if we abandoned our style we’d struggle, and Claude Puel’s unpopular revolution has proven that to be true. It’s incredible that, given the dirge we’ve endured this season, we’ve been so comfortable in the table. The bottom half must be truly diabolical … I’ll give it 6/10 for the season; 3/10 for the manager. Stars/flops Jamie Vardy was robbed of the official player of the year award, won by Harry Maguire. Without Vardy’s goals who knows where we’d be now. As for flops: he’ll for ever be our greatest ever captain but Wes Morgan has well and truly entered the twilight of his career. Kasper Schmeichel has also seen a remarkable dip in form. Summer targets Recruitment is crucial for us this year, with Riyad Mahrez surely on his way. The unrelenting push for a new brand of football and an ageing squad means we could do with reinforcing every position on the pitch. Best and worst away fans Newcastle were best, but they played us off the park and Sunderland had just gone down, so they had every reason to be chipper. Southampton were disappointing. Moment that made you smile When the visiting Spurs fans were goading Vardy with crude chants about his wife’s appearance on I’m a Celebrity, only for him to rifle home a beautiful volley. It shut them up mid-sentence. – Chris Whiting TheChrisWhitingShow.wordpress.com; @ChrisRWhiting Liverpool Pre-season prediction 1st; Current position: 4th We’ve had worse. We didn’t quite make the top spot and we need a point today to guarantee a top-four finish – though of course if we do it right in Kiev that won’t matter. This really is Jürgen Klopp’s team now, with all the rollercoaster rides that brings. He has made us a united force, and he gave City a masterclass in tactics away in the Champions League. After today, Kiev here we come! 9/10 Stars/flops No real flops: we’ve improved massively as a unit. Trent Alexander-Arnold has learned fast, Andy Robertson has been phenomenal, Virgil van Dijk looks like he’s played at the back for us for ever and James Milner is revitalised. Sadio Mané is back to his best at just the right time, and I can’t heap high enough praise on Bobby Firmino. Oh, and then there’s Mo Salah. Summer targets I was keen on Roma keeper Alisson until we put seven past him. It’d be great to have another defender on Van Dijk’s level – Toby Alderweireld? And we need more in midfield. Naby Keita is coming but it’d be great if Nice’s Jean Seri joined him. Best and worst away fans The best were all those who don’t whine about our lack of “famous atmosphere”. As ever, usual suspects for worst, but a special mention to Stoke and their fiver-waving antics. Moment that made you smile Hearing the ref’s whistle after what seemed like the hundred and ninety‑eighth minute away to Roma. – Steph Jones Observer reader • Part 2: Manchester City to West Ham"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/may/12/lomachenko-linares-fight-boxing-pound-for-pound","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-13T02:46:33Z","webTitle":"Vasiliy Lomachenko stops Jorge Linares to bolster pound-for-pound credentials","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/12/lomachenko-linares-fight-boxing-pound-for-pound","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/may/12/lomachenko-linares-fight-boxing-pound-for-pound","fields":{"headline":"Vasiliy Lomachenko stops Jorge Linares to bolster pound-for-pound credentials","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The imperious Vasiliy Lomachenko captured the World Boxing Association lightweight title from Jorge Linares in a wildly entertaining scrap on a rainy Saturday night in New York, becoming a world champion in a third weight division in the remarkable and unprecedented span of a dozen professional fights. It’s so often looked easy for the sport’s most technically proficient fighter but Saturday’s outing was anything but. The two-time Olympic gold medalist showed he was indeed human against the bigger, longer champion before him, coming off the floor for the first time in a decade at the end of the sixth round and roaring back for a devastating body-shot knockout in the 10th before a rollicking crowd of 10,429 in the big room at Madison Square Garden, bolstering an already compelling claim for boxing’s pound-for-pound throne. Now the 30-year-old southpaw is a champion in three weight classes in fewer bouts than it took division-spanning icons like Oscar De La Hoya (who needed 23 fights), Floyd Mayweather Jr (34) and Manny Pacquiao (41). The all-time mark in boxing’s sprawling annals had been held by Australia’s Jeff Fenech, who won titles at bantamweight, junior featherweight and featherweight inside 20 fights between 1984 and 1988. Linares (44-4, 27 KOs), three inches taller and a reported 10lbs heavier after rehydrating, appeared to loom even larger over Lomachenko at the opening bell than at Friday’s weigh-in and for once the Ukrainian wasn’t clearly the faster fighter in the ring. The 32-year-old born in Venezuela and based in Las Vegas, a top operator and three-division beltholder far more worthy than the oddsmakers’ 10-1 price against him, took advantage of his opponent’s cautious opening, working in the pocket and scoring in spots as the calculating Lomachenko carefully assessed the challenge before him. Lomachenko needed only two rounds to make the right adjustments and began using feints to move Linares out of position, making him pay with shots from unexpected angles. That left Linares already starting to look disspirited while Lomachenko was only getting started and the crafty veteran, immediately devoid of a plan B, found himself relying on a series of rabbit punches to stem Lomachenko’s ominous tide in the fourth, drawing a warning from the referee and the animated ire of the Ukrianian’s corner. By the fifth Lomachenko appeared in full command, controlling the distance and dictating the action with the same impeccable, balletic footwork that’s made one elite challenger after another quit on their stools rather than absorb another minute of a punishment that’s proven as taxing mentally as physically. He closed the round with an educated four-punch combination, whipping the partisan crowd into hysterics as the bell sounded. The one-way traffic, the sort of creative symphony of jabs, hooks and uppercuts that evoke the bullet-time origins of his initial nickname (‘The Matrix’, since usurped by the equally evocative ‘Hi-Tech’), continued into the sixth but just when it seemed the outcome was a formality, Linares found purchase against the run of play with a compact right hand flush on the jaw that dumped Lomachenko onto the seat of his trunks near the end of the frame. The fight was on. “I relaxed a little bit,” Lomachenko said afterward through a translator of the first knockdown since early in his amateur career more than a decade ago. “He used his speed and he was throwing a lot of counterpunches, but I thought I already did what I what I needed to do. I was wrong and he caught me.” The high-speed chess match continued but now it was Linares who appeared to be winning exchanges with power over precision and he did enough to nick the seventh on dedicated body work. But Lomachenko rallied back in the eighth with pinpoint combinations, including one in the closing minute that opened a cut over the Venezuelan’s left eye. Every time it seemed Lomachenko had solved the puzzle, Linares managed to fire back, including a cracking flurry in the ninth that stopped the stalking Ukrainian in his tracks. But he finally succumbed at 2:08 of the 10th round after Lomachenko bounced a series of punches off Linares’s head before finishing the proceedings with a beautifully timed left hook to the liver almost imperceptible to the naked eye that dropped the champion to the canvas, pumping his right fist in jubilance as he strode clear of the wreckage toward a neutral corner. The fallen champion managed to make it to his feet to narrowly beat the 10-count, but referee Michael Ortega had seen enough and waved it off, resigning Linares to an ennobling defeat, his first in five years, that result notwithstanding will surely improve his stock. “I wasn’t planning at all to (go for the knockout),” said Lomachenko, who connected with 213 of 627 punches (34%) compared to 207 of 739 (28%) for the champion according to CompuBox’s punch statistics. “If you plan for it, sometimes it’s not going to come. “But I was looking for that punch and I was very happy I found it.” It’s a good thing he did. One of the ringside judges had Lomachenko trailing 86-84 at the time of the stoppage, another had him ahead by the same score while the third had it 85-all (as did the Guardian). “Going into this fight, we knew Loma was a huge talent,” said Top Rank supremo Bob Arum, who promotes Lomachenko. “After this fight, we know now that he’s a fighter.” Now Lomachenko is expected to surrender his junior lightweight title and hold steady at 135lbs – a smart move at least for the short term given his uncharacteristic struggles with Linares’s size – and is slated to return to headline a 25 August card at the Forum in Inglewood, California. One likely match would be a lightweight title unification fight against the veteran Ray Beltrán, a Top Rank stablemate, longtime Pacquiao sparring partner and general hard-luck contender who in February finally broke through to capture the vacant WBO strap in his 19th year as a professional. Lomachenko (11-1, 9 KOs), who turned professional after an extraordinary amateur career where he won 396 of 397 fights and Olympic golds at the Beijing and London Games in different weight classes, had already matched the all-time record for fewest bouts to win a world championship when he outclassed Gary Russell Jr for a featherweight title in his third paying fight. He’d then climbed to 130lbs and stopped Rocky Martinez in his seventh outing, setting another record for fewest fights to collect a world title in a second weight class. All four of the junior lightweight challengers he had faced entering Saturday’s fight – elite fighters like Nicholas Walters, Jason Sosa, Miguel Marriaga and Guillermo Rigondeaux – retired between rounds rather than endure further humiliation. Lomachenko’s ledger may be brief but unlike countless professional neophytes holds up to close inspection: the combined record of his 12 opponents, a fraternity that includes no less than eight current or former world champions, is 396-34-13. That includes the split-decision defeat in his second fight to Mexico’s Orlando Salido, a multiple-time world champion across two divisions and one of the sport’s all-time gamers. But Lomachenko is hopeful that Saturday’s rare glimpse of vulnerability will entice boxing’s bigger names into the ring who otherwise might have avoided the formidable challenge of taking on the sport’s best fighter regardless of weight. At least one of them, the unbeaten super lightweight champion Mikey Garcia, has articulated a willingness to come down to 135lbs for the right opportunity and the mere mention of a summit meeting between the pair will no doubt leave fight fans drooling. “That’s what I told to (Top Rank vice president Carl Moretti) right after in the ring: right now it’s going to be much easier for you to get opponents for me because they all see I am also a human being,” he said. “I just made an easier job for my promoter.” On the undercard Ireland’s Michael Conlan won a lopsided unanimous decision over Ibon Larrinaga of Spain to improve to seven wins in seven pro fights, emerging unscathed for next month’s much-anticipated homecoming bout at Belfast’s Odyssey Arena. The two-time Olympian, who earned bronze at the London Games before controversially missing the podium in Rio, won all eight rounds on all three judges’ cards over his overmatched Basque opponent. Already a proven draw in the Garden’s smaller theater, Conlan wore a crowd-pleasing New York Knicks jersey into the ring and delivered on his promise, albeit over limited opposition, scoring a knockdown in the fourth that ignited a still-arriving crowd dotted with broad pockets of Irish fans. “It’s always going to be hard to look good against a guy who is backing up,” Conlan said. “But I’m happy because I was composed and working on things I need to work on. I’ve only had seven pro fights, so this was a good learning experience.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/may/12/ireland-pakistan-test-cricket-day-two-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-12T18:03:37Z","webTitle":"Ireland make flying start in historic first Test before Pakistan fight back","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/12/ireland-pakistan-test-cricket-day-two-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/may/12/ireland-pakistan-test-cricket-day-two-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Ireland make flying start in historic first Test before Pakistan fight back","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Soon after 10am, the Irish players gathered together on the outfield while the chair of selectors, Andrew White, set down a scruffy cardboard box full of handsome new caps. He handed them out one by one, the first to captain William Porterfield, then the rest in alphabetical order, Andy Balbirnie, Ed Joyce, Tyrone Kane, Tim Murtagh, Kevin and Niall O’Brien, Boyd Rankin, Paul Stirling, Stuart Thompson and Gary Wilson. The first Irish Test XI. At least a couple of them started to cry from pride. Then, their coach, Graham Ford, cut them short. “Let’s get moving.” The Irish cricket community is small, but proud and enthusiastic. Over the years a lot of boys and men who love or loved the game have entertained daydreams of playing in a Test match for Ireland. In their minds, it might have looked just like this Saturday. A bright, warm May morning at the pretty little ground, hardly a cloud in the sky, and 5,000 fans in the grandstands, family and friends and team-mates all around and the opposition reeling. This after Porterfield, following Friday’s washout, had won the toss, and became the first captain to choose to bowl in his country’s first Test. Porterfield’s side were stacked with right-arm medium-fast bowlers, his two openers, Murtagh and Rankin, much the best and most experienced of them. The next, Thompson and Kane, have played a handful of first-class games between them, and the last, Kevin O’Brien, is strictly part-time. But Pakistan’s batting line-up was callow, too. They had given a debut to Imam-ul-Haq and Faheem Ashraf, their No3, Haris Sohail has played two Tests before this, and their No5, Babar Azam, 11. The pitch was damp and grassy and Porterfield reckoned Pakistan’s batsmen might be vulnerable. Porterfield was right. They looked nervous from the first ball, which was a slapstick bit of business. Murtagh, ever so tense after the “spine-tingling” cap ceremony, over-pitched so the delivery landed right up by Azhar Ali’s feet. “That first ball is something I’ve been thinking about for a while,” Murtagh said. He’d been telling himself to “bowl a magic ball, bowl a magic ball” and instead “I missed my length by about a yard” so it came out as a floaty yorker. Azhar patted the ball down to the ground, stared at it for a split second, then set off on a quick single. Imam came haring up from the non-striker’s end and as he dived for the line he collided with both the keeper, Niall O’Brien and Kane, who was sprinting in from square-leg. Imam was knocked flat and for a moment it looked like he might be seriously injured. He passed his concussion test though and was back on his feet and batting again five minutes later. As Murtagh said: “The first ball in Test cricket’s probably never taken so long.” In the stands, everyone seemed to know each other, but not what to expect from this Test. The Irish crowd know the game, and love it, so were quick and keen to applaud Imam when he hit the first four, through cover. They were quicker and keener, mind, when Rankin got Azhar out soon after, caught at second slip, and then Murtagh dismissed Imam lbw with the next ball. Murtagh was bowling brilliantly and almost had Asad Shafiq caught at slip later in the over. Porterfield chose this as the moment to make his first change and brought on Kane. A group of his club-mates were watching, unable to believe that their pal, a 23-year-old who has not played so much as a county match, was now a Test cricketer. They seemed every bit as nervous for him as he must have felt himself. Kane started with a no-ball but after that he settled into it well, his second over a maiden. As Porterfield said, he bowled better than his final figures, 18-2-84-0, suggested. As the morning wore on, Pakistan rallied, and Shafiq and Sohail batted through to lunch. The afternoon ebbed and flowed. Thompson found that Test cricket was as easy as whanging the ball down and waiting for the batsmen to play a bad shot. He had Sohail caught in the gully and Sarfraz in the slips. In between, Murtagh got Azam and Rankin did for Shafiq, who was the only man in the top order who settled. Shafiq put together a careful 62 before Rankin switched to bowling short and had him caught at square-leg. At that point Pakistan were 159 for six. But they finished well. Faheem and Shadab Khan rattled their way to half-centuries so by the close they were 268 for six, as Ireland’s fielders flapped at a couple of catches. It had been a long day, the first of many."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/may/12/hayley-turner-victoria-cup-ascot-violence","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-12T18:19:54Z","webTitle":"Ascot violence overshadows Hayley Turner’s Victoria Cup victory","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/12/hayley-turner-victoria-cup-ascot-violence","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/may/12/hayley-turner-victoria-cup-ascot-violence","fields":{"headline":"Ascot violence overshadows Hayley Turner’s Victoria Cup victory","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"For the second consecutive Saturday, fighting broke out at one of Britain’s premier racetracks. An Ascot official confirmed that two groups of men had engaged in a fight inside the main grandstand after the final race. The incident, which was also flagged up on social media by onlookers, followed a week after a 50-person fight at Goodwood that resulted in three people being taken to hospital. Britain’s racecourses are likely to come under unprecedented pressure to show they are taking the subject of antisocial behaviour seriously, with some concerned a reckless pursuit of profit through sales of alcohol is causing a serious problem for the sport. “Unfortunately, there was an incident,” said Ashley Morton-Hunte, the communications manager at Ascot. “Our security staff were on the scene almost immediately. There were two very small head injuries that were treated on the site. “Our aim, always, is to have a safe, secure and enjoyable race day. Following the recent incident at Goodwood, we increased the number of response teams on site and the incident was dealt with quickly. Sadly, an irresponsible minority can impact on the majority. We take all antisocial behaviour seriously. We can and did eject people.” She said only those involved in the fighting had been hurt. Ascot’s estimate, based on CCTV images, is six to eight men were at the core of the fighting but witnesses on social media mentioned larger numbers. It is believed the fight may have been between rival groups of football fans, as those involved were heard singing football-related chants at each other before the outbreak of violence. Fighting was later reported on Ascot high street. Thames Valley police, which had officers outside the track, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A short video posted on Twitter showed a confrontation between two large groups of men inside the grandstand, with blows being exchanged while bar staff looked on from behind a protective screen. Another user posted a picture of a shattered window at the front of the stand with the caption: “im never going to @Ascot again terrified me”. The previous weekend’s fight at Goodwood has yet to result in arrests, despite online footage of an unconscious man being kicked in the head. The Sussex track’s manager said “very clear face shots” of those involved had been handed to the police. The British Horseracing Authority has been content to leave the issue of racegoer behaviour to the tracks but indicated this week it may choose to involve itself, following a series of dismaying incidents at several tracks over the past year. “The BHA has a duty to take into account all relevant facts and matters when issuing [racecourse] licences,” a statement said. “We have already stated we will be carrying out a review of all our licensing procedures later this year, which includes participant and racecourse licences. It is our intention to ensure crowd control and behaviour are considered as part of this review.” The main action on the track concerned Hayley Turner, who won the Victoria Cup with a perfectly timed challenge on the 20-1 shot Ripp Orf. Turner retired in 2015 but returned to the saddle last year, lured by the weight allowance offered to female jockeys in France. She is now trying to resurrect her career in Britain and will surely get plenty of interest after this display. “We’re going to concentrate on trying to get some nicer rides if we can,” said her agent, Shashi Righton. “It’s not easy to get rides when you’re coming out of retirement but she’s got a lot of self-belief and she knows she’s good enough to establish herself again.” “Oh my God, that was amazing,” Turner said on ITV while returning in triumph. “What a legend of a horse. They gave me some good orders, to ride with lots of confidence. The big field suited him, strong gallop. I was just weaving through them.” At Lingfield, Knight To Behold ran away with the Derby Trial and is now a 20-1 shot for the Epsom Classic next month, in which he would be a first runner for the trainer Harry Dunlop. “We’ve loved him from day one, he’s a wonderful mover,” Dunlop said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"technology/2018/may/12/facebook-brexit-russia-unresolved-40-questions","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-12T20:30:40Z","webTitle":"‘We’re waiting for answers’: Facebook, Brexit and 40 questions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/may/12/facebook-brexit-russia-unresolved-40-questions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/may/12/facebook-brexit-russia-unresolved-40-questions","fields":{"headline":"‘We’re waiting for answers’: Facebook, Brexit and 40 questions","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Mike Schroepfer, Facebook’s chief technology officer, was the second executive Facebook offered up to answer questions from parliament’s select committee for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS). He took his place in the hot seat in the wake of the first attendee, Simon Milner, Facebook’s (now ex-) head of policy for Europe, who answered a series of questions about Cambridge Analytica’s non-use of Facebook data that came back to haunt the company in the furore that followed the Observer and New York Times revelations from Christopher Wylie. Schroepfer is Facebook’s nerd-in-chief. He was the tech guy sent to answer a series of questions from MPs about how his platform had facilitated what appeared to be a wholesale assault on Britain’s democracy, and though there was much he couldn’t answer, when he was asked about spending by Russian entities directed at British voters before the referendum, he spoke confidently: “We did look several times at the connections between the IRA [the Kremlin-linked Internet Research Agency] … and the EU referendum and we found $1 of spend. We found almost nothing.” But new evidence released by the United States Congress suggests adverts were targeted at UK Facebook users, and paid for in roubles, in the months preceding the short 10-week period “regulated” by the Electoral Commission but when the long campaigns were already under way. This is the latest episode in a series of miscommunications between the company and British legislators, which has come to a head in the week the Electoral Commission finally published the findings of its investigation into the Leave.EU campaign. Damian Collins, the chair of the DCMS committee, said: “We asked them to look for evidence of Russian influence and they came back and told us something we now know appears misleading. And we’re still waiting for answers to 40 questions that Mike Schroepfer was unable to answer, including if they have any record of any dark ads. “It could be that these adverts are just the tip of the iceberg. It’s just so hard getting any sort of information out of them, and then not knowing if that information is complete.” Preliminary research undertaken by Twitter user Brexitshambles suggests anti-immigrant adverts were targeted at Facebook users in the UK and the US. One – headlined “You’re not the only one to despise immigration”, which cost 4,884 roubles (£58) and received 4,055 views – was placed in January 2016. Another, which accused immigrants of stealing jobs, cost 5,514 roubles and received 14,396 impressions. Organic reach can mean such adverts are seen by a wider audience. Facebook says that it only looked for adverts shown during the officially regulated campaign period. A spokesperson said: “The release of the set of IRA adverts confirms the position we shared with the Electoral Commission and DCMS committee. We did not find evidence of any significant, coordinated activity by the IRA operatives directed towards the Brexit referendum. “This is supported by the release of this data set which shows a significant amount of activity by the IRA with only a handful of their ads listing the UK as a possible audience.” Collins said that the committee was becoming increasingly frustrated by Facebook’s reluctance to answer questions and by founder Mark Zuckerberg’s ongoing refusal to come to the UK to testify. Milner told the committee in February that Cambridge Analytica had no Facebook data and could not have got data from Facebook. The news reinforces MPs’ frustrations with a system that last week many of them were describing as “broken”. On Friday, 15 months after the first Observer article that triggered the Electoral Commission’s investigation into Leave.EU was published, it found the campaign – funded by Arron Banks and endorsed by Nigel Farage – guilty of multiple breaches of electoral law and referred the “responsible person” – its chief executive, Liz Bilney – to the police. Banks described the commission’s report as a “politically motivated attack on Brexit”. Leading academics and MPs called the delay in referring the matter to the police “catastrophic”, with others saying British democracy had failed. Liam Byrne, Labour’s shadow digital minister, described the current situation as “akin to the situation with rotten boroughs” in the 19th century. “It’s at that level. What we’re seeing is a wholesale failure of the entire system. We have 20th-century bodies fighting a 21st-century challenge to our democracy. It’s totally lamentable.” Stephen Kinnock, Labour MP for Aberavon, said it was unacceptable that the Electoral Commission had still not referred the evidence about Vote Leave from Christopher Wylie and Shahmir Sanni – published in the Observer and submitted to the Electoral Commission – to the police. He said: “What they seem to have done, and are continuing to do, is to kick this into the long grass. There seems to be political pressure to kick this down the road until Britain has exited the EU.” He accused the commission of ignoring what he considered key evidence, including about Cambridge Analytica. The commission had found Leave.EU guilty of not declaring work done by its referendum strategist, Goddard Gunster, but said it had found no evidence of work done by Cambridge Analytica. “The whole thing stinks,” Kinnock said. “I wrote to the commission with evidence that the value of work carried out by Cambridge Analytica was around £800,000. The glib way it dismissed the multiple pieces of evidence about the company was extraordinary. I just think it is absolutely not fit for purpose.” Gavin Millar QC, a leading expert in electoral law at Matrix Chambers, said: “Our entire democratic system is vulnerable and wide open to attack. If we allow this kind of money into campaigning on national basis – and the referendum was the paradigm for this – you have to have an organisation with teeth to police it.” Damian Tambini, director of research in the department of media and communications at the London School of Economics, described the whole system as broken and said there was not a single investigatory body that seemed capable of uncovering the truth. “The DCMS Select Committee has found itself in this extraordinary position of, in effect, leading this investigation because it at least has the power to compel witnesses and evidence – something the Electoral Commission can’t do. It’s the classic British solution of muddling through. “The big picture here is it’s possible for an individual or group with lots of money and some expertise to change the course of history and buy an election outcome. And with our regulatory system, we’ll never know if it’s happened.” • This article was amended on 13 May 2018 to clarify that a remark from Damian Tambini referred to the DCMS Select Committee."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/may/12/north-korea-invites-us-media-to-watch-closure-of-nuclear-test-site","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-12T18:08:44Z","webTitle":"North Korea invites world to watch closure of nuclear test site","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/12/north-korea-invites-us-media-to-watch-closure-of-nuclear-test-site","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/12/north-korea-invites-us-media-to-watch-closure-of-nuclear-test-site","fields":{"headline":"North Korea invites world to watch closure of nuclear test site","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"North Korea plans to officially dismantle its nuclear test site later this month at a ceremony attended by foreign media that will pave the way for leader Kim Jong-un’s summit with the US president, Donald Trump. State authorities will put the site out of operation by using explosives to collapse the tunnels used for testing between 23 and 25 May, the foreign ministry said in a statement on the official KCNA website. Above ground North Korea will block all entries to the site, and remove all guard posts, observation sites and research institutes, the report said. Guards and researchers will be withdrawn, and the area shut off. Chinese geologists believe the mountain over the main site was likely to have collapsed after North Korea exploded its largest ever nuclear weapon last year, making it unsafe for further testing and requiring radiation monitoring. But Kim’s move to formally decommission the test site and invite foreign journalists to a highly sensitive military site to observe its shutdown is another gesture of goodwill before the 12 June summit with Trump in Singapore. It comes after the Pyongyang government released three American citizens it had been holding. The men, who Trump had described as hostages, were handed over to newly confirmed secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, on his second trip to the North Korean capital to prepare for the summit. He described his meetings with Kim as substantive and said he had offered US economic help to North Korea if the country gives up its nuclear weapons. Many long-term analysts are sceptical that Kim, who only announced in December that the country’s nuclear forces were completed, will give up such a hard-won prize even for extremely generous aid. The fate of autocrats like Saddam Hussein and Libya’s Muammar Gaddafi, who gave up their weapons programmes only to be toppled in western-backed military actions, has been noted in Pyongyang. Trump’s decision to pull out of the nuclear agreement his predecessor Barack Obama forged with Iran may also give Kim pause for thought about the durability of any deal he makes with a US president. For now, however, Kim appears to be on a diplomatic offensive, offering concessions many thought he would try to use as bargaining chips at the meeting with Trump, including the prisoner release and decommissioning the test site. Foreign journalists will be invited to observe the shutdown of the facility where North Korea has tested several generations of nuclear weapons, “to ensure the transparency of discontinuance of the nuclear test”. “A ceremony for dismantling the nuclear test ground is now scheduled between May 23 and 25, depending on weather condition,” the report said. Correspondents from the United States, Britain, Russia, China and South Korea will be flown in a special charter flight from Beijing to the newly expanded resort town of Wonsan, then take a special train to the remote test site in an “uninhabited deep mountain area” near the northern border. They will sleep and eat on board the train, but a press centre will be set up so they can “transmit … about dismantlement of the test ground which they have covered on the spot”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/may/19/country-diary-permit-walk-in-england-easton-hornstocks-northamptonshire","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-19T04:30:18Z","webTitle":"Country diary: 'I’ve never needed a permit to go for a walk in England before'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/19/country-diary-permit-walk-in-england-easton-hornstocks-northamptonshire","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/may/19/country-diary-permit-walk-in-england-easton-hornstocks-northamptonshire","fields":{"headline":"Country diary: 'I’ve never needed a permit to go for a walk in England before'","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The dawn light astonishes but mostly it’s the smell: sharp, delicate, wild garlic, the last of the bluebells, dewy grass. Dappled light is spilled up the trees and on the ground, and swirls, as the leaves casting it sway, like reflections off water. Silver birch limbs, knotted with birch polypore fungus, lie pale on beds of fat-bladed grass. I find an ornate snail on one. Falling leaf litter. Birdsong. This place quietly seethes with life. I’ve never needed a permit to go for a walk in England before. Easton Hornstocks is an old wood of lime and ash trees close to my home. It’s a national nature reserve, and I had to ask for access. It was easy. Free. I had to carry the permit. No bikes; fine, I don’t own one. No dogs; ditto. But I didn’t know how I felt about the idea. Rankled by the restriction? Or thankful for its sense of privilege? Easton is a village, but Hornstocks is an unfamiliar word, certainly for a wood. There are other odd suffixes to woodland reserves in these parts: Everden Stubbs, Castor Hanglands, Bedford Purlieus. Archaic generics that had fallen obscure in the way that chase or heath hadn’t, maybe. One, purlieu, is a relic of the Forest Law, meaning an agricultural area on the edge of the trees. Forest law was established by William the Conqueror a thousand years ago. In it there were two kinds of offences. Acts against the vert, and the venison. The green, and the game. The restrictions were different. No weapons. A fee to chase (that word). Mastiffs were allowed, but only if their front claws were removed. Easton Hornstocks and the surrounding patches of old woodland – most now reserves – are parts of the old Rockingham Forest that once stretched from Stamford to Northampton. William used it. Then, like most ancient woodland, it was diminished. Now these fragments of an older wild world are under law again, for a different kind of conservation. But, in their rarity, oddly more effective in the parts of the forest that linger. The crisp smell of this one lingers on me long after I leave it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/may/12/angel-face-review-marion-cotillard-is-wasted-in-tabloid-tale-of-boozy-mum-and-mini-me-daughter","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-12T16:16:21Z","webTitle":"Angel Face review – Marion Cotillard is wasted in tabloid tale of boozy mum and mini-me daughter","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/may/12/angel-face-review-marion-cotillard-is-wasted-in-tabloid-tale-of-boozy-mum-and-mini-me-daughter","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/may/12/angel-face-review-marion-cotillard-is-wasted-in-tabloid-tale-of-boozy-mum-and-mini-me-daughter","fields":{"headline":"Angel Face review – Marion Cotillard is wasted in tabloid tale of boozy mum and mini-me daughter","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"“Everything is going to be fine,” thirty-something Marlene likes to tell her eight-year-old daughter Elli. She says it ahead of her drunken wedding and she says it when the ceremony falls apart and then again after she picks up a guy in a nightclub and airily suggests the kid takes a cab home on her own. She repeats the line like a mantra, as though saying it will make it so and is itself proof of motherly love. But everything in Marlene’s life is a long way from fine. The woman’s heading clean off of the rails and worse, it looks as if Elli may not be too far behind. I kept hoping that everything would be fine with Angel Face as well, which is at least stylishly framed and performed with a certain gung-ho intensity by Marion Cotillard as alcoholic Marlene. But it’s apparent early on that Vanessa Filho’s debut picture (which screens here at Cannes in the Un Certain Regard section) has major issues of its own, which it then compounds by turning overheated and shrill, overstaying its welcome and struggling to find the exit door. You could almost hear the frustration mounting among the guests gathered in the gloom of the afternoon screening. Returning home from a night on the tiles, Marlene loves to clamber into bed beside Elli (Ayline Aksoy-Etaix), still sprayed inside her party dress, painting lipstick smears on the pillow. She knows that Elli can be relied on to sing her to sleep and to have set the alarm to ensure she doesn’t lie in too late the next morning. Elli, in other words, is the real mother in this relationship and has grown adept at presenting a front of good cheer whenever social services (which she refers to as “the children police”) come calling. And yet we soon realise that this lifestyle is already eating into the kid like battery acid. When Marlene runs away to spend time with her latest lover, she is left rattling around the empty apartment, necking spirits from the bottle and accepting cash for kisses in the toilet cubicle at school. Initially set up as a soulful, capable saint, Elli appears to be spiralling into the same vortex as her mum. Cotillard has already compiled quite the bulging show-reel playing wild, beautiful messes and she turns on the fireworks here, almost to a fault. Her Marlene is a whirling dervish of bright laughter and pinwheeling bare arms, collapsing into a depressive heap the moment her latest dream of love runs aground. When she’s not insisting that life’s about to be a bed of roses she’s informing Elli that “humanity’s fucked up”, dashing to yank the girl back from the balcony of their seafront apartment. “Are you wanting to jump and end it all?” she shrieks into the kid’s face, although one has the distinct sense she’s largely talking to herself. Filho’s film is never less than heartfelt and strident, like a tale torn from life, or an episode of Jeremy Kyle played as stentorian opera. And this, I suspect, may be part of the problem. Crucially, Angel Face lacks shading, pacing and nuance. Having first delivered a metaphorical series of slaps across Marlene’s upturned painted face, it then finds itself with precious little to do except get drunk on its own misery and start wandering in circles. Elli loves her mother and longs for her to come home. But out in the world, the woman’s regarded as an embarrassment. The cashier at the supermarket regards Marlene with open disgust. The parents outside school simply won’t meet her eye. Such desperate, screeching neediness yawns like a bottomless pit. Midway through the film, it’s hard to stop yourself flinching, too."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/2018/may/12/castleford-st-helens-challenge-cup-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-12T15:59:29Z","webTitle":"Ben Barba masterclass for St Helens sinks Castleford’s cup hopes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/12/castleford-st-helens-challenge-cup-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/may/12/castleford-st-helens-challenge-cup-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Ben Barba masterclass for St Helens sinks Castleford’s cup hopes","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"St Helens will be in the draw for Sunday’s Challenge Cup quarter-final draw and, as they have been so many times this season, the Super League leaders were thankful for an imperious performance from Ben Barba. It has been a decade since St Helens reached Wembley, let alone won the cup. Then, they were in the midst of a three-year run during which they made the Challenge Cup their own under Daniel Anderson. The side Justin Holbrook is building inarguably share many traits with that great side but one obvious difference is the presence of Barba. Irrespective of the misdemeanours which brought Barba to Super League almost a year ago, he is the best player in the competition and that fact was illustrated again. “I’d like to be playing with him, that’s for sure,” Holbrook said of his full-back, who was at the heart of the Saints’ progression to the last eight. He scored a magnificent hat-trick but it was his third and final try which showed the gulf between Barba and the rest as he danced around half of the Castleford side before scoring. Barba was equally influential in creating the tries for Regan Grace and Ryan Morgan that ensured there would be no way back for Castleford. Tries for Jake Trueman, Greg Minikin and, on the hooter, Mike McMeeken, were the least Castleford’s performance merited – but there was only ever likely to be one winner. A year ago, while St Helens were waiting for the arrival of Holbrook from Australia, Castleford dismantled St Helens 53-10 at this very stage of the competition. Now, it is clear the Saints are on a very different path. The Castleford coach, Daryl Powell, said: “I just didn’t think we were quite durable enough. When Saints put the hammer down, they were too strong for us. We gave key penalties away.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/may/12/vegas-golden-knights-leicester-city-best-story","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-12T14:24:41Z","webTitle":"How the Vegas Golden Knights became the most remarkable story in sports","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/12/vegas-golden-knights-leicester-city-best-story","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/may/12/vegas-golden-knights-leicester-city-best-story","fields":{"headline":"How the Vegas Golden Knights became the most remarkable story in sports","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"While attending a wedding full of the Las Vegas elite on Sunday evening, Carolyn Goodman kept losing focus on the bride and the groom. The Mayor of Las Vegas had other things on her mind as the sports world’s most sensational story continued to break new ground: Through the hors d’ouevres and dinner, Goodman kept checking her phone for updates on the Vegas Golden Knights in Game 6 of their second round NHL playoff series against the San Jose Sharks, and tapping the Golden Knights pin she wore on her blouse, over her heart, for good luck. Finally, sometime around when the dancing picked up, Goodman relaxed. The expansion NHL team, featuring a collection of players that had been left unprotected and unwanted by their previous clubs, had shut out the Sharks, 3-0. They were continuing their improbable run to a place many believed was not a long shot, but an impossibility ahead of the season: the Western Conference finals. The NHL wasn’t supposed to work in Las Vegas: The city was part of the nebulous group of “non-traditional hockey markets” and their roster was cobbled together. But it has worked, and it’s now become impossible for both locals and those around the hockey world not to be swept up in the kind of sports story that is on par with the implausible championship won by Leicester City in 2016. “My heart,” said Goodman of the Knights, “is there.” Goodman’s not alone. Sin City has quickly become transformed into a hockey city. Thousands line up outside the T-Mobile Arena on the Strip to watch road games on giant screens. Hockey schools and camps are popping up across the city. A 10-year old Jack Russell terrier has been named after the club’s All-Star goalie, Marc-Andre Fleury. How did this happen? Many balked when Golden Knights owner Bill Foley said the new franchise would win a Stanley Cup by year six. Ahead of their first ever NHL season, the Golden Knights were given the worst odds by oddsmakers in their own city to win the Stanley Cup. They’re now eight wins away from the Cup. The Western Conference finals begin Saturday night. “Everybody’s extremely happy,” said Golden Knights forward Deryk Engelland, “but still not satisfied.” Engelland was a rare bird amongst the expansion team. The Edmonton-born 36-year old has spent his summers in Las Vegas for over a decade and was an integral part of the team’s roster building. He felt an inherent level of civic pride when the city welcomed its first ever team from one of North America’s four major professional sports leagues. It was a horrific tragedy, however, that hastened the connection between the Golden Knights and the city itself. On Sunday 1 October, a gunman opened fire on a crowd at the Route 91 Harvest music festival on the Las Vegas Strip. Fifty-eight people were left dead, along with 851 injured in the deadliest mass shooting in the history of the United States. Immediately, players began texting Engelland: What could they do? How could they help? A $300,000 donation was made from the team to the victims and their families. Players went out into their communities to show their support of first responders. They visited blood donation centers and the Las Vegas Convention Center, which was serving as a family assistance center. “That helped to bring guys together on a personal level, instead of just going to the rink,” said Engelland. The Knights played their first ever regular season game on 6 October in Dallas, winning 2-1. After the game, Engelland stepped up in the team’s dressing room to read texts he’d received from local firefighters: They wanted the Golden Knights to know that just the simple act of playing a hockey game for a grieving city helped many cope with the tragedy. “We weren’t winning for ourselves,” said Engelland. “We were winning for everyone in the city that was affected by that tragedy.” Nine days after the shooting, the Golden Knights held their first ever home opener. “We felt, because we were on a major platform now, we had to be the community hub and have a memorial that was respectful and help this community grieve, heal and persevere,” said Golden Knights General Manager George McPhee. First responders escorted players on the ice ahead of puck drop and 58 seconds of silence were held, one second for each victim of the shooting. The Knights would go on to beat the Arizona Coyotes, 5-2. That began a seven-game home stand, during which the Knights won six games. “It gave people three hours of their day to not think about everything that had gone on,” Engelland said of Las Vegas residents. The process of implanting the team into the city’s psyche, in the eyes of Engelland, was fast-tracked. All along, every player that was left unprotected by their former clubs and selected by the Golden Knights in the expansion draft found a purpose in their career once again. Forward Erik Haula, left unprotected by the Minnesota Wild, was usually deployed as a fourth-line centre who killed penalties. His career high in goals was 15. With the Knights, he scored 29 goals this season. And William Karlsson, affectionately known as “Wild Bill”, went from scoring six goals with the Columbus Blue Jackets last season to finishing third in goal-scoring across the NHL with 43 goals. “The guys that were left unprotected coming in knew there was a lot of opportunity to play a bigger role than they had and play to their full potential,” said Engelland, who was not protected by the Calgary Flames. “Guys kind of just ran with it.” That stretched to the front office. Head coach Gerrard Gallant had been fired by the Florida Panthers in November 2016 and McPhee had been fired by the Washington Capitals in 2014. “Everyone here has been rejected in one way or another,” said McPhee. The team referred to themselves as the Golden Misfits. It might seem like a joke of a moniker, but as the regular season wore on, there was nothing funny about the results they were generating. By the early spring, the Knights had backed up their hot start with a push to become Pacific Division champions. “Having a chip on our shoulder did not hurt this team,” said McPhee. “It helped this team.” Those closest to the organization credit McPhee’s ability to not only draft for talent, but find players that were willing to buy-in to a simple notion: this team could find success if they forgot about the past and those who didn’t believe in their abilities and instead, embrace a second chance. Every player entered the season as equals, all united on a strange island for banishment in the middle of the desert. McPhee had to vet hundreds of players available in the expansion draft establish for those who would relish the opportunity. What he assembled was a collection of personnel who thrived with that second chance, especially Gallant, who last month was announced as a finalist for the Jack Adams Award as NHL coach of the year. “Every button this guy is pushing is working,” said Steve Carp, who covers the Golden Knights for the Las Vegas Review-Journal. Throughout the season, players would arrive far earlier than needed to have breakfast together at the team’s practice facility. With no designated team captain, you could make the case that no hierarchy has existed either. “There’s a lot of respect around the room, for everybody,” said Carp. With a 51-24-7 record, the Golden Knights became the first modern-era expansion team, without mergers and divisions of only expansion teams, throughout North America’s four major professional sports leagues to finish first in its respective division in its inaugural season. Even as they entered the NHL playoffs, many in the hockey world believed the Golden Knights’ luck would soon run out. And then they dispatched of the 2012 and 2014 Stanley Cup champion Los Angeles Kings in a four-game sweep in the first round of the playoffs. Their second round series win over the Sharks required only two more games. Now as fans of Leicester City know all too well, the conversation has shifted. The Knights aren’t just happy to have been invited to the dance. The question now being asked is, can this team win a championship and join the ranks of Leicester City as one of the most unlikely champions in sports history? McPhee bristles at the notion. He hasn’t had time to pause. The relentless work he put in to building the squad hasn’t yet halted. There are two more rounds to go. “We’re working in silos,” McPhee said of him and his staff. “We’re working away and we don’t get to absorb what’s going on around us, outside of the building. There’s little time to reflect on things.” Well, that’s only partly true. McPhee might be unaware of what’s being said about his organization around the world, but he knows what a difference his club has made in the city he now, rather unexpectedly, now calls home. “We can’t go anywhere without being recognized,” McPhee said of himself and his players. “Everywhere you go you see Knights merchandise. It’s the ‘Thank yous.’ I go to the grocery store, the church, wherever, and people say ‘Thank you’ for bringing a team here that they can be proud of.” Las Vegas was long known as a transient city, where people would make residence for a short period of time. You could be forgiven for believing at the start of the NHL season that the same would hold true for some of the city’s newest implants, its NHL roster. Expansion teams often experience high levels of roster upheaval in their first few seasons. But the team’s improbable playoff run, and the way it’s inspired a city during a mourning period, may change all of that. “This has pulled the city together,” Goodman said of the Knights. “Everything about the Golden Knights is about today but also for the future.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/may/12/manchester-city-united-arsenal-contract-offers-melayro-bogarde","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-12T14:15:30Z","webTitle":"Manchester City, Manchester United and Arsenal make offers to Melayro Bogarde","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/12/manchester-city-united-arsenal-contract-offers-melayro-bogarde","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/12/manchester-city-united-arsenal-contract-offers-melayro-bogarde","fields":{"headline":"Manchester City, Manchester United and Arsenal make offers to Melayro Bogarde","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Manchester City, Manchester United and Arsenal have all offered contracts to Melayro Bogarde, nephew of former Chelsea defender Winston, with the defender free to sign his first professional deal when he turns 16 on 28 May. Liverpool and Chelsea are also monitoring the Feyenoord defender, though neither club has opened negotiations. Bogarde is considered one of Europe’s prime talents due to his physique, height and ball-playing skills, with Pep Guardiola viewing him as having a similar technical potential to John Stones, who he signed in the summer of 2016. The Manchester City manager has invited Bogarde to visit the club’s City Football Academy facility and Bogarde has received similar invitations from Arsenal and United, who enjoy good relations with Feyenoord. Two years ago, United signed Tahith Chong from the Dutch side, with the Caracao-born winger winning the Jimmy Murphy youth team player of the year award this month. Due to his age negotiations for Bogarde’s signature could not begin until he was 15½. These are now advanced regarding City, United and Liverpool with the player expected to choose the club he believes will offer the best chance of him progressing to the first team.United’s Dutch scout, Henny de Regt, hired by the club when Louis van Gaal was manager, has been monitoring Bogarde all season, as have his counterparts from City and Liverpool. RB Leipzig, who are sixth in the Bundesliga, also retain a firm interest. Paul Mitchell, their head of recruitment, watched Bogarde around a fortnight ago when Feyenoord U17s played Ajax U17s.

The hosts were almost ahead in the eighth minute when Jordan Nobbs controlled the ball 20 yards out and struck a powerful half-volley but Karen Bardsley in the City goal reacted to palm it over. Bardsley’s acrobatics were rewarded three minutes later as Georgia Stanway drove through the middle of the pitch before sliding a pass to Nadia Nadim who made the most of a slip from goalkeeper Sari van Veenendaal, as the Denmark international’s shot from 10 yards trickled beyond the stranded Arsenal No1 and into the corner. Nadim should have added another as she found space in the box in order to connect with a Nikita Parris cross but headed over the bar. Nobbs then brought the best out of Bardsley once more when she fired a shot from the right-hand edge of the area across the goalkeeper but she was once again spurned by strong arm which diverted the ball wide. After the break Arsenal quickly took control of the match as Nobbs laid the ball into the path of Van de Donk who maintained calm before precisely directing her shot into the bottom corner from 18 yards. The Dutch international then ran to embrace her soon-to-be retiring team-mate Scott on the bench. In the 62nd minute the comeback was completed as Kim Little dissected the defence with a pass which looked like it had missed its original target but Mead broke between opposition players to then hit a shot beyond Bardsley from an acute angle. Mead was another who shared her moment of joy with Scott on the touchline, a sign of how much the defender means to the squad after originally joining the club in 1992. City should have shared the points but substitute Izzy Christiansen failed to convert a cross from the right-wing despite being five yards out and unmarked, instead sending her header wide of the goal. Scott was sent on for the final moments of the game, much to the home support’s delight, and they celebrate once again when the whistle went as they held on. Everton were dispatched 3-0 by Birmingham City Ladies at Marine Travel Arena in a disappointing final home game in Division One of the Women’s Super League Season. Striker Charlie Wellings scored two of City’s goals, the first a superb dipping shot from 30 yards out in the 20th minute and the second arriving after half-time when she stabbed home a low effort from just outside the area. Wellings had other chances throughout a one-sided match but it was England star Ellen White who completed the rout with another magnificent long-range goal. The result sees Birmingham leapfrog Everton’s rivals Liverpool in fifth place. Winless Yeovil Town were once again defeated despite holding out for 62 minutes before Lauren Hemp and Yana Daniels scored to give Bristol City a 2-0 victory."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"education/2018/may/13/teacher-burnout-shortages-recruitment-problems-budget-cuts","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-13T06:00:51Z","webTitle":"Burned out: why are so many teachers quitting or off sick with stress?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/may/13/teacher-burnout-shortages-recruitment-problems-budget-cuts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2018/may/13/teacher-burnout-shortages-recruitment-problems-budget-cuts","fields":{"headline":"Burned out: why are so many teachers quitting or off sick with stress?","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"It was a toxic routine: plan lessons until 1am, wake up at 5am in a sweat, vomit, go to work, teach. “I lost a stone and a half in two months,” Dan Lintell said. “I was having heart palpitations and panic attacks. My body was totally exhausted. I couldn’t go on.” He had barely completed his first half-term as a newly qualified teacher. The start of the school year in September had been filled with optimism. After a successful 20-year career as a design engineer, Lintell decided he wanted to become a teacher. This made him what the government called a “high-calibre career changer”, who would revitalise schools and bring experience from the “real world” into the classroom – in his case, teaching physics at a comprehensive in Leicestershire. “The idea was to spend time with my daughter, who was turning four,” he said. “The irony is that I barely got to see my family. I was doing my job, coming home, having dinner, then starting work at 8.30pm and working through until 1am, every night.” Lintell was overwhelmed by two things: pouring his soul into “choreographing the classroom” five times a day; and seeing any hope of recovery disappear under a mountain of preparation for the next day’s performances. “You’re meant to spend no more than an hour preparing for each lesson, but if you’re going to do a half-decent job, you need two hours. If you have 25 hours of lessons a week, that’s already 50 hours. And then you’ve got marking and other things on top.” Welcome to England’s classrooms in 2018. Every teacher knows someone who has left the profession, retired early, had a breakdown, or been signed off work with stress. Just under 40,000 teachers quit the profession in 2016 – the latest figures available – representing about 9% of the workforce, according to government figures. And not enough of them are being replaced – there is now a shortfall of 30,000 classroom teachers, particularly at secondary level, where 20% of teacher training vacancies are unfilled. A lack of teachers means classes are getting bigger. Bigger classes are harder to control. Losing control stops teachers teaching. With less teaching time, students make less progress. And that can be catastrophic for teachers. “One bad year can be career-ending,” said Valentine Mulholland, head of policy at the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT). “In no other profession would you have that. You can have one year of pupils which is very different from previous years, which they have no control over. If you live with that sword of Damocles over your head, it’s difficult not to cascade that fear to the rest of your school.” Some schools have tried radical solutions to this crisis of being unable to find or keep staff. In Daventry, Northamptonshire, Ashby Fields primary floated the idea of closing early on Fridays, sending children home at 1.15pm, with the possibility of an after-school club for children of working parents. The problem, the headteacher said in a letter to parents, was recruitment, retention and workload, which had a “direct, major impact on, not only our children’s education, but on their well-being and confidence. The huge workload ensures teachers work an average of 60 hours a week during term time and through their holidays to keep up. Many teachers, despite their love of frontline teaching, cannot manage this workload and maintain a healthy work/life balance, and subsequently resign.” Parents arriving at the school – which is part of a shopping precinct bolted on to a 1990s housing estate where there are no street corners, only gentle curves and cul-de-sacs – were unimpressed. “It’s hard enough to find a job that finishes within normal school hours,” Emma Lennox said. “How would I find a job that finishes at 1pm? It’s £8 for an afternoon session and I’ve got three kids. That means all my wages would be paying for their care.” She and friend Kim Burns agreed that teacher turnover was high. “We’ve had nine teachers in one year for my daughter’s class,” Burns said. “We had eight,” Lennox nodded. “They need more time to plan, but don’t they have six weeks’ holiday?” But holidays, in teacher-speak, simply mean a break from the classroom. For Victoria Hewett, they meant time to catch up on work. As head of geography at a new academy in Kent, she was responsible for setting up the department and teaching about 240 children across the school. “I could feel I was on the edge before Easter,” she said. A few days before the break, she broke down in class, but struggled back to finish the half-term. “I worked all Easter break to catch up. The minute I got into my classroom, I just walked out again. I couldn’t do it. The anxiety was crippling.” Another teacher found her and asked if she was all right. “I just burst into tears and didn’t stop crying for two hours. I was sent home – I have no idea how I got there. My memory is just a blur. I went to bed and slept until Tuesday morning. I had barely had any sleep over the holidays.” After taking advice from the Education Support Partnership (ESP), a charity that offers mental health support to anyone working in education in England and Wales, Hewett was signed off work for three weeks and prescribed antidepressants. ESP says that over the past 12 months it has seen the number of teachers calling its confidential helpline rise by 35%, to 8,668 cases. “What we’re hearing is that people have lost a sense of agency,” said Julian Stanley, ESP’s chief executive. “There is constant change – new initiatives, new curriculum changes. A number of pressures tell us that it’s not a whinge; it’s a fact. Teachers feel they need to be trusted, and need support.” Hewett felt in an impossible bind – she was expected to show constant improvements in her students’ assessments, but classroom time was frequently undermined by unruly behaviour. She felt there was no backup from her senior leadership team when she tried to deal with troublemakers. “You had these targets to meet, but you didn’t have the support to meet those targets.” Research shows that people in a high-performance job can cope with stress if they have support and autonomy, a model known as “decision latitude”, said Dr Almuth McDowall, head of occupational psychology at Birkbeck, University of London. “It’s well established that you can cope with a very stressful job if you’ve got control and support,” she said. “If you take support out, things become much more difficult. If there is a lack of control and autonomy for a long period while you have high job demands, things start to go very wrong.” So if more support is the solution, where will it come from? Since not enough teachers are being trained, schools are turning to supply staff: 71% of headteachers say they are spending more on temporary staff. Becoming a supply teacher is seen by some as an attractive career option: they can avoid the paperwork and marking of a full-time post and simply do the job they love. But that could be harming children’s education, according to a study by Asma Benhenda of the Paris School of Economics. Her analysis of 100,000 teachers and 3 million students shows that “teacher absence has a statistically negative impact on student test scores”. The disruption to the flow of learning caused by using substitutes – however good they are – is equivalent to using teachers who are in the bottom 15% of the profession, Benhenda says. Even if enough people were going into teacher training, heads believe they wouldn’t have the money to hire them anyway. Although schools have seen a rise in funding, the NAHT says they’ve been hit by various new costs, including an increase in employers’ national insurance contributions and new rules on pensions. “That adds up to a real-terms cut of about 8%, even after the government found £1.3bn down the back of a settee last July,” Mulholland said. “We’ve still got an issue that is becoming chronic – 80% of our members say they have no idea how they’ll make their budgets balance in two years.” One primary head, speaking anonymously, said they were at the stage where any more cuts would affect children’s learning. “Secondary schools are able to cut subjects and make those teachers redundant,” the head said. “We’re asking ourselves, is there a hidden talent of parents who can come in and do some things for free, so we can make people redundant and still get the work done? And can parents contribute more financially than we’ve realised and, if so, how much?” Cake sales and other fundraisers now pay for vital equipment such as whiteboards – and some schools ask parents to set up direct debits. The Harris Westminster Sixth Form academy in central London is advertising for a “major gifts fundraiser” to work part time and “lead a programme to take on annual donations from £500,000 to £1m”. For those without dedicated fundraisers, early closing on Fridays is a more attractive option. This is already in place at all four schools run by the South Essex Academy Trust in the Basildon area, as well as at Bordesley Green Primary in Birmingham, the City of London Academy, and King’s Hedges and Westwood primary schools in Cambridgeshire. At Westwood, early closure is designed to help teaching assistants become teachers. Headteacher Gill Thomas says: “In these days of recruitment and retention being a real issue, I have teaching assistants with the capacity to get their degree. We felt that, as we are upskilling our teaching assistants, involving our TAs in planning, preparation and assessment would help that.” Yet the funding shortfall means many schools are losing teaching assistants too, the NAHT says. Cuts to services such as Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services, educational psychologists, and speech and language therapists mean that many children are not getting help, which leads to more behavioural problems. “We can attribute the rise in exclusion to children not getting the right support early enough,” Mulholland said. Children excluded at age 12 are four times as likely to be jailed as adults, according to research by the University of Edinburgh. Lintell still has an appetite for teaching, despite the scars. “I’ve gone back into design and it’s nice to feel truly competent again. But in time, if the environment were to change, perhaps I would go back into teaching.” There are some signs that the environment may be changing. Damian Hinds, the education secretary, said last month that his priorities were to reduce teachers’ workload and the fear caused by the “spectre of our accountability system”. Lintell will be watching closely. “My instinct is to fix things – I’m a design engineer,” he said. “I don’t know what the solution is. It’s not just money. But the constant increasing of class numbers because they can’t afford enough teachers and support staff is not helping. I have seen very caring, very capable teachers who, for self-preservation reasons, say, ‘I just can’t take any more of this’.” Case Studies Victoria Hewett, head of geography at a Kent grammar school This is my sixth year in teaching. I became head of department at a free school - it was a brand new school and I set up the department mainly single-handedly. The aim was to become an outstanding school. I was doing 60- to 70-hour weeks. I would start work at 7.30am and wouldn’t stop until 6pm, then I would work for several hours in the evening, to about 9.30pm. At weekends, I would work all day Sunday, planning my lessons for the following week. I became really insular and lost a lot of friends because I didn’t have the time to spend with them. There were days when I left the morning briefing and burst into tears before I got to the classroom because we had been told there was even more work to do by the end of the day. Extra work included things like observations. Because we were a new school I had about eight observations in a year, when someone from the school or the DfE would come into the classroom. But you don’t know which of the five lessons in the day they’ll observe, so that meant spending more time on lesson plans, data collection on student progress, extra copies of teaching resources. That would add about seven hours extra to my day. There were data drops for every year group where you give them a grade. They weren’t staggered so I had to do all of it in one week for 12 classes. The irony is that I was asked to develop a well-being programme in the school - but I had no time to do it. Now [after time off and a course of antidepressants] I am at a different school. Being relaxed helps because you become more approachable. Now, because I’m not stressing about behaviour, I find I can give feedback during lessons. I do a lot more group work, and the students make more progress. Dan Lintell, who worked for three months as a newly qualified teacher at a secondary school in Leicestershire I spent nearly 20 years as a design engineer and had got a little disillusioned with the commercial world. I had always wondered about teaching. I enjoy helping people understand complex things. I did well in my PGCE and looked forward to becoming a science teacher. A school I had done a placement with couldn’t offer me a science position, but asked if I fancied teaching maths and science. When I started in September, I hit the ground running but soon found I couldn’t keep up. I was up until 1am every night. By the end, I was having palpitations and panic attacks. I was totally exhausted: waking up at 5am and throwing up, every day. I lost a stone and a half in weight. I got to Christmas and knew I couldn’t go on. You can have the lesson plans and get some resources from other people, but, ultimately, teaching a class is choreography, an art form. It’s knowing when to pick your battles and how to pick them. It’s happening every second: you’re reading situations and reading body language. You can only get that experience in the classroom. What really makes it hard is the differentiation [giving each child individual attention according to their ability]. Doing that for every child for every lesson is unrealistic. I think my lack of experience showed – more experienced teachers might take the view that, if they manage differentiation for 80%, that’s OK. But attempting to do it for every child takes so much preparation time. You’re meant to spend no more than an hour preparing for each lesson. But if you’re going to do a half-decent job, it’s two hours. If you’ve got 25 hours of lessons a week, that’s already 50 hours, and then you’ve got marking and other things on top. I was doing my job, coming home and starting after dinner at 8.30 and working through until 1am, every night."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2018/may/13/the-gorbals-18-may-1968","type":"article","sectionId":"theobserver","sectionName":"From the Observer","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-13T07:00:05Z","webTitle":"Observer picture archive: The Gorbals, 18 May 1968","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/may/13/the-gorbals-18-may-1968","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2018/may/13/the-gorbals-18-may-1968","fields":{"headline":"Observer picture archive: The Gorbals, 18 May 1968","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"This is an extract from an article, published in the Observer on 19 May 1968, entitled ‘Where the violence is as casual as the smile of a pretty girl’, by Patrick O’Donovan The City of Glasgow was once called the Second City of the Empire. It remains superb. Its streets are wide and nobly lined with mansions and offices that would flatter a capital. It has rich museums, universities, theatres and 50 dance halls. It has well-kept parks and a graceful river. This is a great city with a character as strong and pleasing as its national drink. But it is also a city that considers itself in trouble. It believes itself to be in the grip of a crime wave, not so much of robbery as of a degenerate, mindless, pointless violence. This week, for example, a 16-year-old boy, who could not run away because he had an artificial leg, was stabbed three times by young strangers in a park. They ran away, shouting “Shamrock”. A 12-year-old boy, the son of a policeman, waiting at a bus stop, was slashed down his jaw-line with a razor. And again there was no reason for an attack that was as casual as a smile at a pretty girl. A girl looking into a shop window with friends was stabbed in the back, apparently because she had refused to kiss a strange young man. The worst of Glasgow’s recent experiences came over the Easter weekend. Then there were 21 serious assaults and 25 robberies with violence. Nearly 100 people were injured. A boy coming home from church on Good Friday was stabbed by a youthful gang and died on the pavement in his father’s arms. There were 132 brutal attacks in Glasgow in March. There were 56 in the same time a year ago. It is a mysterious business and it is not clear if the situation is worse than in other comparable cities. Violence and its punishment was a major issue in the recent local elections and the Tories first and then the Labour candidates made it one of their chief claims to authority. There are demands for sterner punishments and for more powers of search and arrest for the police, though they would seem to have all that a civilised policeman could require. There were famous fights in the 1920s and 30s when gangs of up to 300 fought each other on the streets.

In a case that will raise further questions about the financial management of academies, an inquiry into Silver Birch Academy Trust claims it spent £6,117 on a fact-finding trip to China and New Zealand for its chief executive Patricia Davies, a former headteacher of the year, and her deputy. The draft investigation states that the trust allegedly spent £99,000 refurbishing a former caretaker’s house, later to be rented out to a member of staff. It claimed £10,000 of work had been done without quotes having been obtained, while no rent had been paid. It alleges the trust spent £3.26m on services from six companies without providing evidence of any contracts having been signed. It also alleges that the trust had contracts with four consultancy companies, together worth £326,044, without the work having gone out to tender. Meanwhile, a school within the trust spent £1,064 on two rooms for two nights at the Hyatt Regency hotel, Birmingham, with £507 of this for a room where the guest did not turn up. The report seen by the Observer was a draft version. A final version has not yet been published and could differ from the draft. Silver Birch, which runs four primary school academies educating nearly 2,000 pupils in the London boroughs of Waltham Forest and Redbridge, also allegedly spent nearly £5,000 on four laptops for management. The findings are contained in a draft investigation report by the Education and Skills Funding Agency, which oversees academies. It is the second time in four years that the trust’s spending has been examined. An inquiry in 2014 criticised it for spending £26,000 on refurbishing Davies’s office. Queries have also been raised about her earnings. The trust’s latest accounts show she was paid £211,082 in 2016-17 – a rise of 10% from the previous year. The leaked investigation states that her pay was in the range £180,000 to £261,000 in January 2018. The report questions the financial understanding of those running the trust. Its 2016-17 accounts show that overall spending of £9.5m was nearly £1m higher than the income it received for its “education operations”, meaning it had an in-year deficit. “Discussions with both [Davies] and [the] acting chair of the board demonstrated a poor understanding of the current financial situation of the trust,” the draft report states. “Neither could explain the in-year deficit that the trust incurred and did not show any understanding of what an in-year deficit was.” The findings come after the Commons public accounts committee concluded that “too often academy trusts are falling short” of the “highest standards of governance, accountability and financial management” and that the Department for Education is often “too slow to react”. The draft report highlights 11 alleged breaches of the Academies Financial Handbook, a government document setting out spending rules for academies. Several “novel or contentious payments” should have been sent to the ESFA for approval in advance, the report suggests. A spokeswoman for the trust said the overseas fact-finding mission had been “approved”. She said it had been part-funded by a group called the National Leaders of Education, which contributed £6,000 to the trip’s cost of £12,117. The remaining £6,117 came from the schools’ budget. In relation to the other allegations, she said: “As part of its recent review ESFA raised an inquiry in relation to the manner in which certain payments were made, evidenced or demonstrated value. Further information and evidence by way of clarification has already been provided to the ESFA. The payments referred to were made in accordance with trust policies and procedures. “Changes already under way and further measures introduced in response to the ESFA enquiries have dealt with many of the points raised. A final report has not as yet been published.”The Education Department said it did not comment on leaked documents, but added: “The department investigates all allegations of financial impropriety.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/may/13/sarah-mullally-bishop-london-respect-opponents","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-13T08:00:04Z","webTitle":"Comprehensive pupil, poly student, nurse ... and now the C of  E’s most powerful ever senior female cleric","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/13/sarah-mullally-bishop-london-respect-opponents","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/13/sarah-mullally-bishop-london-respect-opponents","fields":{"headline":"Comprehensive pupil, poly student, nurse ... and now the C of  E’s most powerful ever senior female cleric","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"In the grandeur of St Paul’s Cathedral, far removed from the busy hospital wards where she once worked as a nurse, Sarah Mullally made history on Saturday when she was installed as the bishop of London, becoming the most senior female cleric ever in the Church of England. The 90-minute ceremony – on the birthday of Florence Nightingale – marked a break with tradition in more than just gender. The 133rd bishop of London is also a former comprehensive school pupil whose career before she was ordained as a priest at the age of 40 was in the NHS. “There aren’t many bishops who come from comprehensive schools, who are poly [polytechnic] girls and who did [part-time training] for the priesthood,” she told the Observer in an interview before the service. “It’s not just gender, it’s also your background that’s equally important. Some of these things are changing. Leadership in the church needs to reflect the communities we serve. There is work to do about how we encourage vocations from people who may be working-class, people who’ve not had a traditional straightforward academic pathway, people from BAME [black, Asian and minority ethnic] groups. The system may need to be different.” The appointment of Mullally, 56, to the No 3 position in the church after the archbishops of Canterbury and York surprised many who believed the capital’s strong conservative traditions ruled out a female bishop. Mullally will also become the first bishop of London to ordain male and female priests; her predecessor, Richard Chartres, declined to ordain either in order to avoid a backlash from traditionalists. Since her appointment was announced in December, Mullally has met clergy and congregations who “for theological reasons will not accept my ministry”, she said. “While I haven’t spoken to everyone – and a lot of people may have chosen not to speak to me – I have been encouraged about how it’s gone; they’ve been very generous. “Someone at a school asked me if a refusal to accept my ministry was perpetuating inequality. My answer is, there is a tension; to deny that would be wrong. My challenge [to traditionalists] is to ask: how are you encouraging women in your church, how are you making sure you’re not discriminating against them? But I respect those who can’t accept my position, and we will make provision for those who for theological reasons do not want to be ordained by me because I am a woman.” Later this month Mullally will take a seat in the House of Lords that is hers by right as bishop of London. “It’s a real privilege, and I recognise I need to use it wisely,” she said. She hopes to focus on three areas: London issues, health and nursing, and “speaking up for marginalised groups: women, the homeless, young people – it’s a tough world for them”. She added: “I hope to give a voice to women who, for whatever reason, feel marginalised. And to ask what I can do to encourage and empower women to do the best they can” – perhaps by mentoring, which she has done throughout her career. Mullally rose swiftly through the NHS ranks to become the youngest ever chief nursing officer at the age of 37. “My experience in the NHS and Department of Health has shaped how I minister. Being a nurse is incredibly pastoral, and I bring that with me, but I’ve also managed complex organisations and provided leadership for 420,000 nurses. I think I’ve learned something about leadership, that you have to understand the value of people, and be clear about what the vision is and how it can be achieved, and bring people with you.” Christians often found it “very hard to talk openly about faith” in the workplace, she said. “You have to have confidence and not be apologetic – and that’s quite hard in what is a hostile and increasingly secular world. But if you are confident and respectful, people are interested. What they find difficult is if they think you’re being directional to them.” She was aware that “there are groups with whom the church hasn’t got huge amounts of traction, and young people are one of them. We need to reach out, engage with young people, knowing that the church will look different as a result. “I’m struck that young people may not be interested in the church, but they are interested in God. They don’t necessarily want us to give them the answers, but they want to engage with the questions.” On LGBT equality and same-sex marriage, a controversial issue within the church, Mullally supports its official position that marriage is between a man and a woman, but that LGBT people should be embraced and valued. She is part of a process set up by the archbishops to examine the issue of sexuality. “I understand why people might feel it’s kicking it into the long grass, but I certainly hope that’s not the case,” she said. The other crisis issue within the church is sexual abuse. Mullally extended a personal invitation to one survivor, Gilo (also known as Joe), in whose case she has been closely involved, to attend her installation. He declined, telling the Observer he was disappointed and frustrated with the slow pace of change on how the church deals with abuse cases. “I know Gilo thinks I haven’t delivered,” said Mullally. “But we shouldn’t underestimate what happened [in the two years since an independent report into his case]. There have been changes – all bishops are now trained on how to deal with disclosures, every diocese has had an independent safeguarding review. But I understand Gilo doesn’t think we’ve gone far enough.” A key demand from survivors is for claims of abuse to be dealt with by an independent body. Mullally said: “I think it’s right to ask the question ‘are we independent enough?’, but part of the change of culture is that people like myself have taken responsibility for providing a safe environment and, if someone discloses to us, dealing with it appropriately. We have to take responsibility; we can’t hand everything over.” She hopes that her appointment is part of a continuing process of women taking more leadership roles in the church – perhaps also as archbishops when those positions become vacant. “The challenge is that people often think that, once you’ve appointed a woman, you’ve dealt with the issue. You haven’t. “In London we still have a job to do, to enable women to lead big churches, become area deans and archdeacons. There’s still work to do around how you change the culture.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/13/basque-in-rihannas-reflected-glory","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-13T05:05:50Z","webTitle":"Basque in Rihanna’s reflected glory | Charlie Brinkhurst-Cuff","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/13/basque-in-rihannas-reflected-glory","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/may/13/basque-in-rihannas-reflected-glory","fields":{"headline":"Basque in Rihanna’s reflected glory","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"When Rihanna’s Fenty Beauty products shimmered their way into our lives in late 2017 in all number of foundation shades, shines and magnetic highlighters, it felt like a seismic moment for a beauty industry that was still catching up to realities of diversity in the 21st century. Now, the megastar has launched Savage x Fenty, a line of “size inclusive”, affordable lingerie in 90 styles from bodices to sleepwear and, it’s reported, handcuffs.

Purely on the numbers, it has to be Vladimir Putin, who last week was sworn in for his fourth term as Russia’s president. Not only has he never been defeated at the ballot box, his latest victory was his biggest yet: he won nearly 77% of the vote on a turnout of 67%. That means more than one in two eligible Russians gave him their support. Most democratic politicians can barely dream of such astonishing popularity. For that reason, we take it for granted that Putin is no democrat at all. The margins are too big and the opposition too puny for this to count as real democracy. Yet the Putin model of authoritarianism validated through elections is becoming increasingly widespread. In Hungary last month, the deeply illiberal Viktor Orbán won nearly 50% of the vote. Next month, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan goes to the presidential polls in Turkey. Like Putin, he has never lost an election. He is not about to break the habit of a lifetime now. We should be careful about assuming everything in these votes is fixed. Last week’s Malaysian election saw the return to power of a 92-year-old former strongman, Mahathir Mohamad, who had previously ruled the country for more than two decades. The outcome was a genuine surprise, with the ruling party of Najib Razak unceremoniously turfed out of office. No election, no matter how ruthless the incumbent regime, is ever entirely predictable. That’s what gives this form of politics its effective hold on power: it manages to combine the democratic energy of popular participation with the absence of fresh alternatives that makes democracy meaningful. In Malaysia, they picked the devil they used to know over the one they’ve got to know recently. It’s not much of a choice. Yet while parts of the world are experimenting with elections without real democracy, nearer to home we see the opposite: the creeping rise of democracy without elections. This year’s Italian elections were the first for more than five years there and had been delayed as long as possible because of the fear they would make Italian politics even harder to manage. The result, which divided the spoils between the contradictory forces of the Five Star Movement and the Northern League, seemed to confirm those fears. What has brought the feuding factions to heel is the combined threat of another election or the imposition of an unelected technocratic government. It seems that the only thing worse than the present uncertainty would be to allow the voters a further chance to have their say, since most of the uncertainty starts with them. Elections in many places simply reveal how divided the electorate has become, making it even harder to find common ground. Last year’s German elections, which resulted in a six-month stalemate while a weakened Angela Merkel tried to patch together a coalition government, showed a country that did not seem to know what it wanted any more. Again, it was only the deeply alarming prospect of another election, which almost no one wanted, which enabled Merkel to paper over the cracks. In Britain, Theresa May called an election to get decisive popular backing for her Brexit strategy. What she got instead was weakness and division. It will be a long time before a British prime minister makes that mistake again. It now seems likely that Brexit, with all its machinations and all its implications, will be played out well before we get another chance to elect a government in 2022. Behind this anxious avoidance of elections lies a deeper trend, which is the growing attraction of alternative ways of doing democracy. The Five Star Movement has pledged that any government of which it is a part will use online votes to generate and validate policies. Popular participation will come not in the crude form of elections but through streamlined digital democracy, with regular consultation replacing intermittent upheaval. Elections can look like outmoded analogue politics in a digital age. Why ask voters one question when you can ask them many? Why all vote at one time when you can vote all the time? New technology also threatens to make elections redundant by making them untrustworthy. The wave of suspicion about Russian interference in the Brexit referendum and the election of Trump will take a long-term toll on our confidence in electoral politics. The Cambridge Analytica scandal has made many voters aware of how vulnerable elections are to manipulation. Certainly, few people have much faith that their elected governments will be able to tackle the problem, since their elected governments are often the manifestation of it. Politicians are reduced to asking the tech companies to help get them out of this mess. In the end, it won’t be more elections that solves the problem of Facebook – it will be Facebook that solves the problem of elections. The current weakness of democracy is a reflection of the bewildering variety of challenges it faces. During the 20th century, the battle lines were much more sharply drawn: liberal democracy faced ideological rivals in fascism and communism that offered stark alternatives to it. Now, democracy is being pulled in different directions at the same time. Authoritarians increasingly co-opt elections as part of their political arsenal. Meanwhile, democratic politicians view elections with growing suspicion and wonder if there are more effective ways of getting things done. Few of the threats to democracy are explicitly anti-democratic any more. What Putin and Erdoğan, Facebook and Five Star have in common is that they all pay lip service to the idea that the people should have their say. They believe in popular participation, but on their terms. The result is that democracy is much more likely to blur into its alternatives than confront them. We spend a lot of time worrying about whether demons from democracy’s past are coming back. Is Trump turning into a tyrant? Is fascism making a return? These fears are a distraction, as the conditions of political life have changed dramatically since democracy was last under so much strain. The real question is whether democracy is going to break apart into little pieces and whether we would notice if it did.

Thanks for reading this MBM. Good day to you, wherever you may be! Steve Bruce speaks: “We had to defend very well. We went too deep in the second half. But the resilience! The second half was very difficult but we kept a clean sheet, we’ve got an advantage, coming to Middlesbrough’s never easy, so we’ll take that and look forward to Tuesday. It’s a small advantage. It’s half time. They’ve got to come to our place, but we all know the Championship, how ridiculous it is!” The seven-time champions of England take a precious lead back to Villa Park for the second leg on Tuesday! 90 min +6: Traore skips in from the left, but can’t fashion space to shoot. That allows Grealish to scamper up the other end, eating up what’s left of the clock. 90 min +5: Well that’s all the added time used up, but with Terry having gone down seeking treatment, there’s more! 90 min +4: ... Terry goes down holding his neep. The referee blows up, as he has to for a head injury. The Boro fans don’t like this one either, assuming he’s trying it on. You know how these things go. 90 min +3: A chance! The ball’s sent into the Villa box, and breaks to Fabio on the penalty spot. He slashes a shot towards the bottom right. It’s deflected out for a corner, from which ... 90 min +2: Downing attempts a shot from 25 yards. Bloody hell. 90 min +1: Boro have all the possession ... but it’s in the middle of the park. There’s no way through Villa. 90 min: There will be five minutes of added time. 89 min: Whelan comes on for Elmohamady. Downing immediately romps into space vacated by the left-back. He crosses. Bamford eyebrows the ball on. It drops to Friend, who waits for an age for the ball to drop - then smashes it high into the stand. Too much time to think. 87 min: Elmohamady looks to have pulled a hamstring. He’s holding the back of his right leg, grimacing, having pulled up abruptly in a chase with Fabio. Or is it cramp? The Boro fans think he’s trying it on, with a view to running down the clock. He gets some treatment on the pitch, before limping off. 85 min: Traore skedaddles down the left and loops inside for Bamford, but Terry steps in to clear. Boro have total territorial dominance right now ... but Villa are holding firm. 84 min: Fabio has been busy since coming on. He earns a bit of space on the right, and sends a screamer of a ball through the six-yard box. Johnstone deals with it well. 83 min: Jedinak clears that second one. Both sets of fans are feeling the tension at a nervous Riverside: the next ten minutes or so are crucial to the balance of this semi-final. 82 min: Bamford and Howson one-two down the left, forcing Terry to intercept and concede a corner. The set piece is met by Fabio, on the left-hand corner of the six-yard box. Johnstone is forced to turn the ball round for another corner. 81 min: Grabban has been quiet. He’s replaced by Bjarnason. 80 min: Boro desperately need something to happen. But they’re up against it now. Villa have only conceded six goals in the last 15 minutes of all their matches in all competitions all season! 78 min: Traore turns on the jets and races past Snodgrass, who isn’t risking anything now he’s been booked. He earns a corner, from which Friend is penalised for grappling with Terry. 77 min: Downing lifts the free kick into the mixer. It hits Gibson, and harmlessly bounces through to Johnstone. 76 min: Snodgrass is booked for a fairly cynical check on Friend. It’ll be a free kick just to the left of the Villa box. But before it can be taken, on comes Bamford for the disappointing Assombalonga. Bamford’s arrival is met with great cheers. 75 min: Grealish dribbles with great intent down the middle of the park. He’s a very fine player to watch in full flight. He slips the ball to his left for Grabban, who sidefoots a lame first-time effort into Randolph’s arms from the edge of the box. 73 min: Howson crosses from the Boro left. Grabban volleys to the halfway line. Villa seem happy enough to let Boro come onto them, because they’re doing very little in the final third, and this scoreline will be more than acceptable for Bruce’s side going into the second leg. 72 min: Another cross by Fabio from the right, and again it’s easily snaffled by Johnstone. 71 min: Adomah is replaced by Kodjia. Formerly of Boro, the Villa man receives some warm applause as he departs. 69 min: Fabio crosses deep from the right. Johnstone rises to claim the ball, while Terry eases Assombalonga out of the road underneath. Boro make a half-arsed claim for a penalty, but that’s never going to happen. 68 min: A free kick for Boro out on the left and a chance to load the box. Which they do, but it’s a futile effort, because Besic blooters a wild free kick over everyone and out for a goal kick. 66 min: Howson and Besic one-two crisply down the middle of the park. It’s a lovely move, and Besic then slips the ball wide right for Fabio, who bursts into the box. Fabio might as well shoot, really, because there’s nobody bar the heavily marked Assombalonga in the middle, but he doesn’t fancy the tight angle and cuts it back instead. To nobody. 65 min: Ayala is replaced by Fabio. That was preposterous, really, it was obvious even to a quack watching on television that the player was in pain. I have no idea why Boro sent him back onto the field. 64 min: Ayala takes up possession 30 yards from his own goal. He’s in obvious distress, and it’s all he can do to swivel and hoick the ball straight out of play, lest he make some sort of dreadful mistake. He can’t put any weight on his leg. 62 min: He’s trying to continue, but it doesn’t look good. He grimaces in pain as he steps back onto the field, and immediately looks back to the bench with sad eyes. But for now, he limps on. 61 min: Ayala has injured himself in the process of stopping Grealish in his tracks. He’s hurt his knee, and looks in a lot of pain. For a second it looks like he won’t be able to continue, but eventually gets up, limps off, and is given a talking-to by Pulis on the sideline. He’ll try to continue. 59 min: Traore over-elaborates 30 yards from his own goal. He loses possession to Grealish, who should send a shot goalwards, but doesn’t. Ayala blocks him. Grabban has a whack as the ball runs loose, but Traore deals with that one. A rare second-half attack for Villa, and a let-off for Boro. 57 min: It comes to nothing. Boro have enjoyed the lion’s share of possession since the restart, but Villa look pretty comfortable. 56 min: Traore spins Hutton down the left. Hutton tries to drag him back. The whistle goes for a free kick, though as Traore had continued to run at, and get the better of, Snodgrass, Boro aren’t happy. Still, a set piece in Villa’s final third. 54 min: Boro continue to push Villa back. Downing shimmies along the right and wins a corner. He takes it himself, long. Ayala tries to guide a header goalwards, but it’s bundled clear. Besic probes down the right and curls towards the near post, where Shotton bundles out for a goal kick. 52 min: Howson runs at the Villa back line with great intent. It’s a determined run which gets the visitors looking concerned for the first time since the restart, but when he lays off to Besic, the thrust of the move dies. The ball’s recycled, but Villa have regrouped, and Assombalonga drags a fairly lame shot wide left from distance. 50 min: Traore bursts down the left, a fine run for a while, but it ends sadly with a heavy touch that forces him out of play for a goal kick. The Riverside is a bit subdued for the first time this evening. 49 min: Gibson is booked for a fairly agricultural lunge on Jedinak. He doesn’t bother complaining. 48 min: But otherwise, it’s been a slow start to the second half. Grealish tries to spark it into life with a run down the left, but he’s ushered out of play by Besic. 46 min: Friend immediately tears down the left wing. He goes nowhere, but that was hectic enough to suggest Mr Pulis has given his team a bit of a talking-to during the break. And we’re off again! Middlesbrough get the party underway again, albeit after a false restart. No half-time changes. “Play offs should come with a government health warning,” writes the nanny state’s Simon McMahon. “After watching Dundee United bottle it at Livingston last night, was at Cowdenbeath, aka the Blue Brazil, today to see them preserve their league status with a crazy 3-2 victory over Cove Rangers. Shakespeare couldn’t script what happens in the play offs, and there’s more drama to come for sure.” Half-time reading. There’s been some other meaningful end-of-season action today. In the League One play-offs, Scunthorpe forced a dramatic late draw with Rotherham. Meanwhile Tranmere Rovers are back in the Football League, despite having been reduced to ten men after a first-minute sending off in the National League promotion final against Boreham Wood. Barry Glendenning was at Wembley for that one. And that’s that for the second half. Villa have the advantage thanks to Jedinak’s header; they’d be in total control had Randolph not made that wonder save from Snodgrass. Boro need something in the second half, or they’ll have a hell of a task turning this round at Villa Park. 45 min +1: Friend is booked for an out-of-control run and leap into Jedinak. That seemed a bit of an unnecessary and pointless challenge. 45 min: Traore dribbles in from the left and looks for the top-right corner of the Villa net. Not quite. 44 min: And then Snodgrass drops a shoulder to cut in from the right, curling towards the top left. It’s a wonderful shot, but Randolph stretches out and fingertips it onto the left-hand post. The ball rebounds away to safety. What a shot ... and an even better save! Happy birthday to the Boro keeper, then, 31 years old today. 43 min: Hourihane tries to release Adomah down the left. Ayala should tidy up, but he hesitates after intercepting and that allows Adomah to pick the ball up and consider a shot. He doesn’t have a go, but Villa stay on the attack, pressing Boro back. 41 min: Traore sees a shot from distance deflected out for a corner. Ayala flashes a header on target from the set piece, but Johnstone gathers. Good luck predicting who’ll score next, because both teams are doing their damndest. 39 min: Grealish embarks on another Gazza-style run, this time down the middle of the park from the halfway line. It’s a gravity-defying dribble, as he rides a couple of barges, and it showcases plenty of ball-glued-to-toe skill ... but the minute he enters the area, he’s blocked by Ayala before he can get a shot away. What a stunning run, though. 37 min: A cross curled into the Villa box from the left by Friend. Assombalonga stoops at the near post and tries to guide a header into the bottom left, but Johnstone drops to smother. Assombalonga has had three decent chances in the last six minutes. He should have done better with all of them. 36 min: Besic tees up Adam Clayton, 25 yards out. The ball sails off into the blood-red sky. 35 min: The first slight lull of the match. It’s been otherwise thoroughly entertaining, despite the high stakes, so let’s give the lads a break, they deserve it. 33 min: These teams are beginning to give up chances now. Howson dances through the middle of the park before sliding another fine pass down the inside-left channel for Assombalonga. This time the striker takes a touch before rippling the side netting from a tight-ish angle. 32 min: Adomah drops a shoulder to earn some space on the left, then whips high into the Boro box. Snodgrass rises over Friend, and should be planting his header on target, but over it goes from close range. 31 min: Howson, quarterbacking from deep, finds Assombalonga down the inside-left channel. The striker has a yard on Chester, but thrashes a wild shot high and left of the target when he really should have worked Johnstone. 29 min: As Terry continues to limp around, Traore wins a corner down the Boro right. The first corner leads to another, and then Hutton very nearly eyebrows one into the top left of his own goal. A third corner to come, this time from the left. And this time Hutton batters a clearing header off his own line, the corner having been swung in at pace by Traore. 27 min: Besic attempts to inject some life into Boro’s play, bursting down the inside-right channel but failing to find the nearby Assombalonga with a lay-off. Terry, chasing Besic, might have taken a knock or pulled something there. He’s hopping around a bit, anyway. 25 min: A stat on Sky which may give Boro pause: Villa are unbeaten this season after scoring the first goal. 23 min: Villa hit the right-hand corner deep. Terry rises at the far post, Randolph having been taken out of play, but can only bundle the ball wide left. Boro were living dangerously there, though, and Villa are very much on top now. 22 min: Traore slides in on Grealish. He catches the Villa man on the back of his leg. Accidental, but oof, ow, ooyah, etc. From the free kick, Jedinak’s backwards header threatens to loop into the top right. Randolph claims, but clatters into the post and drops the ball, out for a corner. 20 min: Grealish dribbles in from the left, Gazza style, but his shot from just inside the box isn’t up to the quality of the run. Randolph gathers the pea-roller. 19 min: Snodgrass falls over while dribbling down the right. He grabs the ball, wanting a free kick. But there was nothing wrong with the attention of Friend, and so that’s a free kick to Boro instead. There’s quite an edgy feel to this match; don’t be surprised if it boils over into a brouhaha at some point. 17 min: The Riverside took a while to process that goal, so absurdly simple it seemed. Boro try to respond immediately. A throw’s won deep in Villa territory down the left. Friend spends an age towelling off the ball to get extra purchase ... then flings it straight out of play for a goal kick. Well this was simple! Adomah wins a corner for Villa down the left. Then Jedinak rises to meet Grealish’s corner at the left-hand corner of the six-yard box, guiding it into the bottom right. There’s nobody on the post, so in it flies! 13 min: Hourihane, who was pushing his luck in the first 30 seconds of this match, goes in the book. It’s for hanging an arm into the startled grid of Besic, as the pair contest a high ball. Terry critiques the referee’s work: he’s told in no uncertain terms to stop his yap. 12 min: Besic looks in the mood for this. Twice he runs at the Villa defence within the space of 20 seconds or so. On both occasions, the visitors look to be in a state of panic and only just manage to stop Besic in full flow from breaking through. 11 min: Shotton sends a Delap-style throw into the Villa box from the right. It’s half cleared, to Besic, who caresses a dipping screamer inches wide of the top-left corner. Le Tissier-esque. A pleasing 90s vibe to minute 11: one for the mums and dads. 10 min: The set piece is a waste of time. 9 min: But Boro respond to that period of pressure well, Besic dribbing at great speed down the inside-right channel. He’s crowded out of it before he can shoot. But they come again, Friend and Downing combining well to earn another corner, this time on the left. 7 min: Villa are beginning to dominate these early stages. Grealish is buzzing around with purpose. His prompting pushes Boro back. There’s a little space for Snodgrass on the edge of the box, but instead of shooting he tries to slide the ball forward for Grabban. Wrong decision. Boro intercept and clear their lines. 5 min: It’s high-octane stuff. And a little bit scrappy. Passing moves at a premium. A lot of tackles flying in. Howson crashes into Grealish, leaving the Villa man on the floor. No free kick. All very old-fashioned, and there’s nothing wrong with that. 3 min: ... Traore loops an obvious ball in from the right and it’s easily snaffled by Johnstone. 2 min: An ear-bothering noise at the Riverside. Howson bursts down the right and wins the first corner of the match. From which ... And we’re off! Villa get the party started. Hourihane clatters into Clayton, and gets a good talking-to from the ref for sliding in studs showing, forcefully, not totally within reason. Had there been more than 15 seconds on the clock, that might have been a booking. The teams are out! Boro are in their red shirts with famous white stripe, while Villa play in second-choice black. There’s a thundering atmosphere at the Riverside, ahead of this crucial match. And it’s been a tear-jerking one too: the popular Leo Percovich took to the centre circle to emotionally thank fans for their support in the wake of the recent tragic car accident that took the lives of the 50-year-old Uruguayan’s young daughters Antonella and Valentina. We’ll be off in a minute. Tony Pulis speaks - and is asked about Boro’s record of only winning one game all season against teams who finished in the top six. “The game is the game, no two games are the same. We have to approach it in the right manner, make sure we do our best, and give everything. If we get the breaks, and things go our way, then fine. But if we don’t, we still have the second game to come. But the teams we have played recently - the Derbys, the Bristol Citys, the Millwalls - they’ve all been up there. We’ve won those games.” Steve Bruce speaks! “People hit form and people drop out of form a little bit. Rotating in recent weeks has enabled me to make sure everybody is ready if needed. That’s been vitally important. We’ve cemented our place in the play-offs for a long time, so it’s enabled me to do that. But the team I have picked today are the ones that have predominantly got us into this position. I think it’s only fair that they’re the ones to try and take us a little bit further. No doubt Tony has sprinkled a little bit of his magic, and they’re the in-form team of the division. We’re two really good teams who have been competing against each other so it should be the makings of a classic game!” The winners of this tie will face either Derby County or Fulham in the Wembley final in a fortnight’s time. The Cottagers have been everybody’s favourites to get through the other semi, though the odds on the Rams springing a surprise at the expense of the current hipsters’ choice have shortened considerably in the wake of their hard-fought victory in the first leg at Pride Park last night. Nick Miller was there to report on proceedings. Pre-match reading: Our very own Louise Taylor previews the big game, on a day when Leo Percovich, Boro’s former goalkeeping coach, returns to the Riverside in poignant circumstances. Tony Pulis always said he would name the same XI that started Boro’s last game, the 2-2 draw at Ipswich. And he’s done exactly that. It means Patrick Bamford, whose last-minute equaliser in that match was his 13th goal of the season, stays on the bench. Steve Bruce rings the changes, having named an experimental Villa side for the 1-0 defeat at Millwall. Mark Bunn, Josh Onomah, Scott Hogan and Jonathan Kodjia drop to the bench, while James Bree and Henri Lansbury miss out altogether. In come Sam Johnstone, Ahmed Elmohamady, John Terry, Robert Snodgrass, Jack Grealish and Lewis Grabban. Middlesbrough: Randolph, Shotton, Ayala, Gibson, Friend, Howson, Clayton, Besic, Traore, Assombalonga, Downing. Subs: Konstantopoulos, Da Silva, Leadbitter, Bamford, Cranie, Fry, Harrison. Aston Villa: Johnstone, Elmohamady, Chester, Terry, Hutton, Jedinak, Snodgrass, Hourihane, Grealish, Adomah, Grabban. Subs: Samba, Whelan, Hogan, Onomah, Bjarnason, Kodjia, Bunn. Referee: Robert Madley (West Yorkshire). In January 1950, legendary inside-forward Wilf Mannion inspired Middlesbrough to a 3-0 FA Cup victory over Aston Villa. The tie had gone to a second replay, at neutral Elland Road, which meant the teams would play each other on five occasions that season. For the record, Villa had the better of it in the League, winning 4-0 at Villa Park just five days later. The clubs will meet again and again and again and again this season, as well. By the time this new-fangled play-off semi-final has been decided, these famous old clubs will have racked up five meetings in a season for the first time in 68 years. Once again Villa have had the better of it in the League - Robert Snodgrass scoring the only goal in the two games, at the Riverside just before the turn of the year - while Boro have prevailed in the cup competitions, Patrick Bamford’s brace doing for Villa in the League Cup. So this is in the balance. Middlesbrough are hoping to bounce back to the Premier League at the first time of asking. This is their fourth play-off campaign. In the past, they’ve lost a final to Norwich City in 2015, and a semi against Neil Warnock’s promotion-bound Notts County in 1991. They also famously leapfrogged Chelsea in the two-legged 1988 final, winning promotion while sending the Blues down. By contrast, grand old Villa - the seven-time English and one-time European champions, slumming it in the lower divisions for a second year - are contesting the play-offs for the very first time. But they’re not entering the lion’s den without whip or chair: their boss Steve Bruce has successfully navigated the play-offs twice before, with Birmingham City in 2002 and Hull in 2016. This promises to be a cracker, then, between two of English football’s bigger names. And we’re not just talking about Brucie and Tony Pulis. It’s Boro! It’s Villa! It’s the semi-final of the Championship play-offs, so close to the promised land of the Premier League! It’s on! Kick off: 5.15pm."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"film/2018/may/11/ash-is-purest-white-review-chinese-gangsters-girlfriend-saga-burns-bright","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-11T21:42:14Z","webTitle":"Ash Is Purest White review – Chinese gangster’s girlfriend saga burns bright","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/may/11/ash-is-purest-white-review-chinese-gangsters-girlfriend-saga-burns-bright","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/may/11/ash-is-purest-white-review-chinese-gangsters-girlfriend-saga-burns-bright","fields":{"headline":"Ash Is Purest White review – Chinese gangster’s girlfriend saga burns bright","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"With Ash is Purest White, the always surprising, habitually envelope-pushing film-maker Jia Zhang-ke gives us a complex romantic tragedy from China’s aspirational gangster-classes. And there’s an eerie futurist sheen: a miasma of visionary strangeness that gives a distinct glow to the social-realist grit. As so often with this director, the turn of the century is the key moment — when China began to embrace capitalism, competition, rapid expansion and the Westernised status symbols like smartphones. In the year 2001, we see people dancing to the Village People’s YMCA at a party. As with the rousing rendition of the Pet Shop Boys’ Go West in his previous film, Mountains May Depart, it is a presentiment of that brave new world to come. Qiao, played by the director’s partner and longtime repertory player Tao Shao, is a young woman who lives in a depressed coal-mining town where the pit is about to be closed. Her angry widowed dad is always railing at the official corruption and cronyism that has contributed to the industry’s decline. But she herself is hardly beyond criticism. Qiao is the girlfriend of Bin (Fan Liao), a tough and good-looking young jianghu, or gangster who hangs out all day at the local club playing Mah-Jong and drinking. Occasionally, he takes meetings at a nightclub with his own boss, a crooked property developer with a bizarre obsession with ballroom dancing — he actually brings two favoured ballroom dancers to the club with him and insists the pop music is turned off and replaced with something more congenial to the cha-cha-cha display that his two protégés will now put on for the baffled but obedient crowd. When this boss is murdered in a turf war — occasioning a gloriously surreal display of ballroom dancing at his funeral — it promotes Bin to a de facto leadership level for which he is not ready, and exposes him to attacks. There is a great martial-arts scene scene when opposing wiseguys drag Bin out of his car on a crowded street and he tries taking them all on. But just as they are about to beat him to death, Qiao takes a fateful decision. She produces the handgun that Bin had confiscated from one of his quarrelling consiglieri at the club and fires it in the air. The terrified thugs run, Qiao and Bin are both arrested and the devoted Qiao takes the rap for her boyfriend; she claims the gun belonged to her. When her Dostoevskian five-year prison sentence ends (much longer than his) she finds that life and the Chinese economy and all her old mobbed-up pals have moved on to legitimate businesses well away from her depressed hometown. And Bin himself has gone and found himself a new girlfriend. All her romantic idealism had been for nothing. So in a spirit of revenge, she sets out to track him down — but also, more ambiguously, and desperately, to track herself down, to track down what possible future now remains for her at the bottom of the social heap in this new go-getting society. The film shows that she becomes a figure of resourcefulness, ingenuity and cunning, hanging out at a restaurant and tricking likely-looking rich male diners out of their money simply by sidling up to them and saying: “I’m her sister — she’s had a miscarriage.” There are more than enough guilty philanderers for the ploy to work at least once. And her own experience with toxic masculine disloyalty has given her a nose for playing this kind of con. But there’s more to it than just revenge. Qiao has already taken a boat trip to the Three Gorges Dam (the subject of Jia Zhang-ke’s Golden-Lion-winning 2008 film Still Life) and pondered the fact that this is about to obliterate most of the buildings on the landscape. Later has a deeply weird epiphanic experience: a kind of sci-fi transcendence. A talkative chancer on a train tries chatting her up with a ridiculous line about offering her a job in the research unit he runs for investigating UFO sightings. Qiao claims that she has had just such a vision; each knows the other is lying. But there is a kind of passionate or compassionate spark between them, at least here is some romance, some escape, some direction in this fantasy. And then Qiao genuinely does appear to have a cosmic revelation which is to guide her, obscurely, back to Bin, allowing her to bring him home to the shabby little no-horse town they started out in. It’s where they once gazed at an extinct volcano on the skyline and Qiao pondered something she once read — that volcanic ash is the brightest shade of white, because something that burns at such a high temperature has to be pure. And have Bin and Qiao been burned and tempered and purified by life’s fire? Not quite. They seem to be an ashy, mucky grey. Their life together in this final act has a kind of tragic melancholy. Hard-drinking, hard-living Bin is now a stroke survivor using a wheelchair — a greatly reduced figure, like a malevolent version of Mr Rochester in Jane Eyre, but quite without the redemptive experience of love. Qiao herself is older, almost an old woman, but strong, self-reliant, almost a jianghu gang boss on her own account and unburdened by illusions and desires. What does the ending of Ash Is Purest White mean — and what does its middle or beginning mean? I’m not sure. It feels like a gripping parable for the vanity of human wishes, and another impassioned portrait of national malaise."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/blog/2018/may/12/arsene-wenger-arsenal-arseblog","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-12T17:00:36Z","webTitle":"Life down an Arsène Wenger YouTube rabbit hole at three in the morning","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/may/12/arsene-wenger-arsenal-arseblog","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2018/may/12/arsene-wenger-arsenal-arseblog","fields":{"headline":"Life down an Arsène Wenger YouTube rabbit hole at three in the morning","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Arsène Wenger’s head fell off and rolled across the glass table before plunging on to my living room floor. Last week, an hour after Arsenal had lost to Atlético Madrid, to ruin the fleeting dream of Wenger’s final match as manager being in the Europa League final, I had lifted up the old bobble-head and prepared to move it back to the window sill. As a family joke, and a worrying sign of my lifelong support of Arsenal, I had been given this wonderfully naff homage to the club’s greatest-ever manager years ago. The Wenger bobble-head had stayed in my office until March 2013 when, after a 3-1 home defeat against Bayern Munich, we needed a miracle in the second leg. Wenger was placed on the glass table in front of the television and Arsenal were rejuvenated. We beat Bayern 2-0 in Munich, only to suffer a familiar Champions League exit on away goals. But the mysterious force of the bobble-head had to be relied upon from that night as one Arsenal pattern – defeat in the last 16 – was replaced by another, in the habitual struggle to make the top four. With mini-Arsène in place, Arsenal went on an unbeaten 10-game run to steal fourth spot from Spurs by a point. Over the last two seasons of Wenger’s 22 years as manager, as the top-four tradition slid away, the world divided Arsenal’s fans into Wenger Out or Wenger In camps. It was hardly more subtle in our house. Should mini-Arsène watch the next game or did he deserve to be consigned to the window sill in his long zippered coat? Since Wenger announced his decision on 20 April to leave the club on Sunday, he has been on the glass table for every game. Yet the bobbled Arsène could not spook Diego Costa or Diego Simeone as Arsenal lost their last meaningful match under Wenger. The roll of his head, as I picked him up, felt symbolic. Andrew Allen, another Arsenal fan, endured a more testing ordeal that night. As deputy news editor at Arseblog, the celebrated Arsenal fan website which its founder and chief writer, Andrew Mangan, began in 2002, Allen was bereft of words as he tried to start his post-match analysis. “It’s very rare I get the responsibility to write the main blog,” Allen says, “and I knew if we won it’s easier to write. But, after we lost, I sat in front of the laptop for an hour trying to find an introductory paragraph. I couldn’t do it. Eventually I began jotting down moments from all these years under Arsène. It spiralled out of control and at three in the morning I was still there, down a YouTube rabbit hole, with the occasional tear and glass of wine. It poured out.” The next morning I still felt sad that Wenger’s last game in charge will be away to Huddersfield, rather than at home in France, in Lyon, against an old enemy, Marseille, in a European final he longed to win. But, turning to my usual read of Arseblog, there was no match report. Instead, the headline read: “No European Trophy. No Happy Ending. But…” Allen then listed 197 moments and memories, mishaps and milestones, stretching from “Three League titles. Thierry Henry. Giroud’s scorpion kick. Chu-Young Park. Paris in the pouring rain. Santi’s dancing feet. It’s Thierry Henry, he’s scored, he’s scored for Arsenal in the Bernabéu! Wright breaking Bastin’s record. Cesc’s mullet. Sol on a free. Abou’s ankles. Broccoli” to “Blackcurrant shirts. Giroud’s abs. It’s only Ray Parlour. Henry looping it over Barthez. Pizzagate. Pires … it was in from the moment he hit it! Santi’s cup final free-kick. Together. The Invincibles. 22 years. Thanks for the memories, boss. Thank you so much.” “I’ve written 3,500 articles for Arseblog News,” Allen explains, “but it’s rare I get to show emotion and the feedback was amazing. Even last Sunday [before Wenger’s final home game] strangers in the pub came up and said: ‘Oh, what about this or that one?’” He has equally evocative memories of that sun-kissed afternoon at the Emirates as, after a 5-0 demolition of Burnley, Wenger felt the Arsenal love again. “It was very emotional,” Allen says. “I sit next to my mum and dad and all three of us didn’t look at each other when Wenger spoke. I didn’t want my mum to see me tearing up and I don’t think she wanted me to see her tearing up. His name was sung with passion and it was a kind of joy. It took me over the edge.” Mangan, who lives in Dublin, flew in for the game. As the voice of Arseblog, he has probably written more words about Wenger than anyone else since 2002. “I won’t ever write as many words about another individual,” he says. “Arsène has been a constant in my life for 16 years – and the six years before I started the website. “For a long time Arsenal fans have been divided into unnecessary camps of Wenger In or Out. But the vast majority have a far more nuanced view of the last 22 years. So being there, listening to the fans sing with one voice about Arsène, felt cathartic. It felt healing. “It reminded me of the end of the Champions League final in 2006 when we lost [having been 1-0 up against Barcelona with 14 minutes left]. It was raining in Paris, and heartbreaking, but I’ll never forget the Arsenal fans singing. It was awful to lose but there was something really special after the game where all you could see was this sea of yellow. That was true of Sunday. There was a sea of red but the mood wasn’t mawkish. It was joyous and celebratory.” It seems true to real life that Wenger’s grand yet flawed 22-year reign should end in a meaningless game at Huddersfield. The home side avoided relegation on Wednesday and so, as the game will not be televised, Allen will “use some dodgy stream” to write a match report. “Our away form is ridiculous [Arsenal have not won a single away point in 2018] but there’s something weirdly fitting about ending up at Huddersfield where Herbert Chapman [another great Arsenal manager who enjoyed such success in the 1920s and 30s] made his name. “Of course it’s not the same as a European final in Lyon – and that’s why I was devastated last week. We all thought: ‘Please, please, let him win a European trophy.’ Of course I’m going to Lyon anyway. I have tickets, the hotel is booked. It was a choice between Arsène Wenger and Diego Costa. Diego won.” Allen sighs when asked who he might support in the final. “I don’t know. Me and my friends just might take a big Arsène banner.” Wenger has described his career at Arsenal as “a love affair”. Mangan hesitates when considering the phrase as a fan and writer who has examined Wenger’s attributes and failings so closely. “A love affair is too passionate for me. That stems from the frustration of the last years. It’s a relationship built on love and respect for a guy who came in when nobody knew him. He proved himself as a great manager and a great man. He was successful and he changed English football – and the perception of foreign managers and players. He was so brilliant there was always a yearning for him to replicate that in later years and it didn’t quite happen. I wanted Arsenal to win under Arsène – because of this respect, admiration and pride when you heard him talk about Arsenal, football and society. “Of course he’s an obsessive. On his birthday they asked him what was he going to do and he said: ‘I’ll watch a second division German game.’ The journalist urged him to celebrate his birthday. Wenger said: ‘I’ll put some candles on the top of my TV if that makes you happy.’ Arsène’s real passion was always football. That’s probably not too healthy but it’s a fundamental part of why he was in this job so long.” The Arseblog writers offer an often painful insight into Wenger’s failings. “In some ways his biggest fallibility was his willingness to be a force field who ensured all criticism centred upon him,” Allen suggests. “His refusal to throw players under the bus was beautiful but sometimes the players needed to be called out. Some of the signings were very odd – remember André Santos – but you never knew whether Wenger had more money to spend.” Allen was 13 when Wenger took over Arsenal in September 1996 and the Frenchman has given him some of the sweetest moments of his life. “Winning the title at Old Trafford in that double-winning season [in May 2002] was unbelievable. I was at university and had an exam at 9am the next morning. At 3am I was dancing outside Highbury, jumping around with strangers, after beating United on their own turf at the height of that rivalry. The Invincibles get the plaudits – but that 2002 team? Man, they were something else. The connections between Bergkamp, Ljungberg, Henry and Pires were beautiful.” How did Allen do in his exam? “I was studying Russian history at UCL, which is slightly niche. But I scraped through. Then, at the start of 2004-05 season, after we’d won the league and gone unbeaten, the first seven games were fantastic. I remember playing Middlesborough on another glorious summer day and my brother and I said: ‘How many will we score today?’ You know it can’t go on like this for much longer – but you never want to look that far down the line.” Amid the poignance of Wenger’s leaving there is the thrilling uncertainty of a new era. “I definitely have feelings of excitement around a new manager,” Mangan stresses. “What’s going to happen now? Who is it going to be? What kind of football does he like? What kind of a man is he? Who will he sign? How many of Arsenal’s values will be upheld? It would be awful to get a manager like Mourinho with no interest in young players. Maybe that’s just us being romantic Arsenal fans. Maybe we need to be more pragmatic.” Mangan and Allen would choose Massimiliano Allegri, the Juventus manager, to replace Wenger. “I like the idea of Allegri,” Mangan says. “He’s more defensively minded than Wenger. With our attack a manager who focuses on the defensive side, with the right organisation and personnel, could make everything gel. It’s hard to imagine, when you’ve got Mkhitaryan, Lacazette, Aubameyang, Özil and Ramsey, a new manager will do what Jack Charlton did to John Aldridge – and make them defend from the front and inhibit their attacking quality. “After 22 years there is excitement about something fresh and new. Even the uncertainty is interesting. We don’t know what the new guy is going to do or how he’s going to do it. We don’t know how it will work with the director of football, head of recruitment and chief executive all taking a prominent role. It’s a brave new world.” An Allegri-shaped world? “It’s just a gut feeling but they might go with somebody younger and less experienced,” Mangan says. “The power dynamic has been so weighted in favour of the manager they might go another way. If it’s Allegri or Luis Enrique they will have to defer to them. My gut says they might go for Mikel Arteta or Patrick Vieira.” Our Wenger bobble-head will be moved back to its final resting place, in my office. I like the idea of a mini-Max Allegri on the glass table but Allen also suspects it could be a different name. “I’m open to something left-field,” he says. “But every two or three years we’ll probably be changing our manager and that will be really hard to get used to. After Arsène, we’re in the madhouse with everyone else now.” Montage: David McCoy/Guardian Imaging"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/may/12/isis-jihadist-manual-analysed-rebutted-by-islamic-scholar","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-12T23:05:43Z","webTitle":"The core Isis manual that twisted Islam to legitimise barbarity","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/12/isis-jihadist-manual-analysed-rebutted-by-islamic-scholar","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/12/isis-jihadist-manual-analysed-rebutted-by-islamic-scholar","fields":{"headline":"The core Isis manual that twisted Islam to legitimise barbarity","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"The jihadist manual behind the brutality that underpinned Islamic State has been revealed for the first time in new analysis of a 579-page text, written by the Isis ideologue Abu Abdullah al-Muhajir. The text attempts to legitimise the barbarous acts of the jihadist group, including the mutilation of corpses, the trade in human organs, beheading, the killing of children along with “scorched earth operations” and global terrorist attacks. After two years examining and transcribing the document, experts at the counter-extremist group Quilliam have completed a meticulous appraisal of the extremists’ core textbook along with a robust theological rebuttal of its “twisted” interpretation of Islamic teachings. Used by Isis and its supporters to validate a large range of horrific acts, the “bible for jihadists” provided the theoretical and legal framework for the violent terrorist group. “There is a startling lack of study and concern regarding this abhorrent and dangerous text in almost all western and Arab scholarship,” says the report. “We hope to expose and deconstruct this unprepossessing yet deeply insidious and pernicious text.” Known as the Fiqh al-Dima (or The Jurisprudence of Blood), the book is the key Salafi-jihadist text. It attempts to justify the use of weapons of mass destruction, perpetrating genocide, the murder of non-combatants, the taking of sex slaves and hostages. Researchers for Quilliam managed to acquire a copy of the manual online in 2015, after researchers spotted the Fiqh al-Dima being used to teach new recruits to Isis’s caliphate in Syria. Back then, Islamic State’s self-styled caliphate encompassed vast swaths of Syria and Iraq and a population of up to eight million. Since then the group has lost 98% of territory in the two countries and is now largely confined to a strip of desert straddling the Iraqi-Syrian border. The manual offers the group guidance on “military retreat” with a chapter devoted to “surrender vs fighting to the death” that says jihadists should choose death instead of handing themselves over to the enemy. However, Sheikh Salah al-Ansari, a senior Quilliam researcher who translated the manual from Arabic and wrote the rebuttal, said no religious requirement existed to “fight to the death” and that the Islamic tradition of warfare encouraged the humane treatment of prisoners of war. “Our work comprehensively debunks and rejects Isis’s proto-Islamic arguments, demonstrating their ignorance and disregard for traditional Islamic scholarship as well as for the basic humane and Islamic values of mercy and compassion,” said Ansari. The titles of the text’s 20 chapters include “Beheading, decapitation and mutilation”, “Kidnapping warring infidels” and “How to kill spies”. Another chapter, titled “Indiscriminate killing of warring infidels”, opens with an inflammatory message that calls for force to be used against unbelievers: “Kill them, fight them by every means that may snatch away their souls, drive their spirits from their bodies, cleansing the earth of their filth and removing their scourge from mankind, whatever that means may be.” A separate chapter documents attempts to justify the use of weapons of mass destruction. “The central aim for which we strive – and we do so with all available strength – is the acquisition of weapons, weapons of mass destruction, for there is no escaping the obligation to defend against these defiant perverters of faith and end the aggression of the malodorous filth against Islam and its people,” writes Muhajir, the Isis author. Each point he makes is theologically rebutted by Quilliam using the Qur’an, Islamic teachings and reference to acts prohibited by Islamic warfare ethics and Islamic morality. “This text offers intricate details on the use of jihad in its traditional Sunni discussion, and misuses these features to provide Islamic legal cover to terrorist operations,” said Ansari. Among one of its central strands is the distinction between the “lands of Islam” and the “lands of unbelief (kufr)” and the notion that jihadists are entitled to fight the unbelievers. “This entire binary construct is a later invention of Muslim theologians that is now obsolete, and so the justification of excommunication (takfir) and military attacks against civilians on this basis is completely absurd,” says the Quilliam report. Even so, Ansari said history had proved that some were swayed by the text, even chapters 11 and 12, which attempt to provide an Islamic sanction for the mutilation of bodies, the cutting of body parts and beheading. “A susceptible and vulnerable reader who has no previous training in Islamic jurisprudence might easily become seduced by this book because it is written in a way that gives the impression that it has religious weight. While the text is somewhat based on traditional readings, it does not reflect the diverse and pluralistic complexities of Islamic rulings,” said Ansari. The jihadis’ interpretation of jihad – the text has also been used by al-Qaida and Nigeria’s militant Islamist group, Boko Haram, to justify and commit atrocities – would have been core teachings to Isis’s 6,000 European Muslims who travelled to the calpihate, of which about 850 were British. “They would have been introduced to this book, it is their bible, their most important text,” said Ansari."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/may/12/antonio-conte-emelano-chelsea-tough-season","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-12T21:30:41Z","webTitle":"Antonio Conte points to Emenalo exit as key factor in Chelsea’s tough season","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/12/antonio-conte-emelano-chelsea-tough-season","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/12/antonio-conte-emelano-chelsea-tough-season","fields":{"headline":"Antonio Conte points to Emenalo exit as key factor in Chelsea’s tough season","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Antonio Conte has pointed to the departure of Michael Emenalo as Chelsea’s technical director in the autumn as a key moment in a difficult campaign, as the Italian prepares for what could be his final league game in charge of the club. Emenalo, one of Roman Abramovich’s most trusted lieutenants, ended a 10-year association with Chelsea in early November despite the owner having personally attempted to persuade him to stay on. The former Nigeria defender had cited a desire to spend more time with his young family, although, as it transpired, he would take up a similar position at the then French champions Monaco a little over three weeks later. Conte had benefited from Emenalo, a calm voice in an emotional boardroom, as a conduit between coaching staff and club hierarchy, and, while the head coach’s frustrations over recruitment policy over the summer had been perceived as criticisms of the technical director, the tensions had eased in their relationship by the time of his departure. “To lose Michael, it was a big loss for us, yes,” said the Italian, whose team travel to Newcastle on Sunday with only slim hopes of securing a top‑four finish. “I think so, I think so. Also because Michael did a great job for this club for many years. Last season he helped me a lot during the season. This season, until he left, he helped me a lot. I remember very well he left just after the Manchester United game … For me, for sure, it was a big loss in November.” Chelsea, who spent around £50m in the January transfer window on three new players, are still determining whether or not to replace Emenalo directly or dilute the role’s duties, many of which are now being overseen by the influential director Marina Granovskaia. Informal talks have taken place with some prospective candidates for the position but the situation will be formally addressed only in the summer. Asked whether appointing a new technical director should be made a matter of urgency, Conte said: “But this is not my decision. As you know very well, my task is to work very hard. This is not my decision. This is the decision for others. I’m not in a position to say [whether an expert in that field should be hired].” Chelsea must win on Tyneside and hope Liverpool lose at home to Brighton if they are to qualify for next season’s Champions League and Conte is expected to depart, regardless, after the team’s appearance in the FA Cup final on Saturday. The Italian intends to return to Milan for Andrea Pirlo’s testimonial game on 21 May having made clear he has not, as yet, been asked to attend any meetings with his club immediately after the conclusion of the domestic season. Thibaut Courtois, absent for Wednesday’s 1-1 draw with Huddersfield, is expected to be fit. Olivier Giroud and Eden Hazard are among those likely to be restored to the starting lineup but the defenders David Luiz (knee) and Ethan Ampadu (ankle) are out."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/may/11/derby-county-fulham-championship-play-off-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-11T20:53:15Z","webTitle":"Cameron Jerome header gives Derby slender advantage over Fulham","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/11/derby-county-fulham-championship-play-off-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/11/derby-county-fulham-championship-play-off-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Cameron Jerome header gives Derby slender advantage over Fulham","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The side who finished sixth in the Championship have not won promotion through the play-offs since Blackpool managed it in 2010. Derby County have spent the intervening years seemingly finding new and more elaborate ways not to go up but they took a step towards the top flight with a battling 1-0 win over Fulham in the first leg of their semi-final on Friday night. This was a granite solid performance from Derby, defending Cameron Jerome’s first-half header as if the very future of the club depended on it, and keeping Ryan Sessegnon and Aleksandar Mitrovic, who have laid waste to the Championship at times this season, quiet all night. “You have to do that against Fulham,” said the Derby manager, Gary Rowett, afterwards. “We were very, very disciplined.” And they were: this was the first time Fulham have failed to score in any game since January, drawing a blank here after producing a masterclass in ‘sterile domination’. Statistics do not always tell the full story but that Fulham had 74% possession and lost sums up the evening nicely. Fulham’s manager, Slavisa Jokanovic, did not seem overly concerned, though. “It’s not a bad result,” he said afterwards. “Definitely not the result we deserved. This is a very good performance from my point of view.” The game started in that usual frantic, uncoordinated mess that these play-offs tend to. Both teams tried to start on the front foot, which is a sure recipe for entertaining chaos. Fulham tried surgically to pick holes in the Derby backline but without any real joy. A couple of fairly weak efforts was the best they could manage. The Rams showed little of the same intricacy, yet their more simple approach was brilliantly rewarded in the 34th minute. Tom Huddlestone spread the ball to Craig Forsyth who, pinged over a superb cross from deep on the left, right on to the head of Jerome, who powered his effort into the net. Before the run-in Jerome had scored only once since joining Derby in January: that was his fifth in the last four games. When he signed it seemed like a curious move: now it looks inspired. The Fulham of the first half looked more like the side of the past few weeks, when they have seemed tired and tense. It is tempting to think that extraordinary run, 23 games unbeaten that nearly won them automatic promotion, had come a tiny bit too early and had sapped their energy. One could tell the travelling fans were getting nervous: at the start of the second half they started booing a ballboy. After the break their team showed more purpose: Kevin McDonald belted a shot against the bar, Floyd Ayite volleyed over from a terrific long pass by Matt Targett and Tom Cairney curled a shot just wide. Yet they struggled to create a significant chances of note. Mitrovic, so often Fulham’s brutal inspiration in the latter months of the season, struggled to find space to do much damage and began dropping deeper and deeper as he searched for the ball. Plenty of credit must go to Curtis Davies, who marshalled the big Serb superbly. “Defensively all game, we handled them really, really well,” said Rowett. Sessegnon, the boy wonder of the Championship, was also kept quiet. He was taken off with 15 minutes to go, his anonymous performance suggesting two things: that Andre Wisdom had done a fine job in neutralising him, and also that a rumoured call-up to the senior England squad is too soon for a player who does not turn 18 until next week. On the touchline, as Fulham attack after Fulham attack was snuffed out, Jokanovic, in that brooding manner of his, cast his eyes towards the ground like a parent who was not angry, just disappointed. If this often thrilling side do not go up this season, it will be a shame but in truth they deserved no more from a game where they did not make enough of their theoretical domination. They will need to be more clinical in the return on Monday. The result leaves the second leg placed beautifully. “We can’t go down there and try to protect the lead. We’ve got to try to win the game,” Rowett said, expressing the requisite degree of caution. “It gives us a slender lead but, as we know, that can be cancelled out in a second. I didn’t let them have the music on in the dressing room because we’ve got to be focused for the next game.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"music/2018/may/13/the-last-poets-understand-what-black-is-review","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-20T07:00:00Z","webTitle":"The Last Poets: Understand What Black Is review – hip-hop progenitors bounce back wiser","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/13/the-last-poets-understand-what-black-is-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/may/13/the-last-poets-understand-what-black-is-review","fields":{"headline":"The Last Poets: Understand What Black Is review – hip-hop progenitors bounce back wiser","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Born in the wake of the civil rights movement, Harlem’s Last Poets performed politically charged spoken word to musical backings. Cited alongside Gil Scott Heron as hip-hop progenitors, there’s some ambivalence to the tag. Not merely a rap history footnote, their work stands alone as “jazzoetry”. Compelled by a new civil rights struggle, the Last Poets’ first album in over 20 years marks 50 years since their founding. It finds two of the outfit’s members – Abiodun Oyewole and Umar Bin Hassan – musing long and deep to reggae backings, courtesy of Brit producers Nostalgia 77 and Prince Fatty and Poets percussionist Baba Donn Babatunde. This sonic kismet is so obvious, it’s a marvel the Poets never took to reggae previously. A skank percolates elegantly underneath the gravelly, fatherly tones of Bin Hassan and Oyewole – no longer the young firebrands who furiously indicted systemic racism in the early 70s. Drugs, crime and infighting have plagued their number; the last Poets standing are necessarily wiser and more philosophical.

For someone like myself who grew up in Edinburgh, his music always had that beautiful, distinct element of nostalgia, even before it became the music of my past – evoking messy 2010 nights at T in the Park, a now-defunct festival that was once our equivalent to Glastonbury, where we would drink lukewarm cider and kiss boys we shouldn’t. It was that bittersweet characteristic, found in both the arrangements that Frightened Rabbit produced and the yearning, terrifying quality of some of their lyrics, which kept us angsty teenagers coming back for more. There is something alluring about music that lets you feel complex emotions based on memory for the first time, especially tinged with the familiarity of experience, “dissolving in Scottish rain”. That quality of nostalgia has remained in their music. “This record is a throwback sound that appeals to my past,” Hutchison told the NME of Dance Music, his recent album with the Frightened Rabbit supergroup Mastersystem. “People have said that it’s a weird combination of nostalgia and hearing the future of something.” He recognised the feelings it evoked. Although it was once considered a disorder, research has shown that nostalgia can help people to be empathetic and deal with stress and anxiety – cementing people in their current experiences even as they reflect on their past. So, while the nostalgia experienced by listening to Frightened Rabbit might be painful at present, the brilliance of the emotion is that it is one almost always rooted in joy. For many, that is what Hutchison’s memory will bring. • In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org.

Principally, in some quarters, that Mr Mahathir, who just became the oldest leader in the world, will turn, in July, 93 years young. Even accepting the slightly different demands on Mr Mahathir, as he sets about crushing a former protege and liberating an ex-enemy whom he had imprisoned for sodomy, this important demonstration that 93 is the new 73 is likely to be welcomed (as it was, as an inspiration, on the BBC’s Today programme) by the increasing numbers of older British workers who intend never to give up their jobs – and not necessarily for financial reasons. While the abolition of the mandatory retirement age in 2011 was good news for poorer pensioners and for victims of pervasive workplace ageism, its abolition has also enabled more privileged employees to mimic the sort of high status aversion to retirement expressed by didactic magnates such as Warren Buffett or Richard Branson. From, for instance, the latter, writing in his blog: “I’ve never thought [of] work as work and play as play; to me, it’s all living and learning.” Research, too, identifies higher status professionals, such as lawyers or doctors, as more retirement-averse than less privileged or less autonomous colleagues. Abolition of the retirement age does not, as any member of Virgin West Coast’s catering staff could confirm, liberate people equally. For powerful men, there might also, as with Mr Mahathir, be an element of martyred duty. Who in the absence of Mr Mahathir was going to remind us that, as he reaffirmed to the Guardian’s Simon Tisdall in 2005: “Jews rule the world by proxy”? Actually, maybe it’s because he’s 92 that people now think he’s more harmless. “For me, to say I want to go to sleep and retire and prepare for my afterlife,” Mr Mahathir said of his political resurrection, “I think that is very selfish.” Although, as the House of Lords membership consistently demonstrates, a resourceful legislator can perfectly well juggle the two. But any septuagenarian British workers already postponing their notional departure to – if ever – a more Malaysian-style 92 or 93, should perhaps consider that employment that ends only with extinction is coming, at least to some younger colleagues, to look indistinguishable from classic, baby-boomer entitlement. Writing about protests in universities last week, my Guardian colleague Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett alluded, for instance, to “other industries and institutions top heavy with baby boomers unwilling to make room for new blood”. If she seems to make a reasonable point, opponents of mandatory retirement like to explain that this kind of thinking rehearses something called the “lump of labour” fallacy. The new report from the Resolution Foundation, with all its redistributive remedies for intergenerational unfairness, specifically dismisses allegations that the “relatively strong employment of older workers” could thereby be holding back the young, many of whom it finds stuck in lower-paid, insecure jobs. The report’s exonerating argument is certainly worth memorising by older boomers now giving up on retirement, whether they are influenced by fellow non-retirers or because of well-based fear of a Brexit-induced economic downturn. Employed over-70s should simply repeat, to any millennial who questions their right to bus passes, free prescriptions and pensions, along with ownership of their old jobs: “The labour market rarely operates as a zero-sum game.” Less readily dismissed as fallacious, perhaps, are the constraints on diversification when high status jobs continue, as in some sort of time warp, to be filled by exactly the same white, male unretirables who got them generations ago. Not one of the familiar septuagenarians who never want to stop presenting flagship BBC programmes is, as some of their former colleagues have often pointed out, female. After John Simpson, 73, of “honeytrap” fame, was offered a deal to work there indefinitely, Joan Bakewell noted the corporation’s conviction “that viewers like the craggy, Hemingwayesque faces of old men on television, but they don’t care for the faces of old women”. The BBC’s Hemingwayesque hypothesis has yet to be tested, even on the radio. The avoidance of this sort of frozen unfairness is one reason that Oxford and Cambridge universities imposed their own “employer-justified retirement age” after 2011, which was recently raised, following complaints, to 68. The universities’ arguments for a mandatory retirement age, supported by the 2011 legislation, were based on career progression and intergenerational fairness. “We cannot shy away,” said a Cambridge representative, “from the inevitable fact that opportunities to work longer will be seen to assist one generation, but may not be viewed in the same light by another.” But one, presumably unintended consequence of the 2011 abolition of the retirement age is that anything short of endless tenure can now resemble, to people in the remaining, age-limited jobs, a kind of personal affront. Why, judges want to know, shouldn’t they, too, be allowed to work until aged 75, instead of only 70? It’s not as if, unlike Mr Mahathir, any strenuous persecuting is likely to be involved. If, as opponents of mandatory retirement ages have protested, the old rules only achieve diversity and mobility via ageism, the impact of its opposite, total relaxation only encourages a different kind of exclusion, of a different demographic. Though among older workers, too, not everyone welcomes the gradual redefinition of retirement as inherently ageist; a dreadful humiliation to be triumphantly – as with Mr Mahathir – defied. No wonder, when the state fosters the Bransonesque fiction that paid work is not just valuable, but life itself, that nobody wants to surrender it to millennials. • Catherine Bennett is an Observer columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2018/may/12/ousted-malaysian-leader-najib-razak-prevented-from-leaving-country","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-12T13:36:07Z","webTitle":"Ousted Malaysian leader Najib prevented from leaving country","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/12/ousted-malaysian-leader-najib-razak-prevented-from-leaving-country","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/12/ousted-malaysian-leader-najib-razak-prevented-from-leaving-country","fields":{"headline":"Ousted Malaysian leader Najib prevented from leaving country","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"The ousted Malaysian prime minister, Najib Razak, has been prevented from leaving the country after appearing to attempt to take a flight to Indonesia. The country’s immigration department said in a brief statement on Saturday that Najib and his wife, Rosmah Mansor, have “just been blacklisted from leaving the country”. The statement came after a flight schedule had shown that Najib and his wife were due to take a private jet to Jakarta on Saturday morning. But Najib, who faces being investigated by the incoming government for alleged corruption, never appeared and the private jet, owned by Indonesian company Premiair, remained on the tarmac at Subang airport near Kuala Lumpur. Following the announcement of the ban, Najib said he and his family would respect it and stay in the country. “I have been informed that the Malaysian immigration department will not allow my family and me to go overseas,” Najib said in a tweet. “I respect the directive and will remain with my family in the country.” After the reports of his flight emerged on Friday night, dozens of people, accompanied by a large pack of journalists, had descended on the small airport just outside the capital in the early hours to protest his departure. Riot police were stationed outside the gate where people believed Najib would enter. After losing the election this week to the opposition, led by former prime minister Mahathir Mohamad, there had been concerns that Najib would try to flee the country to avoid the chance of prosecution for his alleged role in the 1MDB scandal, which he was accused of covering up while in office. Mahathir has pledged a full independent investigation into the billions of embezzled funds and many believe this will implicate Najib, who has consistently denied any wrongdoing and was previously cleared by the Malaysian attorney general. Mahathir confirmed he had already ordered the 1MDB investigation files to no longer be restricted under the Official Secrets Act. “They will then submit the report to me and I will study it,” he told a press conference on Saturday. Speaking about the re-opened 1MDB investigation Mahathir said: “We want to do it as quickly as possible.” “It is a very complex thing because it involves a lot of people, it involves a lot of decisions made, and the money you know has to be investigated as to the money laundering,” he added. “We have to contact America, Switzerland, Singapore.” By Saturday afternoon, Najib had resigned as the president of his UMNO and as chairman of the Barisan National coalition. “I have a moral responsibility to step down,” he told the party’s Supreme Council. “We all feel sad about what happened but as a party that upholds democratic principles, we accept the people’s decision.” Najib also took to twitter to apologise for his “shortcomings and mistakes”. “After over four decades in politics and the recent election campaign, which was regrettably personal and perhaps the most intense in Malaysian history, I will take a short break to spend time with my family whom I have not seen enough of in recent years,” he wrote. Najib also tweeted that he hoped the “divisive period” in the country’s history would end with unity. “I pray that after this divisive period, the country will unite. I apologise for any shortcomings and mistakes, and I thank you, the people, for the opportunity to lead our great nation. It has been the honour of my lifetime to serve you and Malaysia.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/may/11/tiger-woods-sawgrass-webb-simpson","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-11T23:38:32Z","webTitle":"Tiger Woods makes Sawgrass cut at the last as Webb Simpson sets pace","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/11/tiger-woods-sawgrass-webb-simpson","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/may/11/tiger-woods-sawgrass-webb-simpson","fields":{"headline":"Tiger Woods makes Sawgrass cut at the last as Webb Simpson sets pace","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Tiger Woods probably thought he had encountered everything in professional golf until a freakish Friday at the Players Championship. In virtually the final acts of round two, with Woods heading for an early tournament exit, the most unlikely set of events handed the 14-times major champion salvation. Woods found himself afforded cut-line hope as Justin Thomas, one of golf’s most unflappable figures, fluffed a chip at the 18th en route to a bogey. Woods still needed assistance to move back inside the top 70; as provided unwittingly by Jordan Spieth. The Texan three-putted the final green, with these instances of non-deliberate mercy sufficient to hand the Players a boost by way of Woods’s involvement over Saturday and Sunday. Woods had finished his round five and a half hours earlier. He had struggled over those 18 holes, his 71 most notable for poor iron play. His aggregate total is one under par. “I didn’t quite swing it right today,” Woods admitted. “I didn’t quite have the shape, ball flight. I didn’t have much of what I wanted. “That’s golf, unfortunately. If we were able to put all of our facets of the game together I think there would be a lot more tournament winners out here. But this is just part of the job. We have to figure out a way to put it together and I have not done that consistently this year so far.” Woods’s reprieve was in contrast to events surrounding Rory McIlroy. The Northern Irishman had also flirted with the cut before finding water at the 17th, thereby all but confirming his exit. McIlroy’s 74 meant a total of plus one. What ever happened to Webb Simpson? The absence of such sentiment in golf circles has owed plenty to cruel analysis; that he was a fluke winner of the US Open in 2012. Plenty of major champions are barely heralded, with Simpson a case in point. Subsequent success at the Shriners Hospitals for Children Open, the following year, meant back-to-back Ryder Cup appearances but Simpson had rather vanished from view until an extraordinary Friday afternoon. Simpson, who is still only 32, clearly has aspirations of a career renaissance having recorded three top-fives already this season. Simpson took to the 17th tee as 11 under par for his Players second round. He had posted six birdies in succession as more illustrious names toiled in blistering heat. Galleries and competitors looked on in collective amazement. Nervousness over the pursuit of a course record – or a 59 – was understandable, albeit Simpson held a seven-stroke lead over the field. He backed off from his wedge shot twice before watching his ball bounce agonisingly on the wooden green boundary and onto the back of the putting surface at fair pace. Next stop, the water. A double bogey shattered Simpson’s dreams of making history. It was to his credit that he made a par at the last without any drama whatsoever; water is again a prominent feature there. Matching the best single round Players score won’t dishearten Simpson too much. Simpson has become the seventh player to sign for a Sawgrass 63. His 15 under par aggregate means a five shot lead at halfway. “It was a lot of fun,” Simpson said. “Everything was working today. Putts I was just trying to get close went in and that gave me so much momentum. At 17, the wind seemed to be changing but I felt pretty good. I don’t think it was a bad shot, just the wrong club probably. I’ll easily be able to block that out and take the positives.” Charl Schwartzel, Patrick Cantlay and Danny Lee are closest to Simpson. Jason Day added a 67 to his 69 to move somewhat effortlessly to minus eight. The Australian’s danger was highlighted last weekend, as he won on the PGA Tour in Charlotte. “I think when you win, you get a little bit more motivated to do more practice and hungry to win a lot more,” Day explained. “If I can keep pushing but be smart about it, I feel like can I win in bunches.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/blog/2018/may/12/sensible-gareth-southgate-england-world-cup","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-12T11:43:19Z","webTitle":"Sensible Gareth Southgate goes early with his England World Cup picks | Paul Wilson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/may/12/sensible-gareth-southgate-england-world-cup","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2018/may/12/sensible-gareth-southgate-england-world-cup","fields":{"headline":"Sensible Gareth Southgate goes early with his England World Cup picks","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Gareth Southgate has made the sensible decision to name his World Cup squad early, this coming week in fact, perhaps because of his close proximity to the furniture rearranging that took place when Glenn Hoddle trimmed Paul Gascoigne from his list at the last moment in 1998. As Southgate has explained, injuries permitting there is no need to prolong anyone’s agony when you have a couple of weeks to spare and a reasonable idea of the group you would like to select. Better to let everyone know the good or bad news early and give the individuals in the finalised squad as much time as possible to get to know each other. Southgate has already been unlucky in losing Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Joe Gomez to injury. Both Liverpool players were virtual certainties to make the trip. Oxlade-Chamberlain on account of his tremendous form since moving from Arsenal, Gomez because of his versatility and ability to play in a back three. That may not be the way England actually line up, at least not all of the time, though the player who can happily provide cover in a couple of positions is always a bonus to a manager looking to leave himself as many options as a squad of 23 will permit. England at the moment are a young squad, with few seasoned internationals absolutely demanding selection, and for that reason Southgate may feel able to resist the temptation to include one or two names for the future simply to increase their experience. Jadon Sancho and Ademola Lookman, the two starlets breaking through in the Bundesliga, have both been mentioned, though the circumstances are not quite the same as when Sven-Göran Eriksson took a 17-year-old Theo Walcott to Germany in 2006. Back then the team virtually picked itself, everyone knew pretty much how it would line up and, having been preferred to strikers of the quality of Jermain Defoe and Darren Bent, Walcott failed to manage a minute on the pitch in the World Cup. He was put back with the under-21s by the next manager, Steve McClaren, and ended up missing out on the 2010 finals under Fabio Capello when he boasted vastly more experience. Sometimes the best of intentions do not always produce the desired results and Southgate may feel, with players such as Ruben Loftus-Cheek, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Marcus Rashford under consideration, that he is doing enough for the future in any case. The flip side of the youth policy is what might be termed the elder statesman question. As already mentioned England do not have too many of those but Southgate is believed to be willing to name Joe Hart among his three goalkeepers, even though the most experienced international at his disposal is unlikely to be first choice. Martin Keown famously retired from international football after Brazil knocked England out of the 2002 World Cup in Japan, and who could blame him? In the later stages of his career he had been selected for the 1998 and 2002 tournaments by two different managers and failed to kick a ball in either. If Jack Butland and Jordan Pickford are the first two goalkeeping names on the list, surely it would do no harm to further Nick Pope’s encouraging development rather than take Hart along as unrequired back-up. Similarly, if Gary Cahill and Chris Smalling are unlikely to be first-team choices, it might be better to make up the numbers with an Alfie Mawson or a James Tarkowski, defenders presently on the periphery of the squad but players who are likely to be around when the next World Cup comes along. So, on that basis, here is a suggested squad. The three goalkeepers who deserve to go are Butland, Pickford and Pope, although Southgate may prefer Hart to the Burnley player. Three centre-backs who seem certain to make the trip are John Stones, Harry Maguire and Phil Jones, and another Burnley player, Tarkowski, would be an adventurous fourth. Southgate must also consider the claims of Mawson, Cahill and Smalling for one place as extra defensive cover, though Michael Keane has probably slipped off the radar after an unimpressive first season at Everton. England are pretty well off for full-backs even without Gomez, so much so that they can afford to ignore the fact that Danny Rose has fallen from favour at Tottenham. Rose may still get the call but few would argue if Kyle Walker, Kieran Trippier, Ryan Bertrand and Alexander-Arnold were the quartet boarding the plane. In midfield the big question is whether to take Jack Wilshere, now that Oxlade-Chamberlain has pulled out. While there are doubts over the Arsenal player’s fitness record, Southgate seems unconvinced by the claims of Jonjo Shelvey. There is also the debate over whether Raheem Sterling and Dele Alli should be regarded as midfielders or strikers, though little doubt that both will be going. So should Jesse Lingard, and one has the feeling that Southgate will allow as much time as possible for Adam Lallana to prove his fitness. The manager has hinted there will be no surprises, so that probably means Wilshere is in and Shelvey out, though it does not necessarily rule out a call-up for Loftus-Cheek. Five options for midfield might be Jordan Henderson, Eric Dier, Wilshere, Lallana and Lingard, and five for up front would be Harry Kane, Jamie Vardy, Sterling, Alli and Rashford. That leaves one spare place, which could go to Loftus-Cheek at the expense of an extra striker in Danny Welbeck. Possible squad Butland, Pickford, Pope; Walker, Trippier, Bertrand, Alexander-Arnold; Stones, Maguire, Jones, Smalling, Tarkowski; Henderson, Dier, Lallana, Lingard, Wilshere, Loftus-Cheek; Kane, Alli, Vardy, Rashford, Sterling."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/may/09/man-who-attacked-children-with-hammer-owen-scott-has-jail-term-increased","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-09T11:47:48Z","webTitle":"Man who attacked his children with hammer has jail term  increased","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/09/man-who-attacked-children-with-hammer-owen-scott-has-jail-term-increased","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/may/09/man-who-attacked-children-with-hammer-owen-scott-has-jail-term-increased","fields":{"headline":"Man who attacked his children with hammer has jail term  increased","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A man who attacked his four children with a hammer and drove them into a wall at 92mph has had his sentence increased from 14 to 24 years by appeal court judges. Owen Scott, who was in a drug-induced psychosis when he tried to kill his children last August, will serve an extra 10 years in jail after the solicitor general, Robert Buckland, referred his original minimum term to the court of appeal. Buckland argued it did not reflect the serious nature of his actions or the injuries caused to his victims, one of whom will need a wheelchair for the rest of their life. The 29-year-old, from Southampton, was jailed for life at Sheffield crown court in February and ordered to serve at least 14 years behind bars. His minimum term was increased to 24 years on Wednesday after senior judges ruled the original sentence was “unduly lenient”. Lord Justice Treacy, sitting with two other judges, said: “In our judgment the facts of this case demonstrate a case of particular gravity. Four young lives have been grievously affected, their mother’s life has been blighted and the level of harm which has been done is very high indeed. “It follows from that analysis that the sentence imposed below was unduly lenient.” Scott, who claims to have no memory of the incident, was arrested after his car crashed into the Travellers Inn at a remote location near Penistone, South Yorkshire, in August last year. In the weeks before the incident, he developed paranoia, put down to a temporary psychosis caused by his long-term recreational cocaine and cannabis use. He collected his three children and stepchild from his former partner’s home in Southampton before driving to the Isle of Wight, Liverpool and Greater Manchester. He then drove to Huddersfield before crashing into the pub in a deliberate attempt to kill the children. The court heard he believed people were after him and thought the only way to protect the children was to kill them. All four children, aged between nine months and eight years at the time of the crash, were left with life-threatening and life-changing injuries as a result of multiple blows delivered by Scott. Medical reports indicate they will have lasting psychological damage and cognitive impairment, and one child will need a wheelchair for life. Lord Justice Treacy said: “Each of the four victims has suffered dreadful injuries with long-term consequences as a result of the hammer attacks which precluded the final collision. “There was a gross breach of trust in relation to each of them. It is clear that some of the children were old enough to understand what the offender was doing whilst those attacks were taking place.” Following the court’s ruling, Buckland said: “Four children’s lives have been devastated by Scott’s actions, and the physical and mental scars will stay with them for the rest of their lives. “I am pleased that the court of appeal has agreed to increase Scott’s sentence to properly reflect the seriousness of his crime.” Scott will not be released automatically after serving his minimum term, but only when the Parole Board considers he does not pose a danger to the public."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/may/09/jeremy-corbyn-both-of-mays-customs-union-plans-are-implausible","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-09T17:59:54Z","webTitle":"Jeremy Corbyn says Tory divisions over Brexit are a shambles","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/may/09/jeremy-corbyn-both-of-mays-customs-union-plans-are-implausible","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/may/09/jeremy-corbyn-both-of-mays-customs-union-plans-are-implausible","fields":{"headline":"Jeremy Corbyn says Tory divisions over Brexit are a shambles","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Jeremy Corbyn sought to exploit Tory divisions over Brexit in the House of Commons on Wednesday, as he accused Theresa May of presiding over a shambles. At prime minister’s questions, the Labour leader said the prime minister had had “23 months to negotiate an agreement” with her cabinet, but was yet to agree what customs arrangement she wants to strike with the EU27 after Brexit. “These negotiations are in a shambles,” he added. Cabinet divisions over Brexit have burst into the open in the past week, with Boris Johnson launching an unprecedented attack on May’s preferred solution of a customs partnership, under which the UK would collect EU import tariffs on behalf of Brussels. He told the Daily Mail: “That’s not taking back control of your trade policy, it’s not taking back control of your laws, it’s not taking back control of your borders and it’s actually not taking back control of your money either, because tariffs would get paid centrally back to Brussels.” The interview followed a staunch defence of the customs partnership by the business secretary, Greg Clark, as well as leading business groups on Sunday, in what was regarded by Brexiters as a coordinated intervention. Brexiters believe there is a majority in May’s Brexit inner cabinet against the proposal, which they describe as a “dead parrot”. They prefer the alternative maximum facilitation, or “max-fac” approach, which would use technology to minimise border checks. Corbyn pointed out that this plan had been criticised by the former UK representative in Brussels, Sir Ivan Rogers, who described it as a “fantasy island unicorn model”. “They have two options, neither of which are workable,” Corbyn said. The government, he said, had “wasted weeks working up proposals that the EU said was unworkable, that her own foreign secretary described as crazy”. May conceded: “There were two options in my Mansion House speech. Questions have been raised about both of them and further work continues.” She said there would be a deal where the UK would “leave the customs union, we have an independent free-trade policy, we maintain no hard border in Northern Ireland and we have as frictionless trade as possible”. Whitehall sources said May’s Brexit inner cabinet would return to the issue again next Tuesday after a fractious meeting last week ended without agreement. Backers of the customs partnership believe it is the only option capable of solving the challenge of preventing new border checks being introduced in Ireland. Brussels had previously rejected the idea, but officials from the Department for Exiting the EU are continuing to look at the issue. The Irish taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, held out a glimmer of hope on Tuesday, saying May’s approach was a “welcome suggestion”. “The view of the EU is that it isn’t workable in its current form but it is something that perhaps we could make workable,” he said. Labour is also divided over Brexit, with 83 of the party’s peers defying the leadership on Tuesday night to back a House of Lords amendment to the EU withdrawal bill aimed at keeping Britain in the single market. The government is expected to bring the key piece of Brexit legislation back to the Commons in the next fortnight, and seek MPs’ backing to remove 14 amendments made by peers, on issues including the Brexit date and a future customs union. Labour whipped its peers to abstain on Tuesday’s amendment, which was tabled by Lord Alli and proposed pursuing membership of the European Economic Area. Pro-single market MPs hope it will put pressure on the leadership to shift its position. Corbyn’s spokesman suggested after PMQs that the party would continue to seek “a new relationship with the single market”; but he stressed that EEA membership “includes a number of different relationships”. He added that Labour objected to key aspects of the single market, including state aid and competition rules, and would seek “exemptions, clarifications or a negotiated change” to ensure Labour could carry out its manifesto pledges of increasing state involvement in the economy. May said Corbyn’s approach was contradictory, because signing up to a customs union, as Labour proposes, would force Britain into trade deals it had played no part in negotiating. “He has spent an entire career opposing a customs union. Now, when the British people want to come out, he wants to stay in. I know he’s leader of the opposition but that goes a bit far,” she said. Labour insists it would only sign up to a customs union if it were given some say over future deals. Nick Timothy, the prime minister’s former chief of staff, used a column in the Daily Telegraph to side with Johnson and urge May to reject the customs partnership, which he said would restrict Britain’s ability to strike future trade deals. He said the government should instead back “max fac” – even if that means extending the transition period beyond 2021 while new technologies are developed. “If there is a compromise to be made, ministers might accept that ‘max fac’ will take longer to be introduced than the current implementation timetable suggests,” Timothy said. The same idea was also advocated by Nick Boles, a backbencher and Michael Gove ally on Wednesday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/may/10/spring-everyones-step-win-the-guardian-public-service-awards-2018-nominations","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-10T11:05:34Z","webTitle":"'It put a spring in everyone's step': what it's like to win the Guardian Public Service Awards","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/may/10/spring-everyones-step-win-the-guardian-public-service-awards-2018-nominations","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/may/10/spring-everyones-step-win-the-guardian-public-service-awards-2018-nominations","fields":{"headline":"'It put a spring in everyone's step': what it's like to win the Guardian Public Service Awards","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"“I’ve never shrieked at a professional event in my life – we were so excited,” Sue Williams, director of family safeguarding at Hertfordshire county council, says. The council won the care award at the Guardian Public Service Awards last year, and was named the overall winner of the night. The council won recognition for its new approach to working with looked-after children and their families, taking services directly to the home, rather than referring families to outside services, and empowering social workers to help parents make changes themselves. In the initiative’s first year, the time children spent in the care system was cut by 50% and the authority saved £2.5m. There was also a significant fall in the number of police call-outs to domestic abuse incidents in the area. Williams says the team didn’t recognise themselves when their achievements were read out on awards night; the presenting judge had to repeat the name of the winner before they joined him on stage. Six months later, she says the recognition has made a real impression on the whole children’s services department. The two awards have been on tour, with a week spent with each of the council’s 40 teams. “It’s no exaggeration to say every staff member from the team administrator to the senior management teams were absolutely ecstatic and felt two feet taller,” she says. “I think it gave an extra boost to our performance because people worked even harder to show the impact they could have by engaging families differently. Almost every public authority wanted to come and visit us to see what we’ve done and to share our work with them.” Stephen Smith, who has spent 25 years encouraging other people with learning disabilities and campaigning for better quality services, won the 2017 public vote to be named public servant of the year. He says it was “a dream come true”, and receiving a standing ovation on the night was “absolutely fantastic”. He has since received messages of support from organisations such as the British Institute of Learning Disabilities and Learning Disability England, appeared on local radio and TV, and spoken about his experience at the 2018 North West Self Advocates Conference in February. “It has been an important message about people who have a learning disability and what can be achieved,” Smith says. For Paul Allen, being nominated for the leadership excellence award last year was a chance to highlight the important role middle managers play in the social work sector. He never thought he’d win: “I was just so delighted someone had thought to nominate me ... I looked at the people I was up against and what they’d achieved, and I never thought the work that goes in at this level would have been acknowledged.” There’s been a knock-on effect on the rest of the office too. “My team has been really motivated and inspired by it. [It put] a spring in everyone’s step,” he says. Allen would encourage teams to look at all levels within an organisation when entering this year’s awards. “If somebody’s doing something right now and really making a difference, really having an impact, put them forward,” he says. Williams agrees: “It’s quite easy for people in the public sector to think they don’t have much expertise or what they do isn’t good enough. [But] the work people do across public services is really awesome. It’s something that should be celebrated far more frequently than it is.” Entries open on 16 May for this year’s Guardian Public Service Awards, which are supported by EY.

Staff from the House of Commons’ media office worked with the Speaker’s office last week to provide briefings on the claims of bullying against the Speaker, the Guardian has established. These briefings were produced so they could be passed on to MPs who are friends of Bercow as he battles calls for a formal inquiry into the claims. The disclosure has prompted concerns about conflicts of interest and a possible misuse of public funds. There has been growing speculation that Bercow will leave the post in the next year. Dave Penman, the head of the FDA, the senior civil servants union, said: “The interests of the Speaker must be separated from the interests of the House of Commons, they are not indivisible. It is extraordinary that staff resources, funded by the taxpayer, could have been used to brief friends of the Speaker to appear in the media defending his personal conduct.” Bercow faces calls for an independent inquiry after Angus Sinclair, the Speaker’s former private secretary, accused him of physically intimidating, demeaning and mimicking him before he took “compulsory early retirement” in 2010. Sinclair was paid almost £90,000 on condition that he signed confidentiality clauses that barred him from speaking out. He has since broken the terms of the agreement. David Leakey, who stepped down last year as Black Rod, a ceremonial post in parliament, told Newsnight he had experienced the outbursts of temper described by other former members of Bercow’s staff. Bercow has denied all allegations of bullying. It is understood that the Speaker’s office asked the House of Commons media office to help put together files of research for MPs defending Bercow. A number of MPs have intervened to defend the Speaker, including the Conservative Dr Julian Lewis and the Labour former shadow chancellor Chris Leslie, who both raised points of order supporting Bercow. Leslie appeared on Newsnight to discuss the claims. Asked whether he was briefed by the Speaker’s office, Leslie said he had a “passing conversation” with the Speaker’s office and was given a summary of news coverage and the Speaker’s public statements. He had not spoken directly to House of Commons staff. Bercow, who has been Speaker since 2009, said before he took the post he would resign after no longer than nine years – leaving 22 June of this year as his deadline. The Sunday Times reported he would step down within the next year. Sir Peter Bottomley, the Tory MP who “dragged” Bercow to the Speaker’s chair nine years ago in the traditional ritual, told the Daily Telegraph he expected him to leave this year. Penman, the FDA chief, said the Commons media team should not be used as “personal PR advisers” to the Speaker. “How can staff have any confidence that their complaints will be treated fairly if the Speaker is able to deploy House resources, apparently without challenge, to help ‘spin’ his side of any alleged behaviour? “What message does this send to staff who may be considering raising a complaint, knowing that potentially their own colleagues will be used to brief against them? “This once again raises the issue of a conflict of interest in the role of the Speaker and the broader House Commission, which he chairs and which acts as the employer of House staff,” he said. A House of Commons spokesman said: “As is common practice, the House of Commons media team provides background material to MPs and officials on issues affecting the House”. A spokesman for the Speaker’s office said: “The speaker has put his position on the record. He has not asked the Commons media team or anyone else to do anything more than report that position.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jun/01/best-way-avoid-regrets-oliver-burkeman","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-01T14:00:51Z","webTitle":"What’s the best way to avoid regrets? | Oliver Burkeman","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/01/best-way-avoid-regrets-oliver-burkeman","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/01/best-way-avoid-regrets-oliver-burkeman","fields":{"headline":"What’s the best way to avoid regrets?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"How should you spend your life if you don’t want to end up filled with regret? The standard modern answer to this ancient question, often based on research by the psychologist Thomas Gilovich, is that we regret inaction more than action: not things we do, but things we fail to do. I’ve long been sceptical, though. Can’t you simply rephrase any decision so it fits in either box? Leaving your relationship to embark on a round-the-world adventure might be a bold case of “doing something”, or it might mean shirking the hard but rewarding task of building a lifelong partnership. Having children clearly seems like an action – unless you’re doing it solely to comply with social expectations, in which case it’s surely a matter of failing to forge your own path. And so on. Clearly, when it comes to avoiding regret, we’ll need a better rule of thumb than just “do stuff”. Fortunately, Gilovich’s latest work, conducted with another psychologist, Shai Davidai, might just be able to provide one. Their new series of studies, which I found via the Research Digest blog, hinges on a distinction between what they call the “ideal self”, the person you’d be if you fulfilled all your goals and ambitions, and the “ought self”, the person you’d be if you met your obligations to others, and lived a morally upright life. Overwhelmingly, they found, people regret ideal-self failures – in short, not pursuing your dreams – more than ought-self failures, such as failing to visit a dying relative or cheating on a spouse. That’s not merely because everyone’s incredibly selfish, the researchers argue; it’s that we’re more likely to take action to repair ought-self failures, perhaps because they seem more urgent or shameful. You might work hard to salvage your relationship after an affair, resolve never to neglect your elderly relatives again, and suchlike. By contrast, unpursued dreams have a tendency to stay in the background, gnawing at you only quietly, until suddenly it’s too late. Gilovich and Davidai are appropriately reticent about deriving life advice from their research, but I’m not: these findings are a powerful argument for figuring out what you truly want from life and giving it a shot, even at the risk of others’ negative judgments. Of course, the challenge is figuring out what that is. “Do what you want” risks becoming a call to impulsiveness and hedonism (and plenty of regrets, of both the ideal-self and ought-self varieties). That’s why I like the trick, with its roots in the work of Carl Jung, of flipping the question and asking not what you want from life, but what life wants from you. Looking beyond your immediate whims and desires, what’s trying to come into being through you? I’m not sure it matters whether or not we each really have, as Jung believed, a soul with its own agenda, distinct from that of the ego, struggling to make itself heard. When faced with a big life choice, just asking the question that way can be enough to cut through the noise, to the quiet place where you already know what to do. Do that thing; you’re unlikely to regret it. Read this: contrary to stereotype, philosophers these days tend to avoid pondering the meaning of life. But in his 2015 book A Significant Life, Todd May bucks the trend. Living meaningfully, he argues, is less a matter of what you do than how you do it. oliver.burkeman@theguardian.com"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/may/26/quiz-goddess-halemaumau-crater-hawaii-nightclub-murder-hole","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-26T06:00:49Z","webTitle":"Which goddess is said to live in Halema‘uma‘u Crater in Hawaii?

Now, it cannot seem to come fast enough. Three years ago this month, the Republic voted in favour of same-sex marriage – and became the first country in the world to do so by popular vote. A year later, Leo Varadkar, who was a number of firsts rolled into one, became taoiseach. At 38, he was the country’s youngest ever prime minister, the first from an ethnic minority background and the first to have come out as gay. Now, voters are about to go to the polls to have their say on arguably the most bitterly and repeatedly contested issue in modern Ireland: abortion. This is the sixth referendum on the subject in the past 35 years. But while previous votes were about small, esoteric changes to the existing law, this time the Irish people will decide whether to liberalise, once and for all, one of the most restrictive abortion regimes in the world, or to keep the status quo. Voters will be asked on 25 May if they want to repeal article 40.3.3 – known as the eighth amendment – which gives unborn foetuses and pregnant women an equal right to life, in effect enshrining a ban on abortion in Ireland’s constitution and making it the sole western democracy to do so. It is only since 2013 that terminations have been allowed in cases where the mother’s life is in danger and currently the penalty for accessing an illegal abortion is up to 14 years in prison. Many will be hoping that, whatever the outcome, Ireland’s “abortion wars” will be put to rest. Since the eighth amendment was passed in 1983 access to abortion has been a hugely divisive issue, coming, like Brexit, between friends and families. For many it is bound up with painful aspects of Ireland’s past. People care deeply about it. As the last Friday in May nears, the subject is dominating the national conversation. The main evening radio news programme on RTE 1, Drivetime, has been running a compelling series of interviews with women who have had crisis pregnancies, while TV’s The Week In Politics is to devote two programmes to abortion. The campaign features daily in all newspapers and across social media. Journalists from all over Europe and the Americas are arriving to cover the story. A month out from the vote, Kerry O’Sullivan, aged 17, is canvassing near her home in Santry – a working-class area of north Dublin – for the first time. Too young to vote in the referendum, she still feels she must campaign for Yes vote. “I want to convince as many people as I can to make the right choice.” It’s a sunny Tuesday evening and she is with Dublin Bay North Together For Yes (the umbrella name for pro-repeal groups), door-knocking in Kilmore. Asked how she got involved Kerry smiles. “I told my ma if any canvassers came round for ‘repeal’ she was to call me to the door. I was in the shower when two girls came round. I came running downstairs to sign up. There I was, standing almost in the street in a bath-towel. I didn’t care. I have always felt so passionately about the issue.” She is not the only one canvassing for the first time. Kate Antonisik-Parsons, 39, moved from San Francisco to Ireland as a student when she was 22. She married an Irishman and they have four children – three of them daughters. She can’t vote in the referendum either, not being an Irish citizen. But as someone who has had to travel to the UK for an abortion, and cares “deeply about Ireland”, she knew she would get involved. She contacted the Dublin Bay North group at the end of last year, had a half a day’s training and was on her first canvass in January. “I was so nervous. I was worried that because of my personal stake in this I might cry if someone pushed me. My first night I got paired up with [local Solidarity Party councillor] Michael O’Brien. We knocked on a couple of doors and then Michael said, ‘You know all about this. You’re ready to go alone.’” At the first door she was invited in. “I thought, ‘Oh, what is this?’ But they were so pro-repeal, so enthusiastic, and we talked about the arguments. I found it lovely.” She finds canvassing emotionally challenging but also a privilege. “Several women have shared their stories about travelling [for an abortion], some of them, I think, for the first time. For me, every time I have those conversations it is de-stigmatising abortion.” On the other side of the city, in Dublin Bay South – affluent and regarded as the most liberal constituency in Ireland – Christine O’Connor, 45, is canvassing, also for the first time on any issue. A married mother of four – including three daughters – she felt so strongly about the need to repeal the eighth she had to “get off my arse and do something”. She contacted the Abortion Rights Campaign in January, and then the Dublin Bay South repeal campaign. “I went to meet them in early March. I was really nervous. I got there and told them ‘I’m absolutely terrified’. But now I’m really enjoying being part of it.” These women are among thousands across the country – mainly women but men too – in what is becoming the largest grassroots movement in decades. Long-time activists on both sides speak of huge numbers of previously non-political people joining this campaign. “I think there were about 17 or 18 people on my first canvass,” says O’Connor. “Now there are easily 60 or 70 a night. It has grown very big, very quickly.” Michael O’Brien, in Dublin Bay North, agrees: “One of the most difficult aspects of political work is usually finding people willing to canvass. They’re nervous; believe they have to be ultra-knowledgeable. I’ve never seen anything like this campaign. People are still nervous, but they are determined to overcome that.” Though most political parties back repeal, the main government parties, Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, are allowing members a free vote. The biggest parties’ campaigning is low-key, and – uniquely in any recent referendum campaign – the government is not publishing campaign literature or putting up posters. The campaign, on both sides, is being driven by civil society. Both sides would agree it was the death of Savita Halappanavar in 2012 that put this campaign in motion. Contested though the narrative of her death is, the facts, as I first reported them in the Irish Times, never have been. From Karnataka in south-west India, Halappanavar was completing her dentistry training and living in the west of Ireland when she rushed to Galway University Hospital on Sunday, 21 October 2012, 17 weeks pregnant and experiencing severe back pain. She was miscarrying. A day later, still in immense pain, she asked for a termination but was refused as there was a foetal heartbeat. Under Ireland’s laws, since her life was not in danger, there could be no abortion. She asked again the following day and was again told no. A midwife told Savita: “It’s a Catholic thing.” A week later, after going into septic shock, suffering multi-organ failure and finally, cardiac arrest, she died. While the anti-abortion lobby scrambled to deny her death had anything to do with abortion, there is no doubt that had her wish been respected, Savita would be alive today. It was said to me, the day after the Irish Times broke the story, that “this will change Ireland”. There had been myriad crises in Ireland’s abortion wars since the eighth amendment, involving pregnant rape and incest survivors, pregnant girls in care who could not travel, women too sick to travel and women with diagnoses of fatal foetal abnormalities. But none had been identified and none had died. On the day the story broke, about 3,000 people gathered outside Dáil Eireann, the Irish parliament, weeping, carrying candles and pictures of Savita, and holding placards reading “Never again”. Three days later, on Saturday 17 November, 20,000 people marched through Dublin. Never again, they chanted. There were similar gatherings across the country. Young women in their thousands founded and joined such groups as the Abortion Rights Campaign (Arc) and Reproductive Rights, Against Oppression, Sexism &amp; Austerity (Rosa). The campaign to repeal the eighth had begun. Today, speaking to people around the country, one gets a sense of a nation in reckoning with itself – about what kind of society it has been and what kind of Ireland it wants to be. For many this reckoning is deeply personal, and painful, bound up with the revelations of child sexual abuse by priests, and the abuse of young, poor women in mother and baby homes such as the Magdalene Laundries, which have done untold damage to trust in the Church. With only 78% of Irish people identifying as Catholic in the 2016 census – down from 91% in 1991 – it is clear that unquestioning loyalty to the Church has been replaced for many by a growing ambivalence. Terry Armstrong, a street trader in Dublin’s Liberties said he was definitely voting Yes. He and his older brother were taken into church institutions in 1954 after their mother had a stroke. “We were in Artane [a Christian Brothers industrial school] at the age of nine,” he says. “It was a hell-hole. We were beaten black and blue. There were boys being raped. There were boys told their mammy and daddy were dead, when they weren’t. That’s horrendous. Abortion could not be worse than what they did to kids who were alive.” In Co Clare, artist Eilis Murphy, 37, describes one of the first days she ran a Clare for Choice stall in the county capital, Ennis, earlier this year. “I was really anxious about how it would go. In the afternoon an old man, a real farmer-type, came over. I thought, ‘Here we go’, assuming he’d be anti-abortion. But he said: ‘The priest ruined it for me. He started going on about young girls going to England for abortions. It’s none of his business. So I heard you were here and I came down to sign your petition.’” For me, as for Kate canvassing in Kilmore, and for thousands more, the referendum has a personal dimension. I have had two abortions, one in my 20s in London, about which I had no regrets, and one in my 30s, in Amsterdam, which I regretted hugely. I wrote about them, in passing, in a column for the Irish Times in May 2017, not to “come out” about them, but to acknowledge my privilege in being able to choose them, to underline the way that Irish abortion is not only a woman’s issue, but a class issue too. In the 35 years since the eighth amendment more than 170,000 Irish women and girls have travelled, the vast majority quietly, secretly and often in deep shame, to Britain for abortions. About 3,000 a year still do. Unlike British women and girls, who in the main can access abortion free on the NHS, Irish women must pay – anywhere between £560 to £1,800, the costs rising as the pregnancy progresses. Add to that the cost of flights and accommodation, and abortion is an option only for those who can afford it, and who can legally leave and return to Ireland. Increasing numbers – about 2,000 per year – are buying abortion pills on the internet, and taking them at home, in secret, without medical supervision. If found out they would face up to 14 years in prison. From the abortion that I regretted I learned more about the importance of choice. I already had a daughter, Rosie, who was eight, when I became unexpectedly pregnant. I had a secure career, a good relationship and a belief that I didn’t want more children. I was 36. I went for crisis pregnancy counselling, as is mandatory before arriving at clinics in either Britain or the Netherlands. I was more emotional than when I’d had the same counselling a decade earlier. If I didn’t have this baby, would I have another chance? Did I want another? The counsellor, Michelle, told me to take time on my own: “Look at the stars, the skies; think about how enormous this decision is for you and how insignificant it is really for anyone else. Don’t make the wrong decision for you.” I talked to my partner. He didn’t want another child and thought I didn’t either. It was agony. I couldn’t think straight. I couldn’t focus on work, couldn’t sleep, couldn’t decide. In the end I travelled, full of doubt, to a clinic in Amsterdam. I was unsure, even when the woman checking me in asked if I was sure. I said I was. I felt relief travelling home. I could get back to normal now. But within days, all I felt was a gaping, tear-filled sadness. What had I done? I’d cry on my bike on the way to work, in the shower where I couldn’t be heard, driving with my daughter in the back seat so she couldn’t see the tears streaming down my face. I didn’t want to see friends. I couldn’t. I’d have to explain I was heartbroken, that I had broken my own heart and nothing, least of all me, made sense. In the days after I first wrote about my experience I was invited on RTE’s main Saturday night chat-show, The Late, Late Show. Doing my makeup before going on air was a woman in her late 50s. She asked what I was going to talk about. I told her. “Abortion.” “Oh,” she said. “Would you be for it?” Half assuming she was anti-abortion, I said gently: “Well, I think if a woman needs it she should be able to.” She stopped with the blusher and said: “That’s good. I had to travel once, to Liverpool.” It was the first of several conversations with older women who, one senses, may be feeling safe for the first time to speak not only about abortion, but about traumatic pregnancies, miscarriages and difficult births – and about what their needs had been, and how they could not be met. While younger women may be leading a charge for abortion rights older women too are finding their voice after many decades of being silenced. In Bray, about 20 miles south of Dublin, a couple in their 70s gave their views on the referendum. “Abortion is mass murder,” said the man. His wife, who said they were 48 years married, said: “I don’t see it like that.” She told how they had lost their first baby. “I was very ill. I had severe toxaemia [pre-eclampsia]. I was 32 weeks and trying to hang on to the 34, to save the baby. A doctor said to me: ‘A lot of people want to talk about saving the baby, but I want to talk about saving you.’ So he delivered the baby. He lived a week. “I never got to see my baby. I was too ill. They took him away and I never saw him. I was just sent home. I got so depressed, and I had no one to talk to about it. No one asked me about it. Only a woman can understand what it is to go through that. I’ll be voting Yes.” In Ringsend, a working-class area in Dublin, Bernie Galvin, a woman in her 60s told me how she had contracted rubella when pregnant in 1984. “I was covered in German measles and the doctors told me nothing. I was kept totally in the dark about what could happen to the baby. The child was born very sick, and completely deaf. They didn’t even tell me she was deaf. All I wanted was for my child to be better. Everyone has a story.” Asked how she’ll vote, she said: “Yes. Of course.” There are many parallels between this vote and the marriage equality referendum three years ago, which was approved by 62% on a turnout of 61% after a mainly good humoured campaign during which thousands of Ireland’s gay community found their voice. Surely, given the clear support for that, in the face of Catholic opposition, this vote too will pass easily? Ailbhe Smyth, 72, Irish feminist, lesbian, veteran campaigner and joint co-ordinator of the national Together For Yes campaign says that this referendum is different: “In marriage equality we were asking to be to be part of what the rest of society was doing – and it was about happiness, love, stability, family. This is about access to something we need and, more profoundly, it’s about challenging the control and repression of women.” The anti-abortion campaign – centred on the Pro-Life Campaign and Save The 8th – has been difficult to penetrate. There has been reluctance by the main spokespeople to be interviewed, and by canvassers to be accompanied by journalists. Perhaps this is indicative of an antipathy towards a “liberal” press, and a sense they have nothing to gain from media exposure. At a Saturday afternoon vigil in Roscommon town, which was made up of about 15 mainly older women and three men, retired nurse Mary Fallon said the campaign was going well. “We have teams out canvassing around the county, just in the towns so far – Roscommon, Castlerea, Ballymoe. We had Katie Ascough [a young anti-abortion campaigner who has been fronting a roadshow since February, promoting estimates of how many lives have been saved by the amendment since 1983] last weekend. You know 900 lives have been saved by the eighth in Roscommon.” Mary Fallon was very confident Roscommon would vote No, as is John McGuirk, 34, spokesman for the Save The Eighth campaign. He adds Cavan, Monaghan, Mayo, Galway and Kerry, conceding: “Yes will win Dublin. We are happy with how things are going in Dublin, though. If Dublin goes 70% for Yes we’re in trouble. If we can get that down to 60%, this is very winnable. “The battle will be won and lost in the commuter counties around Dublin which have very mixed rural-urban populations. It’s here that we’ll be concentrating our efforts – Kildare, Meath, Louth, Carlow, Kilkenny.” Anti-abortion meetings around the country are well attended. There were some 300 at a meeting in Castlebar, Co Mayo on 22 April, at which the referendum was described as a “defining moment for our society”. One elderly woman, at the end of the meeting, told RTE radio: “The people of Ireland who believe in God are praying and we will win. We will win.” As well as a deeply held conviction that abortion at any point after conception is the killing of a baby, those against the repeal of the eighth are articulating concerns about the vanishing of a cherished Ireland, an Ireland that prizes family, children, the less fortunate; an Ireland built around community, protection of the vulnerable and faith. Abortion, synonymous with individuals’ rights, women’s empowerment, selfishness even, is antithetical to this Ireland. And many remain torn between the two. A Dublin taxi-driver in his 60s said: “My heart says ‘No’, but my head says ‘Yes’. I know things have to change, but it’s just the way I was brought up. It’s still taking a life.” A solicitor in Bray described the vote as very difficult. “I’d call myself pro-life, but I look at my teenage daughters and I know, if ever something happened to them, if they needed the choice, I’d want them to have it at home.” Two weeks from the vote, the outcome is far from clear. While several months, even weeks, ago a Yes vote seemed inevitable, polls are narrowing. A survey last weekend, in the Sunday Independent found 45% in favour of repeal, 34% against, 18% undecided and 4% not expressing an opinion. And it is clear that the government’s proposed legislation, to be introduced if the referendum is carried, is causing most unease among the all-important undecideds. It would provide for medical abortion on request up to 12 weeks, the drugs to be prescribed by the woman’s GP. People are telling canvassers they fear young people – already seen as consuming too much pornography and immersed in a sexualised culture – will see abortion as a form of contraception. Irish Times columnist Breda O’Brien, who describes herself as a pro-life feminist, believes “core values have not changed as much as some people think”. She says: “There is still a huge unease around this and, I think, an awful lot of people who say they are not decided will quietly vote No. I feel more hopeful than I did two months ago that the pro-life argument will win.” Among Irish twentysomethings – whether in Dublin, Clare, Roscommon, Louth or Wicklow – the urban-rural divide appears fully bridged. In Roscommon – the only county to vote No to marriage equality – a mother aged 60 was voting No while her daughter, 27, said she would vote Yes. Her mother looked horrified. “But God made you. It’s the fifth commandment.” Her daughter laughed. “Mammy’s very religious.” Both sides say that if they lose they will continue fighting – whether to push again for another referendum or to ensure that whatever abortion legislation is introduced is as liberal –or restrictive – as possible. As the votes are counted, 26 May will be a hugely emotional day for Ireland. It will be one of huge celebration and shattering disappointment – and is unlikely to herald a permanent peace in Ireland’s abortion wars.

Picks of the week The Great God of Depression “Our minds are full of rabbit holes,” says the New York Times’s Pagan Kennedy as she introduces this powerful new podcast about mental illness. It focuses on neurologist Alice Flaherty, whose grief for the twins she miscarried led to mania, delusions and the urge to write down her experiences. Flaherty looked to the case of William Styron, the Sophie’s Choice author who had also written about his depression, to make sense of her thoughts. It can be hard to listen to at times, but it does offer hope. HV Life on the EdgePodcast This hard-hitting podcast, sharing “the hidden struggles of ordinary people,” covers minimum-wage campaigns, single parenthood and nocturnal workers. Each episode features a wealth of warm, likable characters who tell their stories in an engaging way, from Jayne Dickinson, who was thrown into the benefits system when she suffered a head injury after a theatre set fell on her, to Waleed Akhtar, who illustrates the inequality in universities and beyond when students embark on unpaid internships. HV In focus: why are there so few good music podcasts? At least among the nerds I follow on Twitter, one regular topic of discussion is why there aren’t more good music podcasts? Rights issues might be one practical explanation. But then, what makes a good music podcast? Plucking a theory from the ether, I wonder if it comes down to whether you believe in separating the art from the artist – an aesthetics-first approach – or that context is crucial. I’m for the latter, which is perhaps why I find the forensic approaches of the profoundly popular Song Exploder, Switched On Pop and Dissect dry compared to the rich seams of discussion and history available elsewhere. On the former tip, there’s the New York Times’s reliably comprehensive Popcast, which pulls apart the week’s biggest music news story. (As with many music podcasts, it can be annoyingly bro-heavy – it’s best when pop music editor Caryn Ganz joins the fray and they introduce guests, as on one exemplary episode about Rita Ora’s controversial Girls, titled: “Who gets to make a gay love song?”). Also at the New York Times, Still Processing regularly dedicates whole episodes to music, including Janet Jackson, Beyoncé (specifically her Coachella performance), Kanye West and Lauryn Hill. In the UK, the New Statesman’s pop culture podcast Srsly often includes appealingly detailed music segments. Then there’s the history option: Red Bull Music Academy’s Couch Wisdom is simply audio uploads from their live lectures, but each episode feels like a mini documentary: I loved the Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis episode for the producers’ anecdotes about Prince and Janet Jackson. Even more in-depth is Chris Molanphy’s superb Hit Parade for Slate, which pulls apart the story of the US’s most interesting No 1 singles.

Thanks for taking part. Read more about how our weekly series works at the end of the piece. What is youthfulness? Pedants may say it is the quality of being young and tie it in with a particular stage of our life. We start as infants, go through childhood, teenage years, adolescence, young adulthood, adulthood, middle age, and so on. One’s youth might range from adolescence through young adulthood, those years pivotal in laying out the path into mature adulthood. For me, and for the purposes of this playlist, youthfulness is a state of mind rather than a specific age. We have such expressions as “old before his time”, “an old soul” and “young at heart” which reflect mental states, and not age as such. And our youth – whenever we experience is – is a time for exploring, learning, testing limits, and growth. It can be a time of optimism or regret. A time looked back on in later years with longing or loathing. It can also be a time of contradictions. We start our list with a song that captures both the optimism and the craziness of youth. We Are Young by Fun. is a story of drunken carousers carrying each other home, but the chorus line is a rousing paean to future hopes and dreams: “We are young! / So let’s set the world on fire / We can burn brighter / Than the sun!” Maybe the toughest years are the In Between years. Sixteen is often thought of as the year that transforms us from childhood into adolescence. But 15 is a tough year, as Judy Garland tells us: “Too old for toys / too young for boys.” It’s not surprising there are many songs about being 16. Teen romance was a staple of the music of the 50s and 60s, but let’s go for something less sugary to capture this time of life. The Smoking Popes record the sense of “deep connection, undeniable and real” in Diary of a Teenage Tragedy. “No one has ever felt this way,” its lyrics suggest – but of course, everyone has. Some young lovers just can’t wait to grow up, longing to be together forever. “Wouldn’t It Be Nice,” ask the Beach Boys, if “we could be married and then we’d be happy.” The reality is often much more tragic. Bruce Springsteen brings us down to earth with a song inspired by his sister’s experience in The River. “Then I got Mary pregnant and that was all she wrote.” We in the west often take our good fortune for granted. But in some parts of the world violence destroys what should be every child’s birthright, to grow up in peace and safety. The lightness of the music belies the seriousness of Kirsty MacColl’s Children of the Revolution. “Bombers ripped the night apart and blew the school away,” she sings. “See the soldiers come smiling at the widows as they take away the sons.” Some may say today’s youth are shallow, their faces glued to their smartphones. Style of Eye gives us this put-down of modern Kids: “Everyone’s special the exact same way / You live your life on a Facebook page.” Is this a fair assessment? Certainly shallowness abounds, but most young people I meet have hopes and dreams that go beyond today’s pleasures. Debbie Gibson conveys this optimism: “Don’t underestimate the power of a lifetime ahead.” The future belongs to Electric Youth! So we’re out of school and trying to make our way in the world. Sometimes we need a hand up, maybe a place to stay. There’s always the YMCA, the Village People tell us! In our world travels, my wife and I have found this to be the one song that is truly universal – popular everywhere we go, from Puerto Vallarta to Sint Maarten to Phuket. We’re young adults now. Sometimes we marry, find temporary work, even embark on a career. Through it all we have experienced being “happy, free, confused and lonely at the same time / It’s miserable and magical.” But we’re feeling 22, and Taylor Swift tells us everything will be all right because “we’re happy, free, confused and lonely in the best way”. Youthfulness is a universal experience. It matters not whether we are the “sons of tycoons or sons of the farms”. Scott Walker tells us “all were children like your own, the same sweet smiles, the same sad tears.” I chose this topic because my youth is behind me. Or is it? In January I went back to university to finish the degree I never finished 40 years ago. Immersing myself in the word of young people eagerly carving out their path in life is exhilarating. I identify with the words of Alphaville: “I don’t want to perish like a fading horse / I want to be forever young.” Modern technology has improved our life expectancy so much I can actually see myself starting a second career in my 70s – not working at the local shop, but writing books, maybe even getting a doctorate and teaching at the university level. Clint Eastwood is still directing movies in his 80s. Despite being on three prescription medications, I feel young. Maybe a bit slower physically, but as Ol’ Blue Eyes Frank Sinatra puts it: “Fairytales can come true if you’re Young at Heart.” Professor den Ouden – it has a nice ring to it!

Victims of the undercover spying had previously walked out of the inquiry, criticising the judge leading it for allowing too much of it to be cloaked in secrecy. On Wednesday, Peter Francis, a key figure in the controversy over the police’s use of undercover officers whose revelations had helped to force the government to set up the inquiry, boycotted its latest hearing. He told the judge, Sir John Mitting, that his decisions giving anonymity to police spies undermined the ability of the inquiry to uncover the truth of how the police had infiltrated more than 1,000 political groups since 1968. Francis has argued at previous hearings of the inquiry for the fake names of the undercover officers to be published. But he said Mitting had accepted on many occasions applications from undercover officers to have their identities concealed “wholesale, with minimal, obfuscatory or no reasoning provided at all”. He added that he did not want to spend more public money submitting arguments that were unlikely to change Mitting’s approach. “Without meaningful disclosure, neither I nor, more importantly perhaps, the victims of undercover policing will be able to properly question the evidence put forward by the police officers during the evidential stage of the inquiry. “This is crucially important, particularly when the inquiry must remember that these former police officers have been trained to lie. It was a fundamental part of their job. “Without cover names being released, so many victims of undercover policing will never even know they were targeted. Such an outcome is the very opposite of the professed aim of the inquiry, which is primarily to establish the truth.” Francis was sent by his superiors to infiltrate anti-racist groups for four years in the 1990s. However, he later blew the whistle on the activities of his covert unit, the Special Demonstration Squad, becoming a crucial source for the Guardian. In 2013 he revealed how he and colleagues had secretly gathered information on the campaign run by the family of murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence to compel the police to investigate the racist attack properly. The revelations, coupled with other disclosures such as the frequent deception of women into intimate relationships by the police spies, compelled Theresa May, when she was home secretary, to set up the public inquiry in 2014 to examine the misconduct of the undercover officers. However, the £10m inquiry, despite being scheduled to be completed this year, has yet to hear any evidence in public. The delay has been caused by voluminous legal applications from the police to keep secret the identities of individual undercover officers. The latest hearing, on Wednesday, lasted six minutes as neither the victims, nor Francis, were present in the courtroom to oppose the latest tranche of applications from the police. There was a protest outside. The victims and Francis have not taken the decision to abandon the inquiry completely."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/may/09/terry-gilliam-stroke-man-who-killed-don-quixote-cannes","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-09T10:58:21Z","webTitle":"Terry Gilliam suffers stroke ahead of Don Quixote's Cannes premiere","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/may/09/terry-gilliam-stroke-man-who-killed-don-quixote-cannes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/may/09/terry-gilliam-stroke-man-who-killed-don-quixote-cannes","fields":{"headline":"Terry Gilliam suffers stroke ahead of Don Quixote's Cannes premiere","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Terry Gilliam, the former Monty Python member and director of films such as Brazil and Time Bandits, has suffered a minor stroke. He is said to be recovering well in London after falling ill over the weekend, returning home from hospital on the evening of 8 May. Gilliam was discharged the day before a French court ruled that the world premiere of his new film, The Man Who Killed Don Quixote, could go ahead as the closing gala of the Cannes film festival on 19 May. The film, which has been in the making since 1989 and has a reputation as one of the most unlucky productions in screen history, has been the subject of a distribution rights disagreement. Producer Paulo Branco had launched a legal challenge on 25 April to stop the screening and its French cinema release, claiming that his company Alfama Films owns the rights. On 8 May, Amazon Studios pulled out of US distribution, despite contributing significant funding. However, the court ruled in Gilliam’s favour, dismissing Branco’s attempt to gain an injunction to stop the screening at Cannes and other French cinemas. Before the court decision came through, the festival said it backed Gilliam and was proceeding as planned with the premiere. The Guardian has approached Gilliam’s representatives for comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"fashion/2018/may/26/best-scents-perfume-celebrate-summer","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-26T07:00:49Z","webTitle":"The best sun scents | Sali Hughes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/may/26/best-scents-perfume-celebrate-summer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2018/may/26/best-scents-perfume-celebrate-summer","fields":{"headline":"The best scents to celebrate summer","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The limited annual release of Estée Lauder’s Bronze Goddess Skinscent (£43, 50ml) signals the start of beauty’s own asparagus season. As usual, I plan to binge on it, despite it being in many ways exactly the sort of simple, crowd-pleasing fragrance I’d avoid at any other time of the year. Skinscent’s bright, coconutty, suntan-oily notes – like a sniff of a hot arm after a day at the beach – are arguably basic, but somehow all the lovelier for it. There’s something so celebratory, unpretentious and generically “summer” about Skinscent (not to be confused with the inferior and pricier Bronze Goddess Eau de Parfum) that it seems always to raise smiles and attract compliments. I love it so much that I wondered if anything else hits the same spot. In a crude but nonetheless joyful sense, Hawaiian Tropic Golden Paradise (£10, 250ml) does. It’s a body spray (pleasingly retro: no one I know has worn body spray since the 1980s) that encapsulates more subtly the delicious smell of Hawaiian Tropic suntan oil, drunken teenage holidays and the smell of your mum’s C&amp;A bikini, without leaving your clothes like a fish-and-chip wrapper. I’ve been inhaling it daily since the bank holiday. For many of us, summer is a sticky, humid and busy affair in which the rich scent of suntan oil can feel a bit cloying, and in this case I enthusiastically recommend Dolce &amp; Gabbana’s wonderful new Light Blue Italian Zest For Her (£55, 50ml; also in For Him, but this one, at least to my nose, is gender-neutral), which cuts through the clag with the sharp and boozy smell of iced limoncello. Like all citrussy scents, this doesn’t hang around for long – expect to need an afternoon sharpener if you’re going out after work – but while it lasts, it’s glorious (unlike the majority of big-brand lemon fragrances, which almost invariably smell like loo cleaner). Finally, for the sophisticate (or perhaps someone used to fancier summer holiday destinations), we have Juliette Has A Gun’s Sunny Side Up (£85, 50ml), a warm, woody blend of white flowers, vanilla, sandalwood and more obligatory coconut that initially left me cold, but settled into a lovely, almost creamy, almondy musk that’s seen it graduate from my testing pile to dressing table, via boardroom, beach and beer garden."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"sport/2018/may/10/final-day-football-heroics-naked-champions-and-ducklings-on-the-pitch","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-10T09:00:08Z","webTitle":"Final-day football heroics, naked champions and ducklings on the pitch | Classic YouTube","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/10/final-day-football-heroics-naked-champions-and-ducklings-on-the-pitch","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/may/10/final-day-football-heroics-naked-champions-and-ducklings-on-the-pitch","fields":{"headline":"Final-day football heroics, naked champions and ducklings on the pitch","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"1) It’s been a weekend of triumph and disaster across English football as the season reached its final throes in the Football League. There were “scenes” at the Macron Stadium, where Aaron Wilbraham scored twice in the dying minutes to keep Bolton in the Championship. But perhaps the finest moment came at Rochdale, where Joe Thompson – after twice fighting back from cancer – scored the goal to keep Dale in League One. 2) This week in US sports part one: Seattle’s James Paxton becomes the first Canadian to pitch a no-hitter in MLB since 1945 (an improvement on his previous claim to fame when he got uncomfortably familiar with an American eagle during a pre-game ceremony); Filip Forsberg with your NHL goal of the week (he’s got between-the-legs previous); South Dakota student pole vaulter Chris Nilsen clears 5.81m – the third best vault in the world this year; and get your cute on: DUCKLINGS ON THE FIELD! 3) A thirsty Didier Drogba grabs some unorthodox refreshment, then swings in the perfect corner for Phoenix Rising. 4) Cars and bike races don’t mix particularly well these days. The Tour de Yorkshire was a roaring triumph over the weekend but it wasn’t far away from disaster thanks to the Astana team car. 5) Valtteri Bottas doesn’t seem much concerned about what is else on the road as he tears through the streets of Italy in his Mercedes F1 car on the way to the Lorenzo Bandini awards. Only the lane he was in was closed off, and oncoming traffic included tractors among the obstacles. 6) Before the World Snooker Championship Mark Williams had promised to turn up for his press conference naked in the unlikely even of him winning the thing. And he did. It’s been a week for unusual post-victory celebrations: after claiming the Spanish Moto GP, Marc Márquez celebrated in … well, “style” isn’t quite the right word but flossing looks very hard to do on a motorbike. 7) This week in US sports part two: the Orioles give up 10 runs in the first innings against the Royals in MLB; in the NBA, the Golden State Warriors’ Draymond Green listens in on the New Orleans team talk; and we admit to not being very familiar with the tactics of lacrosse, but this looks like a serious error in overtime in your pivotal college play-off match. Our favourites from last week’s blog 1) If you were inspired to pick up a cue after the dramatic World Snooker Championships finale, best get some lessons. Here’s Dennis Taylor and, um, Johnny Ball with some tips. 2) Gary McAliister has joined Rangers as Steven Gerrard’s assistant. Here he is scoring for Leeds at Ibrox to almost total silence. 3) Egg boxing? “I’ve probably only had four or five eggs in my life that’ve gone 12-0.” You do have to wonder. 4) In ice hockey, Great Britain’s men won the IIHF World Championship Division One title last month, a victory secured in dramatic circumstances (saved penalty shot and a tying goal in the last two minutes) in Budapest. They now have the opportunity to play against Canada, Sweden and Russia at next year’s Championships in Slovakia, the first time in 24 years they’ve been at this level. 5) Melbourne Victory won the A-League in fine style but not before Roy O’Donovan took out Jet’s keeper Lawrence Thomas with flying kick that even Graeme Souness might have blinked at.

To join in the conversation you can click on the links in the comments below to expand and add your thoughts. Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs - Politics live Andrew Sparrow summarised that for Corbyn, it was a clear win – and probably his best on the topic of Brexit after May was forced to give MPs single market vote. Here are some of your thoughts: ‘The prime minister became almost incoherent at times’ Much stronger performance from Corbyn today, thank goodness. He nailed May on divisions in the government and she became almost incoherent at times. Enjoyed looking at the glum faces, particularly David Lidington and Philip Hammond when she was trying to answer on her preferred customs arrangement. Daivedover ‘Is it worth ditching this last charade of democracy?’ Given the few times May actually answers the questions at PMQs, is it worth ditching this last charade of democracy? Maybe we should just go straight to the flimsy dictatorship already largely in place through emergency legislation, inadequate debating time, and the insertion of last minute amendments so beloved of this bunch. olderiamthelessiknow ‘Theresa May’s sole tactic at PMQs is diversion’ Corbyn asks the right questions, but with May this is no more effective than putting a letter in a bottle and consigning it to the waves. Her sole tactic at PMQs is diversion by way of talking-points and rehearsed soundbites. Mrdaydream Europe must make Trump pay for wrecking the Iran nuclear deal Foreign affairs commentator Simon Tisdall writes that “Donald Trump’s torpedoing of the Iran nuclear deal on highly specious and misleading grounds is an act of wanton diplomatic vandalism fraught with dangers.” You’ve been sharing your thoughts beneath his piece. ‘This will do nothing but increase the already shaky instability of a region’ In a long and growing succession of bad decisions, [Trump’s] decision yesterday to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal is the worst yet. It will do nothing but increase the already shaky instability of a region of the world where instability already reigns supreme. That said, I don’t agree that the UK should withdraw its invitation. I also don’t agree with the ongoing drive to isolate the United States. For the UK to withdraw the invitation would only further add to the growing US isolationism, at a time in the world’s history when nations should be working more closely together. His decision also, may it be said, could very well add to any scepticism already extant about any possibility of securing a lasting nuclear deal with North Korea.

Prostate cancer is something very close to my heart currently and your article is very timely.

Good to have you back. I hope there are some men out there that will read this and be reassured, especially with the ‘oversharing’ that ‘all is not lost’ after diagnosis and treatment. You reminded me of a patient I looked after in about 1968, when I was a student nurse: a single lady in her early 60s with rectal cancer who had had an AP excision leaving her with a permanent colostomy and a big scar on her behind that would take a while to heal. She was wandering around the ward a few days post-op when the docs were doing their ward round. She was called back to bed, and after the usual check, and chat to the medical students, she was asked if she had any questions. She said, in her prim and proper voice “When will I be able to start having intercourse again?”. I never did find out if she meant it or it was her wicked sense of humour, but the look on the doctors’ faces and the consultant delivering advice with a bright red face was a sight to behold. dunnock49 Comments have been edited for length.

With his partner, the screenwriter and actor Zoe Kazan, Dano has adapted the novel by Richard Ford about Joe, a teenage boy who has moved to a small town in 1950s Montana with his parents. They are on the genteel middle-class poverty line, living from pay cheque to pay cheque, and then to lack of pay cheque. When Joe’s restlessly angry and unemployed dad leaves to take a low-paying job fighting wildfires up in the hills, it ambiguously signals the end of the marriage, and Joe is the intimate witness to his mother Jeanette’s private depression and her courage in facing up to her new life choices. She treats him like an adult, or like an ersatz husband or best friend, and he is poignantly admitted to what writer Betty Friedan would later call “feminine mystique”. He and we see a gradual change in her – she reverts from the cheerful, respectable wife and mother that he is used to seeing around the house, to the sensual and rebellious young woman that his father originally fell in love with. But all this in a spirit of quiet desperation and caricature, as she begins to weigh up what’s involved in accepting the advances of a wealthy, good-humoured car salesman and war veteran whose own wife has left him. Jake Gyllenhaal plays Jerry Brinson, the dad, a man who looks permanently gaunt and exhausted, deeply dismayed by his failure to master the American dream or Dale Carnegie-style tricks of achieving popularity and social advancement. When we first see him at work, it seems that he is an assistant at the local golf course, but appears to have calamitously misjudged how up close and personal he is expected to be, actually cleaning the members’ shoes while they are wearing them, an embarrassing servility that jars with his cheery greetings and farewells. Ed Oxenbould plays Joe, a role that requires what might be considered a series of mute reaction shots, his cherubic face often set in a ruefully suppressed grimace as he impassively sizes up his father’s humiliation and depression and his mother Jeanette’s disappointment with life. Jeanette is played with terrific gusto by Carey Mulligan. It is one of the best roles and best performances, of her career – giving her a chance to display maturity, wit, savvy and the emotional battle scars of life, and taking her away from the rather girlish image in which she has often been confined. She is a fighter, a smiler, never-say-die-er, but only so long as her husband is prepared to do his part. We see her breezily wave away the issue of a cheque that has bounced at the bank and through sheer persistence get a job as a swimming instructor at the YMCA, a job that allows her to become socially acquainted with a certain adult pupil, her would-be beau, the corpulent, opulent Warren Miller, played by Bill Camp. Once Jerry is off the scene, he invites Jeanette and Joe to dinner at his house. Joe wanders into his bedroom while the grownups are talking and encounters Warren’s leg caliper gruesomely hanging up in the closet, and a hardly less gruesome contraceptive in his nightstand drawer. The relationship takes its course, and it’s Joe who has to get himself to school, get his own meals and wonder what his role is to be in this new fractured family. It’s an extremely watchable movie, beautifully and even luxuriously appointed in its austere evocation of small-town America – though maybe a little self-conscious in its emotional woundedness. Perhaps the character of Joe himself is its flaw, required to give us nothing much more than wordless dismay or acceptance of everything that is going on. His face is often seen in silent closeup, but the movie does not give us the kind of access to his feelings that we have with Jerry or Jeanette. Joe is, incidentally, working part-time as the assistant to a portrait photographer in town, and Dano periodically gives us nicely observed still images of the customers’ heartbreaking family portraits: a bourgeois-aspiration effect that has been used in Mike Leigh’s Secrets and Lies and Paul Thomas Anderson’s The Master. Dano has given us a satisfying drama of damaged lives."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2018/may/09/eurovision-2018-the-songs-to-look-out-for","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-09T10:47:18Z","webTitle":"Eurovision 2018: the songs to look out for, from gay couples to toy camels","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/09/eurovision-2018-the-songs-to-look-out-for","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/may/09/eurovision-2018-the-songs-to-look-out-for","fields":{"headline":"Eurovision 2018: the songs to look out for, from gay couples to toy camels","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The token metal entrant Eurovision, maybe due to an obscure EU directive, has to have a token metal act each year – and if they’re theatrical enough, as with Lordi in 2006, they can win. This year it’s Hungary’s AWS with Goodbye Summer, a song inspired by the death of the lead singer’s father (“I’m washed out and weary / You’re still holding on” he sings, bleakly). It’s surprisingly listenable – even helped by a dodgy key change at the end – although it’s such an anomaly compared to the other acts, it does feel a bit like Hungary’s right-wing government shouting: “No one likes us, we don’t care.” The muso’s choice Salvador Sobral of Portugal almost ruined his win last year when he declared it a victory for real music. “Music is not fireworks, music is feeling,” he said, “so let’s try to really change this and bring music back.” It was the moan of someone who only watches Eurovision under duress. But if you too are a believer in “real music”, then look out for France’s brilliant Madame Monsieur, with Mercy. There are no fireworks to their entry; it’s just a fantastic pop song, brimming with feeling, about a child born on a refugee ship, and it’ll please anyone who loves Christine &amp; the Queens. Merci for Mercy, indeed, GCSE French fans! The dance bangers Cyprus’s Eleni Foureira is the bookies’ favourite with Fuego – a dance banger that sounds like it was written to hit every bar around the Med as soon as Eurovision ends. Foureira has incredible hair and tosses it at every opportunity – she’s even made an instructional video for Eurovision TV – and I wouldn’t be surprised if she takes someone’s eye out in rehearsals and is forced to leave. If that happens, look out for the other banging dance tune in the line-up: Finland’s Saara Aalto with Monsters. Sung by the former X Factor runner-up, Aalto’s guaranteed the fetish – and alt-right – votes thanks to her dancers’ leather-heavy uniforms, but she deserves a lot more because the tune is brilliant. She is this year’s best Scandinavian act, and also sings upside down at one point while strapped to a Catherine wheel, which is surely worth something. The one with the chicken noises A few weeks ago, Israel’s Netta looked like she’d cruise to victory with Toy – a song that has everything from chicken impressions to a chorus perfect for the first #MeToo Eurovision (“I’m not your toy / You stupid boy”). So why’s she no longer leading the pack? Perhaps because she spends the first half of her performance standing behind what looks like an airline check-in desk. Fingers crossed she steps that part up for the final. The one that can only disappoint At a recent press event in London, Mikolas Josef – the Czech answer to Justin Timberlake – walked around with a backpack, telling everyone he had a surprise in it for his performance. If it’s fistfuls of pyrotechnics, it’ll be fantastic. Sadly, chances are it’ll be a toy camel, since the video for his track Lie to Me features him bizarrely astride one. Real camels are not allowed on the Eurovision stage; toy ones are. The reveal can only disappoint. The one with the big dress If you like pop opera, you’ll love Estonia’s Elina Nechayeva, who does the sort of glass-shattering operatics you normally only find soundtracking football tournaments. If you don’t like pop opera, enjoy the fact she has a humungous dress that people project animations on. It’s this year’s best gizmo – it cost €65,000, according to Politico, which Estonia’s government refused to pay for – although it does look a bit like a wedding guest trying to upstage a bride. The returning winner Someone should have told Norwegian violinist Alexander Rybak to retire on a high. Rybak cruised to victory at Eurovision 2009 with Fairytale – a violin hoedown and one of the catchiest songs ever to win. This year he’s back with the violin-disco of That’s How You Write a Song, during which he gives instructions for penning a Eurovision hit (“Step one, believe in it and sing it all day long”). The lyrics are clearly unhelpful to any aspiring songwriter listening, but the bigger problem is this has been done before. During 2016’s contest in Sweden, hosts Petra Mede and Måns Zelmerlöw presented their own guide to how to win Eurovision with Love Love Peace Peace, a very funny track that featured Rybak on violin. Is that where he got the idea? How on earth this is the third favourite (assuming he gets through the second semi-final on 10 May), I don’t know. The one that will annoy Russia The great surprise of Tuesday’s first semi-final was easily Ireland’s Ryan O’Shaughnessy. His Together doesn’t sound impressive on first listen – a cliche-stuffed love song (“I thought we’d be together ’til we die”) – but in Lisbon it soared, a real tear-jerker. It was helped by great staging: a young couple dancing with each other on a park bench, and twirling around a lamp-post in the snow. Who are the couple? Two men. That might not go down well in Russia with its “gay propaganda” ban, but should everywhere else. The UK’s SuRie, with Storm, is also a strong entry and would be guaranteed a top 10 placing if it wasn’t such a vintage year."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/09/europe-trump-wreck-iran-nuclear-deal-cancel-visit-sanctions","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-09T10:07:35Z","webTitle":"Europe must make Trump pay for wrecking the Iran nuclear deal | Simon Tisdall","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/09/europe-trump-wreck-iran-nuclear-deal-cancel-visit-sanctions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/may/09/europe-trump-wreck-iran-nuclear-deal-cancel-visit-sanctions","fields":{"headline":"Europe must make Trump pay for wrecking the Iran nuclear deal","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Donald Trump’s torpedoing of the Iran nuclear deal on highly specious and misleading grounds is an act of wanton diplomatic vandalism fraught with dangers. While the 2015 agreement may not yet be wholly sunk, it is holed below the waterline. Many in Tehran will see the sweeping reimposition of US sanctions as a declaration of war. As for Trump, he has once again proved himself the master of chaos. This aggressive bid to further isolate Iran appears designed to ultimately enforce regime change. In the short-term it will destroy remaining mutual goodwill, undermine pro-western Iranian opinion, empower hardliners, trigger an oil price crisis, and increase the risk of conflict centred on Syria and Israel. It raises the spectre of a regional nuclear arms race, and damages the western alliance to the advantage, among others, of Russia. It is a Crimea-sized blow to the primacy of international law. Yet Trump’s short-sighted folly, far from being unprecedented, is entirely consistent with a long history of similarly disastrous Middle East policy missteps by previous US presidents. The region is littered with the corpses of momentously misconceived and wrong-headed US policies, spawned by the same noxious mix of ignorance and arrogance now permeating the White House. In this respect, Trump is no different from many of his modern predecessors. Iran, as ever, is a case in point. The 1979-81 Tehran hostage crisis is usually referenced by those seeking to explain enduring, official US enmity. It’s true America’s national humiliation was considerable, and Jimmy Carter paid the political price. But the Iranian people’s real offence was not the embassy siege. It was their presumptuous overthrow of the shah’s autocratic, pro-American regime in the 1979 revolution. The US and the UK, after all, had gone to considerable trouble in 1953 to keep Iran in line, covertly ousting its democratically elected government of prime minister Mohammad Mosaddegh. Their loss of influence, consequent on Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini’s assertion of absolutist clerical rule, was the product of their own machinations. Here was the genesis of lethal US backing for Saddam Hussein in the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war. The fight to repel Saddam’s invasion took 300,000 Iranian lives. Its cost, and causes, are not forgotten. Close by the Khomeini mausoleum south of Tehran, I once walked among the well-tended, shaded graves of hundreds of “martyrs” interred in Behesht-e Zahra cemetery. The war was a national trauma. Yet there has been no US apology, nor any thought of one. Although the US finally turned on Saddam in 1990, although Iran helped track al-Qaida following the 2001 attacks, and even though the nuclear deal elicited significant concessions, venomously irrational, unmitigated US hostility persists. Among the many US-fomented catastrophes in the Middle East, George W Bush’s 2003 decision to invade Iraq without a plan was a standout moment, unrivalled in its strategic incoherence and staggering incompetence. It destabilised Iraq territorially and economically. Bush’s “axis of evil” rhetoric and “global war on terror” fuelled sectarian violence and jihadism, playing midwife to Islamic State. And the ensuing, lengthy occupation failed to entrench inclusive democratic governance, as this weekend’s Iraq elections may again demonstrate. Ronald Reagan used covert Middle East arms sales to fund an illegal war in Nicaragua in the 1980s. Likewise, the US armed the Afghan mujahideen, then blanched as they morphed into the Taliban. George HW Bush liberated Kuwait in 1991 only to betray Iraq’s Kurds and Shias when they demanded liberation, too. Bill Clinton tried to end the Palestine-Israeli conflict, inspiring great optimism. I recall standing on the White House’s south lawn in 1993 as Clinton physically pulled Yasser Arafat and Yitzhak Rabin together for a reluctant handshake that had taken decades in coming. “Enough of blood and tears, enough … The time for peace has come,” Rabin solemnly declared. But the time had not come. Blood continued to flow. Clinton’s efforts to play honest broker failed, like those of other American presidents, because, ultimately, the just claims of the Palestinians always proved unequal to Israel’s political, emotional, and financial clout in Washington. Far from endowing peace in Palestine, US policy has underwritten a deepening divide, the expansion of illegal settlements, and now the provocative recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital city. Arafat and Rabin are both dead. So too, almost, is the two-state solution. In the decades after the Suez Crisis in 1956, when Britain and France were shoved aside, successive US administrations war-gamed the Middle East as part of a bigger strategic contest with the Soviet Union. If that meant propping up pro-western dictators such as Egypt’s Hosni Mubarak and the Saudi and Gulf monarchs, then so be it. Yet as Condoleezza Rice, the former secretary of state, conceded in Cairo in 2005, it was a self-defeating policy. “For 60 years, my country, the United States, pursued stability at the expense of democracy in this region, here in the Middle East, and we achieved neither,” she said. In another famous Cairo speech, in 2009, Barack Obama promised a “new beginning”. The US had treated Middle East countries as either proxies or enemies, he said. Instead, Obama promised, it would tackle religious extremism, Palestine, nuclear proliferation, democratic deficits and women’s rights. Yet for all that, not much changed in the Obama years. Only the Iran deal marked a clear shift – until Trump wrecked it. In many respects, the region’s problems have grown steadily worse under American tutelage. Witness Somalia, a failed state-turned-shooting range for US special forces. Witness Yemen, a humanitarian disaster wrought by the US-armed Saudi regime. Witness Libya, anarchic product of made-in-America regime change. Witness Turkey where, in the age of Guantánamo, human rights increasingly count for naught. Unsurprisingly, terrorism, in many forms, is proliferating, as is displacement, poverty and youth unemployment. And all this without mentioning the post-2011 Syrian holocaust of half a million dead. Syria’s fate symbolises perhaps the biggest US failure of all: its hard-nosed refusal to support the Arab spring uprisings and stand up, despite Obama’s promises, for democratic self-determination. Know-nothing Trump is the direct heir to this grim litany of catastrophic presidential blundering. But that is not to say Britain and Europe should tolerate yet another avoidable Middle East disaster wrought in Washington. Just as Russia has been told certain actions are unacceptable and incur painful consequences if not reversed, so too should the US. The European allies must, by all available means, undercut, circumvent and subvert Trump’s attempt to wreck the Iran deal. Closer ties should be pursued with Tehran, while escalating, punitive diplomatic and economic sanctions are levelled at Washington. Joint action should also be taken to censure the US at the UN. A price must be paid for perfidy. Theresa May can make a start by withdrawing her ill-judged invitation to Trump to visit Britain. With his Middle East warmongering, as with his climate change denial and his other dangerous and divisive policies, Trump threatens British interests and international peace and security. It is no longer enough simply to complain and condemn. The moment for active resistance has arrived. • Simon Tisdall is a foreign affairs commentator"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"film/2018/may/15/star-trek-franchise-future-chris-hemsworth-quentin-tarantino","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-15T10:01:21Z","webTitle":"Warp speed Thor and a Tarantino space romp: where can Star Trek boldly go next?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/may/15/star-trek-franchise-future-chris-hemsworth-quentin-tarantino","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/may/15/star-trek-franchise-future-chris-hemsworth-quentin-tarantino","fields":{"headline":"Warp speed Thor and a Tarantino space romp: where can Star Trek boldly go next?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"As openings to a saga go, the beginning of 2009’s Star Trek is up there with the best for emotional wrench. James T Kirk’s dear old dad, George, is forced to sacrifice himself to save the lives of the crew members of the USS Kelvin, as well as his pregnant wife and unborn son, by piloting the 23rd-century Federation starship on a collision course with a marauding Romulan ship. We then see how this single incident completely altered the timeline of the younger Kirk’s life. Where Spock’s future bezzie mate always had his maverick side and a natural inclination not to play by the rules, Chris Pine’s version of the future starship captain is now reimagined as a cosmic take on James Dean in Rebel Without a Cause, stealing his stepdad’s 1965 Corvette Stingray, getting into bar fights and generally making a nuisance of himself. Thus, JJ Abrams’ zippy reboot intelligently rebuilt Kirk for a new generation, giving Pine the chance to make the part his own. The opening has been given extra significance over the past few years because the actor who played George for those fleeting, fiery moments on board the Kelvin has since become one of Hollywood’s most recognisable faces. Not so long ago, Chris Hemsworth’s Thor was one of the least interesting members of Marvel’s Avengers, but the searingly funny Thor: Ragnarok and the events of Avengers: Infinity War have completely turned matters on their head. So it is hardly surprising that Paramount has for some time now been concocting a plan to try to bring old George Kirk back in some form – to meet his kid and help the studio bask in the reflected glow of Hemsworth’s recently boosted star wattage. A reminder that this pitch remains on the table for Star Trek’s next adventure came recently when the internet went into a brief tizzy over comments from actor Jennifer Morrison, who suggested at a convention in Calgary that gorgeous George might not have been burnt to a frazzle by Romulan space cannons after all. Morrison has since clarified her comments to confirm that she knows nothing whatsoever about the plot of the mooted Star Trek 4. But with Star Trek Beyond writer (and face of Scotty) Simon Pegg having confirmed reports this week that a pair of follow-ups to the 2016 film are currently in the pipeline, now seems like the right time to ponder where the saga might boldly go next. The elephant in the room here is Quentin Tarantino’s ongoing pitch for an R-rated Trek episode, also confirmed by Pegg. How will Paramount reconcile the two movies? Well, why even bother to try? The 2009 Star Trek has already established the principle of alternative timelines (via Spock Prime’s time-travelling antics) and shown it can be used to explain shifts in tone, pacing and characterisation from the original series of films. If Star Trek producers really want to, they could use the same trick to explain both George Kirk’s survival and the (presumably radical) reframing of the crew of the Starship Enterprise required for the separate Tarantino project. The first new Star Trek movie might centre on a space-time anomaly that sees the universe trying to reset itself, briefly bringing together various timelines and alternate realities before settling on a single future. (Surely something like this can be found in The Theory of Everything if we look hard enough?) Hence, the James T Kirk of the current movie timeline might be able to meet the George Kirk of the old-school Star Trek timeline, where the latter never encountered the Romulan ship and died a ripe old age after helping his son emerge as a well-rounded young man, etc etc. A pathos-drenched finale, mirroring the dramatic death scene of Spock in 1982’s Star Trek 2: The Wrath of Khan (“I have ... and always shall be ... your dad...”) might see father and son forced apart once again as the multiple timelines are fused into a single existence – wiping George once again from the picture! Quite what remarkable event might have had to take place to shift the current Star Trek movieverse into territory where it makes sense as a Tarantino movie is open to question. Perhaps Kirk experienced a slacker, cinefile youth after the attack on the Romulan ship, briefly working in the 23rd-century equivalent of a rundown video store and developing an obsession with kitschy 1960s Hollywood space flicks. Perhaps he learned everything he needs to know about surviving in the vast reaches of space from repeat viewing’s of 1975’s The Girl from Starship Venus (AKA The Sexplorer), reputedly one of QT’s fave grindhouse romps. Who knows, and who cares? We all want to know what the Kill Bill film-maker will do with Star Trek, and it’s clear the saga has the tools to let him loose on Kirk, Spock et al without messing up the main narrative. Now Paramount just has to make this happen, because if studio execs fail to seize this opportunity they deserve to be fed to the Klingons."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2018/may/09/sam-lee-singing-with-nightingales-review","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-09T11:30:46Z","webTitle":"Sam Lee Singing With Nightingales review – joyous interspecies collaboration","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/09/sam-lee-singing-with-nightingales-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/may/09/sam-lee-singing-with-nightingales-review","fields":{"headline":"Sam Lee Singing With Nightingales review – joyous interspecies collaboration","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"It takes a brave musician to play a gig with no guarantee that the lead vocalist will show up. But Sam Lee, the Mercury prize-nominated folk singer and song collector, reveals himself to be a master storyteller as we await his duet with a nocturnal wild bird. Lee tells of the first such human-nightingale duet, when, in 1924, cellist Beatrice Harrison persuaded the BBC to live broadcast the sound of her playing in her Surrey garden “duetting” with a nightingale. On the 90th anniversary of Harrison’s collaboration, Lee began taking groups into the countryside to accompany the bird’s nocturnal singing. This month, he’s holding concerts at conventional venues, with nightingale song live-streamed from the rewilded farm of Knepp in West Sussex. We begin with Lee phoning Penny Green, Knepp’s ecologist, whose task is to locate a notoriously shy singing male nightingale. As the lights mimic the sun setting, Lee sings a traditional Sussex folk song before bringing in guest musicians, guitarist Fiston Lusambo and Caoimhin Ó Raghallaigh, who plays the hardanger d’amore, a 10-string fiddle. Lusambo, raised in the Democratic Republic of Congo, is particularly inspired casting. While the nightingale is celebrated by English Romantic poets from Keats to Clare, this migratory bird actually brings the music of Africa to Britain, spending more time there than he does in the UK. At 10.27pm, Lee calls Green again. “We’ve got a singer,” says Knepp’s ecologist on speakerphone, adding, with feeling: “Oh my goodness, this is so stressful.” Suddenly, loud and close, an extraordinary burst of trills, whistles and melodic extemporisation; the liquid song of the tropics and gunfire bird-rap. Lee lets us listen in rapt silence before slowly accompanying on his Indian shruti box. Lusambo follows with intricate guitar, while Ó Raghallaigh adds a whistle he bought two days earlier in a Hastings junkshop. These wistful sounds reflect the 90% crash in the nightingale population over the past four decades; there is urgency in Lee’s mission to bring its song to audiences who can no longer hear it. Despite that loss, there is joy in this deeply collaborative night – between instruments, nations and species – and a renewed sense that we can find harmony with other creatures. • At the Phoenix, Exeter on 9 May.

(What exactly remains to be seen: Revenge could equally be paired with March’s Death Wish as evidence of a violent lurch to the right.) Breaking In is the major studio option, which means a male writer and director, fewer nasty edges and minimised bloodshed (as if someone at Universal was hedging for a lower rating). It also unfolds around one of those implausibly vast, only-in-the-movies properties, replete with pool room, expansive crawlspace and a security system to set any CIA wonk to salivating. Nevertheless, this viewer caught himself giggling at just how well it was working. Gabrielle Union is the protective mother who arrives in rural Wisconsin – sans husband, but with young son and daughter in tow – to oversee the sale of her no-good father’s estate. Suspicions are raised that somebody may have beaten her there; these are borne out with the appearance of four variably stubbly louses – headed by Twilight’s Billy Burke – with eyes on the $4m in dad’s safe. Momma Bear is soon on the wrong side of the house’s electronic shutters, with her kids being held hostage indoors – a nimble reversal of standard siege-movie procedure, in that our sympathies now reside with the figure on the outside looking in. Is it significant that this individual should be a female of colour? Journeyman director James McTeigue’s better work (V for Vendetta, Sense8) has always maintained an element of social commentary: we sense him lingering when Burke tells Union “You are a woman, alone, at the mercy of strangers”, which makes it even more cathartic whenever our resourceful heroine locates a weak spot. That subtext provides the only spice in what’s basically a meat-and-potatoes runaround, but these 88 minutes never drag their heels long enough for us to get hung up on their myriad implausibilities.

But councillors and staff now have to puzzle out exactly what they said about local services and policies. Could it be that they didn’t say much at all? Deliberately or not voters endorsed the old Labour-Tory dualism in England’s local government. If the elections marked the end of Ukip as a presence, few will notice, the party having made little or no impact on policy or service delivery. The election results aren’t enough to change the leadership of the Local Government Association (LGA); the new communities secretary, James Brokenshire, will be polite but give the LGA no more recognition than his predecessor. He can say, with evidence, this wasn’t a convincing vote against austerity; equally the vote showed a lot of people are angry at the continuing cuts. Results defy clear interpretation, especially in particular places. Take the London borough of Barnet. Labour campaigned against the Tories’ “easy council” model – which favours maximum outsourcing to Capita and other companies – and on housing. Labour lost seats and the Tory majority was restored. So whether or not the voting arithmetic is explained by Labour’s problems over anti-Semitism, the outcome could be interpreted as popular endorsement of controversial policies. Alternatively, Barnet Tories may feel they lucked out thanks to Labour’s internal battles and might realise how close they came to defeat. Among Tory councillors at large, particularly in London, there was genuine fright about losses and the lesson being drawn is about backing away from rigid and dogmatic positions on outsourcing and social housing. Austerity continues but among incoming Tory leaders, there’s a mood of moderation, which may play out – money permitting – in more consensual and communitarian policies. Affordable housing may benefit if, even in Tory councils, the conviction is growing that more must be done. In Nuneaton and Bedworth, pundits focused on Brexit as the explanation for Labour losses. Maybe, but locally the result – no overall control of the district council – creates further confusion and uncertainty about what happens to housebuilding. Before the election, the Tory opposition criticised the borough’s Labour leadership as making too generous an allocation for new homes in plans; meanwhile the (largely) Tory councils in the Warwickshire and Coventry sub region criticised the council for not making a large enough provision for new housing. Results, in other words, may not tell you much about policy. In Haringey, it’s not at all clear whether Labour losses reflect on the borough’s controversial development scheme, which precipitated the departure of the leader, Claire Kober. Her successor confronts the hard question: if not the special purpose vehicle and private finance, what mechanism can a cash-strapped council, hemmed in by restrictions on borrowing, actually use to secure new and refurbished social rented accommodation? Haringey aside, Corbynite forces have yet to register as a municipal presence; in the Labour camp, watchwords are sensible, practical and credible and where the party remains in power, it’s business as usual. You could go round the results and point up the disparity between ostensible reasons for voting and what they mean for council decisions. In Plymouth the election, which saw Labour make gains and take control of the unitary council, was interpreted by a local Tory MP as a protest at inadequate defence spending by his own government. The result is Labour takes up the reins it dropped in 2015, except this time we are two years further into austerity, with the council’s capacity even less than it was. The return of Kensington and Chelsea’s ruling Tories – in charge since 1965 – may reduce urgency around Grenfell, on the part of councillors, if not the community around the tower. Ironically, the tragedy was a spur for refreshing the party leadership in the town hall, improving Tory performance at the election. The return of Sheffield’s ruling Labour councillors – who have been predominant over many years – gives little or no guide to what happens next in the story of the city’s trees. Labour lost a handful of seats and the Greens gained two. You don’t have to be a psephologist to observe that at that rate of attrition, Labour is going to remain in power in Sheffield for years, whether or not its councillors stop contractor Amey going ahead and cutting down the remaining avenues.

The deal for the Virgin Media owner, which has been the subject of on-off talks for several years, will transform Vodafone from a mobile phone operator into a cable and broadband TV giant across Europe. “This transaction will create the first truly converged pan-European champion of competition,” said Vittorio Colao, chief executive of Vodafone Group. “It represents a step change in Europe’s transition to a gigabit society [next generation broadband]. Vodafone will become Europe’s leading next generation network owner, serving the largest number of mobile customers and households across the European Union.” After Vodafone completes the takeover – which includes Liberty Global’s operations in the Czech Republic, Hungary and Romania – it will have 54 million cable TV and broadband customers across Europe. Sky, which operates in the UK, Ireland, Germany, Austria and Italy, has 23 million. Vodafone has 120 million mobile customers in Europe. The deal excludes Virgin Media, which Liberty Global bought for £15bn in 2013 in its biggest ever deal, although Colao did not rule out a potential move in the future. “You can never say never in life, but this is a pretty big deal for us and now we [must] have a bit of time to digest,” he said. “Virgin Media is not on the agenda right now.” The deal excludes Liberty Global’s joint venture with Vodafone in the Netherlands, VodafoneZiggo, which will be the subject of a strategic review in the 2020-21 financial year as part of the agreement between the two companies. The sale will leave John Malone, who controls Liberty Global through voting shares, with almost €11bn in cash to inject into its remaining businesses. The deal could spark speculation that he may once again consider buying ITV, in which Liberty Global has a 9.9% stake. The company has repeatedly said ITV, which has a market value of £6bn, is overpriced as a takeover target. Analysts have also speculated that Liberty Global may look to boost Virgin Media by buying a mobile operation, with O2 an obvious target as its owner, Telefónica, is already eyeing a £10bn stock market listing to realise value from the business. “We are not saying what we will do with the proceeds, we have no transactions in the queue,” said Mike Fries, chief executive of Liberty Global. “We intend to look to optimise growth and shareholder returns. This is about us being clear-eyed about where our best opportunities lie.” The potential benefits of a tie-up of the UK’s biggest cable operator with the largest commercial, free-to-air broadcaster was spotted more than a decade ago when NTL Telewest – before a rebrand to Virgin Media – held merger talks. It was James Murdoch, then chief executive of Sky, who, after identifying the threat the combination could make, thwarted the move by swooping to buy a 17.9% stake for almost £1bn. Fries said the deal was necessary because in some markets, such as Germany, which is dominated by Deutsche Telekom, there is a lack of competition. “Now more than ever, Europe needs strong competition from scaled national challengers willing and able to invest in next-generation wireless, video and broadband services,” he said. “Germany, for example, is dominated by one provider that controls over half the broadband market. Even together, Liberty Global and Vodafone, whose cable networks do not compete or overlap, will be half the size of the incumbent operator. It’s time to alter market dynamics by unleashing greater investment and competition.” A break fee of €250m will be payable by Vodafone, in certain circumstances, if the deal does not complete."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/may/28/country-diary-terns-return-to-their-nesting-sites-along-the-shoreline","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-28T04:30:44Z","webTitle":"Country diary: terns return to their nesting sites along the shoreline","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/28/country-diary-terns-return-to-their-nesting-sites-along-the-shoreline","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/may/28/country-diary-terns-return-to-their-nesting-sites-along-the-shoreline","fields":{"headline":"Country diary: terns return to their nesting sites along the shoreline","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"“Terns have got everything stacked against them. They don’t have good PR. They suffer from looking too much like gulls.” I’m walking with Barry Yates, manager of Rye Harbour nature reserve, towards the distant boom of the sea. It’s a perfect April morning, bright with the high calls of terns, as warm as summer. We near the beach, and as if summoned by Yates’s words, seven little terns, Sternula albifrons, flash across in front of us, arrowing through the air like shards of light. They’re starling-sized, fragile creatures that spend winter in west Africa, flying up to 10,000km each year to come and nest on British coasts. Rye Bay, which curves from the cliffs at Fairlight round to the lowering fortress of Dungeness power station, has just had its special protection area status extended to include the seabirds’ nesting sites along this strange and mutable stretch of shoreline. Industrial fishing of their west African winter waters and falling fish stocks here in Britain are just some of the threats faced by these terns. They must also struggle with chick-devouring badgers, foxes and kestrels; and the fact that the landscapes they love – of low-lying spits and shingle islands – have become vanishingly rare. Human pressure, whether for recreation or to redress coastal erosion, has deprived terns of the wild places they have evolved to inhabit. Yates and I make our way deeper into the wide, salt-flung reaches of the reserve. The pools and lagoons are ringed with electric fences to deter badgers and foxes. “A single kestrel could take all of our little tern chicks in a day, though,” Yates says. From hides we peer out, squinting into sunlight, and see first Sandwich terns – large, black-capped and muscular – and then common terns, with their vivid red beaks and feet, their soft grey plumage. A few days later I was swimming far out in Rye Bay, a glorious evening, the sun dropping down over Winchelsea. Another flock of little terns shot past, yellow beaks daggering, dipping to drink from the waves. They’re known as “sea swallows” in some parts and this is how we should think about them: our most graceful and beautiful sea birds, full of the promise of summer."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/may/09/revealed-network-rails-new-800m-scheme-to-remove-all-leaf-fall-trees","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-09T15:21:27Z","webTitle":"Revealed: Network Rail draws up option to remove all 'leaf fall' trees from wider trackside area","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/09/revealed-network-rails-new-800m-scheme-to-remove-all-leaf-fall-trees","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/may/09/revealed-network-rails-new-800m-scheme-to-remove-all-leaf-fall-trees","fields":{"headline":"Revealed: Network Rail draws up option to remove all 'leaf fall' trees from wider trackside area","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"• Editorial note: An earlier version of this story suggested that the Network Rail document had been adopted as current policy. This article has been amended to reflect Network Rail’s assertion that the document contains policy options none of which have been adopted. Network Rail has drawn up a plan to target all “leaf fall” trees for removal alongside its tracks, according to an internal policy document seen by the Guardian. The document sets out a series of alternatives for dealing with the millions of trees along Britain’s railway over the next five years, and says the preferred option is a programme of “enhanced clearance”. [Network Rail says the document is hypothetical modelling and that it has no plans to implement the favoured option presented in the document. It says that it cuts down about 1,000 trees a week at present, and has no plans to change that.] The policy document for 2019-24 emerged as the environment secretary, Michael Gove, summoned the chief executive of Network Rail for talks over their approach to environmental management following revelations about tree felling across the country by the Guardian. After discussions with Network Rail, Jo Johnson, the rail minister, set up a review into vegetation management . He called for all tree felling to be suspended during the current nesting season - March to August. Johnson said: “This review will look at all aspects of this issue, including, for instance, whether Network Rail has the capacity and capability to control vegetation in a way that minimises harm to wildlife, and whether staff need more training to help with tree identification and identifying approaches that would be better than felling.” The leaked document seen by the Guardian sets out a new policy option which appears to go further than any current environmental management. It would involve an “enhanced level of clearance” of trees and vegetation from the railway banks along 20,000 miles of lines in the UK, in an attempt to deal with costly delays to services and improve safety. Network Rail says it owns 6m trees. Its internal document identifies 13 million trees within falling distance of the tracks – some on third party land and some on its own land. “Network Rail is responsible for any damage that they may cause unless it can be robustly demonstrated that it has taken reasonable steps to reduce the risk of that damage occurring,” the document states. Network Rail said in a statement that it was constantly balancing the needs of the environment against passenger health and safety. But it denied the document was a statement of intention, describing it as “a piece of modelling work” that has not been adopted as policy. “It is a piece of modelling work our regulator asked us to do that actually demonstrates [that] moving to a more aggressive vegetation approach is very costly and does not represent value for money,” a spokesman said in an email to the Guardian. The document specifies that it would need £41,000 per mile of track for the enhanced clearance. It said this would result in “a far better performing safer railway.” If the estimate is extrapolated across the entire 20,000-mile network, it would cost more than £800m. The document says that certain species of trees pose greater risk due to the amount and size of leaves they produce. They include sycamore, poplar, horse and sweet chestnut, ash and lime. Network Rail says in the document that it needs to reduce the risk of leaves and trees falling on to the lines, improve performance and safety and cut the hundreds of millions of pounds it pays in compensation – called schedule 8 payments – for delays. Entitled Lineside Asset Management Control Period 6 (CP6), the document’s preferred option involves the “removal of all leaf fall species” within falling distance of the track, “intensive intervention” on vegetation in close proximity to the railway and the removal of emergent lower level growth at the earliest stage. The area for management of scrub, grasses, trees and shrubs will also increase from five metres either side of the railway – which has been the policy for the last five years – to a minimum of 6.5m. Grasses and scrubland alongside Britain’s railway lines are made up of more than 1,600 species of plants, including 900 varieties known of as “railway species” that are exclusive to the trackside. Senior politicians have been in discussions with the publicly owned company over the scale of its vegetation clearance after the Guardian revealed last week millions of trees are at risk. A petition calling on Network Rail to “stop chopping down millions of trees” attracted more than 60,000 signatures. Gove invited Mark Carne, chief executive of Network Rail, for talks at his office on Wednesday. Network Rail says it cuts down about 50,000 trees a year. It has not responded to requests to provide the Guardian with an aerial map highlighting “problem” trees earmarked for felling. A freedom of information response revealed that 30,000 trees were felled by Network Rail or their contractors on the west coast mainline between Euston and Carlisle in the 12 months between February 2016 and February 2017. Network Rail said there were no plans to replace any of the trees in its FOI response. Network Rail says in the document it will adhere to environmental legislation which requires it to restrict practices at certain locations or certain times of the year. It says the risks to poor performance and safety from trees includes obstruction of the line, causing delays and putting staff and passengers at risk. Between March 2016 and March 2017 there were 720 incidents with trees, according to the document. Of these 233 trees were struck by trains. “The likelihood of a tree failure causing an accident is high,” the document states. The company says the impact from falling leaves in the autumn of 2015 involved four signals passed at danger, 91 wrong side failures and 61 station overruns due to poor rail adhesion attributed to leaf fall contamination. These incidents, it says, cost Network Rail between £100m and £150m. Network Rail says in the document that trees and vegetation can have a positive benefit in terms of lineside ecology where desirable flora and fauna have been identified and sustainable management plans have been put into place. It also states the company will “manage the vegetation to comply with legal requirements to protect the environment.” A spokesperson for Network Rail said: “Last year we recorded over 400 incidents of trains colliding with fallen trees and another 1,000 where they caused delays to services, costing the industry over £100m. As a result, we have well thought-out standards and policies in place that have been developed over many years with the help of experts that we believe strike the right balance and maintains a safe and biodiverse line side. “Most of the time when putting those standards and policies into action we get it right, but sometimes we don’t.” Sara Lom, chief executive of the Tree Council, which works closely with Network Rail, has not seen the new policy document. She said: “We are Network Rail’s critical friend. When things go wrong, as they sometimes do, we tell them.” She said the charity was carrying out trials with the company this autumn to look at different ways to manage vegetation apart from tree felling. “Alternatives to removal could be coppicing or pollarding or hedging,” she said. “That is better for wildlife, and better for people in the local community.” • This article was amended on 24 August 2018 following a complaint from Network Rail. The readers’ editor substantially upheld the complaint, finding that in initial reports the status of the leaked policy options document had been overstated."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2018/may/09/android-p-google-phone-software-ai-update-smart-reply","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-09T10:32:20Z","webTitle":"Android P: everything you need to know about Google's latest phone software","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/may/09/android-p-google-phone-software-ai-update-smart-reply","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/may/09/android-p-google-phone-software-ai-update-smart-reply","fields":{"headline":"Android P: everything you need to know about Google's latest phone software","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Google unveiled a range of new features that are coming to the next version of its mobile operating system, Android P, injecting artificial intelligence into everything. We still don’t know the final name of Android P, but from smart replies to smart battery management, enhanced privacy and attempts to cure smartphone addiction, a lot is changing for Android for the next year. Here are the all the main features as unveiled at its Google I/O developer conference on Tuesday. When can I get it? The open Android P beta kicked off on Tuesday, and unlike previous years limited to just Google’s Nexus or Pixel devices, third-party smartphones are invited. Those with a Google Pixel or Pixel 2, Sony Xperia XZ2, Xiaomi Mi Mix 2S, Nokia 7 Plus, Oppo R15 Pro, Vivo X21 or Essential PH-1 can head to the Android beta test page to enrol their devices. The OnePlus 6, which has yet to launch, will also be included in the Android P beta. Will anyone else ever get it? The problem with Android updates is it often takes as long as a year before third-party manufacturers push out major versions. Google is trying to solve this by giving early access to Qualcomm, which makes many of the smartphone processors, as well as third-party manufacturers. Android P promises to be the fastest update to non-Google devices yet, but notable absentees to the initiative are the two biggest Android smartphone manufacturers, Samsung and Huawei. Gesture navigation Following on from Apple’s introduction of gestures for navigating on the iPhone X, several Android smartphone manufacturers have introduced similar gesture options, including OnePlus. Google is adding the option into Android P to replace the familiar on-screen back, home and overview buttons with just a back and home button. Tapping the home button goes to the home page of the launcher, but swiping up once from it activates overview, while two swipes opens the app drawer. Notch support Displays with so-called “notches” are quickly becoming common, with several smartphones such as the Huawei P20 Pro already available with the cutouts at the top housing front-facing cameras, sensors and speakers. Android P will introduce full support for notches optimising how content, notifications and status icons are shown around them. Time on the left One of the smallest but most noticeable changes is the shifting of the clock to the left from the right. The left used to show the mobile network signal quality and notifications from apps. But now the time is in the left corner and the signal meter has been moved to the right side. App actions and AI predictions Google is using machine learning to try to predict what users want all over Android. Within the new horizontal multitasking page, Android P will try to guess which app you want next. The new App actions feature goes one stage further, attempting to predict the task you are trying to perform, showing a shortcut to take you straight to the section of a particular app that deals with it. Smart replies for notifications Having debuted within the Gmail app, and then a dedicated Smart Reply app, Google is bringing AI-powered reply suggestions straight into the notification area. With Android P, you will no longer have to think or write anything back to the dozens of inane messages you get – just tap a button and be done with it. Slices A bit like the way Google surfaces information within search on the web using boxes to display snippets of sites within the results, Slices displays information from apps directly within the Google search app. One of the demonstrations shows pictures from Google photos for place searches. The feature requires app developers to build in the capability, but this is Google attempting to make search more relevant within the current app-siloed paradigm. Adaptive Battery Google’s assault on battery-hogging apps continues with Android P in the shape of Adaptive Battery. Developed by Alphabet’s AI-outfit DeepMind, Adaptive Battery learns an individual’s usage patterns and directs the power to only the apps you need at the time you need them for more predictable day-to-day battery life. Android P also has a new way of categorising apps called App Standby Buckets that separates the apps you use from those you don’t, restricting those you don’t actively use or have installed but never launched from draining the battery. Third-party manufacturers, including Huawei, have long had similar services on their phones, but it is good to see Google backing the technology in Android. Adaptive Brightness Automatic brightness adjustment using an ambient light sensor has been built into Android for years. Now Google is integrating AI into the feature so that it will actually learn from your manual adjustments to automatically tailor screen brightness to levels better suited to the individual user. A cure for phone addiction? Google also showed off tools focused on “digital wellbeing”, designed to prevent smartphone addiction. These include an app dashboard, which shows how much time you’ve spent on your phone and what you’ve been doing with it. An app timer allows you to set limits on certain apps, nudging you when getting close to your allotted time and greying out the app once the timer is up. Finally, the Wind Down feature will automatically enable Night Light, which cuts down on blue light emitted by the screen, turns on the Do Not Disturb mode and changes the screen to greyscale at your set bedtime. Enhanced privacy Google is revamping the way Android handles background apps to better protect user privacy. Starting with Android P, apps given permission for location, the microphone, camera and network status will no longer be able to access them when idle in the background. As such, it will be harder for rogue apps to spy on users without their knowledge. The changes follow a recent tightening of control over how and when apps run that were made with Android Nougat and Android Oreo, primarily to prolong battery life and performance.

That said, low-key isn’t the phrase that immediately springs to mind when confronted with their performance. The stage is bedecked with so many flowers and so much foliage it looks less like the Royal Festival Hall than the Royal Horticultural Society spring show. The band numbers eight, including two keyboard players, two percussionists and a harpist who occasionally diversifies with glockenspiel, and the venue’s enormous pipe organ – usually concealed behind boards at the rear of the stage – is on display and primed for use during the encore. It’s intended as no slight on the organist to say it that doesn’t make much difference to the overall sound. One of the effects of cramming a band used to playing arenas into somewhere smaller is that they invariably sound immense, as if the venue is struggling to contain their sound. So it is tonight, which fits Florence + the Machine’s music. Their – well, her – stock-in-trade is high drama, heavy on the rumbling drums and roaring vocals. It says something that a song as breezily anthemic as 2015 single Ship to Wreck, complete with its Fleetwood Mac-like chorus, represents one of the more subdued moments. A handful of songs from the band’s forthcoming fourth album, High as Hope, seem to dial down the ostentation slightly – such things are obviously relative, but there is a folky simplicity about current single Sky Full of Song – at least until they get to 100 Years, a track so gung-ho in its theatrical swoops from gentle piano ballad to tom-tom pounding and violin scraping it makes the other gung-ho theatrical tracks they’ve come up with thus far sound as if they were merely warming up. It can all be a bit much on record, but it gains an appealingly visceral force live. The same is true of Florence Welch’s voice: what sounds histrionic coming out of a pair of headphones makes more sense amid the tumult of the band’s live sound. The stagecraft designed to reach the nosebleed seats at Frankfurt’s Jahrhunderthalle looks a little nuts close up. There is a great deal of creeping around on tiptoes and a preponderance of expressive hand gestures. At one juncture, Welch crouches at the front of the stage, blank-eyed, apparently lost in the moment – one slightly spoiled by the fact that the stage is low, and the spotlight picking her out illuminates a security guard, blinking and looking as mortified as it is possible for a person to look. Welch – who can’t swig a bottle of water at the rear of the stage without twirling around and waving her arms about en route – cuts a wildly OTT figure. But you’d be hard-pushed to suggest she isn’t entertainingly OTT, compounded by the feeling – again not always obvious on record – that she doesn’t take herself quite as seriously as you might expect. At one point, she earnestly implores the audience to put their phones away and their hands in the air. “This moment is going to disappear, and we’re going to allow it to disappear,” she says, then reconsiders. “Unless you come to another show, and then obviously, we’ll do it again.” With the Rolling Stones at London Stadium, 25 May.

Vinko Osmakcic, a Croatian believed to be behind a number of high-value diamond thefts across Europe and the US, is wanted in connection with the disappearance of the jewellery from the event at the Royal Hospital Chelsea last year, Scotland Yard said. The rings were removed from a cabinet at the Masterpiece London 2017 event at the famous retirement home on Royal Hospital Road on 4 July at around 5.30pm. The Metropolitan police have reissued an image of a man they believe to be Osmakcic in a fresh attempt to solve the case. It shows a bespectacled man with receding grey hair, dressed in a blue polo shirt and jeans. Osmakcic was identified in 2010 by the New Yorker as being part of the Pink Panther network, named by Interpol after the crime-comedy films starring Peter Sellers. It was reported that he was a suspect in heists in Basel, Honolulu and Las Vegas among others. DS Chris Taylor from Kensington and Chelsea CID, which is leading the investigation, said: “This was a well-planned and audacious theft committed in the middle of a busy art fair. “It is highly likely that Mr Osmakcic may be out of the UK, possibly in Europe. He may also be known by the following name Vinko Tomic or Juro Markelic.” One ring featured a cushion-shaped diamond, another had a yellow cushion-shaped stone encased in smaller oval and round diamonds, and the third was an emerald-cut diamond with purple and pink stones and four pear-shaped diamonds. The prestigious Masterpiece London art fair features at least 160 international exhibitors of art, design, furniture and jewellery. The Pink Panther network is composed of members from across the Balkan peninsula and is linked to some of the most high-profile robberies and burglaries worldwide. Interpol has estimated that there are at least 60 members in the gang and possibly even several hundred thieves in the network. At last count, they were thought to have carried out around 380 armed robberies targeting high-end jewellery stores between 1999 and 2015. The combined value of these thefts was more than €334m."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/may/10/maasai-herders-driven-off-land-to-make-way-for-luxury-safaris-report-says","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-10T10:00:11Z","webTitle":"Maasai herders driven off land to make way for luxury safaris, report says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/10/maasai-herders-driven-off-land-to-make-way-for-luxury-safaris-report-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/may/10/maasai-herders-driven-off-land-to-make-way-for-luxury-safaris-report-says","fields":{"headline":"Maasai herders driven off land to make way for luxury safaris, report says","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Tanzanian government is putting foreign safari companies ahead of Maasai herding communities as environmental tensions grow on the fringes of the Serengeti national park, according to a new investigation. Hundreds of homes have been burned and tens of thousands of people driven from ancestral land in Loliondo in the Ngorongoro district in recent years to benefit high-end tourists and a Middle Eastern royal family, says the report by the California-based thinktank the Oakland Institute. Although carried out in the name of conservation, these measures enable wealthy foreigners to watch or hunt lions, zebra, wildebeest, giraffes and other wildlife, while the authorities exclude local people and their cattle from watering holes and arable land, the institute says. The report, released on Thursday highlights the famine and fear caused by biodiversity loss, climate change, inequality and discrimination towards indigenous groups. Losing the Serengeti: The Maasai Land that was to Run Forever uses previously unpublished correspondence, official documents, court testimonies and first-person testimony to examine the impact of two firms: Thomson Safaris based in the United States, and Otterlo Business Corporation based in the United Arab Emirates. It says Thomson’s sister company, Tanzania Conservation Limited, is in a court battle with three Maasai villages over the ownership of 12,617 acres (5,106 hectares) of land in Loliondo which the company uses for safaris. One Maasai quoted in the report said Thomson had built a camp in the middle of their village, blocking access. “Imagine, a stranger comes and constructs a big building in the centre of your home,” reads the testimony. “Our livestock cannot go to the waterhole – there is no other route for the villagers or their livestock.” The report says villagers have been driven off, assaulted or arrested by local police, park rangers or security guards. The restricted access to land has made the Maasai more vulnerable to famine during drought years, the report says, noting appeals that locals have made for the government to change policies because of growing numbers of malnourished children. A Maasai villager contacted by the Guardian said access remained blocked and that uniformed agents had beaten, threatened or tied-up and driven off pastoralists, as recently as December. Thomson strongly denies these accusations. It says Tanzania Conservation Limited employs 100% Maasai staff, allows cattle on the property to access seasonal water, and works with local communities and the government to conserve the savannah, improve access to water and formulate a sustainable grazing policy. The company blames past conflicts on NGO activists who they say stirred up villagers and led to staff being assaulted by young warriors armed with clubs, spears, knives and poison arrows. “These interventions have been played out to attract attention, provide stories, and to disrupt the working relationship between company and communities on the ground,” Rick Thomson, a director of Tanzania Conservation, wrote in an email to the Guardian. “In these events the endangered staff have a protocol of disengaging any way they can to avoid escalation, and reporting to the authorities any situation where any people and property, are physically threatened. These situations have been rare and no such events have occurred for the last four years.” He said the company was not connected to government evictions of illegal residents in the national park, which is reserved for wildlife. The report also claims Maasai have been driven off land as a result of government ties with Otterlo Business Corporation, which organises hunting trips for the royal family of the United Arab Emirates and their guests who fly into a custom-built landing strip in Loliondo. Since Otterlo was first granted 400,000 hectares of land for hunting, the government has mounted successive eviction operations. The company has warned the area needs greater ecological protection because herds are increasing while water sources are drying up due to climate change. Despite past government promises that the Maasai would never be evicted from their land, the report notes Serengeti national park rangers burned 114 bomas (traditional homes) in 2015 and another 185 in August of last year. Along with other demolitions, local media report more than 20,000 Maasai were left homeless. Maasai protests, an international outcry and domestic allegations of corruption have forced a reconsideration of this policy. In November 2017, the tourism minister revoked the hunting licence of Otterlo, suspended the state director of wildlife, and ordered investigations into the links between foreign firms and former officials. But the authorities appear divided. Locals told the Guardian this week that Otterlo continues to operate safari tours in Loliondo to the detriment of villagers. Lawyers representing the Maasai communities in a court claim over the land said the policies of the government were tilted towards foreign tour companies. “The evictions are not justified because more and more land is being taken away from the villages without due process or compensation even though they have legal titles,” said lawyer Rashid S Rashid. “The policies of the government are based mainly on the arguments advanced by Thomson and Otterlo because they have more political influence than the villagers.” The report’s authors say the problem dates back to the era of British rule. From then onwards, Maasai have been steadily dispossessed of land on the Serengeti. They urge the government to take urgent action to alleviate the risk of famine, establish a new model of land titling and an independent inquiry into disputes over ownership. “Without access to grazing lands and watering holes, and without the ability to grow food for their communities, the Maasai are at risk of a new 21st-century period of emutai (eradication),” said Anuradha Mittal, the director of the Oakland Institute. “But it does not have to be this way. Unlike the emutai of the 19th century, the hardships and abuses currently faced by the Maasai can be halted.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/may/09/cabinet-divided-over-plans-to-investigate-unsolved-ni-killings","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-09T15:15:29Z","webTitle":"Troubles investigations are skewed against veterans, May says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/09/cabinet-divided-over-plans-to-investigate-unsolved-ni-killings","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/may/09/cabinet-divided-over-plans-to-investigate-unsolved-ni-killings","fields":{"headline":"Troubles investigations are skewed against veterans, May says","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Theresa May has given her tacit backing to cabinet ministers concerned that veterans may be unfairly pursued under plans for a new unit to investigate killings in Northern Ireland during the Troubles, calling the current system “patently unfair”. Cabinet ministers are divided over plans for the creation of a historical investigations unit, which the government agreed to establish in 2014 as part of the Stormont House agreement, to investigate the unsolved murders. At Tuesday’s cabinet meeting, the defence secretary, Gavin Williamson, and the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, are understood to have raised concerns with the Northern Ireland secretary, Karen Bradley, that ageing ex-soldiers, who had already been investigated, would not be sufficiently protected from new inquiries. Northern Irish parties including the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) and Sinn Féin had raised objections to a potential statute of limitations for former soldiers who served in Northern Ireland, with unionists concerned it could pave the way for an amnesty for IRA terrorists. A consultation on the unit has stalled in recent months, partly owing to the deadlock in restoring the Northern Irish executive. The Northern Ireland Office circulated a draft document to the main Northern Irish parties, though it is not thought to include any proposal for a statute of limitations. Speaking at prime minister’s questions on Wednesday, the defence select committee chair, Julian Lewis, asked the prime minister to ensure the option for a statute of limitations was “not excluded from that consultation exercise”. May said she wanted a solution that would protect veterans. “We have an unfair situation at the moment,” she added. “The only people being investigated for these issues that happened in the past are those in our armed forces or those who served in law enforcement. “That is patently unfair. Terrorists are not being investigated, they should be investigated and that is what the government wants to see.” A senior Whitehall source said Williamson believed the protections were “plainly not good enough or strong enough”. There are understood to be concerns that a statute of limitation might be subject to legal challenge, but Williamson is said to have argued those concerns could be overcome. “There needs to be more there to protect veterans. People will always claim there are legal reasons why you can’t, but if there is the will to do right by veterans then there can be greater protections.” Williamson is said to have argued that soldiers and police would be soft targets for new investigations because records exist of personnel whereas they do not for IRA members. “The odds are already stacked against veterans,” the source said. “Ministers sat around the cabinet table and sent servicemen to bring peace to Northern Ireland and now could be signing them up to be prosecuted.” The Northern Ireland Office has drafted a document circulated to the main Northern Irish parties, though consultation has stalled, partly owing to the deadlock in restoring the Northern Irish executive. The document is not thought to include any proposal for a statute of limitations. Bradley’s office believes the unit would offer better protections for soldiers and redress an imbalance, since families pursue former soldiers through the inquest system, not available to victims of paramilitary groups. The DUP MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, whose party has a supply and confidence agreement to back the Conservatives in parliament, told the BBC on Wednesday that his party had concerns that such an amnesty could pave the way for an amnesty for the IRA, which he said would be unacceptable. Donaldson said his party would instead push for a statute of limitations to apply to all killings committed by UK armed forces across the world. That should apply whenever there had been an investigation that cleared the soldiers, to prevent cases being reopened when they were in retirement. He said the party would oppose any proposal that “could be used by the IRA and other terrorists to try and push for an amnesty for their crimes, and that would be totally unacceptable”. “Over 90% of deaths in Northern Ireland were caused by the IRA and other terrorist organisations and we need to remember that, and no one at the moment is investigating those murders and that’s wrong – people are entitled to justice.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/may/10/greens-will-push-for-75-newstart-increase-as-howard-weighs-in","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-09T18:00:51Z","webTitle":"Greens will push for $75 Newstart increase as Howard weighs in","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/may/10/greens-will-push-for-75-newstart-increase-as-howard-weighs-in","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/may/10/greens-will-push-for-75-newstart-increase-as-howard-weighs-in","fields":{"headline":"Greens will push for $75 Newstart increase as Howard weighs in","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A bill increasing Newstart by $75 per week will be placed before parliament later this year, as the Greens attempt to wedge Labor and capitalise on a growing push for change. But the Greens were dealt an early blow on Thursday, when a motion calling on the Senate to support the Newstart increase was voted down comprehensively, with the help of Labor, most of the crossbench, and the Coalition. Former prime minister John Howard unexpectedly breathed new life into the campaign to increase the dole on Wednesday. Howard, speaking at a post-budget breakfast in Melbourne, said a 24-year freeze on the Newstart rate had “probably gone on too long”. “Yeah, I think there is an argument about that, yeah I do,” Howard said. “I was in favour of freezing it when it happened, but I think the freeze has probably gone on too long.” Howard’s comments add to a broadening consensus that Newstart is inadequate, and follow a similar assessment by Deloitte Access Economics last month. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The Newstart payment has not increased in real terms since 1994, and sits at $40 a day for single recipients. Welfare advocates say it is at poverty levels, and is not enough to meet even the most basic costs of living. Labor have already signalled they believe the payment is too low, as have key crossbench senators Tim Storer and Derryn Hinch. The Greens have now announced they intend to reintroduce a bill increasing the single rate of Newstart by $75 per week. Greens senator Rachel Siewert said the bill will be reintroduced in the second half of the year. “It is time we stopped leaving struggling Australians behind and for Newstart to be increased to a level where jobseekers can live with some dignity,” Siewert said. “We are a kind and generous nation and to leave Australians trying to find a job languishing well below the poverty is a national shame.” The Australian Council of Social Service (Acoss) led the pre-budget campaign to increase Newstart. Its chief executive, Cassandra Goldie, said a large number of people made it clear, via social media and by contacting her organisation, that they’d rather forgo their $10 per week tax cut to help the most disadvantaged. “The treasurer said ‘people are asking us what’s in it for me?” Goldie told Guardian Australia, referring to Morrison’s budget speech. “I think he’s got us wrong. I think what people ask is what’s in it for us as a community.” On Wednesday, treasurer Scott Morrison defended the decision to leave Newstart untouched, saying 95% of recipients also received other forms of assistance or payments. “Newstart is not intended to be a payment you live on, it supports you while you get yourself back into work,” he said. “Our priority is to provide tax relief for working Australians and ensure we create a stronger economy so we can provide those people not in work with the best from welfare which can be provided, which is a job.” Labor wants a comprehensive review of welfare payments before deciding on an increase to Newstart. Senator Doug Cameron conceded the rate was currently too low to live on. “You can’t live on $40 a day, Labor recognises that, Labor concedes that,” Cameron told the ABC. “We just want to make sure that we do the right thing across the whole system.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/may/09/chelsea-huddersfield-premier-league-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-10T06:11:16Z","webTitle":"Huddersfield seal Premier League survival and dent Chelsea's ambitions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/09/chelsea-huddersfield-premier-league-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/09/chelsea-huddersfield-premier-league-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Huddersfield seal Premier League survival and dent Chelsea's ambitions","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Huddersfield Town’s sojourn back in the top flight was supposed to be fleeting, a one-season dalliance with the elite, but David Wagner and his side are not done with life at this level just yet. A point squeezed despite incessant Chelsea pressure will prolong their stay into a second year, effectively at Swansea’s expense. The joyous visiting players swiftly persuaded the management to cancel the team’s flight home in favour of a coach journey back to west Yorkshire. Beery celebrations were no doubt maintained up the M1 through the small hours. Theirs has been a staggering achievement, one perhaps lost amid the plaudits strewn over sides overseen by Pep Guardiola and Sean Dyche, or others steered to safety by Roy Hodgson, Chris Hughton or Rafael Benítez. Wagner deserves similar accolades. “People said we had no chance and they were right,” he offered, his trousers hoisted back to his waist after an unfortunate and inadvertent flash as he was subjected to the bumps in front of the away support. “We were anything but a Premier League club last summer, but we have given it a go. If you have the passion, desire and spirit you can compete with top, top quality.” They have done just that, at Manchester City and Chelsea in successive games, to claim the unlikely draws to edge them to safety and effectively condemn Swansea – three points adrift of Southampton and 10 goals worse off – in the process. It was fitting Town should achieve a campaign’s objective with such a scrap of a performance, a frenzy of blocks and challenges to blunt Chelsea’s Champions League aspirations, with their resolve utterly unbreakable as the home side poured at them through the chaotic latter stages. One madcap pinball in the visitors’ penalty area seven minutes from time summed up their refusal to wilt, players flinging themselves into a succession of blocks as the ball ricocheted off the mass of bodies. When it eventually broke free to loop up invitingly to Andreas Christensen, the Dane’s header back towards the far corner was tipped thrillingly on to a post and behind for a corner by the diving Jonas Lössl. They simply would not allow Chelsea in for the victory that would have thrust them level with Liverpool. Huddersfield were not to be denied. They had briefly even enjoyed a lead here, plucked from one of their three shots. Willian lost out to Chris Lowe and with home players committed upfield, Aaron Mooy, a midfielder whose industry sets the tone, lofted a simple pass down the middle into space beyond Christensen. On to the loose ball lumbered Laurent Depoitre, a striker previously without a goal this year and noted more for his brawn than any searing pace, to attempt to lift a shot over the onrushing Willy Caballero as the pair collided on the edge of the penalty area. As the Argentinian goalkeeper lay supine on the turf Depoitre retained his composure to lift a follow-up beyond a stumbling Antonio Rüdiger and into the gaping net. The majority inside this arena blanched at the concession. Antonio Conte had rested six players here with one eye on the FA Cup final and while his team’s endeavour could not be doubted, it took the introduction of the cavalry – Olivier Giroud and Eden Hazard – to force parity. César Azpilicueta’s low centre fizzed across the six-yard box and Mathias Jørgensen, in attempting to hack it clear, succeeded only in belting the ball on to Marcos Alonso’s forehead. In it flew beyond a startled Lössl, the Spaniard just as shocked to have been rewarded in such bizarre fashion. Yet, for all that Rüdiger would miss two appealing opportunities from close range, that was the extent of the damage the home side would inflict. Christopher Schindler was vocal and inspirational organising his back-line, Lössl excellent in goal and the Mooy and Jonathan Hogg combination in midfield snapped into challenges to disrupt the home side’s rhythm. Chelsea could find no way through and, trailing Liverpool by two points on the final afternoon, have surely now given up any lingering hopes of qualifying for the Champions League. The vast majority of the home support had ambled away as the players went through the motions of a post-match lap of appreciation, their body language almost apologetic. This may have been Conte’s last home game in charge. “It is for the club to judge the situation and then to take the best decision,” he offered through numbed disappointment. “We have another game to play, and the FA Cup final, and then the club – for sure – will do the best to improve the situation.” The Italian is unlikely to be in the Premier League next season. Huddersfield most definitely will be. • This article was amended on 10 May 2018.

It entered the two-horse race last August, running against a supremely confident and organised joint campaign from the US, Canada and Mexico. For the first five months it was a virtual information blackout but now that Hicham El Amrani and his team have started talking, murmurs are the contest will be closer than expected. After apparent last-minute goalpost moving by Fifa in an attempt insiders suspect was designed to derail Morocco’s bid, simply making it to the vote in Moscow on 13 June would be an achievement. The Guardian understands Morocco 2026 submitted a complaint to Fifa last month concerning the eligibility of four of the Fifa member federations to vote. As bidding nations, Morocco, the US, Canada and Mexico must abstain from voting but the US territories of Guam, Puerto Rico, American Samoa and the US Virgin Islands have retained votes. The Moroccan bid is based on a concept of Africa meets Europe, with 12 host cities and a stadium construction budget of $3bn. The plan is to build nine stadiums, of which six are modular allowing their capacity to be reduced after the tournament.Extensive renovations will be made to five existing stadiums. El Amrani and his team hope they can persuade the 207 remaining Fifa voting-member federations that Morocco, which has bid for the World Cup four times before, is now capable of hosting the biggest sporting event on the African continent. It is widely understood the Fifa hierarchy – including the president, Gianni Infantino – would prefer the united bid, with its ready-made stadiums, infrastructure and accommodation provisions. That is not to mention a guaranteed $300m bonus payment due the governing body if the tournament is held in the US. It is also understood that three Fifa Council members – Sunil Gulati from the US, the Concacaf vice‑president Victor Montagliani, and Sandra Fruean of American Samoa – have remained in meetings where they should have excused themselves. There was believed to have been disquiet in the Morocco camp, too, about changes to the bid regulations 48 hours before final versions were due to be submitted in March. The revised rules stated host cities must have a population of 250,000 or more – the Moroccan city of Ouarzazate falls short. A change that particularly raised eyebrows was the maximum drive between a host city and the nearest airport being reduced to 90 minutes – the journey between El Jadida on Morocco’s west coast to Casablanca airport had been estimated at 91 minutes. A 0-5 judging scale was introduced and if a bidding nation falls short of two points on a key criteria it will be excluded from the race. Morocco has been visited twice by Fifa’s bid inspection taskforce and will find out at the end of this month whether it has passed that test sufficiently to make it to the vote. “We were a bit surprised of getting the scoring system 48 hours before the deadline, which was not necessarily about methodology but about additional information required,” El Amrani said. It was also surprised to see the US president, Donald Trump, getting involved in the race when Fifa rules outlaw political interference. Trump tweeted: “The US has put together a STRONG bid w/ Canada &amp; Mexico for the 2026 World Cup. It would be a shame if countries that we always support were to lobby against the US bid. Why should we be supporting these countries when they don’t support us (including at the United Nations)?” The South Africa sports minister, Tokozile Xasa, also said this week that her country would not be supporting the Moroccan bid. El Amrani said: “My focus is on defending the values of the Moroccan bid, its values, its concept. But in relation to political interference, I think the rules are pretty clear. Fifa has to implement them. The bidders have to respect them.” Asked if he thought the bid process had been fair, El Amrani said: “I will be able to tell you that at the end of May and then maybe on 13 June. All we wish for is a good game.” Fifa did not respond to an approach for comment. Martha Kelner’s trip to Morocco was paid for by the Morocco 2026 bid team"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/may/09/uk-russian-police-world-cup-mps","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-09T19:10:45Z","webTitle":"UK and Russian police working well on World Cup trouble risks, MPs told","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/09/uk-russian-police-world-cup-mps","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/09/uk-russian-police-world-cup-mps","fields":{"headline":"UK and Russian police working well on World Cup trouble risks, MPs told","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Russian and UK police are cooperating well on plans to protect supporters travelling to the World Cup, the Foreign Office has said, despite the collapse in relations between the two countries following the poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal in Salisbury in March. The minister of state Harriett Baldwin told the foreign affairs select committee’s inquiry into government preparations for the World Cup that police and counter-terrorism are two operational areas in which cooperation with Russia is continuing, at a “strong level”. No individual or group has yet been identified as being responsible for the Salisbury attack. Responding to concerns from MPs about hooliganism in Russia, particularly about potential racism, and prejudice against LGBT supporters, Baldwin acknowledged the risks and said the government is relying on security assurances given by the Russian authorities to Fifa. She said the UK police are applying established legal powers to prevent British troublemakers travelling to the World Cup, and helping to identify people who could pose a risk. “We think Russian police will have taken similar steps with regard to potential troublemakers,” she said. Those who attacked England fans at the Euro 2016 match between the countries’ national teams in Marseille have since been banned from attending football matches in Russia, Baldwin said, and the Russian government has given assurances to Fifa about the safety of fans at the World Cup. However, Baldwin acknowledged strong concerns expressed by the committee’s chairman, the Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, that Russian police have behaved violently towards LGBT groups in Russia, and she accepted that, despite assurances given, the safety of travelling fans cannot be fully guaranteed. Foreign office advice to Britons travelling to Russia warns that although most people do not experience trouble, “racially motivated attacks do occur” and “people of Asian or Afro-Caribbean descent may attract unwanted attention in public places and should take care, particularly when travelling late at night”. Martin Harris, the Foreign Office director for Eastern Europe and Central Asia, told the committee that cooperation between British and Russian police has worked well at five major matches officials have monitored, most recently Arsenal’s Europa League quarter final at CSKA Moscow last month. There were reports that Arsenal’s black players were subjected to monkey chants from some CSKA fans at that match, but Uefa said it did not receive reports and has not charged the club. Fifa fined the Russian Football Union CHF 30,000 (£22,000) this week for racist chanting by fans during the friendly between Russia and France in Saint Petersburg in March. “The way we test the assurances [given to Fifa] ourselves is to see how we have worked or been able to work with the Russian police over successive games,” Harris said. “It’s not for us to police the games, but it’s to see whether the Russian police are willing to work with the UK police in ensuring that the safety and security of all fans is properly assured. And we have seen across those games and the most recent one since Salisbury that the level of cooperation has been good.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/blog/2018/may/09/mark-williams-squeaky-bums-charlie-austin","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-09T17:58:40Z","webTitle":"Trusting himself lets Mark Williams perform at his peak when bums turn squeaky | Paul MacInnes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/may/09/mark-williams-squeaky-bums-charlie-austin","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2018/may/09/mark-williams-squeaky-bums-charlie-austin","fields":{"headline":"Trusting himself lets Mark Williams perform at his peak when bums turn squeaky","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"On Monday evening I stood adjacent to history. Waiting for the delayed evening session, I was pouring myself a Britvic J20 in the Crucible press room when Mark Williams walked in. The 43-year-old was three frames away from winning his first World Snooker Championship in 15 years and prize money of £425,000. It was perhaps the most pressurised moment in his entire life. The Welshman wandered over to where I was standing and spotted a game of micro pool. “I’m good at this,” he said. With a tiny cue he lined up a shot, only for the gobstopper-sized ball to bounce out of a pocket. I didn’t quite know what to say. In the end I gave it some crap banter about the pocket being hexed. Williams switched from top left to top right and soon the balls were flying in from all corners of the 25cm long table. I breathed a sigh of relief. The last thing I wanted was to destroy the guy’s confidence on a table suitable for ages eight and up. As it turned out Williams lost the next five frames on his return to the main arena. He still won the title, however, claiming the break that ultimately got him over the line was “one of the best under pressure I’ve ever had in my life”. It’s a good time of year for observing athletes under the cosh. It’s squeaky bum season. When Sir Alex Ferguson coined the term “squeaky bum time” in March 2003, he did so with the intent of getting inside the head of Arsène Wenger and his players. The Premier League rivalry between Manchester United and Arsenal, brought into poignant focus once again after recent events, was then at its height. A rampant Gunners side were favourites for the title and Fergie was doing everything he could to poke a stick in their spokes. In the end Arsenal blew an eight-point lead as United romped home. The result put the seal on Fergie’s reputation as a master of mind games, just a part of the legend once again in vivid focus after the 76-year-old was taken to Salford Royal Hospital last weekend. Ferguson had not observed anything that people did not already know, but he did crystallise the idea in their minds (probably with unpleasant mental image to boot). The concept of a point in time where sporting pressure comes to a head, an occasion in which specific demands are made of an athlete, became a thing. I was thinking about all this as I watched Williams at the mini-pool and then, later, when he was cavorting around in victory wearing nothing but a towel. The Welshman had been mucking around all weekend, it seemed; tweeting from a kebab shop late at night before the final, eating a spectator’s wine gums during play. “Win or lose, I can honestly say I didn’t really mind,” Williams insisted after the match. Had his insouciance stopped his bum from squeaking? The next night I watched Charlie Austin on the television. Described as a Premier League playoff, it’s fair to say there was a lot riding on Swansea versus Southampton. Austin was playing as Southampton’s sole striker in a team set up to frustrate the home side. Any opportunities he had would be limited and it was crucial he made the most of them. That Austin did, with uncanny consistency. He forced three saves from Lukasz Fabianski from moments that barely constituted half-chances. His fourth opportunity came in a flash, a knockdown from Oriol Romeu after a corner. Austin immediately adjusted his body to take the ball on the volley, driving it into the ground. Fabianski did well to save, but the ball spat out, the Southampton substitute Manolo Gabbiadini poked it into the net and a £100m revenue differential opened between the Swans and the Saints. Such was the intensity and accuracy of his play Austin displayed the epitome of a well-greased bum (I think that’s the opposite of squeaky). It seemed the opposite to Williams’s attitude. I wondered what it meant and which approach worked best. Could Austin summon that intensity consistently over a period of time? What would happen to Williams’s sangfroid if he actually cared about the outcome? Professor Andy Lane of the University of Wolverhampton observes that it is unlikely Williams was as diffident as he made out. “The financial effect of winning the world championship after 15 years would be like winning the lottery,” he says, “so there would definitely be anticipated pressure.” Furthermore, Lane believes that those whose bums stay silent owe less to the ability to ignore pressure than their ability to focus on what they can control. It’s the aspect of performance that, in sport, has become known as “the process”. “Elite performers typically make good decisions,” says Lane. “It’s about making judgments without having to think hard. Having the good decision grooved in. Analysing the processes and learning to stay in them is absolutely vital. You’ve got to be confident of delivering your skills. You have to let the processes come through, and you have to trust yourself to do that.” Their manners may have been contrasting but in the end Williams and Austin shared the key to success under pressure: a belief in their own ability. Less of a belief, in fact, than a trust. They knew that if they did the things they had made second nature during practice they would be giving the best of themselves. Quite whether you can say the same about Williams’s dietary habits is a moot point."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2018/may/10/payments-to-michael-cohen-show-how-shadow-lobbying-eludes-us-law","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-10T05:00:04Z","webTitle":"Payments to Michael Cohen show how 'shadow lobbying' eludes US law","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/may/10/payments-to-michael-cohen-show-how-shadow-lobbying-eludes-us-law","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/may/10/payments-to-michael-cohen-show-how-shadow-lobbying-eludes-us-law","fields":{"headline":"Payments to Michael Cohen show how 'shadow lobbying' eludes US law","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The disclosure that Donald Trump’s legal fixer Michael Cohen was quietly paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to advise corporations highlights the inability of US laws to prevent secretive “shadow lobbying”, analysts said. Companies such as the telecoms giant AT&amp;T and Novartis, a major pharmaceuticals firm, confirmed they paid Cohen, the president’s personal attorney, large sums last year in return for what they describe as guidance on navigating the new administration. As Cohen said he provided consultancy services rather than lobbying, which involves directly advocating for a client to government officials, he was not required under US law to register as a lobbyist and disclose the payments in public filings. Cohen and his attorney, Stephen Ryan, did not respond to requests for comment on the arrangements. Federal authorities in New York have said Cohen, 51, is the subject of a criminal investigation relating to his personal business and financial affairs. No allegation has been made relating to Cohen’s consultancy work. Professor James Thurber of American University, who has researched lobbying for decades, said it was too easy for influential people in Washington to make money around the legislative process without informing the public, in what is loosely termed shadow lobbying. “If someone is trying to influence government policy and is getting paid for it, they should register,” said Thurber, who said that as well as being fundamentally weak, the Lobbying Disclosure Act was also not enforced aggressively enough. The 23-year-old law states that anyone who spends 20% of their time lobbying in a three-month period, and is paid to lobby public officials twice or more, must register as a lobbyist and identify their clients. Ethics experts have consistently said this language makes it too easy to technically avoid that threshold. “You get paid to tell the client how to lobby, or what the important people are thinking, or who to call on what topic,” said Daniel Auble, a senior researcher at the Center for Responsive Politics. “Anything like this is allowed without disclosure.” AT&amp;T employs a small army of registered lobbyists to advocate for it on Capitol Hill, in Trump’s White House and at agencies such as the Federal Communications Commission. The company has spent more than $28m on federal lobbying in 2017 and 2018, according to congressional filings. But the company has confirmed it also paid Cohen’s company Essential Consultants for “insights into understanding the new administration” beginning in early 2017, when Trump was inaugurated. AT&amp;T paid Cohen $200,000 in four installments, according to a document published by an attorney for Stephanie Clifford, the pornographic actor known as Stormy Daniels, who is battling Trump and Cohen in the courts. Trump’s administration was last year considering whether to allow an $85bn merger of AT&amp;T and Time Warner. The justice department announced in November that it would seek to block the merger, a decision that the companies are fighting in court. The administration was also working on reforms to rules on net neutrality that directly affect AT&amp;T. Henry Su, a former attorney for the Federal Trade Commission and now a partner at Constantine Cannon in Washington, said it was unusual for a company to approach someone closely linked to an incoming administration so quickly and directly. “Typically a company will wait for the administration to be in place. There are official channels to do this, usually through the transition team,” he said, adding that the Essential Consultants setup “looks more and more like the swamp Trump said he was going to drain”. While the extent of shadow lobbying is by its nature difficult to quantify, ethics campaigners and others have pointed to a steadily declining number of official lobbyists as proof that influence is increasingly being pushed in secret. Having reached a modern-day peak of 14,824 in 2007, the number of registered lobbyists had by last month fallen to 9,443, according to congressional records, following some tightening of the rules under Barack Obama’s administration. Paul Miller, president of the National Institute For Lobbying &amp; Ethics, a lobbying trade group, said of this decline in numbers last year: “The simple reality is people are reclassifying what they do as not direct lobbying and thus they are no longer covered by the Lobbying Disclosure Act.” Two other companies that paid Cohen have in recent years decided against paying registered lobbyists to advocate for them in Washington. According to public filings, Columbus Nova has not done so since paying McGuireWoods $16,000 in 2010 to lobby on business regulations. Columbus Nova is the US affiliate of a corporate empire belonging to Viktor Vekselberg, a Russian oligarch closely linked to Vladimir Putin. The company confirmed it hired Cohen “as a business consultant regarding potential sources of capital and potential investments in real estate and other ventures” and said Vekselberg was not involved. Avenatti said the company paid Cohen almost half a million dollars. Meanwhile Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI), one of South Korea’s biggest defence companies, confirmed it had paid Cohen for “legal consulting concerning accounting standards”. Avenatti’s document said KAI, which is competing for a Pentagon contract, paid Cohen $150,000 in November last year. KAI has not used a registered lobbyist in Washington since paying American Defense International $20,000 in February 2002, according to congressional filings."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/may/10/john-taylor-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-10T11:51:16Z","webTitle":"John Taylor obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/may/10/john-taylor-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/may/10/john-taylor-obituary","fields":{"headline":"John Taylor obituary","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"My good friend and mentor, John Taylor, who has died aged 88, was a highly talented architect who designed remarkable buildings. In the 1970s he developed a groundbreaking design for low-cost social housing in Sheffield. He arranged smaller flats over larger ones in three-storey terraces, stepping back at each floor, thereby creating generous balconies on the two upper levels. Each flat is approached from those balconies, or from gardens on the ground floor, on the living-room side, as in traditional streets where front parlours face the pavement. This is radically different from other deck-access designs where, to maintain privacy, much of the access is hidden from view. John’s design ensures “eyes on the street”, vital for the safety and self-policing of neighbourhoods. Each flat has a greenhouse porch and the decks have full-length planting boxes, resulting in a colourful display of hanging gardens for much of the year. In all, more than 400 of these dwellings were built in Stannington, Heeley and Gleadless. They nestle into the hillside, easily reached with ramps and bridges from car parking at the end of each terrace. They are all wheelchair accessible, with no need for lifts and stairs. John was born in Cookridge, Leeds, to Russell Taylor, a manufacturer’s manager, and Olive (nee Quilliam). He attended Leeds grammar school and in his teens developed a passion for ornithology. He kept a menagerie of rescued casualties, including a kestrel, which he trained. Love of the natural world never left him. During his architecture degree at Leeds College of Art he did two years’ national service, and after graduation briefly worked for West Riding before moving to the Sheffield city department of planning and design in the mid-50s, where he stayed for his working life. His first project there was the Castle Market, built in 1959. This intricate and popular building was demolished recently after 50 years of useful service. His 1970s social housing flats are still cherished by their occupants, 40 years on. They are a testament to John’s genius for counter-intuitive, modest and humane design, domestic in scale, and adaptable to almost any site. John saw the projects completed shortly before a change of government ended the era of council housebuilding. His design had the potential for further developments, including solar energy for heating; these remained unexplored as he became seriously ill and took early retirement in 1982. In retirement he read the Guardian avidly, as well as works on environmental issues, history and philosophy. He is survived by his wife, Marion Watson, his son, Rowan, daughter, Zoe, stepdaughter, Alison, and younger brother, Guy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/2018/may/09/rory-mcilroy-sawgrass-players-championship-masters","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-09T17:03:46Z","webTitle":"Rory McIlroy fired up by Masters missed chance as he chases first Sawgrass win","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/09/rory-mcilroy-sawgrass-players-championship-masters","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/may/09/rory-mcilroy-sawgrass-players-championship-masters","fields":{"headline":"Rory McIlroy fired up by Masters missed chance as he chases first Sawgrass win","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"It remains unlikely that Rory McIlroy has publicly articulated the exact scale of his disappointment when falling short at the Masters – and why would he? – but the Northern Irishman is well aware of the best way to overcome heartache. McIlroy has three major championships in his sights for the remainder of 2018 but first comes this week’s Players Championship, the biggest tournament on the PGA Tour and one at which victory has eluded him. “It gives you motivation,” McIlroy said of the final round at Augusta National. “All I wanted to do this year was give myself chances. It wasn’t about results, it was about if I can give myself a chance. “I put myself in the final group of the first major of the year and it didn’t quite work out but if I can put myself in the final group of some other events coming up, then I’ll have some recent experience and hopefully I’ll deal with it a bit better. “I’ve got so many opportunities. I’m playing well, my game’s in good shape. We have got this event here, I’ve never won this, I would love to put this on my CV. We have got the other three major championships, everything else to play for, FedExCup, whatever. We’re not even halfway through the season. “It was disappointing that I didn’t get the result I wanted at Augusta but I took a lot of positives from the fact that I probably didn’t have my best stuff and I still was able to play my way into the final group and contend. “This is my ninth time here [at Sawgrass], so I’m not a spring chicken any more. I’ve got a few years under my belt – and it took me a few years to figure it out – but I’ve had a few top‑10s here. I haven’t been quite right in contention but I’ve been close enough. I think it is about time I stepped up and gave myself a chance on Sunday.” McIlroy can also, of course, take solace from the fact he has already won this year, at the Arnold Palmer Invitational. And should the 29-year-old need evidence of how the Players can transform attitudes, he needs only look at a Ryder Cup team-mate. Ian Poulter’s share of second place here 12 months ago revived a career that had looked in danger of flatlining. The competitive fires fuelled by the Englishman’s Sawgrass performance led to his victory at the Houston Open last month. “He went through a tough time with injury and then he had a couple other things happen in his life that I think were quite trying for him,” McIlroy said. “So to see him come through the other side of it and win in Houston was really cool. I was really happy for him. “He’s played really well this year, and he seems like he’s came out with a lot of motivation and determination. I don’t think it’s a coincidence it’s a Ryder Cup year, but I’m so happy for him. Poults is one of the best guys out here. He’s great company.” A reinvigorated Poulter has been afforded opportunity to reset his career targets at the age of 42. “I feel I’ve got a lot more in me to give,” he said. “With that in mind, I think I can still win big tournaments. I still think I can win a major. Other guys have done that over the age of 42 and I would like to think I still can. “To play free, to have goals fresh in your mind, long-term goals, is a good position rather than week-to-week goals. It takes a lot of pressure off you.” Another player who will not lack motivation this week is Justin Rose. The Englishman could leap to No 1 in the world rankings – a position he has never held before – with victory here. Rose’s compatriot, Paul Casey, withdrew on Wednesday because of a back injury."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/may/13/bridge-tabula-rasa-homeland-genderquake-who-wants-millionaire-tv-review","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-13T06:00:52Z","webTitle":"The week in TV: The Bridge; Tabula Rasa; Homeland; Genderquake; Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/may/13/bridge-tabula-rasa-homeland-genderquake-who-wants-millionaire-tv-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/may/13/bridge-tabula-rasa-homeland-genderquake-who-wants-millionaire-tv-review","fields":{"headline":"The week in TV: The Bridge; Tabula Rasa; Homeland; Genderquake; Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"The Bridge (BBC Two) | iPlayer Tabula Rasa (C4) | All 4 Homeland (C4) | All 4 Genderquake (C4) | All 4 Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?

Somebody else decides everything.” For someone so used to control, this is indeed an appalling wrench; but, worse, she’s no longer in the police, a status of sorts on which she had built her entire identity. And for someone who has lived her life by unceasing truth-telling, to the extent that she dobbed in lovely partner Martin, there’s a savage irony in her being wrongly imprisoned.

Actor Sofia Helin, on the news that her conviction has been quashed, gives a quiet masterclass in repressed relief: a shuddered sigh in silhouette, tight eyes, trembling mouth. Less is more speaks volumes. But it’s not all about Saga, though she will go through many emotional catharses this series, tragically the last ever: Henrik, teamed with a regressively non-PC cop Jonas – we’ve learned throughout the whole series that Danes generally regard Swedes as hideously PC; as we’ve learned that they pronounce “Saga” differently – is off investigating the first, particularly horrid, example of what’s bound to become a grim little series of murders. One of the supreme strengths of The Bridge is the quality of acting throughout. There are many little diversions – a journalist with a dodgy identical twin; a couple of teen pickpockets; an abusive father; Henrik’s support group; a deported immigrant – but no scene or character ever feels jerry-built with gaffer tape, even (perhaps especially) the most cochineal of red herrings. Yet our eyes constantly, when they’re not drawn to that astonishing bridge, are drawn to policewoman Saga (or, as Jeremy Clarkson wittily called one Millionaire contestant last week, “a policeman woman”; the wit dwindled a little with constant repetition). How we’ll bloody miss her and her olive Porsche 911S and her sad eyes. To Belgium, then, for our next helping of Walter Presents. Tabula Rasa, hot off of Netflix, is a disarmingly good psychological chiller about an amnesiac witness, which has echoes of those fine 50s films about a blind/damaged/amnesiac women disbelieved by all around her. It’s proper spooky, too, not (thankfully) Woman in White bad-spooky but modernly unsettling: I physically jumped a couple of times. And, yes, there is a stock haunted house straight out of Scooby-Doo, but you also get to see a lot of Belgium that you never normally see, and Belgians that you never see, and never know when anyone’s lying to you. Homeland ended its best series yet, and there was another shocker, also happening to a sort-of-cop, also female. I am conscious that some have simply stopped watching this, but I’d humbly suggest for quite misguided reasons: the plots might be borderline ludicrous, the spy shenanigans still laughably unlikely, but, post-Trump, who can be at all sure? Cast and production still take it seriously, believe in it, and this comes across with every minute’s viewing. If you only watch one series watch this one just finished, not least for credible explorations of a White House mired in paranoia and Russian post-truth meddling. And to watch Carrie stumbling out after months of being denied her meds in a Russian jail, and Saul’s eyes widening in the dark on a chill Estonian border at the extent of her descent from sanity, is to experience a frisson of horror like few others. Channel 4 deserves credit for wading into the piranha-infested waters of the gender/trans debate with two successive nights of Genderquake, even if the station hardly covered itself with glory in the subsequent debate. There was much good in Genderquake, a kind of Big Brother gone right (relatively few screaming drama divas) for a nice enough selection of bi, trans, cis and non-binary youngsters in a big house together for a week. Not least the fact that this outsider realised they, the insiders, were at least as confused when it comes to gender fluidity as me. What muddy waters, what early days… despite a couple of fierce disagreements, this was a surprisingly uplifting experiment, and they all seemed to enjoy themselves, even fall a little bit in love. As brave, smiley Brooke put it, late on: “I love being ‘normal’. It just feels great being part of a group.” A group together, if momentarily, against the catcalls of the outside world, and I learned much, though surely not nearly enough, about the travails – the traumas of dysmorphia, the pain of surgery, the years of ostracism – that most in the house had suffered. The catcalls of the outside world were permitted mob-like free rein on the subsequent live Channel 4 debate, which was all but closed down thanks to shouted insults from a couple of chortling radical feminists. Caitlyn Jenner spoke well, if too often, in a why-can’t-we-all-just-love-each-other? way, and Sarah Ditum made one of the most interesting points of the interrupty night: that between 50% and 80% of youngsters who present as trans don’t go on to transition, ie change their minds later, when they know them. But Cathy Newman, rather than getting all do-you-apologise, do-you-regret? with poor old Germaine Greer (and I notice Newman didn’t at all latch on to Munroe Bergdorf for her “all white people are racist” rant), should have surely saved her tongue-lashing for the audience. I couldn’t help wondering whether the shouty rad-feminist wandered off afterwards to the pub arm in arm with the bloke proudly wearing an “I AM A MAN” T-shirt. After all, doesn’t it just feel great being part of a group? Even a group fuelled by spittle-flecked hatred! Despite what I said about Clarkson earlier, he was a surprisingly good host of the week’s 20th-anniversary tributes to Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? Warm, human, drily funny, kind to contestants… we’ll make a grown man out of you yet, Jeremy. The main surprise was the contestants and the answers.

Press regulation campaigners felt otherwise. “This is not necessarily the end,” said one Labour adviser immediately afterwards, explaining that peers had already discussed whether to send the relevant legislation back to the House of Commons in the event of a tight vote. On Wednesday night campaigners were understood to be meeting with peers to discuss whether to implement such a plan. This would involve rejecting the decision when the House of Lords considers the data protection legislation next week, sending the proposed law back to parliament’s lower chamber with the amendment reinstated and forcing MPs to once again vote on whether to hold a new public inquiry. Given just five MPs need to switch sides for the motion to fail, campaigners are hopeful that the small margin of victory could convince wavering politicians to jump ship and force an inquiry. The relatively unusual decision to keep pushing for another vote belies the fact that press regulation campaigners are starting to run out of legislative options and the defeat could force them to divert their attention to forthcoming court cases involving newspapers. Even the format of Wednesday’s vote hints at the battle underway: the two separate amendments at the heart of this week’s debate were tabled in relation to data protection legislation which had not been intended as a vehicle for press regulation and were both strongly opposed by the government. One of the amendments, tabled by Labour deputy leader Tom Watson, appears doomed. It would have imposed punitive legal costs on any publisher which refused to signup to an officially recognised press regulator such as Impress. But the Watson did not even put his proposal to a vote when it became apparent the Scottish National party would abstain, leaving him heading for a heavy defeat. The other amendment, tabled by the former Labour leader Ed Miliband, was billed as promising an inquiry often described as Leveson part two, in reference to the second half of the press ethics inquiry which the Conservative government had previously announced would not go ahead. In reality the proposed legislation set out an entirely new inquiry with a much broader remit which would have taken in the use of personal data by media outlets, fake news, and the regulation of companies such as Facebook and Twitter. Ultimately it was the votes of the Democratic Unionist party which pushed the government over the line and saved the media industry from potentially years of scrutiny. Seemingly, this was the result of a deal struck by the culture secretary Matt Hancock in which he promised the DUP an inquiry in Northern Ireland alone, which was excluded from the original inquiry. A delighted Ian Paisley Jr described the offer as “Leveson for Northern Ireland”, to the fury of opposition MPs and campaigners who griped that it was another sweetheart deal for the Conservatives’ partners in the confidence-and-supply agreement which props up Theresa May’s government. The News Media Association, which represents major publishers, celebrated the vote as evidence MPs had chosen to “uphold the freedom of the press as a cornerstone of our democracy”, having argued that the proposals taken together would have caused “irreparable damage to the sector”. But for the campaign group Hacked Off the battle continues. “This is not the end,” it said. “The fight goes on in parliament and the courts.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/may/09/tottenham-hotspur-newcastle-united-premier-league-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-09T20:59:33Z","webTitle":"Harry Kane purges Spurs of Champions League nerves with win over Newcastle","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/09/tottenham-hotspur-newcastle-united-premier-league-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/09/tottenham-hotspur-newcastle-united-premier-league-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Harry Kane purges Spurs of Champions League nerves with win over Newcastle","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"It was a long way from being the most fluent performance of the Mauricio Pochettino era and there were times, particularly during a fraught first half, when the Tottenham support could imagine the worst-case scenario that their team would contrive to lose their grip on Champions League qualification. But the mood and the match turned on one swish of Harry Kane’s boot early in the second half and with Chelsea failing to beat Huddersfield Town at Stamford Bridge, it turned into a night of celebration. For the third season in succession Pochettino has led Spurs into Europe’s elite competition and, given the budgets he has had to work with, nobody can say it is not an outstanding achievement. Happily for all concerned, the club’s new stadium, into which they will move next season, will begin life as a Champions League venue. Spurs will finish as the top team in London for the first time since 1994-95 and they will wrap up third place if they beat Leicester City at Wembley on Sunday. Pochettino had declared this match to be about the mentality of his players and they found a way to chisel out the result. Newcastle were proactive and they created plenty of opportunities and Rafael Benítez complained about the non-award of two penalties for his team – the biggest shout coming when Hugo Lloris caught Matt Ritchie in the 58th minute. The Newcastle manager was entitled to say that “100% we deserved something” but, in the end, it was another occasion to illustrate why he wants his board to break the bank for a dead-eyed striker. The chances came and the chances went, with the substitute Jacob Murphy blowing a gilt-edged opportunity on 72 minutes. Kane has still to rediscover the red-hot form he showed before his ankle injury in March and his air-kick for an attempted volley when gloriously placed in the 40th minute summed up both his and the team’s travails before the interval. But he dug deep and found a way to make the difference. It was an excellent finish, swept high inside Martin Dubravka’s near post after Son Heung-min had drawn three Newcastle defenders to him and popped the ball back to Kane. The England striker now has 28 Premier League goals – three short of Liverpool’s Mohamed Salah. The Golden Boot race could yet go to the wire. Pochettino was elated and he made the point of thanking his backroom staff for their work. But he also highlighted how Tottenham had made light of their temporary move to Wembley. “People did not realise how tough it was for the players and for the fans too,” he said. “To achieve the top four under this condition – it is a massive achievement.” Spurs were loose, anxious and too lateral in the first half and there were groans of frustration from the home crowd at the end of it, which sounded a lot like boos. With so much at stake, it was also surprising to see so many empty seats. The attendance of 54,923 was the club’s third lowest of the league season.Newcastle called the tune before the interval and they ought to have led. Jonjo Shelvey banged a free-kick from the edge of the area against the outside of a post while Lloris sprang to his right to keep out Jamaal Lascelles’s header. It was a wonderful save. Dwight Gayle headed too high from close-range and the visitors had further flickers. Pochettino’s team and the home fans refocused during the interval. There was bellowed encouragement upon the restart and, shortly afterwards, Kane fashioned the breakthrough. Spurs had other moments in front of goal through Jan Vertonghen, Dele Alli and Danny Rose but they could not relax. Ayoze Pérez miskicked after a Newcastle counter and when Lloris left his line to deal with the follow-up, there was contact with Ritchie. The referee, Neil Swarbrick, was unmoved. Benítez also felt Pérez ought to have had a penalty for a pull, although that was harder to see. Murphy’s chance came after he outstripped the unconvincing Davinson Sánchez only to blaze high and it seemed it would not be Newcastle’s night. The blot for Tottenham – and England – was the kick from Mohamed Diamé that forced Kieran Trippier off, although the home fans gave his replacement, Toby Alderweireld, a hero’s welcome. Trippier twisted awkwardly and Pochettino declared himself “a little bit concerned”. Otherwise he radiated satisfaction."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/may/09/malaysia-former-leader-mahathir-mohamad-set-to-become-worlds-oldest-pm-at-92","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-10T06:08:30Z","webTitle":"Malaysia's former leader set to become world's oldest PM at 92","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/09/malaysia-former-leader-mahathir-mohamad-set-to-become-worlds-oldest-pm-at-92","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/09/malaysia-former-leader-mahathir-mohamad-set-to-become-worlds-oldest-pm-at-92","fields":{"headline":"Malaysia's former leader set to become world's oldest prime minister at 92","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Former Malaysian leader Dr Mahathir Mohamad is poised to become the world’s oldest prime minister after defeating Najib Razak in a fiercely contested election that put an end to the ruling coalition’s six-decade hold on power.Mahathir, 92, who was prime minister between 1981 and 2003, led the opposition coalition, Pakatan Harapan, to its first election victory since Malaysian independence in 1957, winning an outright parliamentary majority. He will be sworn in by the king on Thursday. A euphoric mood gripped Malaysia at the announcement, which many had believed impossible. “We are so happy, such a proud day for Malaysia,” said David Thaiga, 57, who joined others in the street to celebrate. “We have been waiting for this for the past 60 years. This is a miracle for us. And even though I was not a fan of Mahathir, I think he was the only one who could have brought this victory.” Sukumira Sekhar, 84, witnessed the beginning of Malaysian independence and lived through 60 years of rule by the Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition, said: “I’m so happy I survived to see this. I wish I could jump up and down for joy, but be sure my heart is jumping up and down. I’m so proud of the people of Malaysia, especially the young people and the Malays who swung it.” Mahathir’s win marks the end of the nine-year tenure of Najib, who came to power in 2009 and whose reputation was tarnished by the 1MDB corruption scandal in which $2.6bn was embezzled from a government fund he was overseeing – including $681m that was alleged to have ended up in his personal bank account. Mahathir’s victory marks the first time that a Malaysian prime minister will not be from the UMNO party and not be part of the BN coalition, of which UMNO is the main constituent. The win indicates that a mood for change has gripped the country, following the “Malay tsunami” in which many ethnic Malay voted for the opposition for the first time. Voter turnout was 76% – lower than in the 2013 election – but the opposition took many states that were considered BN strongholds such as Johor, Malacca and Negeri Sembilan. The campaign also galvanised the youth vote for the first time, with young people taking to social media to add their support to the opposition. “This is a pure adrenaline rush. We have been waiting for this change for the longest time,” said Naveen Kumar, 31. “We have been infected with a BN government for so long and now it’s a total relief.” Shaliz Kumar, 28, said: “The young people had a big part to play in this. I called all my friends to make sure they had voted.” The official results, usually announced by 11pm, were not released until around 3am, and some alleged that Najib was trying to stall the announcement. Constituencies that were swinging towards the opposition also reported electricity blackouts, hindering the final count. In the end, however, Najib made no public statement after Mahathir had claimed victory in the early hours of Thursday morning. Mahathir’s selection as opposition leader had made this an unusual election: he was an UMNO member when he first came to power in 1981, and played a key role selecting his protege Najib as prime minister in 2009. The relationship soured in 2015 after Najib was implicated in the 1MDB scandal, and this year Mahathir announced he was not only forming his own political party, Bersatu, but switching sides and joining the opposition coalition. Najib had initially been expected to win easily, but, as campaigning picked up, the opposition dominated the narrative, raising issues such as corruption and the rising cost of living. After claiming victory on Thursday morning, Mahathir was asked whether he would seek to prosecute Najib for his alleged role in the 1MDB scandal. “We are not seeking revenge, we are seeking to restore the rule of law,” he said. As part of his agreement with Pakatan Harapan, Mahathir will only be prime minister for two years, and then will cede power to Anwar Ibrahim. Anwar, who was also once Mahathir’s protege, is currently in jail serving a second sentence for sodomy. Mahathir and Anwar fell out publicly in 1999 and Mahathir was responsible for jailing Anwar, but the pair put aside their differences in their united desire to take down Najib. The plan now is for Mahathir to have Anwar pardoned so he can take office. “He’ll be released in June,” said Mahathir. “Once he’s pardoned, he’s eligible to be PM again.” Mahathir also announced after his victory that he would appoint Wan Azizah, Anwar’s wife, as his deputy prime minister. The police have warned people against gathering in the streets to celebrate in case of rioting; however, a large group gathered outside the Pakatan Harapan headquarters in Petaling Jaya to cheer and wave flags. For Dr Mohan Mahatheva, who was in the crowd, “tonight this is true freedom for Malaysia. We freed ourselves from colonialism, now we have freed ourselves from kleptocracy,” he said. “At least I know my children will live in a truly independent Malaysia.” • This article was amended on 10 May 2018.

Lawyers for Amanda and Andy McCulloch, whose daughter Colette was hit by a lorry after she walked out of Pathway House, Bedford in the early hours of 28 July 2016, have accused Ian Pears, the acting senior coroner for Bedfordshire and Luton, of unacceptable delays and bias against the family. Merry Varney, a partner in the human rights department at Leigh Day, who is representing the family, said: “Inquests are often the main, if not only, route a bereaved family have to truth and accountability in a public arena and where there is a formal mechanism to prevent future deaths ... the McCullochs are asking the court to ensure Colette, a vulnerable adult who died in care, receives the inquest she deserves.” The McCullochs have been fighting to secure a full inquest for their daughter since December 2016, when they claim Pears said at a pre-inquest review (PIR) that he would look at Colette’s death solely as a road traffic accident, without exploring any failings in her care. At that hearing they said he told them that only one of them could speak for just three minutes. When Colette’s father tried to persuade him there were broader issues to investigate, they said he told him: “We don’t need to investigate how the lorry got there.” After a complaint from the family, Pears refused to recuse himself. He then took seven months to deny an application for the inquest to look more broadly at how Colette’s right to life may have been violated, a decision he later reversed. Months passed as submissions were collected and correspondence received from the coroner that the McCullochs’ lawyers described as “terse and sarcastic”. When Pears listed a fresh PIR date this June that several interested parties, including the McCullochs, were unable to make, he accused the couple of an “outcry of protest”, the family said. A letter sent to the court by Varney claimed Pears had been dismissive of the family’s concerns. “The coroner’s combative and sarcastic tone and approach is causing Colette’s parents serious distress and has undermined their faith in the coroner’s ability to perform his judicial role,” she wrote. “It is impeding their ability to effectively participate in their daughter’s inquest, which is at the heart of their rights protected by Article 2 [the right to life].” The McCullochs have been forced to crowdfund the money for a judicial review, and the coroner – whose costs are met by the government – has refused to rule out passing them on if the action is not successful. “We never wanted to do this,” McCulloch said, adding that he and his wife felt “the only way we can get a fair and fearless inquest – an open inquest – is by going to judicial review”. He added: “This is not just for Colette. Since we’ve been involved in this we’ve come across so many other cases, so many people who’ve lost children, lost relatives – vulnerable people who’ve died while in care – and nothing has been done.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/09/soft-brexit-lords-tory-moderates","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-09T17:43:23Z","webTitle":"Suddenly, soft Brexit can happen.

Thank the Lords","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Next week the EU withdrawal bill finally emerges from the House of Lords. The bill is now a very different piece of legislation to the one launched in the Commons by David Davis last September. It was significantly amended in the Commons just before Christmas. Now the Lords have fundamentally transformed it. MPs must therefore decide what to do with the many changes that the Lords have made. It will be the most important few months of parliamentary activity in a generation, perhaps more. It was not always clear, when the withdrawal bill was launched, that such a great moment of decision would ever be reached. If the government and Labour leadership had had their way, the soft Brexit opportunities that now face MPs this summer would probably not have existed at all, or in very constrained ways. Both parties had their own reasons for wanting the bill to go through. But a combination of doggedness, craftiness and, above all, the size of the opposition in both houses to a hard Brexit has changed the political agenda through a series of hugely important amendments, often opposed by both the government and the Labour leadership. This week there have been some particularly striking government defeats in the Lords. The first, moved by the bishop of Leeds, would keep the UK as a participant in EU agencies such as Europol. The second, moved by the Duke of Wellington no less, removes the government’s preferred Brexit date – 29 March 2019 – from the bill, giving elbow room for a possible agreement to pause or extend the article 50 withdrawal process. The most wide-ranging, however, was the amendment tabled by Labour’s Lord Alli to keep the UK in the European Economic Area, which was passed on Tuesday by a majority of 29, against the advice of both major parties. This would put Britain in a relationship with the EU that is comparable to that of Norway. Norway has twice voted not to join the EU, but it remains in the European single market through the EEA. Now Britain’s MPs will have to vote again, not just on the EEA, but on almost all the pivotal issues that would make the difference between a hard Brexit and a soft one. When the bill went through the Commons last autumn, relatively few of these issues raised large tussles. The one big defeat for Theresa May in the Commons was Dominic Grieve’s amendment that, in effect, requires parliament to vote to approve the final withdrawal agreement with the EU, on which work still continues. This remains a crunch issue, but it is now joined by the 13 or so Lords amendments on a wide range of other issues. These include continued membership of the customs union in some form, the adoption of the EU charter of fundamental rights into domestic UK law, and Chris Patten’s amendment ensuring that the UK and Ireland must agree any new Irish border rules before they come into force. For parliament these are all very big questions, on which there could be Commons majorities if MPs were not forced to follow party lines. Coalitions similar to the one that passed the Grieve amendment could be assembled again. Don’t forget, also, that the withdrawal bill is not the only Brexit-related legislation currently under consideration in parliament (the trade bill is particularly significant). And there is the hugely significant possibility that any new bill on the withdrawal terms could be defeated or amended (including by a demand for a fresh referendum). May’s Brexit strategy is to hold the Tory party together by withdrawing entirely from the EU, while making serious practical compromises to maintain as “frictionless” a relationship as possible with the EU, its institutions, agencies and member states – Ireland above all. Government defeats on crucial questions such as the single market, the customs union or the Irish border would overturn the entire strategy. Yet this is becoming more likely now. May’s strategy worked for her first months as prime minister. But the “lost election” of 2017 and the fundamental differences among Conservative MPs and ministers over Brexit issues that cannot be permanently postponed mean its lifetime is now almost spent. Labour’s caution on Brexit shows little sign of changing, but there are enormous temptations for Jeremy Corbyn to overcome his anti-EU instincts in order to humiliate the government on at least some of the Lords amendments. This explains why, even as she runs out of road on Brexit, May still acts as if she is hoping that something unexpected will turn up. There is now talk at Westminster of the Brexit bill votes being delayed to the autumn, partly to avoid embarrassing Commons defeats affecting the June EU summit at which the future relationship will be discussed – and partly because Conservative rebels on both sides of the argument might be more disciplined if the talks appear to be nearing a successful conclusion. It is hard to imagine that the Tory party’s Commons discipline is about to collapse on every single issue that the Lords have put on the table. Nevertheless, the Tory soft Brexiters seem a bit bolder now. That is partly because their numbers are gently creeping up – and also because, in the end, these moderate Tories feel they have to fight harder now if they are to prevent their party collapsing even further to the Ukip right. That is why every disloyal provocation by Boris Johnson or other ministers – such as the foreign secretary’s “crazy” jibe this week – acts as a recruiting sergeant for the soft Brexiters. The coming weeks and months may be their moment. A hung parliament gives them the means. The slide to the right gives them the motive. And now the Lords have given them their opportunity. It will be a hot political summer. • Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"books/2018/may/13/neighborhood-mario-vargas-llosa-digested-read","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-13T14:00:01Z","webTitle":"The Neighborhood by Mario Vargas Llosa – digested read","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/13/neighborhood-mario-vargas-llosa-digested-read","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/may/13/neighborhood-mario-vargas-llosa-digested-read","fields":{"headline":"The Neighborhood by Mario Vargas Llosa – digested read","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"“Please indulge an elderly Nobel laureate,” begged Mario. “Let me start this novel with a cliched lesbian sex scene.” “Oh look,” cried Marisa. “Both our husbands are away and you’ve just missed the curfew. You’d better stay the night in my bed, Chabela.” “Gosh,” replied Chabela. “How time flies! You’re right. I will phone Luciano to let him know I’m staying. Are you sure Quique won’t mind?” Marisa woke up during the night. But was she actually awake – or just dreaming? Her best friend’s hand was pressing against her wetness. It felt so wrong, yet it felt so right. Within seconds they were entwined, their tongues probing one another hungrily. Standing in his office, Enrique knew that Rolando Garro, the tabloid journalist from Exposed!, was trouble the moment he saw this pallid man with rat-like features. “I’ll get straight to the point,” said Garro. “I’ve got some photos of you participating in an orgy with some whores. Either you give me $100K to bankroll Exposed! or I publish the pictures.” “Get out,” yelled Enrique, known as Quique to his wife and friends. “I could tell immediately by your pallor and rat-like features that you were trouble.” In Miami, Marisa and Chabela were now enjoying a three-day break away from their husbands. It felt so wrong, yet it felt so right. At least it did to Mario, who could barely breathe with excitement as the two women pleasured one another for several pages. Enrique was in tears. The photos had been published and he was now the laughing stock of all Peru. “What shall I do?” he begged. “My business will be ruined and Marisa will never make love to me again.” “Try not to worry,” Luciano said evenly. “We just have to make sure this is an end to the matter. And Marisa will be all over you again within minutes.” “Please forgive me, Marisa,” Quique wept. “I can never forgive you,” she replied, taking his stiff cock in her hands and guiding it into her mouth. Back in the Exposed! offices, senior reporter Shorty – so named because she wasn’t very tall – was in a state of shock. Rolando, her boss, had been found brutally murdered in one of the poorest areas of Lima. She quickly packed up her things and went into hiding. Rolando’s death had all the hallmarks of an assassination by the Doctor, the head of the secret police set up by President Alberto Fujimori. “Everyone’s going to think it was me that killed the pallid reporter with rat-like features,” Quique sobbed, unable to stop himself from using the same descriptions over and over again. “Please try to think and write a little more clearly,” Luciano advised. “I’m doing my best,” Mario insisted huffily. Just as they were speaking, the secret police arrested Enrique and took him to prison where he was forced to masturbate several burly inmates. Enrique couldn’t believe what was happening to him. Nor, quite frankly, could the reader. Or that the book was so badly written. “It’s OK,” said a guard, on the third morning. “You can go. You’re innocent.” Marisa and Chabela were once more to be found in bed together. “I do wish you would stop making love to Quique,” said Chabela, her arm draped across Marisa’s breasts. “Then how would you feel if we invited him to join us in a threesome?” said Marisa. “Couldn’t you ask me?” Mario begged eagerly. “I’d be up for it.” “No,” Marisa and Chabela replied firmly, before pleasuring themselves once more. “This is amazing,” said Quique, as all three of them came simultaneously. “I can’t believe my luck. Should we tell Luciano? “No.” Shorty found herself bundled into the back of a car and taken to the Doctor’s secret location. “We killed Rolando,” said the Doctor, “because he published the photos of Enrique without permission. But it’s all OK because we’ve pinned the blame on an old poet with dementia. Here’s the deal. You’re going to be the new editor and you will only publish the stories I tell you to.” Hot off the presses! Three months later, Exposed! ran a special edition revealing that the Doctor and Fujimori had killed Rolando and that the Peruvian state was corrupt. “Isn’t it great how Fujimori and the Doctor are in prison and that Shining Path has stopped blowing things up?” agreed Marisa, Chabela and Quique as they celebrated their three-year shagfest with yet another juddering orgasm. “Do you think our threesome might be an allegory for something?” “Who cares as long as Luciano doesn’t find out?” said Chabela. “Can I come to Miami with you next time?” asked Luciano. “If you must.” “Oh goody,” cried Mario. “Does this mean I can join in now, too?” Digested read, digested: Don’t Lima this way"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/may/10/morning-mail-tax-cut-wrangles-iran-deal-chronic-hepatitis-b","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-09T21:01:35Z","webTitle":"Morning mail: Morrison's tax plan labelled 'regressive'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/may/10/morning-mail-tax-cut-wrangles-iran-deal-chronic-hepatitis-b","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/may/10/morning-mail-tax-cut-wrangles-iran-deal-chronic-hepatitis-b","fields":{"headline":"Morning mail: Morrison's tax plan labelled 'regressive'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Good morning, this is Eleanor Ainge Roy bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Thursday 10 May. Top stories High earners will benefit much more from the Coalition’s tax changes, according to analysis by a leading thinktank. Someone on $200,000 a year earns five times more than someone on $40,000 but their future tax break will be more than 16 times higher, the Australia Institute claims. As the two major parties lock horns on the tax plans before what promise to be five crucial byelections across four states next month, the research shows that the changes will radically alter Australia’s progressive income tax system. “It is clear that the actual result of this tax cut is to hand billions of dollars to high-income Australians and make Australia’s tax system more regressive,” said an AI economist, Matt Grudnoff.

Storer has also expressed concerns about flattening the income tax scales, saying the proposal is regressive and may be unaffordable. The EU is scrambling to arrange a crisis meeting with Iran after Donald Trump pulled out of the nuclear agreement, as the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, said Europe had a “very limited opportunity” to save the deal. The EU has vowed to take steps to protect firms from any US sanctions after Trump warned that he would seek to hit European businesses that continued to trade with Tehran. Tehran had complained in recent weeks that the EU had gone too far to appease Trump but it appears Europe is uniting to protect the deal, even if it means putting its member states on an economic collision course with the US. The Greens will announce today that they will reintroduce a bill to increase Newstart by $75 a week this year, as the party attempts to wedge Labor and capitalise on a growing push for change. It comes after the former prime minister John Howard made an unexpected intervention on the issue on Wednesday,saying the 24-year freeze had “probably gone on too long”. The Greens senator Rachel Siewert said: “It is time we stopped leaving struggling Australians behind and for Newstart to be increased to a level where jobseekers can live with some dignity … to leave Australians trying to find a job languishing well below the poverty is a national shame.” Researchers hope that chronic hepatitis B could be eradicated from the Northern Territory within five years. They believe that the combination of a phone app that offers key information in local Aboriginal languages and community care has created a “one-stop liver shop” that means the killer virus could be wiped out.

Sometimes it’s difficult, telling them this story, that they’ve got this disease. Sometimes they feel shame.” North Korea has released three US citizens in a move that continues the apparent thawing of its relations with the US before a planned meeting between Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump. The release marks a major diplomatic victory for the Trump administration, and was secured during a visit to North Korea by Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state. Trump announced the releases on Twitter and has promised he will reveal a site for the summit within three days, but confirmed it would not be held at the demilitarised zone along the border between the two Koreas.

Thinking time The latest cuts to the ABC are the government’s attempt to bully the broadcaster and silence criticism, argues Andrew Fowler, a former Four Corners journalist. “These kind of sustained attacks do have an impact. Though the ABC supported its political reporter who described Tony Abbot as “destructive” the buckling by the ABC to criticism of Emma Alberici’s reasoned argument that big business is not paying its fair share of tax, or the handling of the Asio cabinet files saga, where huge number of classified cabinet documents were returned to the government without producing a story, suggests a lack of strong journalistic leadership.” Fowler says the ABC must continue to hold the government to account – a bully can never be appeased. One in three millennials will never own their own home, and renters can be evicted with just two months’ notice, writes Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett. What effect is this instability having on young people’s wellbeing? “I used to find renting really, really stressful – especially after leaving university,” says Brett Chapman, 30. “You never feel comfortable when you move house every one or two years.

Donald Trump has angered Scots after his luxury golf club in Turnberry banned the country’s favourite non-alocholic drink, Irn-Bru, because of its carpet-staining risk.

The latest grisly discovery was made on Gabriola Island in the strait of Georgia on Sunday, said the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. A man was walking along the beach just after noon when he came across what appeared to be a disarticulated foot inside a hiking boot. The boot had become lodged in a logjam, police said in a statement. The find was the latest in a series that has sparked speculation around the world. Since 2007, another 13 feet have washed up in British Columbia, all of them clad in running shoes. Some have linked the grim finds to natural disasters, such as the 2004 tsunami, or plane or boat accidents at sea. Others have theorised that the feet might be the work of a serial killer or organised crime. Pranksters have also attempted to add fuel to the fire at times. “We’ve had people put dog foot skeletons in runners and leave them on the beach,” Barb McLintock of the province’s coroner’s office told the Guardian in 2016. “And somebody even used old chicken bones.” She pointed to the ubiquitous presence of running shoes to perhaps explain some of the mystery. Made with light but durable materials, the shoes both protect the foot from decomposition and act as a flotation device that pulls it to the surface. The last sneaker-clad foot was found in December 2017 by a man walking his dog along the southern coast of Vancouver Island. After an object tangled in sea kelp captured his dog’s attention, he leaned in for a closer look and found a fibula and tibia attached to a left foot, all of it encased in a white sock and black Velcro shoe. The province’s coroner service later said the foot belonged to a 79-year-old Washington state man who had gone missing and was later found dead. The investigation is ongoing. In prior cases, the provincial coroner’s office ruled out foul play, noting that none of the feet showed signs of trauma. Eight of the feet have been identified and they included two pairs. The remaining lone feet all belonged to men. All of the individuals either killed themselves or died accidentally, with their feet naturally coming apart from their bodies during decomposition, said the coroner. In the case of this latest find, police said they are currently working with their forensic identification service and the provincial coroner in an effort to identify the remains."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/may/10/failure-to-seal-eu-free-trade-deal-will-mean-higher-uk-food-prices-say-peers","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-09T23:01:03Z","webTitle":"Failure to seal EU free trade deal will mean higher UK food prices, say peers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/10/failure-to-seal-eu-free-trade-deal-will-mean-higher-uk-food-prices-say-peers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/may/10/failure-to-seal-eu-free-trade-deal-will-mean-higher-uk-food-prices-say-peers","fields":{"headline":"Failure to seal EU free trade deal will mean higher UK food prices, say peers","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Shoppers face a significant rise in food prices if the government fails to secure a free trade deal with the European Union, peers have warned. In a bleak assessment of the impact of Brexit, the Lords EU energy and environment subcommittee suggested grocery costs would rise, businesses could go bust and year-round supplies be put at risk. The price of beef could rise by between 5% and 29%, while cheddar cheese could soar by nearly a third and broccoli by 10%, according to evidence from the British Retail Consortium to the committee’s inquiry. The UK Trade Policy Observatory, meanwhile, predicted price increases of 5.8% for meat, 8.1% for dairy products and 4% for vegetables. Peers concluded that shoppers could be left in a two-tier system that means the better off buy more expensive, British goods while those who are poorer are left with lower-standard cheap imports. The committee chairman, Lord Teverson, said: “Throughout our inquiry there was a striking contrast between government confidence and industry concerns. The government has some important choices to make.” The report suggested UK ports would be choked up with delays if EU food imports are subject to the same border checks as other imported produce. Allowing them through with few checks would raise safety concerns, it added. Peers said it was “inconceivable” that Brexit would have no impact on EU food imports to the UK, whatever the structure of a deal. The report found that if no agreement was negotiated, Brexit was likely to result in an average tariff on food imports of 22%. “While this would not equate to a 22% increase in food prices for consumers, there can be no doubt that prices paid at the checkout would rise. “To counteract this the government could cut tariffs on all food imports, EU and non-EU, but this would pose a serious risk of undermining UK food producers who could not compete on price.” The committee found that it would not be possible to increase food production in time to meet any shortfall caused by Brexit. Half the UK’s food is imported, with 30% from from the EU, 11% from countries with EU trade deals and the rest from other foreign sources."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/may/11/arctic-monkeys-save-the-album","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-11T11:57:38Z","webTitle":"Arctic Monkeys may have ‘saved rock'n'roll’ but can they save the album?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/11/arctic-monkeys-save-the-album","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/may/11/arctic-monkeys-save-the-album","fields":{"headline":"Arctic Monkeys may have ‘saved rock'n'roll’ but can they save the album?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"It might just be the most skin-crawling moment in recent music history. To watch it back now is to have every greasy pub band in Camden inside you at the same time. It is, of course, when Arctic Monkeys’ Alex Turner got up at the 2014 Brits and tried to make a Braveheart speech defending guitar music. “That rock’n’roll, it just won’t go away,” he cooed like he’d just been elected president of white guys. “It might hibernate from time to time, sink back into the swamp … but it’s always waiting there, just around the corner, ready to make its way back through the sludge.” Turner later tried to brush the speech aside as a joke (by that point NME had already put him on the cover mocked up as Uncle Sam with the line “rock’n’roll needs you”). Once the histrionics were over, though, it wasn’t necessarily rock’n’roll that wouldn’t go away, but the success of the Monkeys. That award was four years ago, but their last album AM has sold more than 1m copies in the UK, almost unheard-of in the streaming era, especially for an indie band. HMV says it sold more vinyl copies of AM last year than any year since its release. Perhaps this calm confidence is why Arctic Monkeys are again opting for a more old-school approach. Their new record, Tranquility Base Hotel &amp; Casino, has been released without any lead-up singles. When it arrived, fans hearing it for the first time had to take it as a whole. There was no companion app or branded content tie-up, but those buying it in shops (including their global pop-up stores set up specifically for its release) also got a book of Turner’s lyrics, presumably so fans can rip pages out and affix them to the pinboard in their halls of residence. It is a particularly bold approach when you consider that streaming services, which prioritise individual tracks and playlists, have grown hugely in the past couple of years. Most acts focus more on releasing all their best tracks ahead of an LP, which is often chucked out as an afterthought, if an album ever comes out at all. Even big-budget visual albums released by Beyoncé, Justin Bieber, Frank Ocean and Bon Iver were teased with single releases, giving us a sense of what was to come. The aim seems clear: not content with trying to save rock’n’roll, the Monkeys want to save the album, forcing fans to listen to their record as an entire statement rather than a collection of tracks. HMV’s music manager John Hirst has applauded their attempt to get people to “think about it as an album”, admitting to Music Week he was “delighted to finally have an album that’s likely to really shift some units”. Perhaps at the Brits 2019, Turner can make a new surly speech, to the whoops of the assembled industry dons: “It just won’t go away, that £23.99 limited-edition clear vinyl plus lyrics songbook … ”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"society/2018/may/09/government-to-stop-forcing-nhs-to-share-patients-data-with-home-office","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-09T15:46:19Z","webTitle":"NHS will no longer have to share immigrants' data with Home Office","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/may/09/government-to-stop-forcing-nhs-to-share-patients-data-with-home-office","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/may/09/government-to-stop-forcing-nhs-to-share-patients-data-with-home-office","fields":{"headline":"NHS will no longer have to share immigrants' data with Home Office","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Ministers have suspended controversial arrangements under which the NHS shared patients’ details with the Home Office so it could trace people breaking immigration rules. The government’s U-turn on a key element of its “hostile environment” approach to immigration came after MPs, doctors’ groups and health charities warned that the practice was scaring some patients from seeking NHS care for medical problems. Margot James, a minister in the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, announced the rethink during a parliamentary debate on the data protection bill. She confirmed that the government had decided to suspend “with immediate effect” the memorandum of understanding (MOU) under which NHS Digital, the health service’s statistical arm, shared 3,000 NHS patients’ details with the Home Office last year so they could check those people’s immigration status. Patients had given their details when attending GP and hospital appointments. In future, Home Office immigration staff would only be able to use the data-sharing mechanism to trace people who are being considered for deportation from Britain because they have committed a serious crime, James made clear to MPs. James paved the way for the U-turn by accepting an amendment, tabled by Conservative MP Sarah Wollaston and Labour MP Paul Williams, which called for the MOU to be suspended. Williams, who is also a GP, welcomed “this huge U-turn”, adding: “NHS information should only be shared in the event of a conviction or an investigation for a serious crime, not to create a hostile environment where people are afraid to go to their GPs for fear information might be reported to the Department for Work and Pensions for benefit sanctions.” The government backtracked after MPs on the Commons health and social care select committee twice called in unusually strong terms, in January and April, for data-sharing to stop. During evidence on the MOU’s impact it heard how one pregnant woman did not seek any antenatal care because she was too frightened to attend appointments. NHS staff only found out that she was expecting when she turned up at hospital already in labour. Another woman, a migrant domestic worker, died after not seeking treatment for a persistent cough, the committee heard. Doctors of the World, a London-based charity that provides free healthcare for refugees, asylum-seekers and other undocumented migrants, welcomed the move. “For too long the Home Office has undermined doctor-patient trust and caused unnecessary fear and harm to people most in need of help. Our volunteer doctors saw every day the damage this deal was doing to people in vulnerable situations, including victims of trafficking and pregnant women”, said Lucy Jones, its director of programmes. Deborah Gold, chief executive of the National Aids Trust (NAT), said: “We are delighted that at last this shameful sharing of confidential patient information with the Home Office is to end.” However, the NAT and Liberty, the civil rights group, both voiced concern about the “vague” definition of serious crimes that the Home Office will use when still pursuing personal details. Critics warned that passing patients’ details on to the Home Office risked turning NHS staff into de facto immigration officers, was ruining patients’ relationships with NHS personnel and deterring some people from accessing NHS care. The select committee called for the MOU to be scrapped because it is unethical and damaged patients’ trust in the NHS. Williams, a member of the committee, had previously warned that people left afraid to access care because of data-sharing posed a risk to public health through conditions such as tuberculosis going untreated and children not receiving vital vaccinations. The Home Office said: “After careful consideration of the concerns raised by the health and social care select committee, the circumstances in which the Home Office will request data from the NHS has changed with immediate effect. “The changes mean that data will be requested to locate foreign national offenders we intend to deport who have been given a prison sentence of 12 months or more and others who present a risk to the public. “We remain committed to tackling illegal immigration and will continue to trace immigration offenders using a range of different investigative measures.” The U-turn comes amid growing concern that staff in some public services, including teachers, housing officials and NHS workers, are being turned into border guards because of new duties put on them to check the immigration status of people they encounter. For example, hospital trusts have been obliged since last October to check that patients are eligible to receive many, but not all, types of care for free and demand that those deemed ineligible pay for their treatment in advance. In March, the Guardian revealed that the NHS’s Royal Marsden cancer hospital in London had told a Jamaican-born London man who had lived in the UK for 44 years to pay £54,000 upfront before he could undergo radiotherapy to treat his prostate cancer. Sylvester Marshall, who was previously known as Albert Thompson, is now due to receive his treatment free on the NHS. The British Medical Association, which has also voiced deep unease about sharing of patients’ data, had also called for James to accept the Williams-sponsored clause. The MOU “falls short of the well-established ethical, professional and legal standards for confidentiality”, it said. The Health and Social Care Act 2012 allowed for patients’ details, which they had provided confidentially to the NHS, to be used to help trace immigration offenders. It led to the signing of the MOU between NHS Digital, the Home Office and the Department of Health. Last year it led to more than 3,000 patients having their details passed to the Home Office for its immigration purposes. Of those, 195 requests for data led to the Home Office finding out new information about people. Meanwhile, Jeremy Hunt, the health and social care secretary, has come close to backing calls from leading doctors and Labour for NHS staff to be exempted from the monthly cap on the number of skilled workers from overseas who are allowed to come to the UK. Having a separate system of visas for doctors and nurses, he said, was “a really interesting idea” that he will discuss with Sajid Javid, the home secretary. The cap has led to 400 doctors being denied permission to join the NHS since December, despite having job offers from hospitals, because the cap had been reached. “It’s invidious when the NHS gets traded off against other sectors in the economy,” Hunt told the Health Service Journal."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/shortcuts/2018/may/09/most-excellent-sequels-dude-could-other-80s-classics-get-a-bill-and-ted-reboot","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-09T16:56:40Z","webTitle":"‘Most excellent sequels, dude!’ Could other 80s classics get a Bill & Ted reboot?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/shortcuts/2018/may/09/most-excellent-sequels-dude-could-other-80s-classics-get-a-bill-and-ted-reboot","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/shortcuts/2018/may/09/most-excellent-sequels-dude-could-other-80s-classics-get-a-bill-and-ted-reboot","fields":{"headline":"‘Most excellent sequels, dude!’ Could other 80s classics get a Bill & Ted reboot?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Twenty-seven years.

Fourteen years later, the subject of this month’s How to Eat is no longer a tahini riddle wrapped in a pitta enigma. Falafel is everywhere, from specialist slingers such as London’s Mr Falafel or Manchester’s Go Falafel to the supermarket aisles. These days, falafel is as British as bao, poutine and poké. Yet, frequently, something is lost in the translation of falafel from Arabic or Hebrew. Consequently, How to Eat – the blog series exploring how to best to enjoy Britain’s favourite foods – feels compelled to step in and raise objection to such things as the baked falafel taco. Not in an attempt to assert an indisputably authentic Levantine way to eat falafel (in the region itself the origin, ingredients, method of prep and best way to serve falafel are all keenly disputed), but to pose some basic and urgent questions, such as why would anyone put falafel on a pizza? The ideal falafel meal Be it making “falafel” from sweet potato, pumpkin and beetroot, or serving them on toast with avocado, as a “fawaffle” or in lettuce leaves as a low-carb canape, there is a lot going on in the WTF!?-world of fusion-falafel, which can be dismissed without discussion. To debate it would only legitimise those street food traders and recipe writers who, clearly, in their endless quest for novelty, have forgotten how to step back and ask, seriously, how is this adding to the sum of gastronomic happiness? Other bastardisations, however, namely the falafel burger and the falafel salad, are ingrained in UK culture. However, immovable as they may be, it is always valuable to point out how terrible they are. Steroid-pumping the falafel up to burger proportions, then encasing it in a thick burger bun, is lunacy. The result is a sandwich that, at best, if it has been generously topped with sauces, quickly becomes a sloppy mush and, if it arrives drier, is like chewing your way through a carpet sample. The falafel salad makes more sense, but given the state of 99% of British salads (over-chilled, mealy chopped tomatoes, a few slivers of bell pepper) the falafel salad is frequently dismal. Such salads lack the pickled zing, the creamy inflections, the nutty, savoury depth, the complex interplay of flavours and textures, that make a great falafel meal sing. That is why falafel served as a more traditional plated meal or mezze works. Falafel served with pitta, garlicky hummus, sesame-rich, lemony tahini sauce (or a little loosened labneh), with vivid pink pickled turnips, tomatoes, cucumber and shredded red cabbage, brings together a collection of contrasting and complementary flavours, which collectively form a cohesive meal. That plate has everything: layers of sharpness and savoury depth, a dirty fried edge, carbohydrate heft, freshness. Still, mezze lacks one thing: functionality. That is why the falafel wrap is falafel’s pinnacle. All those mezze items are great, but they are even better when intermingled in a wrap around some lightly squashed falafel (important to ensure even distribution), so that you get, if not a little bit of everything in each bite, then in every other bite. Plus, it is all there in a handily portable format. Note: the tendency in cafes and bars to serve a falafel mezze on – but not in – a wrap is bizarre. It looks pretty on the plate, but if the idea is that the diner should then create their own wrap, that demands an untenable level of DIY. Conversely, if you are meant to enjoy the flatbread with the plates components, it should be served on the side not underneath them. Getting your bread straight Serving falafel in a split pitta is fine but, in the UK, commercial pittas often lack durability, staying power and structural integrity. They begin to fall apart after a few bites. Size is an issue, too. If your pitta is too tightly stuffed, tomato and cucumber invariably spill out at each mouthful. A far better alternative is to use a thicker, chewier Middle Eastern-style flatbread (there are endless variations, but something on the khubz/lafa axes), and wrap your falafel like a burrito, to create a reasonably sturdy baton. Do not attempt to cut corners by using tortilla, roti or other thinner unleavened flatbreads. They really don’t work. The falafel wrap needs a certain density and chew at its edges. Bringing the heat Hot or at least still warm from the fryer, falafel can be sensational: crisp, moist, fluffy and nubbly within, verdant with herbs and heady with spices. As they cool, however, that magic floats away on the vents of hot air. Served deliberately cold, perhaps from a supermarket supermarket chiller cabinet, falafel become gritty truffles of tedium, as tasteless as packing foam. As the food writer Daniel Young once put it: “It must be eaten hot and fresh. You can wait for your falafel, but your falafel shouldn’t wait for you.” Wrap stars: the extra ingredients There is a school of thought that putting hummus on a falafel wrap is akin to putting roast potatoes on a chip butty – it’s too much of the same thing. That is plainly wrong. The closer analogy would be dressing a salad that contains olives with olive oil. Hummus acts as a lubricant in the wrap and it should have a significantly different flavour profile to the falafel. There is, elsewhere, a lot of talk about adding heat – harissa, spicy chipotle mayo, pickled chillies, hot sauce – to the falafel wrap, but those are blunt instruments that could easily upset what is a relatively delicate ecology of flavours. Pickled vegetables are as sharp-elbowed as you want the flavours to get on this sandwich. If you must have some heat, use Yemeni zhoug. Its light, precise, herb-modulated heat will step more lightly in your wrap. Good additions: Hummus; tahini sauce; zhoug; tzatziki or a similar cucumber/yoghurt sauce (use dill not mint); potato tots (used sparingly, they mine your wrap with joy); smoky grilled aubergine or even a little slick of baba ganoush; shredded red cabbage, fresh parsley, chopped little gem for added crunch; diced tomatoes and cucumber; crisp pickled vegetables, usually fermented turnips whose fizzing, vivacious sourness should refresh your palate at regular intervals. Bad additions: halloumi (too dry, too rubbery); avocado (both in its flavour and texture, nonsensical here); dill pickles (dull pickles, whose overt vinegary twang is too bullying in this wrap); chillies, harissa, hot sauce; mayonnaise (a claggy interloper); pickled cauliflower (too tough, everything in there needs to yield easily, even if it has a crisp edge); any sweet honey/pomegranate sauces (this is a savoury dish); chickpea or tabbouleh salads, an OTT addition; raw carrot; spinach leaves, which are commonly used to pad out wraps to no discernible positive effect. Where and when The falafel wrap is fast food – a quick turnaround, on-the-move meal that never tastes quite as good when sitting down, particularly at home. Certainly in the UK, it is a lunch item or an evening meal, one that works best as a ballast before a big night, rather than after a bellyful of beer, when its comparatively subtle flavours cannot always cut through the alcohol fug. You need to eat it quickly while it is still warm, preferably while walking to aid digestion. If your falafel wrap is a good one, you will spend most of the journey dodging the drip-dripping of sauces from its paper/foil-wrapped bottom, so you must maintain a stance (a concave, stooped stance, sandwich held just in front of your face) that How to Eat likes to call “shirt alert”. Grab more napkins than you are offered, you will need them. Drink Not essential while moving and eating. You need both hands to disrobe your wrap and keep it from flip-flopping around. However, this can be quite a greasy meal, so afterwards something fizzy and/or dry, with a nice carbonic acid edge, is welcome: diet cola, pale ale (craft keg not cask), cava etc. So, falafel – how do you eat yours?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/09/the-guardian-view-on-party-members-a-vital-voice-but-not-a-veto","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-09T17:34:21Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on party members: a vital voice, but not a veto | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/09/the-guardian-view-on-party-members-a-vital-voice-but-not-a-veto","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/may/09/the-guardian-view-on-party-members-a-vital-voice-but-not-a-veto","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on party members: a vital voice, but not a veto","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"President Richard Nixon famously invoked the support of “the great silent majority” of his fellow Americans, in defiance of protests against the Vietnam war. He was not the first or last politician to imagine that noisy opposition conceals a friendlier national mood. People prefer praise to criticism, so assume that the latter is exaggerated. But it is often true that the loudest voices are on the fringe and drown out a larger, more nuanced body of opinion. Last week’s local elections are a case in point. The fever of partisan spin has now died down and it seems there was no single message from the electorate. Neither Theresa May nor Jeremy Corbyn can claim to speak for a “silent majority”. Turnout was only 36%, which is normal for council ballots. But there is evidence elsewhere of an uptick in political participation. Data published last week by the House of Commons library show an overall increase in party membership in recent years. Labour’s rise is by far the biggest, with around 552,000 members, up from 388,000 in December 2015. The Liberal Democrats and Scottish Nationalists have grown over the same period. Ukip has shown the steepest decline, with 21,200 members now – around half of its 2015 total. The Conservatives are secretive with their data, but their current membership is estimated at around 124,000. That is a tiny pool that could, in the event of a Tory leadership contest before a general election, end up choosing Britain’s next prime minister. Around 1.6% of the electorate are members of one of the three biggest parties in England, up from a historic low of 0.8% in 2013. Most people tune in to party messages only when big decisions must be made. Those who monitor every twist and turn in Westminster are unusual. Their priorities cannot be presumed to be universal. There is no doubt that the two recent referendums – on Scottish independence and EU membership – brought people out to vote who had previously felt disenfranchised. Mr Corbyn’s bid for the Labour leadership enthused a generation of young people whose voices had been ignored. Those effects are rightly celebrated as signs of renewed democratic engagement. There is also more subtlety and variety of motive behind those votes than is sometimes implied by common stereotypes of “Nats”, “Brexiteers” and “Corbynistas”. Ballots give a snapshot of opinion, which can change. Election results must be honoured, but dissenting voices must also be heard. That ethos is currently endangered in the two biggest parties. On the Labour side, there is a tendency to forget that MPs represent all of their constituents, not just the ones who admire Mr Corbyn. MPs should respect local activists but are not obliged to obey them completely. On the Tory side, there is a habit of believing that MPs’ function is to enact Brexit, defined in the hardest possible terms, and that anything less is defiance of the people. The reality is that majority opinion is fluid, and parties have patchwork coalitions of support. Some people are moved to become members, some routinely switch allegiance. Effective leaders do not seek comfort in the cheers of an ultra-loyal minority, nor do they pretend, like Nixon, that the silence of the majority indicates support. The will of the people is not contained in activist ardour or non-voting apathy, but in the spectrum the runs between them. It is a messy, complex thing, and anyone claiming exclusive, absolute knowledge of it has not understood what is involved in governing a democracy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/10/disabled-people-internment-care","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-10T08:00:07Z","webTitle":"Now disabled people face a kind of internment.

Just ask Edith","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"In 24 hours’ time, Edith will no longer be able to get out of bed. The 30-year-old has multiple sclerosis, and relies on council-funded care assistants to help her live in her two-bed adapted flat in Hitchin, Hertfordshire. For 18 months, she has managed with only a couple of visits a day: one at 7am, to enable her to get up for work as a chartered accountant, and another at 8.30pm to help her get out of her wheelchair and back into bed. After years of saving hard for her first home and moving out of her parents’, it was meant to be the start of Edith’s life. But in February her care agency struck a blow: owing to staff shortages in her area, they would be ceasing their contract, and giving social services 90 days’ notice. Three months later, with barely a day until her carers leave, the council hasn’t found her a replacement. Edith is terrified. “Carers helping me out of bed every morning are the fundamental life support which everything else in my life depends on,” she says. “And now it feels like the rug is being pulled out from beneath me.” Hertfordshire county council (HCC) says the care agency delivering Edith’s support served notice because it doesn’t have anyone else in need of support in the area, but that they’re continuing to look for other care agencies before the notice period ends. HCC adds that some new care slots have already been offered, but ask Edith what the times were and it’s little wonder she turned them down: a 9.30am wake up and 6.45pm night call. That would mean getting up half an hour after she’s meant to start work and being back in bed 15 minutes after she typically gets home. Forget going for a drink with friends: she’d be in bed for 14 hours every day. “My housebound 90-year-old grandpa wouldn’t accept that,” she says. Edith repeatedly tells me her social worker is doing her best, but in a social care climate of underfunding and staff shortages, she may as well be trying to squeeze blood from a stone. As Edith puts it: “There just aren’t enough carers. The system doesn’t work.” As vast budget cuts see people with disabilities and older people lose their support to eat, wash, and leave the house, the care sector is “in crisis” because of severe staff shortages. Low pay, zero-hours contracts and poor conditions means staff are leaving while councils and care homes struggle to hire and retain qualified carers. The drive for outsourcing public services in recent years, championed by Conservative and New Labour governments alike, only exacerbates this. To get a picture of the scale of the staffing shortage, on any one day, there are 90,000 vacancies for social care jobs in England, according to research by Skills for Care in 2017. This will only worsen after Brexit as the care sector faces a future without the contribution of its largely European migrant workforce. With no carers found, Edith’s social worker has come up with increasingly desperate solutions, including asking Edith’s bosses to alter her working day around her care call hours. “This isn’t shift work. I’m an accountant,” she says. Edith tells me she cried as soon as she heard the latest plan: putting her into a care home. If no agency can be found in time, she has been told she’ll have to leave her own flat and move into an unnamed residential institution. “I feel like I’m being threatened into accepting a care package which will strip me of my life and just leave me surviving,” she says. Edith is far from alone in this. I reported in March how disabled people are increasingly being threatened with being “interned” in care homes owing to unprecedented underfunding in the system. I’m increasingly hearing from campaigners and charities that they’re assisting disabled people who are being encouraged by authorities to go into an institution as a “solution” to their poor care packages, despite being in their own homes for years. Suggest that a non-disabled person live like this and there would rightly be outrage. And yet someone like Edith, with her whole life ahead of her, is expected to waste her days in bed or a care home. It’s reminiscent of attitudes to disability that were said to have died out before Edith and I were even born: that people with disabilities are “not normal”, and as such don’t need a career, social life or family. Friday evening is the last time Edith’s carers are scheduled to help her. As time runs out, she has been ringing around care agencies herself, but with no luck. She has even written to her MP for help. The stress would be tough for anyone, but with Edith’s MS, it’s brutal – she’s increasingly fatigued and weak, and pain has developed down her right arm. In her worst moments, she says, she thinks perhaps quitting work, cancelling all plans, and lying in a care home might be preferable to this fight. As we finish talking, I ask her what she’ll do on Saturday morning if her carers don’t come. “My social workers said we’ll have to start looking for care homes.” • Frances Ryan is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/10/celebrate-house-prices-falling-britain-property-values","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-10T05:00:04Z","webTitle":"At last, a reason to celebrate: house prices are falling | Larry Elliott","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/10/celebrate-house-prices-falling-britain-property-values","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/may/10/celebrate-house-prices-falling-britain-property-values","fields":{"headline":"At last, a reason to celebrate: house prices are falling","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The housing market is dead. Britain’s biggest mortgage lender, the Halifax, says that prices fell in April by 3.1%, the biggest monthly drop in almost eight years. Newspapers bury this disastrous news way back in their editions for fear that it will spread gloom and despondency. We need to wean ourselves off this way of thinking. Falling house prices are not disastrous, and only in a country with such a perverted relationship with bricks and mortar could they be seen as such. In Germany, they scratch their heads in bemusement when they hear Britons boast of how the value of their house has soared. The Germans are right. Ever-rising house prices are a curse. They are bad for social mobility. They are bad for young people. And they are bad for the economy. The billions that are spent pushing up property prices could be more productively invested elsewhere. Imagine for a second that the next time you went to the train station the rail operating company had unexpectedly cut fares by 5%. Or that when doing your weekly shop you discovered that the supermarket had slashed your normal bill by £10. Would you think this was an unwelcome development? Daft question. Of course you would be happy, because your money would go further. Conversely, you would be less than chuffed to find more of your pay being spent on getting to work or putting food on the table. That’s why there are no headlines in the papers screaming “Boom-boom Britain: joy for commuters as rail fares rise by 10% for third year in a row”, or “Good news for families as supermarkets add £10 a week to the average shop”. The papers stand up for their readers when they think they are being gouged by train companies and supermarkets. They stick up for buyers rather than sellers. But different rules apply to property. If the average house price had risen rather than fallen by £7,000 in April, that would have been front-page news and hailed as a sign that all was well with the economy. The papers tend to side with owner-occupiers rather than the buyers of property getting the rough end of the deal. This fetishisation of rising house prices is relatively recent. For the first 25 years after the second world war, a combination of mass housebuilding and strict controls on credit meant that the cost of property rose only modestly. But since 1970, financial deregulation, much lower levels of housebuilding and a tax system heavily weighted in favour of owner-occupation have meant demand for housing in parts of the country has tended to outstrip supply. There have been four big house-price booms – the early 1970s, the late 80s, the mid 00s and the mid 10s. None of them have ended well. The biggest and longest bust was in the early 90s, when people who had bought at the peak of the late-80s boom were clobbered by 15% interest rates and rising unemployment. Record levels of home repossession were the result. But since the market collapsed in 1995, housing has become more and more expensive. Owner-occupation rates have fallen from a peak of just under 70% to less than 64% in the past 15 years, as young people have found buying a home of their own unaffordable. Rents have risen, making it harder to save for a deposit. So bad is the intergenerational imbalance between the property haves and have-nots that the Resolution Foundation thinktank wants each person in Britain to be given £10,000 when they turn 25. This would certainly help young people stump up the money for a deposit on a home – especially outside London and the south east, where prices are a lot lower – but in the absence of an increase in housing supply it would be bound to drive up prices. One definition of inflation is that it results from too much money chasing too few goods, and that’s a perfect description of what has happened over the past decade. Thanks to the Bank of England and the Treasury, there has been plenty of cheap money knocking about. The Bank’s quantitative-easing programme is essentially a giant money-creation scheme, and the proceeds have been recycled into mortgage lending. George Osborne did his bit with help to buy, a subsidy for first-time buyers that further inflated prices. Giving every 25-year-old £10,000 would have a similar impact. Weaning Britain off its obsession with rising house prices won’t be easy. The economy now only has two settings: strong growth when the housing market is buzzing and owner-occupiers feel confident enough to borrow against the rising value of their homes; and much weaker growth when the housing market is dormant. There is a strong temptation for policymakers to reignite the housing market when, as now, the economy is spluttering along. A second problem is that for many people their house is easily their most valuable asset, and they are relying on being able to downsize when they retire. That makes a large chunk of the population highly resistant to policies that might drive down prices, such as higher property taxes or changes to planning laws. With unemployment at its lowest level for more than 40 years and interest rates at 0.5%, the chance of a house-price crash is currently remote. More likely, prices will stay where they are while incomes catch up. Property will become cheaper as a result. This breathing space should be exploited to make the tax system less biased in favour of owner-occupation and to start a mass public-sector housebuilding programme. After repeated boom-bust cycles, it should be clear that an economic model that cannot function without repeated injections of property inflation is built on the shakiest of foundations. • Larry Elliott is the Guardian’s economics editor"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/may/09/trump-angers-scots-with-ban-on-irn-bru-at-luxury-golf-resort","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-10T06:07:39Z","webTitle":"Donald Trump angers Scots with ban on Irn-Bru at luxury golf resort","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/09/trump-angers-scots-with-ban-on-irn-bru-at-luxury-golf-resort","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/may/09/trump-angers-scots-with-ban-on-irn-bru-at-luxury-golf-resort","fields":{"headline":"Donald Trump angers Scots with ban on Irn-Bru at luxury golf resort","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"White House diplomacy has dipped to a new low after it emerged that Donald Trump’s luxury golf resort in Turnberry, Scotland, has banned the sale of Irn-Bru on the premises. The ban came to light after guests asked for Scotland’s favourite non-alcoholic beverage to be supplied at an event but were refused because staff were concerned about potential spills. The combination of colourants that give the fizzy drink its distinctive luminous orange hue are believed to be responsible for its notorious indelibility. The five-star resort on the Ayrshire coast has recently benefited from a £200m upgrade, which is believed to have included hundreds of thousands of pounds spent on carpets. Turnberry’s general manager, Ralph Porciani, told the Ayrshire Post: “We can’t have it staining when to replace the ballroom carpet would be £500,000 alone. “We have villas here with Irn-Bru stains in the carpets which I can’t let.” The latest affront comes after a change in recipe cut the sugar content of the drink by almost half following the introduction of the UK government’s sugar tax, prompting fans to stockpile cans of the original version. The piecemeal ban on Scotland’s other national drink, long avowed as the ultimate hangover cure, has caused inevitable outrage on social media, and will likely swell the protests already planned should Trump visit Scotland as part of his trip to the UK in July. The US president, whose mother was born on the island of Lewis, also owns a golf resort in Aberdeenshire, and is expected to meet the Queen at Balmoral during his controversial visit which is planned for 13 July. The Scottish Labour leader, Richard Leonard, has pledged to lead the protests against Trump: “Someone who holds such misogynist, racist and anti-trade union views not to mention his whole approach to foreign policy, someone who rejects the Paris climate change agreement, should simply not be given the red-carpet treatment.” The Scottish Greens leader, Patrick Harvie, vowed that Trump would be “met with a level of protest not seen since the Iraq war”. Scotland’s first minster, Nicola Sturgeon, has previously spoken out against a state visit by Trump. Last November, after the president retweeted an anti-Muslim video, she argued that such a visit would be “inappropriate”, adding: “When President Trump was first elected I said that we could not afford to compromise our own principles in the interests of diplomatic silence and this is one occasion where that is absolutely the case.” Irn-Bru – which is not, despite its famous advertising tagline, actually made from girders, but does contain a total of 32 flavouring agents – consistently outsells all other fizzy drinks in Scotland. First produced in 1901 under the name Iron Brew, the Bru has cultivated a maverick status amid other beverage behemoths such as Coca-Cola, producing near-the-knuckle adverts including a billboard of a cow with the tagline: “When I’m a burger I want to be washed down with Irn-Bru”, which drew 700 complaints."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/may/17/home-office-dehumanises-asylum-seekers-says-report","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-17T05:00:21Z","webTitle":"Windrush cases just 'tip of iceberg' of immigration failings, report warns","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/17/home-office-dehumanises-asylum-seekers-says-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/may/17/home-office-dehumanises-asylum-seekers-says-report","fields":{"headline":"Windrush cases just 'tip of iceberg' of immigration failings, report warns","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Home Office mistreatment of immigrants goes far beyond the Windrush generation and affects thousands of refugees and asylum seekers, according to new research which concludes that the “dehumanising” approach is systemic. The report, published by Refugee Action, highlights the issues that occur at multiple points in the asylum process and alleges that “systemic failures” in the Home Office’s approach to asylum claims “dehumanises, disempowers and damages” those who have come to the UK fleeing persecution or war. Stephen Hale, chief executive of Refugee Action, said the detention, destitution, homelessness, and limbo faced by Windrush children were just the tip of the iceberg, and were widely familiar to asylum seekers. “All of the things those people have been through are also experiences that people are going through as result of asylum system,” he said. The report highlights several “pressure points” in the asylum process that tend to cause problems for asylum seekers or refugees. These include long waiting times that asylum seekers face for their claims to be decided by the Home Office. By the end of 2017, 14,306 people had been waiting for a decision on their asylum claim for more than six months, which is the current “service standard” for asylum claims. This is a 25% increase from 2016, despite the number of applications for asylum falling in 2017. The report also details the number of incorrect decisions on asylum claims made by the Home Office. In 2017, 35% of asylum appeals resulted in Home Office refusals being overturned. For certain nationalities more than half of all appeals were upheld, including cases of people from Yemen (70%), Libya (61%), Somalia (54%) and Afghanistan (52%). Some refugees told the researchers about how the interpreter provided for their Home Office interview – their key opportunity to explain their reasons for seeking refuge in the UK – did not correctly interpret what they said. Some also said they had not been able to access legal advice before the interview and had no clear point of contact to ask about their case. “The human issues here are the length of time to take decisions, and the absolute lack of clarity on how long those decisions might take,” said Hale. “So people who are waiting two, three, four years, but without knowing if indeed it might be 15 years. People have been left in limbo – a time in which they have got incredibly low levels of income, no right to work, no place they can make their own in terms of housing. They really are abandoned.” The report calls for people to be allowed to work and study while they wait for their asylum claim to be decided and describes the allowance given to asylum seekers of £37.75 per week as “problematic”. Hale said the Home Office often dealt with problems in a piecemeal way and called for a “fundamental reset” of the system. “The reality is that in making one issue better they will often make another issue worse and that’s why we think it’s important to take a systemic approach,” he said. “The vast majority of the British people, I’m absolutely certain, would recognise we’ve got to find better ways to do this, that we can be a country that is compassionate, that is supportive of people who have had to flee the conflicts that are reported on our TV screens.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “The UK has a proud history of granting asylum to those who need our protection. In 2017 there were just under 15,000 grants of asylum, alternative protection or resettlement, of whom almost 6,000 were children. “We are committed to transforming the asylum system. We are modernising our processes and have established a new team to focus on more complex cases to make sure that they are decided faster.” Mohmand’s case Mohmand left Afghanistan in April 2013 after more than a decade of threats, abuse, and kidnapping attempts for his work exposing human rights abuses. It took the Home Office three years and 11 months to give him refugee status and his case was marked by a litany of Home Office mistakes, including them losing his documents, repeatedly postponing his interview and wrongly refusing his claim. “I felt it was not handled in care,” he says of his case. Mohmand was able to bring most of his family to the UK last December under family reunion provisions, which allow refugees to reunite with their spouse and dependent children under the age of 18. However, as a result of the Home Office’s delays to his case, Mohmand’s two oldest children, who were 15 and 17 when he left Afghanistan, were 19 and 21 by the time he got refugee status, and had their applications to accompany the rest of their family refused. Mohmand is particularly worried about his daughter Shireen, who lives virtually under house arrest in Kabul, because it is not safe for her to leave the house without the protection of her father or another older male relative. “It is very much like a broken family,” he says. “You cannot concentrate on work, on children’s education, other future, you are always thinking of how you can bring together a broken family.” Leila’s case Leila, 23, arrived in the UK in 2010 when she was 15, fleeing Pakistan with her mother and father after the Taliban made threats against them because one of Leila’s brothers worked for the British army. Their case, subsequent appeals and fresh claims were all refused, even after her other brother and sister back in Pakistan were shot and killed by the Taliban in 2014. A judge finally granted Leila and her parents asylum last year, almost seven years after they arrived in the UK. Leila had been able to attend school, but once she graduated she was not allowed to work or study and spent four years feeling like she was living in “a cage”. “They just kill you by not letting you do anything,” she said. The impact was particularly profound on her father, 61, whom she said was “perfectly fit” when he arrived in the UK, but had had four heart attacks and a minor stroke since being in the country, which she put down to the stress and uncertainty of their situation. These incidents left him partially blind and unable to walk long distances."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/may/12/gerhard-richter-review-john-hansard-gallery-southampton","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-12T17:00:36Z","webTitle":"Gerhard Richter review – an illuminating mini retrospective","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/may/12/gerhard-richter-review-john-hansard-gallery-southampton","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/may/12/gerhard-richter-review-john-hansard-gallery-southampton","fields":{"headline":"Gerhard Richter review – an illuminating mini retrospective","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"A new gallery of contemporary art opens its soaring glass doors this week – or rather, an old one is controversially reborn. The renowned John Hansard Gallery, once out on the verges of Southampton University, to which it belongs, has moved into a specially designed building in the city centre. The exterior and interior are the work of two different architects, the developer went bust and too many cooks were involved in the broth. To describe the project as a long story would be the merest understatement: it has been going on for nearly 20 years. But the good news is that the bad news – the exterior – doesn’t matter. Outside is an undistinguished shop-front of grey bricks speckled with sporadic beige, the default look of so much of today’s high-rise housing (the gallery morphs into flats at the back). Standing opposite is its exact twin, the Nuffield theatre, separated only by a narrow alley of tapas bars. The signage is hideously civic and almost comically inadequate for such important institutions. The name is absurd – why call these two entirely separate venues (three if you count the film charity City Eye) Studio 144? And both the theatre and the main galleries are hoisted up above more cafes and restaurants, as if they could hardly stand on their own two feet. But the interior of the new JHG is as well suited to contemporary art as anything launched in those two decades, from the Turner Contemporary in Margate to the Jerwood in Hastings. Indeed, for art lovers, the south coast is an ever-growing chain of beacons: from Margate, with its exceptional programme, to the Folkestone Triennial and the impressively adventurous De La Warr in Bexhill-on-Sea; from the great Towner Gallery in Eastbourne (its funding recently, disastrously, threatened by its own council) to Pallant House in Chichester, with its museum-class British art shows; and onward now to Southampton. Considering that Southampton already has its venerable City Art Gallery, housed in the neoclassical Civic Centre, with a permanent collection running from Turner and Monet to Chris Ofili and currently showing George Shaw’s terrific My Back to Nature, you might say the city centre is already rich in art. But unlike practically every other gallery in the world, this one doesn’t open on a Sunday. So there is even more scope for the JHG, which is aiming for six times the modest visitor figures of its campus days. There is underfloor heating for cold weather, a vividly appealing children’s suite and panoramic windows in two spaces to lure a curious public in from the main boulevard outside. The decor is standard white cube – polished concrete, glass, steel and selected Scandinavian wood floors – but the configuration of galleries is excellent. Small rooms open into larger galleries and finally into a colossal double-height prism of a space with picture windows the size of a multiplex screen overlooking the wide piazza below. Crowds gather and disperse, children run, skateboarders race across the pale Portland stone to the colonnaded Guildhall opposite. It’s like being in a box at some vast public theatre. For its inaugural show, the curators have chosen the German art star Gerhard Richter (born 1932). With two-dozen works (or 275, if you include all the panels in two major installations) running all the way back to 1977, this is effectively a condensed retrospective. And because Richter is famously questioning of all the usual distinctions in painting – figurative versus abstract, mechanical reproduction versus painterly touch and so on – it’s a particularly judicious selection. His Mirror paintings, in which pigment adheres to glass, are shiningly reflective in outward appearance yet inherently opaque. Look into them, drawn by their greens, greys and blues, and you see yourself doubled, then mistily silhouetted (they are angled in pairs in gallery corners). The colour recedes and so does the clarity of your own visage. Mustang Squadron shows an array of warplanes flying in formation, in silent black and white. Close by it hangs 14 Feb 45, an aerial image of a cityscape that one cannot quite make out. Are we too high up for visibility, is the photographic print blurred, or are we simply blind to what we see – namely Dresden, bombed on that February day. The analogy between the two images is clear. There are all-grey paintings, their surfaces so flawless they look like photographs of paintings; and there are black-and-white photographs of coloured paintings that transform individual brushstrokes into lunar landscapes. 4900 Colours fills the double-height gallery from floor to ceiling with its panels of coloured squares in innumerable permutations. A vision of apparent estrangement – they look, and are, entirely random – the installation nevertheless holds the eye completely with its glowing-all-over scintillation. The lighting is superb, particularly in the room devoted to 48 Portraits, which have never looked so poignant. A gallery of modern heroes – Wilde, Stravinsky, Mann, Planck – these are facsimiles of black-and-white paintings based in turn on formal photographs, so that the sense of remoteness is deep, as if to ask what the painter could ever know of these people. Yet together they are a shrine to the dead, pivoting on the one mask that turns directly to us: the intensely moving face of Franz Kafka. For such a monastically reserved painter, Richter is extraordinarily prolific. Yet even this relatively small survey carries a full sense of his anxious, doubting intellect. It includes a self-portrait in which Richter is both there and not there, three times over, a photographic ghost haunting his own studio. Richter will be followed by shows featuring the work of John Latham, Anya Gallaccio and Siobhán Hapaska. Philip Hoare, marvellous writer, curator and film-maker, author of Leviathan, or The Whale, is working on a centennial celebration of Wilfred Owen for the colossal video wall in the foyer. Any gallery that starts as it means to go on, like this, deserves every future success. Gerhard Richter is at the John Hansard Gallery, Southampton, until 18 August"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2018/may/10/daylight-robbery-grey-squirrels-stealing-millions-of-pounds-of-bird-seed-a-year","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-10T06:00:05Z","webTitle":"Daylight robbery: grey squirrels stealing millions of pounds of bird seed a year","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/10/daylight-robbery-grey-squirrels-stealing-millions-of-pounds-of-bird-seed-a-year","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/may/10/daylight-robbery-grey-squirrels-stealing-millions-of-pounds-of-bird-seed-a-year","fields":{"headline":"Daylight robbery: grey squirrels stealing millions of pounds of bird seed a year","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Daylight robbery worth millions of pounds is taking place in gardens across the country with grey squirrels raiding bird feeders on a huge scale, new research has revealed. The crimes were caught on video camera by scientists, who said grey squirrels are also known to raid birds’ nests for eggs and chicks. So people putting out food for birds are inadvertently supporting a species that harms them. Over 40% of households across the UK put out bird feed, totalling about 150,000 tonnes a year and costing £210m. But the new analysis, based on video recordings of more than 33,000 visits to bird feeders, showed much of the food is being snaffled by squirrels. Grey squirrels, though loved by some people, are an invasive alien species that has driven the native red squirrel out of much of the UK and they are also a pest in orchards and commercial forests. However, using feeders that are enclosed by a cage can help stop the squirrels getting their free lunches. “Anybody who feeds birds knows that there is a good chance that squirrels will come in to your feeders,” said Prof Mark Fellowes, at the University of Reading, who led the new work published in the journal Landscape and Urban Planning. “The question is how much is going to the target species – the birds?” To find out, the researchers placed automated video cameras in suburban gardens around Reading and found that birds would not go near a feeder when a squirrel was present. Furthermore, when squirrels were frequent visitors, they deterred birds even when not actually on the feeder. “Squirrels don’t just simply push birds off feeders, those birds change their behaviour,” said Hugh Hanmer, at the British Trust for Ornithology and also part of the research team. Overall, squirrels were responsible for almost half the recorded visits to feeders, a frequency that surprised the scientists. As larger animals, squirrels are likely to eat more than half the food. Feeders that incorporate a protective cage were also watched during the study and these cut squirrel visits to peanut feeders by half. But, said Prof Fellowes, the rodents are accomplished burglars and were often able to take some nuts. In contrast, caged seed feeders were rarely visited by squirrels, who much prefer the nuts. However, caged feeders also reduced the number of visits by birds, probably because the birds feel less able to escape a predator when inside the cage. Another way to foil the squirrels is putting out food that only birds like, such as the niger seeds loved by goldfinches, or even greasing the pole supporting standalone bird feeders. The best solution, said Prof Fellowes, are feeders that have a spring-loaded mechanism which closes the feeder when a relatively heavy animal, such as a squirrel steps on it, though these are more expensive. Robert Middleditch, at the charity SongBird Survival, said: “These findings greatly add to our understanding of the significant economic and environmental damage that non-native grey squirrels cause. The good news is that by using simple solutions we can help make sure that the food goes to our garden birds, and it may even help us save money [on feed] in the process.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/may/09/data-rules-threaten-last-avenue-used-in-thousands-of-immigration-cases","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-09T20:54:27Z","webTitle":"Data rules threaten 'last avenue' used in thousands of immigration cases","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/09/data-rules-threaten-last-avenue-used-in-thousands-of-immigration-cases","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/may/09/data-rules-threaten-last-avenue-used-in-thousands-of-immigration-cases","fields":{"headline":"Data rules threaten 'last avenue' used in thousands of immigration cases","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Tens of thousands of people each year could be prevented from obtaining information about their own immigration status under new data protection powers, Home Office figures reveal. Changes proposed in the data protection bill, which was debated by MPs on Wednesday, would deprive applicants of a reliable means of obtaining files on themselves from the department through what are known as subject access requests (SARs). The decision to grant the Home Office an exemption to such requests in immigration matters has already been criticised by campaign groups. But the large number of subject access requests in recent years suggests removing the right will have significant impact on those seeking to regularise their nationality or immigration status. According to the Home Office there were almost 25,950 SARs in 2016, the last year for which the department has released figures. The number of requests has been rising steadily since 2010, when there were 22,204 requests. The figures are far higher than generally appreciated and indicate that SARs have become an important source of information in such cases. The3million, a grassroots organisation representing EU citizens living in the UK, and the Open Rights Group argue that the exemption for data protection for immigrants is unlawful and will make EU citizens and others “second-class citizens” without full access to government files. It is threatening legal action if the government goes ahead with the plan. The Law Society has condemned the proposal and said it would hamper effective scrutiny of Home Office decision-making in immigration cases in future. A spokesman for the Law Society said: “When the government removed legal aid for most immigration cases, they made it harder for people to challenge Home Office decisions. Now they are seeking to remove the last avenue people have to understand and contest these decisions, which will put the immigration status of tens of thousands of people at risk. “There is no clear benefit or valid justification in exempting the Home Office from the same data rules as everyone else. Yet thousands are set to be denied the basic right to access their own personal data. “The Windrush scandal has shown us what is at stake. The Home Office should not be given the power to prevent vital access to personal data and undermine fundamental rights. The government must listen to the groundswell of opposition and ditch this exemption to prevent real harm coming to those the immigration system is supposed to be serving.” Responding to criticism of the exemption in the data protection bill last month, the Home Office said: “It is wrong to say that the proposed narrow exemption in the data protection bill is an attempt to deny people access to their data. People will still be able to request data as they can now and will be met in all cases except where to do so could undermine our immigration control. “They will have the right to complain to the information commissioner if they disagree with any use of the immigration exemption and we would always want to assist those whose claims are in question.” On Wednesday, MPs voted against an amendment that would have removed the Home Office’s exemption from the Bill."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/10/cure-baldness-hairless-head-bald-hair","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-10T08:00:07Z","webTitle":"They can keep their ‘cure’ for baldness.

I love my hairless head","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"In news that will be mostly of no use to anyone but ennui-ridden middle-aged men now contemplating their lost youth in the wake of their own fading good looks, it looks like a potential cure for baldness has been found. Scientists from the University of Manchester used a drug originally intended to treat osteoporosis on samples containing scalp hair follicles from more than 40 male hair-transplant patients, and found that the drug had a impressive effect on hair follicles, reviving their ability to grow. Dr Nathan Hawkshaw, the project leader for this vital research, noted a proper clinical trial would be needed to confirm if the drug was safe to use on humans, but said it could “make a real difference to people who suffer from hair loss”. But hey – whoa there, Dr Hawkshaw. Some of us aren’t actually “suffering” from hair loss. Some of us bald guys are enjoying not having any hair, and see no need for this new treatment, and in fact see you scientists constantly trying to cleanse the world of our rugged, sensitive, yet ultimately hairless look as something of an insult. Like many of my follicly challenged brothers, I can remember the exact time I started losing my hair. You may not believe it to look at my proudly gleaming forehead now, but I used to have long hair down to my chin, which I’d often dye black or beautiful, shimmering obsidian, which was the fashion at the time (for people into Linkin Park). Yet, slowly but surely, the long black or shimmering obsidian hairs would start piling up on my pillow every morning, and in an act of defiance against what I considered my own biological inferiority, I shaved it all off, and have had a skinhead ever since. At first, the sting was persistent and vivid, like getting dumped or supporting Arsenal. But over time, I started to kind of enjoy not having any hair, and am now glad it fell off in the first place. Sure, sometimes I look at people like Antonio Banderas and think “Christ, I’d rock the hell out of a slicked-back ponytail look”, but the arduous upkeep of your barnet – styling products, shampoo, conditioner, haircuts, trying to fit it into certain types of hat without looking stupid – far outweigh being able to rock the hell out of a ponytail, or any kind of hairstyle. Just thinking about the money I’ve saved on going to the barbers alone makes me weep with a weird, nonsensical pride that I can’t grow my hair any longer than Krusty The Clown-style sidebushes. Every time I need a haircut I just get a mirror and my clippers, and go at it – which is quick, painless and involves zero awkward chat with a hairdresser. And do I any look any worse? Well, guys don’t care if I’m bald or not. In fact, most guys I know either think I look way harder than I actually am, or come up to me and comment on how they wish they could shave all their hair off but can’t because they have decided to cling on to the dying embers of their hairline. And honestly, I’m no expert about what women want in a man, but I’m pretty sure that a good 90% of them couldn’t care less how much hair you have, as long as you’re not an entitled idiot and respect them as people: kind of like how most interpersonal relationships work really, just with less hair. Look at Jason Statham – he’s never had any problems attracting women, and he’s one of the baldest guys around. Ultimately, balding is a part of life, because it’s a part of death. Hair-loss treatments and replacements speak to a grim side of us that seeks immortality, of wanting to be young forever. Growing old is just as important in life as being young. In fact, it may be more important, and being comfortable with your body as it ages is a massive part of that. • Tom Usher is a freelance journalist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"technology/2018/may/09/googles-ai-program-deepmind-learns-human-navigation-skills","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-09T17:00:49Z","webTitle":"Google DeepMind's AI program learns human navigation skills","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/may/09/googles-ai-program-deepmind-learns-human-navigation-skills","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/may/09/googles-ai-program-deepmind-learns-human-navigation-skills","fields":{"headline":"Google DeepMind's AI program learns human navigation skills","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Notch up another win for the robots: the latest program from Google’s artificial intelligence group, DeepMind, has trounced experts at a maze game after it learned to find its way around like a human. Scientists noticed that when they trained the AI to move through a landscape, it spontaneously developed electrical activity akin to that seen in the specialised brain cells that underpin human navigational skills. So-called ‘grid cells’ were only identified in animals in 2005 in work that earned researchers a Nobel prize. The latest breakthrough reveals the potential for human brain-like activity to emerge from scratch in AI systems. Beyond making smarter programs, it paves the way for computer engineers to build models that help neuroscientists better understand the human brain. After discovering the AI-made grid cells, the DeepMind researchers made a beefed-up version of the program. It went on to beat experienced players at a game that involved racing through rooms to find a prize after being dropped into the virtual environment at a random location. Equipped with the artificial grid cells, the AI was faster and found shortcuts that would occasionally crop up when doors in the environment suddenly opened. “It is doing the kinds of things that animals do and that is to take direct routes wherever possible and shortcuts when they are available,” said Dharshan Kumaran, a senior researcher at DeepMind. “With the grid cells, its performance is markedly enhanced to the point that it surpasses an expert human player.” The feat marks a milestone in the field of artificial intelligence. Until now the technology used has proved itself to be superhuman at object recognition and games such as chess, Go, and poker, but not at the very different cognitive challenge of efficient navigation. But the research opens up fresh possibilities too. Because the AI program developed brain-like activity from scratch, scientists believe that a similar approach could shed light on other mysterious processes in the human brain, such as how limbs are controlled. And it could do so without any need for animal or human experimentation. “There is no reason why we couldn’t use this to understand different functions that the brain performs. It could be a testbed for experiments you wouldn’t otherwise do,” said Caswell Barry, a neuroscientist at University College London who worked on the project. Writing in the journal Nature, the scientists describe how they built a ‘deep neural network’, a computer program that uses multiple layers of artificial neurons to process information. They then taught the program the basics of navigation by feeding it the kinds of signals that encode speed and direction in the brains of foraging rats. With feedback on its performance, the AI got better and better at predicting where it was when it moved around a virtual environment. The scientists hoped that with training the AI program might develop its own grid cell-like activity, and that is precisely what they found. A quarter of the artificial neurons in one layer of the deep neural network had begun firing like biological grid cells. In other words, the AI hit on the same strategy to map out the world as the human brain did long ago. “We were surprised how well it worked,” said Caswell. “The degree of similarity is absolutely striking.” Grid cells are fundamental for navigation in humans and other mammals. They behave as if an invisible mesh of hexagons has been laid over the land, firing rapidly when an animal crosses from one hexagon to the next. In reality, some hexagons are big, others are small, and many overlap. Neuroscientists suspect that this imaginary mesh helps all mammals work out where they are and calculate the shortest path to their goal. In the next stage of the project, the scientists went on to build a more sophisticated AI that incorporated the artificial grid cell network. They then let it loose on a virtual reality maze game. Tests in the game showed that the AI used grid cells not only to track its position, but also to work out the direction and distance to its goal, so it could take the most direct route. “We tend to think of navigation as a very everyday thing, but it’s something we don’t understand very well,” said Kumaran. “What our study does is shed light on the neural mechanisms that underlie human navigation.” Francesco Savelli, an expert in artificial intelligence and neuroscience at Johns Hopkins University in Maryland, said that the magic of AI systems like the one used is that they come up with their own ways of processing data to solve the task at hand. “The emergence of grid cells in this model is an impressive demonstration of exactly that,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/may/09/teletubbies-has-vital-lessons-for-toddlers","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-09T16:48:43Z","webTitle":"Teletubbies has vital lessons for toddlers | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/may/09/teletubbies-has-vital-lessons-for-toddlers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/may/09/teletubbies-has-vital-lessons-for-toddlers","fields":{"headline":"Teletubbies has vital lessons for toddlers","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Catherine Shoard has jumped on the “malign influence of TV” bandwagon (Is children’s TV raising a crop of raving narcissists?, 7 May).

I know that he was of southern Irish Protestant stock; that his real name was Trevor Cox; that he worked in the same advertising agency as the poet Peter Porter; that he took holidays on Porquerolles, a Mediterranean island with no vehicular traffic; and that he shared the Irish short story writer’s traditional fate of being called “an Irish Chekhov”. But I can’t think of any public statement he made, or any cause he publicly adhered to, or any time when the non-literary pages of newspapers were interested in him. Was he knighted? Did they make a South Bank Show about him? I met him once, in 1999, after he won the David Cohen prize, but was left with only a strong impression of courtliness, charm and reserve. My wife, who was his long-term literary agent, told me that he liked to sit on park benches and eavesdrop on conversations; but that he never wanted to listen to a whole story, so would get up and move on as soon as he had heard the small amount he needed to trigger his further imaginings. This always struck me as a perfect example of how a fiction writer often works. You need a little, not a lot; and there is nothing more unhelpful than the guy (and it always is a guy) who greets you with: “I’ve got a great story you could use.” I was slow getting to Trevor’s work, put off in my early 20s by a theatrical adaptation in some cavernous provincial theatre of The Old Boys. What was it about, I wondered, and why were people laughing at all these old (or old-looking) actors? It was my fault, doubtless; or at least, my youth’s fault. Trevor writes as an adult for adults, expecting you to understand both life and prose; he is the subtlest purveyor of the partial truths we humans mostly live by. And when I finally read The Old Boys, I saw it as one of the rare examples of a novelist early in his career taking on the question of age, and emotion in age, long before he is personally cognisant of it; Trevor does so with the same kind of wiry savagery displayed by Muriel Spark in Memento Mori (his second novel, her third). He understood and could ventriloquise young and old, male and female; village, town and country; the socially low, middle and occasionally high. As for the young: 1976’s The Children of Dynmouth features one of the creepiest of manipulative boys in the whole of fiction; shelve it alongside The Turn of the Screw. Fiction writers can be located on various spectra. By style: the range goes from the look-at-me merchants, whose every phrase gleams like a monogrammed slipper, to those who operate with discretion, quietness, invisibility. By authorial control: should characters expect to be whipped like galley slaves, as Nabokov whimsically put it, or to be empathetically inhabited and animated? By public visibility: from writers who act as public figures, make political or social interventions, and delight in social media, to those “merely” absorbed in the life around them, about which they issue occasional bulletins. Connected to this, there are writers who invite our curiosity about their own lives, personality and sexual doings, versus those who self-effacingly insist that the work is sufficient unto itself. On all of these spectra, Trevor belongs on the far right-hand side. You can’t imagine him, even if he had lived another 50 years, ever having a Google alert on himself. There is another division between fiction writers, of a more ruthlessly binary kind. There are those who are essentially novelists but who occasionally lapse into the short story; and those who are short story writers but who may veer into the novel. The novelists often fail at the shorter form’s difficult mix of spareness and intensity; the short story writers often sway and ramble when let loose in larger acres. Trevor was one of the very rare exceptions, genuinely ambidextrous in his 14 novels, two novellas and 13 collections of stories. Many of these Last Stories – published after his death in 2016 on what would have been Trevor’s 90th birthday – begin at a point where the characters’ lives might seem to be over, or at least much diminished. They start with a death, a widowing, the end of a marriage, a sudden acknowledgment that henceforth the past rules. A piano teacher realises that all the main events of her life – a father’s death, a secret love affair – have taken place in the very room where she now gives lessons. A publisher’s reader, whose husband was stolen years ago by her best friend, now trusts to a stable routine for getting through her “leftover life to kill”. Some protagonists have walked away from their previous commitments; others have been the ones abandoned. There is much inner solitude in this world; happiness is temporary and conditional; often there has been damage a long way back, damage that cannot be mended. And having the best of intentions may be a recipe for disaster. In “An Idyll in Winter”, a young tutor stirs the imagination of a 12-year-old girl in a Big House on the Yorkshire Moors; a decade and more later, he returns, now a cartographer, married with two children, while she, still unattached, runs the farm after the death of her parents. He visits, leaves, returns, stays, vacillates, lets down both women, and leaves for ever. His desire not to hurt hurts; his marriage dies. Meanwhile, the estate workers silently pity their employer, and she cannot explain to them how love will continue in the man’s absence, despite his absence, even perhaps because of his absence. Her love “will not wither ... there’ll be no long slow dying, or love made ordinary”. This may sound romantic, but in fact offers a terrible choice: the presence and acceptance of love, then its descent into familiarity and ordinariness, versus the absence or refusal of love and its vivid continuation. Yet the word “choice” implies agency. Trevor’s characters rarely choose what happens to them; life chooses for them. What they want, or feel they want, does not govern what they get – or only for a brief, illusory time. After that they are delivered back into emotional marginality, glancing non-relationships and the dubious certitudes of memory. There are also slippages of identity and function to be endured. A picture restorer struck by bouts of amnesia wanders haltingly through his own city; a pair of itinerant “Polish painters” turn out to be something else entirely; a daughter, growing up with a father, assuming her absent mother to be dead, turns out to have a different origin story. Trevor’s characters are often lone, or alone, or lonely, even – especially – if they are in a relationship. And there are doubts and ambiguities at every turn. Did they go to bed together or not? Was it accident or suicide? Where does fault and responsibility actually lie? Trevor’s fiction is full of precise evasions – and evasive precisions. As VS Pritchett wrote of Chekhov, he “accepts all contradictions”. Take “Mrs Crasthorpe”, one of the most powerful stories in the book. It is 22 pages long, and intercuts two lives – a frequent Trevor ploy. It opens with the title character, a “lone mourner” at her husband’s funeral. But – atypically – Mrs Crasthorpe defies her loneness, and declines to accept that her life is over; she imagines herself “always a rosebud”, and proposes to “relish” her widowhood. Living by cheerful pretence, she has removed 14 years from her age, and tells no one about her illegitimate (criminal, banged-up) son, or the lovers she took during her marriage. Meanwhile, elsewhere in London, a specialist printer called Etheridge tends his dying wife. After her death he moves to near Regent’s Park. One day, he is accosted in the street by Mrs Crasthorpe, who asks him for directions to a road that doesn’t exist. Another pretence, designed to delay and engage a polite Englishman who will naturally attempt to help. It is a trick that has worked for her before. We think we can guess where the story might be going – at least, in other hands. She, being cheerful and attractive, will divert him from his grief, draw him out, attach him to her, and make him reliant, if at first only sexually, on her. He will not discover her true nature until it is too late; by which time, even so, she might succeed in making him happy. But this is not Trevor’s way, nor is it his reading of life. A while later, Etheridge is sitting in a cafe, only to find Mrs Crasthorpe at the next table, pretending to half-recognise him. She is both lush and delicate; she employs the charms and conversational ploys that have usually worked in the past. She has a way of implying that they know one another a little better than they actually do. As they sit there, she muses on this “attractive stranger ... whom she’d made herself love a little”. Naturally, the reader feels queasily apprehensive on Etheridge’s behalf. But Etheridge is not being charmed: quite the contrary. He finds Mrs Crasthorpe crassly babbling, and wonders if she might be drunk. But she is not stupid – or rather, she recognises when her prime tactic isn’t working. “We’re clearly not birds of a feather,” she remarks, “but if you should ever think we might know one another better …” and she writes her address down for him. Again, another writer might leave it there – might leave it (in what would be a sub-Trevor way) with an ambiguous ending: might not Etheridge, in his loneliness, still succumb in one way or another? But this is the real Trevor. The story is in part a comparison of griefs: while Mrs Crasthorpe looks to enjoy “the pleasure of widowhood”, Etheridge knows only the uncomprehending regret of that state, and holds a “continuing anger at the careless greed of death”. When, years later, his eye catches the name “Crasthorpe” in a newspaper, he finds that “the curiosity Mrs Crasthorpe had failed to discover in her lifetime came now”. He seeks to imagine the rest of her life, “but too much was missing and he resisted further speculation. He sensed his own pity, not knowing why it was there.” But it is the reader’s pity too, as we go back over her story and better understand the panic behind the bravado, the yearning beneath the bright facade. And our eye returns to a few lines that we might have paused at but only half attended to: a moment when Mrs Crasthorpe cries, but not for effect: She wept her private tears whenever she imagined the coat unbuttoned, the sudden twitch as it opened wide, the torch’s flash. She wept because she loved him as she did no other human being. She always had. She always would. This relates to an incident whose significance escaped me for two readings. And it makes us understand that there is a third grief present in the story, this time for the living, not the dead. Trevor does not make a point of being demanding or obscure; but he is very subtle. And perhaps it is relevant that the 17th-century Etherege – with an E, not an I – wrote a play called She Would If She Could. This pattern of readerly doubt and misprision is typical of a William Trevor story. We will be presented with an event – an accident in the street, a death, a funeral, a chance meeting, an abandonment – that will widen into a situation between two or more characters. There are only a limited number of fictional beginnings, and so we feel as if we have been here before. Automatically, we predict where the story might be going. But it doesn’t go where we predict, because, in a way we sense rather than observe, it has ceased to be a story. It has become life, and life wrongfoots us in stranger ways than fiction can. We submit to the deep, essential truth to life that Trevor has presented. And yet, at the same time, we realise it is still “only” a story. None but those with a complete mastery of fiction can walk this line. William Trevor was not “an Irish Chekhov” or even “the Irish Chekhov”. He was and will remain the Irish William Trevor.

Ever visited the Suffolk-based Latitude festival? I haven’t been. I don’t really care for much of the bands that play it, but my wife, daughter, sister and my mum have been to it. I find something else to do. On a scale of one to 10, how filthy are you at a festival? I’m completely the opposite, to be honest. If I go to a festival I make sure I’ve got a hotel and transport there and back. I’m not into camping. It’s awkward too, because you get recognised. There are artists’ camping sections, but even so I like my creature comforts. If you dropped your phone down a festival toilet, would you try to retrieve it? I actually dropped my sunglasses down the toilet at Bloodstock last year and I retrieved them and washed them quite vigorously. Fortunately the toilet was quite full so they stuck on the top.

Well, when we were young we used to go to north Wales camping to pick magic mushrooms. My friends were larking around with a tent peg and somebody threw it to the other guy and it went through his shoe and foot. He was on mushrooms at the time as well. How many pairs of socks do you wear inside your wellies ? Always two. You’ve also got to buy the wellies slightly too big. Marilyn Manson asks to use your last set of wet wipes following a misjudgment involving a dodgy burger – what do you do? We have an abundance of wet wipes. Too many. For one, we wear a lot of stage makeup and two, there’s the risk that there isn’t a shower at a venue so you have to have a wet wipe shower, which is better than nothing, at least. I have met Marilyn Manson and he’s a likable fellow, so I’d give him some wet wipes. He flicked a Guardian journalist in the balls during an interview. Has he done anything similar to you? He’s kissed me on stage once. If you could curate your own festival lineup using only former boyband members, who would be the three headliners? The Backstreet Boys, all of them.

Hastening the country’s giddy descent into feudal, flag-waving battiness, the broadcast media is indulging in displays of royal arse-licking not seen since the court of Queenie in Blackadder II. All this and not even a bank holiday to show for it. I ask you. Conjecture is the order of the day, as evidenced in last week’s Diana to Meghan: Royal Wedding Secrets (Channel 5), the title of which promised something scurrilous but in fact yielded royal biographers Andrew Morton and Penny Junor spouting the purest slurry and designer Elizabeth Emanuel reliving the creation of Diana’s wedding dress while mournfully clutching offcuts. There was ITV’s Invitation to a Royal Wedding, in which Trevor McDonald and Julie Etchingham promised a wedding “unlike any we’ve seen”, all the while standing like planks outside Windsor Castle in their wedding clobber. And who could have overlooked Prince Harry’s Story: Four Royal Weddings, also on ITV, a hagiographical portrait documenting the prince’s boulder-strewn journey from bereaved child to swastika-sporting booze-hound to generally likable human being? There will, of course, be plenty more of this. The coming week brings a rich smorgasbord of WTF programming, including When Harry Met Meghan: A Royal Romance (Saturday, 7pm, Channel 4), in which we get the lowdown on Meghan’s humble beginnings, and Meet the Markles (Tuesday, 10pm, Channel 4), which finds YouTube star Amelia Dimoldenberg travelling to Florida to track down the Markle family. Meanwhile, Extreme Cake Makers (Sunday, 4.25pm, Channel 4) and First Dates (Thursday, 10pm, Channel 4) will both be undergoing royal makeovers. Amid this sea of sycophancy sits an island of sanity in the form of The Windsors Royal Wedding Special (Tuesday, 9pm, Channel 4). Its mere existence should earn it some sort of commemorative plate. Elsewhere in our new red, white and blue televisual universe, expect “friends” of the bride, ie randoms who once picked up her coffee cup by accident on a film set, to languish on TV sofas and share their intimate memories of Meghan, and montages to be played and replayed of horses and carriages, soldiers sweating in bearskins, guests in awful hats and royal superfans parked outside the palace sporting union jack vests and radioactive sunburn. Assume the brace position as Nicholas Witchell, smug overlord of all things royal, takes up residence on the Mall, causing flowers to wilt within a three-mile radius through sheer force of his banality. If ever there was a threat to the future of the monarchy, it’s this guy. And gird yourself for the interminable chuntering of royal “experts”, namely the columnists, the biographers, the ex-butlers and bodyguards currently undergoing emergency teeth-whitening treatment before hightailing it from one studio to the next crying God for Harry, and hailing the wonderful boost to the nation that is this display of richness by very rich people.

AT&amp;T and the Swiss pharmaceuticals company Novartis both said they were contacted by Mueller’s office in November last year, as Novartis confirmed it had paid Cohen $1.2m – significantly more than was initially disclosed. “Novartis cooperated fully with the special counsel’s office and provided all the information requested,” the company said in a statement. AT&amp;T said in a statement: “We cooperated fully, providing all information requested.” Peter Carr, a spokesman for Mueller’s office, declined to comment. Novartis said it hired Cohen on a $100,000-a-month contract in February last year because it believed he “could advise the company as to how the Trump administration might approach certain US healthcare policy matters” such as the Affordable Care Act, which Trump had pledged to scrap. After only one meeting, however, executives concluded Cohen “would be unable to provide the services that Novartis had anticipated”, according to the company, and decided “not to engage further”. But the contract could not be terminated so Cohen was paid in full for the year, a spokesman said. AT&amp;T confirmed earlier on Wednesday that it also paid Cohen. A company spokesperson said it had contracted Trump’s attorney to “provide insights into understanding the new administration”. Mueller is primarily investigating possible collusion between Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign and Russians who interfered in the election. Cohen is the subject of a separate criminal investigation by federal authorities in New York. His home and offices were searched in surprise raids by FBI agents last month. Prosecutors have said the inquiry relates to Cohen’s personal finances. Novartis and AT&amp;T were among companies revealed to have paid Cohen in a document published on Tuesday by Michael Avenatti, an attorney for Stephanie Clifford, the pornographic actor known as Stormy Daniels, who is engaged in a legal dispute with Cohen and Trump. Avenatti’s document said a subsidiary of the Swiss company had made at least four payments to Cohen’s company totalling $400,000. Confirming the arrangement, the company said: “The terms were consistent with the market.” The records also said AT&amp;T paid Cohen $50,000 per month for at least four months, meaning the company may have paid him as much as $600,000 for the year. Trump’s administration was at the time considering whether to allow an $85bn merger of AT&amp;T and Time Warner, which it has since rejected. Cohen was also paid by Columbus Nova, the US affiliate of a corporate empire belonging to Viktor Vekselberg, a Russian oligarch closely linked to Vladimir Putin. Avenatti’s document said the payments totalled about half a million dollars. Cohen’s attorney, Stephen Ryan, hit back at Avenatti in a furious letter filed to Manhattan’s federal court late on Wednesday, in which he confirmed that AT&amp;T, Novartis and Columbus Nova were all Cohen clients. Ryan said Avenatti appeared to have obtained Cohen’s bank records, and “should be required to explain” how he got them before he is allowed to be officially involved in a dispute the court is considering over records the FBI seized from Cohen’s home and offices. The inspector general of the US Treasury opened an investigation on Wednesday into whether Cohen’s bank records were improperly leaked. Richard Delmar, a counsel to the inspector general, told the Guardian the inquiry would focus on “compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act and its protections of information”. Some reports on Wednesday alleged that Cohen had offered his clients access to senior administration officials. Avenatti sought to connect the payments from Novartis to the company’s incoming chief executive, Vas Narasimhan, being invited to a group dinner with Trump at the World Economic Forum in Davos on 25 January 2018. But Novartis stressed on Wednesday that the company’s contract with Cohen predated Narasimhan, and said he had “no involvement whatsoever” in the arrangement. Columbus Nova said Vekselberg had no involvement in its own arrangement with Cohen. Vekselberg, too, was reportedly interviewed by investigators for Mueller’s team. He has not been accused of any wrongdoing. Cohen used the same Delaware company to pay Daniels $130,000 in October 2016 in return for an agreement that she would not talk publicly about allegedly having had sex with Trump a decade earlier. The arrangement was later disclosed by reporters. Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI), one of the biggest defence companies in South Korea, also confirmed it had paid Cohen. Avenatti’s document said it had paid Essential Consultants $150,000 in November last year. A spokesman for the company told Reuters that it had contracted Cohen for “legal consulting concerning accounting standards”. KAI is currently competing for a lucrative contract from the US defense department and hopes to produce about 350 trainer jets in partnership with the US contractor Lockheed Martin."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/may/14/ione-christensen-canada-yukon-sourdough-starter-yeast","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-14T09:00:23Z","webTitle":"Rising fame: experts herald Canadian woman's 120-year-old sourdough starter","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/14/ione-christensen-canada-yukon-sourdough-starter-yeast","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/14/ione-christensen-canada-yukon-sourdough-starter-yeast","fields":{"headline":"Rising fame: experts herald Canadian woman's 120-year-old sourdough starter","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Every Saturday night for the last sixty years, Ione Christensen has followed the same routine to prepare waffles for breakfast the following morning: she measures out two cups of flour and two cups of warm water, then she reaches into her fridge to bring out her sourdough starter. “It’s a family pet, if you will,” she said from her home in Canada’s Yukon territory. Like any pet, the starter needs to be constantly fed – in this case, with flour and water. But the spongy blend of wild yeast and bacteria has far outlived any ordinary pet: at 120 years, the sourdough is much older than Christensen, who is 84. Earlier this month, Christensen baked for a new guest: Karl De Smedt, a Belgian baker, who scours the globe for new sourdough strains to add to his “library” in Belgium. So far, the collection in the town of St Vith contains 84 samples in refrigerated glass jars from 20 countries, including Mexico, Greece and Japan. De Smedt’s archive is meant to both showcase geographically diverse varieties of yeast and preserve a growing collection for future generations to study. “The taste of Ione’s waffles was amazing. I am from Belgium and she was making Belgian waffles,” said De Smedt. “They were very light, but at the same time, I had a couple of them and they filled my stomach for hours.” In baking, a starter is a culture of yeast and bacteria that converts starch molecules into sugars. During this process, the yeast also produces carbon dioxide, which in turn helps the bread rise. It is a critical – if under-appreciated – component of baking, said De Smedt. “For 5,000 years, everybody on earth who wanted to make bread had to use sourdough,” he said. In modern baking, yeast is extracted, meaning bakers don’t need to feed their starter every few hours: “They were slaves to their sourdough,” he says. De Smedt will bring a sample of Christensen’s starter – labeled “106” – back to the library and also provide some to Italian researchers, in order for them to sequence and study the DNA profile of the sourdough. His visit to Christensen’s home in Whitehorse is part of a journey from Seattle to Alaska and the Yukon, where he is tracing a culinary legacy inadvertently established by gold prospectors. Christensen knows the starter travelled with her great-grandfather around 1897, but she is unsure of its exact origins. Small lumps of yeast and bacteria, often found tucked in the flour sacks of prospectors, were critical during the Klondike Gold Rush. Because most food froze, flour – and the starter – became so important to prospectors that over time, a person from the Yukon became known as a “sourdough”. Dating strains is difficult, says De Smedt, but Christensen’s is among the oldest in his collection. Christensen laughs at the prospect that the starter, with its newfound fame, might eclipse her own impressive list of accomplishments – including first female mayor of Whitehorse, Commissioner of Yukon and Canadian senator. “I’m not looking for legacy. The Yukon is a small community. When there’s something to be done – there were no men’s jobs or ladies jobs – there were just jobs. And if you were there and it needed to be done, you did it.” Before she bakes, Christensen is careful to set aside a small amount of the mixture, in order to feed it back to the starter in the jar. Without doing so, the legacy of the sourdough would come to an end. That the starter will find a new home among other sourdoughs – and in history – is a pleasure in itself for Christensen. “I’m quite proud, because I feel I’m sort of a keeper of a Yukon legend,” says Chirstensen. “I don’t feel it’s just my sourdough. It’s the Yukon’s sourdough.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/2018/may/11/weatherwatch-are-ice-halos-a-warning-of-disaster-possibly","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-11T20:30:11Z","webTitle":"Weatherwatch: are ice halos a warning of disaster?

Coming three weeks after the Chernobyl disaster, this unusual phenomenon caused great consternation. The Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute was flooded with calls asking if the halo was linked to radioactive particles in the air. At the time the idea was dismissed, but now it turns out that Dutch observers may have been right. Since Babylonian times halos have provoked fascination and superstition; King Edward IV of England even used them to help him win a battle during the War of the Roses. Today we know they are caused by high level ice crystals acting like chandelier crystals, scattering light. Sometimes halos can presage a storm, when sunlight is scattered by ice crystals in high level cirrus clouds on the storm’s front edge. Writing in the journal Weather, Mila Zinkova describes halos she saw during the Californian wildfires in 2017. She concludes that the smoke from the fires encouraged formation of high level ice crystals, enhancing the chances of halos being seen. Similarly, Zinkova suggests that the radionuclides ejected by the Chernobyl disaster in 1986 might have served as nuclei for the ice crystals that caused halo sightings over the Netherlands."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/may/12/mabel-i-find-camping-difficult-someone-pooed-in-my-tent-once","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-12T13:00:32Z","webTitle":"Mabel: ‘I find camping difficult.

Although the Bank believes the soft patch in growth will prove temporary, seven of the nine members of its monetary policy committee (MPC) adopted a wait-and-see approach to raising official borrowing costs on Thursday, voting to keep them at 0.5%. Mark Carney, the Bank’s governor, said a rate rise was more likely than not before the end of the year, provided the economy rebounded as expected from a first quarter in which it grew by 0.1% – the slowest pace in more than five years. Two committee members, Michael Saunders and Ian McCafferty, said rising pay caused by falling unemployment required an immediate increase in interest rates. The Bank’s decision – outlined in its quarterly inflation report – will come as no surprise to the City, which expected Threadneedle Street to ditch plans for tighter policy this month in the light of weak growth, a faster-than-expected fall in inflation and evidence that consumers were cutting back on spending. Even so, news that a rate increase was being delayed resulted in the pound falling against the dollar to below $1.35, its lowest level in four months. The minutes of this week’s MPC meeting showed rate rises are still being planned in order to meet the government’s 2% inflation target, but the language was notably softer than in February when the Bank said policy would probably need to be tightened earlier and to a greater extent than the markets were expecting. Three months ago, the Bank had been pencilling in growth of 0.4% in the first quarter and 1.8% for 2018 as a whole. The near-stalling of the economy has led the MPC to cut its annual growth forecast to 1.4% for this year. But Threadneedle Street’s belief that little fundamental has changed since February and that the economy actually grew more strongly than 0.1% has kept alive speculation that a quarter-point increase in borrowing costs is possible when the next inflation report is released in August. Carney said that if the economy performed as the Bank expected, a “modest tightening” of policy would be warranted. The Bank believes the economy has the potential to grow at about 1.5% a year but that demand will slightly exceed that limit in the coming years in the absence of a gentle increase in interest rates. The financial markets are expecting three quarter-point increases over the next three years. As in February, the MPC pointed to the fall in unemployment to its lowest level since the mid-1970s as the reason why rates would eventually have to rise. Wage pressures are expected to build as employers struggle to recruit and retain staff. Bank economists think the first-quarter growth figure was distorted by unusually cold weather and will eventually be revised up to 0.3%. “Survey indicators, and evidence from the Bank’s (regional) agents, suggested that growth had been somewhat stronger in the first quarter than implied by the preliminary estimate,” the MPC minutes said. Even so, the seven members of the MPC who voted for no change said they wanted confirmation that the economy had merely been going through a soft patch before voting for higher rates. “Given the recent weakness in consumer credit and the housing market, there was somewhat greater than usual uncertainty about the near-term momentum in consumer spending and the extent to which households would adjust their spending and saving to the past fall in their real incomes,” the minutes said. Frances O’Grady, the general secretary of trade union body the TUC, said: “It’s the right decision not to raise interest rates. You don’t kick the economy when it’s down. Now the government must get our ailing economy back on its feet, delivering decent jobs and a real rise in wages.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/may/10/rangers-rebuild-englands-highest-war-memorial-national-trust-scafell-pike","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-10T05:00:04Z","webTitle":"Rock by rock: rangers rebuild England's highest war memorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/10/rangers-rebuild-englands-highest-war-memorial-national-trust-scafell-pike","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/10/rangers-rebuild-englands-highest-war-memorial-national-trust-scafell-pike","fields":{"headline":"Rock by rock: rangers rebuild England's highest war memorial","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"National Trust rangers have started to rebuild England’s highest war memorial on the summit of Scafell Pike to mark 100 years since the end of the first world war. The mountain was given to the trust by Lord Leconfield when the conflict ended, in memory of the thousands of men from the Lake District who had fought and died. Despite strong winds, rain and thick mist, the mission to rebuild the cairn got under way with the team of seven rangers making their way up. Most of them descend each day after many hours of hard labour, returning the following morning. But a number have set up camp near the summit while the work continues. Some set about the painstaking task of picking apart the cairn to then reset it with replacement rocks and to also take out the various items that have been buried over the years. The 7.5-metre-wide landmark, which stands at 978 metres above sea level, has been added to by the hundreds of thousands of walkers that climb the mountain each year and is now in desperate need of restoration. As the outer layer was pulled away, pieces of litter appeared that have been hidden for decades, including broken urns, family photos, bits of clothing and items of jewellery. At the same time other members of the restoration team have been hauling huge rocks using iron rods and ropes so they could be set into the cairn. Scafell Pike was one of 13 Lakeland summits given to the National Trust in the years immediately after the first world war, in what was known as the “Great Gift”. The words inscribed on the memorial read: “In perpetual memory of the men of the Lake District who fell for God and King for freedom, peace and right in the Great War 1914-18. “This summit of Scafell was given to the nation subject to any commoners rights and placed in custody of the National Trust by Charles Henry, Baron Leconfield.” The work on the cairn is expected to be finished in one to two weeks. However, the other major task, rebuilding many of the paths that lead to the summit, will take the rangers several months. Aside from being historically significant, Scafell Pike is also a fragile habitat and a designated special site of scientific interest and a special area of conservation. More than 250,000 people make their way up each year and, along with erosion by the elements, some of the paths now sprawl like scars across the landscape. Steve Jolley, the area ranger for Wasdale, said: “We will fix the erosion on the footpath network above 2,000ft, which was part of the original gift from Lord Leconfield. “A lot of these paths have encroached on some very fragile vegetation like dwarf willow so our plan is to shrink them in but still accommodate all the people that go up each year. “As part of the 100-year commemorations we’re trying to raise awareness as well that the uplands are a very special place. “They do get a lot of use and sometimes abuse and they’re under a lot pressure with things like the Three Peaks Challenge and the vast amounts of litter we pick off each year. So we want to raise that awareness that it’s somewhere to enjoy but also somewhere to respect.” The team will place a time capsule into the stone wall of the cairn, filling it with details on the work undertaken, including plans, photos and information about the rangers themselves. The capsule will act as a record of the conservation work that goes into maintaining the mountain, which has had numerous repairs during the last century with the last major work taking place in the 1980s. Sam Stalker, the National Trust’s lead ranger on Scafell Pike, said: “It’s great that so many people are able to enjoy Scafell Pike and the surrounding peaks each year. The mountains will be here forever, but they need ongoing care. “Repairing the cairn is just part of the work we’ll be doing this year to keep Scafell Pike looking its best. It’s an exciting opportunity to share what we’re doing with our visitors and show them the hard work that goes into maintaining the Lakes for them and future generations to enjoy.” The National Trust also plans to light a beacon on top of Scafell Pike on Armistice Day, just as Lord Leconfield did on Peace Day on 19 July 1919."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/may/13/the-week-in-radio-the-art-of-money-bearing-grudges-is-eating-plants-wrong","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-13T07:00:01Z","webTitle":"The week in radio and podcasts: The Art of Money; Bearing Grudges; Is Eating Plants Wrong?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/may/13/the-week-in-radio-the-art-of-money-bearing-grudges-is-eating-plants-wrong","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/may/13/the-week-in-radio-the-art-of-money-bearing-grudges-is-eating-plants-wrong","fields":{"headline":"The week in radio and podcasts: The Art of Money; Bearing Grudges; Is Eating Plants Wrong?","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"The Art of Money (BBC Radio 4) | iPlayer Bearing Grudges (BBC Radio 4) | iPlayer Is Eating Plants Wrong? (BBC Radio 4) | iPlayer I do love a documentary and, despite the abundance of excellent real-life podcasts, I still turn to Radio 4 for interesting ones. When the station gets it right, when it hits upon an intriguing topic – an undiscovered history or a subject that’s been niggling under the surface of contemporary life – and sends the right producer and presenter to interview and persuade, its fact-based investigations are second to none. Very different from the Radio 2 docs I moaned about the other week. Radio 2 documentaries are slick, uncontroversial and hosted by someone famous with a tenuous connection to the subject. Radio 4 docs are varied: sometimes soundscapes, sometimes brisk interrogations, sometimes a combination of Open University lectures and a heated discussion in a pub. This is a good thing. I enjoyed three such Radio 4 documentaries last week. The Art of Money was presented by John Wilson of Front Row, and by presented, I mean, he did all the interviews, wrote the script and followed the story with producer Ben Carter. The programme, timed to coincide with the big sale of Rockefeller-owned art that took place in Christie’s New York last week, was about what art means today, in terms of money and soft power. States such as the UAE and Qatar are busy setting up cultural institutions (the Louvre in Abu Dhabi, the National Museum in Doha), because those in power realise that natural resources don’t last for ever and that there’s a need for them to establish a “knowledge-based economy”. Wilson, born of a football man (Arsenal’s Bob Wilson), drew the correct parallels with the world’s favourite game: Qatar will be hosting the World Cup in 2022; Manchester City are owned by the deputy prime minister of the UAE, the half-brother of the president; Paris Saint-Germain are owned by a Qatari businessman and minister without portfolio. Such states are busy using culture “to future-proof economies”. “If you build it, they will come,” said one Qatari official, lightly. The money involved is staggering, and it’s not just nation states that understand what this can mean. We heard the tale of an immensely valuable Basquiat painting coming into the US in 2007, labelled as a painting by an unknown artist and valued at $100. Which meant there was no tax to be paid by Brazilian embezzler Edemar Cid Ferreira, and no way of seeing the painting as global money-shifting. The secrecy around who buys and sells art makes art collecting an ideal way to launder dirty cash. Ooh, this was tremendously interesting stuff, presented and produced with insight and verve. I enjoyed Bearing Grudges for very different reasons. This had the delightfully rarefied Marcel Berlins admitting to holding grudges for years, usually against people he had witnessed being rude to others less fortunate than themselves. I wondered if he would have borne such grudges if he’d just spoken up about the bad behaviour at the time? This wasn’t addressed. What was was just how many of us are holding grudges (pretty much everyone) and exactly how bad they can get. We had political examples, literary ones (a lot of Dickens, all of Trollope), plus a fabulously posh psychotherapist explaining feelings of “pusillanimity, narcissistic injury, a sense of worthlessness, a sense of being dissed or humiliated”. Berlin made incredulous noises when writer Sophie Hannah revealed her belief that there is a good and a bad way to hold a grudge. Most entertaining. Finally, Is Eating Plants Wrong?. The presenter, botanist and Observer magazine columnist James Wong, was a teensy bit too boisterous for me, but this programme was also packed with interesting facts and he, too, did all the presenting work, asking the right questions and giving fascinating examples of plants modifying their behaviour and passing on messages to each other. The title was a red herring (there’s only one answer really – if it is, what do we live on?), but this, like the other docs, was an excellent way to spend a quiet half-hour. Top (soil) stuff. Three of the best podcasts presented by two women Small Town Dicks Less Serial, more 24 Hours in Police Custody, this true-crime podcast goes into the detail of what actually happens in an everyday case.

In March 2016 the newspaper published an article headlined: “Corbyn and the mosque leader who blames the UK for Isil.” The story tried to connect the Labour leader to extremist views allegedly held by Mohammed Kozbar, who runs the mosque in Corbyn’s Islington North constituency and is also vice-chair of the Muslim Association of Britain. Kozbar successfully argued that the article was defamatory and the Sunday Telegraph has now removed the article from its website, published a ruling accepting the article was defamatory, and paid damages understood to be in the region of £30,000 to settle the case. This does not include the newspaper’s costs. “It was not just myself who was the target of this article, it was Jeremy Corbyn,” said Kozbar after the verdict. “The aim was to damage the reputation of Jeremy and make his progress with the Labour party more difficult.” The piece, by the journalist Andrew Gilligan, claimed the mosque administrator supported the use of violence in the Israel-Palestine conflict and blamed the UK government for the rise of Islamic State. It appeared alongside a picture of Corbyn shaking hands with Kozbar, detailed regular meetings between the two men, and quoted the Labour leader as calling the mosque leader “fantastic”. Finsbury Park mosque became infamous for hosting the radical preacher Abu Hamza before it was shut down by the authorities in 2003 over an alleged plot to produce the poison ricin. Kozbar says he has since fought hard to rebuild the mosque’s reputation and standing in the community and he was forced to fight the case against the Sunday Telegraph in order to take a stand against “Islamophopic media coverage”. He insisted the article was “not just an attack on me but also my faith community”. “This mosque went through very difficult times in the past and we managed to change the atmosphere from a hostile atmosphere to a welcoming community,” said Kozbar. “We will not accept anyone who wants to destroy the reputation and the hard work that has been done with the community here at Finsbury Park mosque.” Corbyn appeared alongside Kozbar last summer following the far-right terrorist attack near the mosque, which resulted in the death of Makram Ali. Jonathan Coad of Keystone Law, who took up the case after Kozbar was unsatisfied with a ruling by the press regulator Ipso, said: “While there are many responsible elements of the press, the demonising of Muslims in some parts of it is immensely destructive. “These legal proceedings should never have been necessary. The article should not have been published.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/may/09/oil-prices-hit-three-and-a-half-year-high-after-us-exits-from-iran-deal","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-09T15:16:51Z","webTitle":"Oil prices hit three-and-a-half-year high after US exits from Iran deal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/09/oil-prices-hit-three-and-a-half-year-high-after-us-exits-from-iran-deal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/may/09/oil-prices-hit-three-and-a-half-year-high-after-us-exits-from-iran-deal","fields":{"headline":"Oil prices hit three-and-a-half-year high after US exits from Iran deal","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Crude oil prices rose to three-and-a-half-year highs following the news that the Trump administration revoked the nuclear deal with Iran. Brent crude oil prices, the global benchmark, and US West Texas Intermediate rallied above $77 and $71 per barrel, respectively, in the aftermath of the announcement. The rise came after the treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, told reporters he did not expect a major oil price hikes because other countries would increase output to offset such losses. Although Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action was not a surprise, reinstating all US nuclear-related sanctions was more than expected, said Barclays analysts in a research note. Bart Melek, global head of commodity strategy at TD Securities, said this announcement comes at a time where there are increased geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and global crude oil inventories are normalizing after being in a supply glut for the past few years. In the US inventory levels are now below the five-year average. “There’s a broad consensus that [supplies are] going to rebalance and tighten up, but you throw the possibility of disruptions of flows from Iran, and the markets started to worry,” he said. The reimposition of US sanctions will be phased in over the next 90-180 days to give companies time to wind down operations. Does this mean oil prices will return to the $100-plus days of a few years ago? It’s unlikely for now. Melek said he sees WTI and Brent crude oil prices not going much higher than $72 and $78, respectively, saying the price rise this week reflects a temporary risk premium rather than actual supply shortages. Even if some Iranian oil is off the market, Melek said there was capacity for members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) to increase production to make up for the shortfall. Before the White House announcement, oil traders expected Opec members and Russia to stick to their plan to continue reducing output into 2019, which has helped bring supplies and demand back into balance. That plan could be revisited at the next Opec meeting in June. Plus there are the US shale oil producers which might make up for any shortfall. Jeff Klearman, portfolio manager at GraniteShares exchange traded funds, said he sees WTI prices holding in their recent range of $60 to $70, provided the strong demand from the EU and US continues, which may require prices staying around that level. Considering European signatories still support the deal, Iran said it would still comply and there are six months before the sanctions unfold, so there was still time to work something out, Melek said. This assumes all sides will try to work out something regarding the deal and that there will not be other supply disruptions. There is a lot of uncertainty in the market which stems from the White House itself, said Eric Armitage, chief investment officer of East Alpha, a hedge fund specializing in energy. He noted tweets from Trump a few weeks ago complaining oil prices were too high, but if Iranian sanctions curtail global supply that will only raise prices. “It’s just a mess policy-wise and there is no coherence … nothing is actually making strict sense,” he said. That leaves the oil market susceptible to price swings. Melek said if talks break down in the coming weeks and months or there is more aggressive rhetoric, which is entirely possible, prices could potentially spike higher. But he said market reactions like that are usually temporary. “You would really need something material on the ground that would stop flows of oil to get into the triple digits,” Melek said. Wednesday’s rise in the crude price was also helped by a bigger than expected weekly fall in US crude stockpiles of 2.2m barrels rather than 1m, and benefitted energy companies and helped lift stock markets. The FTSE 100 finished 96 points or 1.3% higher at 7662.5, with BP, Royal Dutch Shell and BHP Billiton among the leading risers, all up more than 3%."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/may/12/barnes-noble-bookstores-retail-amazon","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-12T06:00:23Z","webTitle":"Barnes & Noble: why it could soon be the bookshop's final chapter","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/12/barnes-noble-bookstores-retail-amazon","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/may/12/barnes-noble-bookstores-retail-amazon","fields":{"headline":"Barnes & Noble: why it could soon be the bookshop's final chapter","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"To the casual observer Barnes &amp; Noble in Manhattan’s Union Square seemed to be doing everything right last Thursday lunchtime: displays heaving with books; customers milling around; every table at the Starbucks on the third floor taken by customers; a creche full of excited children; magazine racks browsed. But appearances can be deceptive. America’s largest bookseller is in trouble. A quick chat with the “customers” suggests one reason why. “I get a coffee, take a seat, read the latest magazines,” said a man who gave his name as Buddy. Asked if he planned to purchase the car and engineering titles he was holding, Buddy replied flatly: “No.” Perhaps this is what it means to be a bricks-and-mortar retailer in 2018. It’s a feelgood customer experience and a showcase for online purchasing – but the sound of cash registers ringing? Not so much. Last week, Barnes &amp; Noble, the largest book retailer in the US, saw its stock price plunge nearly 8% just days after the New York Times published an editorial calling for the chain to be saved. “It’s depressing to imagine that more than 600 Barnes &amp; Noble stores might simply disappear,” wrote columnist David Leonhardt. “But the death of Barnes &amp; Noble is now plausible.” Once the dominant player in US book retailing , the chain, which ironically in its time put countless private, neighborhood booksellers out of business, is suffering as the new big beast, Amazon, swallows its business. Sales have been on the slide for 11 years; even online sales have fallen. Over the past five years, the company has lost more than $1bn in value. Dozens of stores have closed. A shake-up in February resulted in the loss of 1,800 full-time jobs. If Barnes &amp; Noble closes it will mark the death of the last major book chain in the US, leaving the field open to Amazon, which sells one out of every two books in the country, according to analysts. Closure is also likely to hurt publishers, who will become even more heavily reliant on Amazon. Big swaths of America will be left without a major bookstore. It’s not that Barnes and Noble hasn’t tried to innovate – “it’s been very creative in staying alive and surviving into today’s Walmart-and-Amazon dominated society,” said one employee, pointing to games and toys as one area of expansion. The company also pushed into technology, spending heavily to launch and market the Nook e-reader to compete with Amazon’s Kindle. But arguably innovation is where Barnes &amp; Noble went wrong. Other big booksellers have tackled Amazon’s onslaught by doing precisely the opposite – going back to basics and putting the books first. Take UK giant Waterstones, which was acquired last month for an undisclosed sum by the hedge fund Elliott Advisors. Chief executive James Daunt told the Guardian the company was succeeding by going back to “good old-fashioned bookselling” and is “very much in expansion mode”. Analyst Neil Saunders of GlobalData Retail said one difference between Waterstones and Barnes &amp; Noble is that the UK chain is centered on high streets whereas the US chain tends to be centered on malls. It’s one thing, he says, to attract high street foot-traffic, another to get customers to drive to a mall for a book. Especially when America’s malls too are being swept away by the Amazon effect. “People may drop in for a browse but they won’t make a dedicated trip to a bookstore,” Saunders says. “They don’t have the need and they don’t have the time. The way people shop changed, and that’s been detrimental for Barnes &amp; Noble.” Saunders said Barnes &amp; Noble also slipped up with the Nook. It’s reported that the company lost $1.3bn on the device hoping to replicate Amazon’s success selling content for the Kindle. “That was a massive distraction for Barnes &amp; Noble that should now be abandoned,” Saunders said. “If you’re only using it to sell books, and there are a lot of other competitors in the market, it’s not a sensible strategy.” (The company withdrew the device in the UK in 2016). Nor, he continued, does it make sense to add new merchandise. “The stores just look like an enormous Aladdin’s cave of all sorts of random products, including departments selling CDs and DVDs that are never crowded. The stores themselves are too large for what they need and in the wrong locations.” In a letter to shareholders including the company’s 76-year-old founder and chairman, Leonard Riggio, activist investor Thomas Sandell warned that at around $500m, Barnes &amp; Noble, which still has more than 600 stores, was valued “unconscionably low”. The company, he argued, should be taken private and become part of a larger business, just as Whole Foods became part of Amazon. But as the crowd in Barnes &amp; Noble Union Square shows, online shopping doesn’t hold all the answers. This venue is host to some of the biggest book launches in the country. It was the first stop on Hillary Clinton’s book tour for her memoir What Happened. Michael Ondaatje and Michael Pollan will read there later this month. Manhattan is not a failing mall but customers everywhere still seem to want somewhere to read, browse and buy a coffee. Designer Carl Barnett said he’d noticed that the store could use an update but he still loved to visit. “The key is to offer an experience. A lot of stores are suffering, but it’s all about the mood and customer service and I’ve never not had a good experience here,” he said. Now if only he’d buy a book."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/may/09/hats-off-to-stockports-unsung-attractions","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-09T16:48:32Z","webTitle":"Hats off to Stockport’s unsung attractions | Brief letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/09/hats-off-to-stockports-unsung-attractions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/may/09/hats-off-to-stockports-unsung-attractions","fields":{"headline":"Hats off to Stockport’s unsung attractions","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"I read with interest Dave Simpson’s review (7 May) of Blossoms’ concert at The Plaza in Stockport, but was dismayed that my beloved Stockport County FC were described as “struggling”, coupled with hints that us Stopfordians have little “to sing about”.

Or 67","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A crisis of cosmic proportions is brewing: the universe is expanding 9% faster than it ought to be and scientists are not sure why. The latest, most precise, estimate of the universe’s current rate of expansion - a value known as the Hubble constant - comes from observations by the European Space Agency’s Gaia mission, which is conducting the most detailed ever three-dimensional survey of the Milky Way. The data has allowed the rate of expansion to be pinned down to a supposed accuracy of a couple of percent. However, this newest estimate stands in stark contradiction with an independent measure of the Hubble constant based on observations of ancient light that was released shortly after the Big Bang. In short, the universe is getting bigger quicker than it should be. The mismatch is significant and problematic because the Hubble constant is widely regarded as the most fundamental number in cosmology. “The fact the universe is expanding is really one of the most powerful ways we have to determine the composition of the universe, the age of the universe and the fate of the universe,” said Professor Adam Riess, at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, Maryland, who led the latest analysis. “The Hubble constant quantifies all that into one number.” In an expanding universe, the further away a star or galaxy is, the quicker it is receding. Hubble’s constant – proposed by Edwin Hubble in the 1920s – reveals by how much. So one approach to measuring it is by observing the redshifts of bright supernovae, whose light is stretched as the very space it is travelling through expands. A challenge, though, is pinpointing the exact distance of these stars. Riess, who shared the 2011 Nobel Prize for Physics for providing evidence that the expansion of the universe is accelerating, is part of a team focussed on developing ultra-precise methods for measuring distances. The latest Gaia observations have advanced this effort by identifying dozens of new Cepheid stars, which have the special feature that their light flickers at a rate that is directly linked to their brightness at source. So through observing the pulsations of these so-called standard candles, scientists can work out their original luminosity and, therefore, how far away they and their native galaxies are. The new data puts the Hubble constant at 73, which translates to galaxies moving away from us 73km per second faster for each additional megaparsec of distance between us and them (a megaparsec is about 3.3m light-years). However, a separate estimate of Hubble comes from observations of the Cosmic Microwave Background, relic radiation that allows scientists to calculate how quickly the universe was expanding 300,000 years after the big bang. “The cosmic microwave background is the light that is the furthest away from us that we can see,” said Riess. “It’s been travelling for 13.7bn years... and it’s telling us how fast the universe was expanding when the universe was a baby.” Scientists then use the cosmic equivalent of a child growth chart (a computational model that roughly describes the age and contents of the universe and the laws of physics) to predict how fast the universe should be expanding today. This gives a Hubble value of 67. Until recently, scientists had hoped that as measurements became more precise, this mismatch would narrow, but instead the difference has widened and the latest calculation gives a chance of only 1 in 7,000 of the discrepancy being down to chance. “If this continues to hold up we may be dealing with what we call new physics of the universe,” said Riess. What form might this take? One proposal is that dark energy, believed to be accelerating the expansion of the universe, is becoming more potent. Scientists are not sure why this would happen - since space is being stretched out, one might expect its strength to be diluted instead. Another possibility is that a fourth, not yet observed, variety of neutrino could have skewed calculations. Dark matter could also be to blame if it turns out to interact more with normal matter than current models predict. “I’m not in the business of ensuring that everything fits,” said Riess. “I think: ‘Ah this is very interesting’.” More prosaic explanations have also been put forward. John Peacock, professor of cosmology at the University of Edinburgh, said: “Beyond a certain level of complexity you have to be open to the possibility that there may be little assumptions that might not be quite right.” “I’m sticking with [a Hubble value of] 70 for the foreseeable future,” he added. The crisis in cosmology, as it was described a meeting of the American Physical Society last month, could soon be resolved through new measurements of the Hubble constant based on gravitational wave observations by the Ligo collaboration. “Within the next five years, we’ll probably nail this,” said Peacock."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/14/parents-carillion-childcare-collapse-nursery-provider","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-14T05:00:20Z","webTitle":"Why parents should fear childcare going the way of Carillion | Helen Penn","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/14/parents-carillion-childcare-collapse-nursery-provider","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/may/14/parents-carillion-childcare-collapse-nursery-provider","fields":{"headline":"Why parents should fear childcare going the way of Carillion","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Ask any parent of young children about what worries them financially, and childcare will likely be near the top of the list. Costs have risen seven times faster than wages in some parts of the country. Much of the political debate has therefore focused on how to pay for it: how many hours parents should get for free, and the extent to which government should be subsidising the costs. That’s an important question. But it’s wrong to focus on that to the exclusion of who is actually providing all this childcare. The collapse of the outsourcing giant Carillion earlier this year shone a fresh light on the extent of privatisation we’ve seen across some parts of the public sector. Childcare is no different. Twenty years ago, most state-funded childcare was either provided by local councils, or by the community nurseries that they funded through grants. Since then, the for-profit childcare market has burgeoned. Small community nurseries have struggled to cope with the shift away from government grants, towards giving subsidies directly to parents, which has created new risks for them. And the last Labour government introduced legislation that explicitly discouraged local councils from providing childcare if it could be left to the market. Today, the private sector accounts for 84% of childcare for children aged three and under, with a growing number of private nursery chains. As demand for childcare has grown, big companies have increasingly been muscling in. One recent market research conference discussed the “hot market” of childcare, and its investment opportunities. The marketing hype, the investment portfolios, the high expectations of prompt financial return: this is the uneasy business environment in which companies gamble on childcare profits. At the aforementioned conference, one leading portfolio investment company claimed to have a list of buyers from 45 countries seeking to invest in childcare. Private equity and foreign investment is becoming more significant, and the low pound and expanding government subsidies are likely to stoke interest further. What’s happened in the older care market should provide a cautionary tale. There has been a similar shift from the public to the private sector, and private equity has become an increasingly important player. Private equity funds have bought up large chains of care homes, and loaded them up with unsustainable debt. This led to the collapse of Southern Cross back in 2011, and more recently left Four Seasons on the brink of breakdown. We haven’t yet seen the collapse of a major nursery provider here. Other countries have. In Australia, ABC Learning – then one of the world’s largest private childcare providers – went into liquidation back in 2008 as a result of burdening itself with debt while chasing aggressive expansion. It was simply too big to fail: the Australian government had to provide a bailout of millions to keep the nurseries running until new buyers took over. Many of the big nursery chains operating here in the UK have ambitious expansion plans, which involve buying out and refinancing smaller nurseries. For example, Busy Bees has been involved in takeover and consolidation bids in Australia, Singapore and the Netherlands. It is also trying to attract Chinese investors and is launching a chain of nurseries in China. Nurseries collapsing is not the only risk. Another is the growth of an increasingly two-tier system, with access to the best childcare being limited to the richest families. The poorest-quality nurseries are already disproportionately found in the poorest areas. This may be further amplified by privatisation: the bigger chains have an explicit strategy of targeting “good quality residential areas” for expansion. In contrast, poorer areas tend to be dominated by smaller, short-lived nursery businesses. There is also an issue around size. The community nurseries of the 1980s and 1990s tended to be small – rarely larger than 60 children. It is not uncommon to find industrial-sized private-sector nurseries catering for more than 200 children, providing considerable economies of scale for their owners. Yet the research on young children in nurseries emphasises the importance of continuity, familiarity and consistency of care for very young children, and parents’ preferences for very local, stable provision.Ultimately, the government today sees childcare as a consumer market rather than a social good or a collective public service, with parents regarded as individual consumers buying childcare for themselves. Many nurseries are now owned by companies that manage them at considerable remove. There is often no expectation that parents will be able to influence the way nurseries are run or financed, or make suggestions about their daily routines, other than to voice concerns or complaints relating to their own individual child. It’s right we invest significant amounts of taxpayers’ money into childcare. But the reason for doing so is not just that parents can go back to work, but that through high-quality childcare and early education, children from disadvantaged backgrounds get a boost to their learning before they start school. Back when local councils directly funded nurseries, there was at least some democratic accountability for how public money was being spent. But now that subsidies are channelled via individual parents, there is too little oversight for how £6bn of taxpayer money is being used to help give children the best possible start in life. Instead, the care of young children has increasingly become a commodity to be bought and sold. • Helen Penn is an academic and writer specialising in childcare and early education"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"us-news/live/2018/may/09/gina-haspel-confirmation-hearing-donald-trump-live-updates","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-09T16:44:59Z","webTitle":"CIA pick Gina Haspel repeatedly declines to say if torture techniques are 'immoral' – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2018/may/09/gina-haspel-confirmation-hearing-donald-trump-live-updates","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/live/2018/may/09/gina-haspel-confirmation-hearing-donald-trump-live-updates","fields":{"headline":"CIA pick Gina Haspel repeatedly declines to say if torture techniques are 'immoral' – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Gina Haspel, Donald Trump’s nominee to lead the CIA, defended her record and pledged that under her leadership the agency would “never, ever” restart the brutal interrogation program like the one she helped run in 2002. But after a nearly three-hour confirmation hearing on Wednesday morning, the fate of her confirmation remains uncertain. Several prominent senators have already indicated that they are likely to object over her role in the CIA’s use of torture and it’s unclear if her testimony was enough to overcome their objections. During the hearing, Democrats on the committee sought to extract commitments from Haspel, who, if confirmed, would be the first woman to run the agency, while Republicans widely praised her years of service. This afternoon she will testify again before the committee in a closed-door hearing, where senators can ask her questions related to classified intelligence. Haspel vowed that under her leadership the CIA would not restart an interrogation program that employed torture techniques. “I would not allow CIA to undertake activity that I thought was immoral, even if it was technically legal. I would absolutely not permit it.” In exchanges with senators, Haspel was both defensive and evasive when pressed to expound on her views on the morality of the CIA’s use of torture. She repeatedly refused to characterize the program in hindsight as “immoral”. “My moral compass is strong,” she said. Asked if she agreed with Donald Trump’s assessment that torture is an effective means of obtaining information, Haspel said: “I don’t believe that torture works.” But she added that valuable information was gained from the al-Qaida detainees who were subjected to the interrogation techniques. Haspel refused to say that she would inform the committee if Trump asked her for a pledge of loyalty, insisting the scenario was unlikely. She said she agreed with the conclusion that Russia interfered with the US presidential election to help elect Trump. Haspel disputed the assessment that she is the unidentified person referenced as the head of the agency’s interrogation program in a book by longtime CIA lawyer John Rizzo. “I did not run the interrogation department,” she said. Democrats accused Haspel of refusing to declassify sensitive information about her career that might be damaging to her nomination buts he dismissed their calls for more transparency. Read David Smith’s full report: Burr adjourns the hearing by telling Haspel that she “may in fact be the most qualified nominee ever nominated for this role” and says she’s poised to “crack” the glass ceiling at the agency. Senator Marco Rubio, a Republican who sits on the committee, announced before the hearing’s conclusion that he will support Haspel. “Gina Haspel is a career intelligence officer who has served over 30 years with the CIA, and combated both communist threats and terrorist organizations like Al-Qaeda and ISIS. She is perhaps the most highly qualified person ever nominated for this crucial national security position. Her nomination has the support of six former CIA Directors who have served under presidents of both parties, and I look forward to her rapid confirmation on the Senate floor,” Rubio said in a statement. “I implore my colleagues not to play politics with this essential nomination, and to consider what message that would send to the thousands of patriotic personnel serving our nation at agencies in Washington and around the globe, as well as what message that would send to our adversaries and those who seek us harm.” Burr and Warner are making their closing remarks. There will be a closed hearing after this public one ends, where senators can ask questions related to classified information. A brief heated exchange erupted between Warner and Cotton, who criticized his colleagues remarks. Cotton interrupted Warner as he delivered his concluding comments and Burr hit the gavel to silenece him. Senator Jack Reed, a Democrat of Rhode Island, asks what she would say to the president if he asked for a personal pledge of loyalty. “My only loyalty is to the American people and the constitution of the United States. I am honor-bound,” she says. Reed asked if she was approached by Trump in such a way, if she would inform Congress. Haspel does not agree to do so. “I don’t believe that such a circumstance would ever occur,” she says, even though former FBI director James Comey - who was abruptly fired exactly one year ago - testified before Congress that Trump had sought to extract a pledge of loyalty from him. Senator Kamala Harris, a Democrat from California and a former prosecutor, asks Haspel whether she believes torture techniques are immoral. Haspel sidesteps the question each time. Harris asks for a yes or no and she will not give it. Harris: “Do you believe in hindsight that those techniques were immoral?” Haspel: “I think I’ve answered the question.” Harris: “No you have not.” Does torture work, Harris asks. “I don’t believe that torture works,” she says but doesn’t directly but then says the program led to the extraction of “valuable information” and its unknowable whether “enhanced interrogation techniques played a role in that”. Senator Tom Cotton, a staunchly conservative Republican from Arkansas and an Iraq war veteran, used his time to critique his colleagues comments and views. He asks how many Democrats would support Haspel if she was nominated by Barack Obama. He jokes that she does not have to answer. Cotton, who boasts a close relationship with Trump, was reportedly considered as a possible replacement for Mike Pompeo, the former CIA director who now serves as Secretary of State. Next up is Senator Joe Manchin, a West Virginia Democrat whose vote may be pivotal to her confirmation. Haspel sat down with Manchin this week, and on Wednesday morning she hugged the Democrat upon entering the room earlier, which some observers interpreted as a positive sign. His praise for her – Manchin said he boasts about the clandestine service to his West Virginia voters – suggest that just may be the case. Asked by Maine Independent Angus King whether she agrees with the Intelligence Community’s 2017 assessment that Russia meddled in the US presidential election to help Donald Trump win the US presidency, Haspel says: “I do.” In an exchange, Heinrich presses Haspel to say whether torturing terrorism suspects in post-9/11 period was morally right. She does not answer directly but defends her “moral compass”. “We should hold ourselves to a stricter moral standards, and I would never allow CIA to be involved in coercive interrogations,” she tells him. “Where was that moral compass at the time?” he replies. “In all of my assignments I have conducted myself honorably and in accordance with US law. My parents raised me right. I know the difference between right and wrong,” she replies. Haspel also says that in hindsight she would not support the order to destroy the tapes in 2005. Senator Susan Collins, a Republican from Maine, asks what she would do if Trump ordered her to waterboard a high value suspect “Senator, I would advise - I do not believe the president would ask me to do that,” she says, taking a long pause. “But we have today in the US government other US government entities that conduct interrogations. ... CIA is not the right place to conduct interrogations.” “CIA does not today conduct investigations. We never did historically and we’re not getting back in that business.” Senator Martin Heinrich, a Democrat from New Mexico, follows up, saying she did not answer the question about what she would do if Trump ordered her to waterboard a detainee. “I would not restart under any circumstances an interrogation program at CIA, under any circumstances,” she says. Haspel gets defensive during a testy back-and-forth with Democratic senator Ron Wyden, a strident opponent of her nomination. “After 9/11, I didn’t look to go to the Swiss desk. I stepped up. I was not on the sidelines,” she said. Feinstein asks whether Haspel is the person, referenced in a book by longtime senior CIA lawyer John Rizzo, who “has previously run the interrogation program”. “Is that you?” Feinstein asked. Haspel: “I’m so pleased you asked me that question.” Feinstein: “A yes or no will do.” Haspel: “No.” Haspel emphatically denies that she is that person in the book and says that a correction has been issued. The book has been the source of much debate. Rizzo initially reaffirmed his contention in the book that Haspel “ran” the interrogation program but he later walked that back. In an email to the Daily Beast’s Spencer Ackerman last month, Rizzo said: “After reading your story, and upon further reflection, I want to make clear that I never intended to suggest in my book that Gina Haspell was in charge of CIA’s interrogation program. She was not. I have nothing further to say on this subject other than to stress that I fully support her nomination to be CIA Director.” Haspel points to a story in the Washington Post that explains the contention over the book. Read that here. Haspel also declines to answer a question from Feinstein about whether she oversaw the waterboarding of Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri at the black site prison in Thailand. Haspel says the answer is classified. Feinstein also asked: “Were you an advocate for destroying the (CIA interrogation) tapes?” Haspel replied: “Senator, I absolutely was an advocate if we could within and conforming to US law.” Next up is Senator Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat from California, and one of the members of the committee who has pressed the CIA for more transparency from the CIA over her history. Feinstein said the CIA declassified only select pieces of information while keeping damaging parts “under wraps”. Feintstein says she likes Haspel personally but finds the hearing to be “probably the most difficult hearing in my more than two decades that I have ever sat in”. Senator James Risch, a Republican of Idaho, spends the majority of his five minutes for questions praising Haspel and recalling meeting her in the field. He does eventually ask a question about the tension between the various agencies within the intelligence community and the congressional committees charged with overseeing them. Warner: With the benefit of hindsight, do you believe the interrogation program was consistent with American values?” Haspel doesn’t answer directly and Warner follows up, pressing her to reveal her “moral code.” She responds again: “I would never, ever take CIA back to an interrogation program. First of all, CIA follows the law. We followed the law then, we follow the law today. I support the law. I wouldn’t support a change in the law.” Warner comes back – what would you do if the president asks you to do something you find “morally objectionable”? Haspel: “My moral compass is strong. I would not allow CIA to undertake activity that I thought was immoral even if it was technically legal. I would absolutely not permit it.” Warner: So you wouldn’t follow the president’s order? Haspel: “No, I believe that CIA must undertake activities that are consistent with American values.” Burr begins the round of questioning by asking Haspel to explain her role in the destruction of videotapes that depicted brutal interrogations. Haspel maintained that the decision to destroy the recordings was made by her boss at the time, Jose Rodriguez, who was the director of the agency’s clandestine service. “Mr Rodriguez has been very up front on a number of occasions publicly that he and he alone made the decision to destroy the tapes. I would also make it clear that I did not appear on the tapes as has been mischaracterized in the press.” She said a review found that there was no legal requirement to keep the tapes. She said multiple investigations concluded that she was not at fault and her actions and my decisions were consistent with my obligations as an agency officer. Haspel: “I have views on this issue and I want to be clear. Having served in that tumultuous time, I can offer you my personal commitment, clearly and without reservation, that under my leadership CIA will not restart such a detention and interrogation program.” Haspel is now under oath and will deliver her prepared remarks. “I am here because I have been nominated to lead the extraordinary men and women at the Central Intelligence Agency –men and women who are our country’s silent warriors”. The career spy introduces herself to the committee as a Kentucky-raised military brat. “I don’t have any social media accounts, but otherwise I think you will find me to be a typical middle-class American.” After a globetrotting career as an undercover spy, very little is actually known about Haspel’s life. The CIA has declassified specific details about her life. Warner presses Haspel about how she would react if Trump pushed her to “carry out some morally questionable behavior that might seem to violate a law or treaty”. How will you respond if a secret DOJ opinion authorizes such behavior and gives you a “get out of jail free” card? On that day, if you are ordered to take actions that are inconsistent with American values, will you say “yes” and follow orders? Will you keep Congress in the dark?” ... This President seems incapable or unwilling to accept facts that might contradict his views or his policy preferences. Indeed, there have been those in the Administration – even some of the President’s own appointees – who have been attacked for telling a truth in public that contradicts the White House narrative. You simply cannot allow the prospects of such attacks to dissuade you in any way. Trump has said that torture and in particular, a technique known as waterboarding, “absolutely works”. He has also suggested that the US should “take out” the families of terrorists in order to win the fight against ISIS. Senator Mark Warner, the vice chair of the committee and a Democrat from Virginia, says in his opening remarks: Many people – and I include myself in that number – have questions about the message the Senate would be sending by confirming someone for this position who served as a supervisor in the Counter Terrorism Center during the time of the Rendition, Detention, and Interrogation program. Ms. Haspel has acknowledged the history of the program. She has stated that the law has changed and that the RDI program is no longer legal. She has committed to upholding the law. I appreciate that, but it is not enough. The secrecy inherent in the CIA’s work demands that the Director honor and follow the law – particularly in the dark spaces where the IC often operates, and when the glaring light of public scrutiny is nonexistent. No one should get credit simply for agreeing to follow the law—that’s the very least we should expect from any nominee, and certainly from the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. Burr, a Republican from North Carolina, offers high praise for Haspel in his opening remarks: “You are without a doubt the most qualified person the President could have chosen to lead the CIA and the most prepared nominee in its 70 year history.” He seeks to neutralize criticism about her record and background: “Some may seek to turn this hearing into a trial about a long-shuttered program. This hearing is not about programs already addressed by executive order, legislation, and the court of law. It’s about the woman seated in front of us.” “Those who have issues with programs or operations conducted years ago should address those concerns and their questions to presidents to former presidents, former directors, and former attorney generals. This hearing is about how you’ll lead the central intelligence agency into the future not how you’ve faithfully executed missions in the past.” Intelligence committee chairman Richard Burr opens the hearing with a stern warning to protesters: “I will not be lenient. If there are outbursts you will be cleared from the room and it will be done immediately. “So,” Burr tells protesters who might plan to interrupt the hearing, “for the benefits of members and for the benefit of our witness, do it fast, do it early and be gone.” Gina Haspel has arrived in 216 Hart for her confirmation hearing. She will be introduced by former members of the Senate Intelligence Committee Evan Bayh, a Democrat of Indiana, and Saxby Chambliss, Republican from Georgia and former vice chairman of the panel. Scenes from inside and outside the hearing room where Haspel is due to appear shortly. Smith reports that the the Code Pink protestors chant: “Don’t reward torture! Don’t reward torture!” “A US Capitol police officer replies: “You are all under arrest.” Scuffles break out as police start removing protesters.” Gina Haspel, Donald Trump’s nominee to lead the Central Intelligence Agency, is set to appear before the Senate intelligence committee for her confirmation hearing at 9.30am in what is expected to be a public reckoning of a dark chapter in American history. Whether Haspel is confirmed is likely to depend on how well she responds to a battery of pointed questions from Senators who are demanding more details about her time overseeing a secret, post-9/11 detention site in Thailand where terror suspects were brutally interrogated using techniques widely condemned as torture. Senators will also ask her to explain her support for destroying videotapes that documented the interrogations of the inmates. In excerpts of prepared remarks released ahead of the hearing, Haspel planned to tell senators that she would not allow such a program to be re-started under her leadership. I understand that what many people around the country want to know about are my views on CIA’s former detention and interrogation program. I have views on this issue, and I want to be clear. Having served in that tumultuous time, I can offer you my personal commitment, clearly and without reservation, that under my leadership CIA will not restart such a detention and interrogation program. Haspel, 61, is a 33-year veteran of the agency where she currently serves as the acting director. If confirmed, Haspel would be the first woman to lead the CIA, but her confirmation rests on a divided Senate. Despite strong support from former top members of the intelligence community, her record has drawn fierce condemnation and on Wednesday more than 100 former US ambassadors who severed under Republican and Democratic administrations signed a letter opposing her nomination. Haspel is reported to have offered to withdraw her nomination, but was reassured by presidential aides that she had the admisnrtation’s full support. The hearing is expected to be contentious and perhaps may yet hold a few surprises. The New York Times is reporting that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the architect of the 9/11 attacks who was tortured by the CIA, has asked a military judge at Guantánamo Bay for permission to provide “six paragraphs” of information about Haspel with the committee. The Guardian will follow the hearing live with oberservations from inside the hearing from Washington Bureau chief David Smith and analysis from world affairs editor Julian Borger. To read more about what to expect from today’s hearing, Borger has the details here And here’s more about the administration’s support for Haspel And here’s a bit more background about the would-be first female boss of the CIA by Guardian reporter Amanda Holpuch And here’s opinion writer James Cavallaro on why Haspel is “perfect” for the job."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/may/12/embrace-the-90s-avoid-the-alexa-the-dos-and-donts-of-festival-fashion","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-12T08:45:25Z","webTitle":"Embrace the 90s!

Don’t: Go the full Woodstock Nineteen sixty-nine is a long time ago. Enough time, you might think, for the Woodstock look to be to solely the territory of BBC4 documentaries and those who actually, you know, live in Woodstock. To be clear, a festival in 2018 is not an excuse to pretend you saw Hendrix do the Star-Spangled Banner, or wear flowers in your hair. Fringing and headbands are not OK. And anyone who commences body painting – unless they’re Keith Haring and Grace Jones at the Paradise Garage, obvs – is seriously in breach of the fashion commandments. Do: Explore the merch stall The unwritten rule that you don’t wear the band’s T-shirt to the gig has been broken by fashion – soz, musos. Now, merch is the statement you want to make in your field of choice. It can take the form of caps – Kendrick Lamar’s What Happens on Earth Stays on Earth – or T-shirts. Bieber’s are a merch classic, and we can only imagine what Beyoncé and Jay-Z will bring come their tour in June. Don’t: Try to emulate a stage lewk So, there’s you. You booked your ticket ages ago and had the date marked in your diary for months. Then there’s Rihanna/Lady Gaga/Gwen Stefani/PJ Harvey/delete as appropriate. They arrive at the site by osmosis, or possibly a helicopter, and remain backstage until they perform, unscathed by the surroundings, in anything from a dress made of mirrors to a perspex headpiece with Hellraiser vibes. Last year, Rihanna wore a Gucci chainmail bodysuit to Coachella, just to hang out in her trailer. Imagine trying to use a Shewee in one of those. Do: Be more Kate Moss Sure, in other ways, Moss’s lifestyle is not exactly easy to attain: the Count boyfriend, the holiday schedule, the house in the Cotswolds. But her festival look is by numbers – in a good way. Moss knows that when you’re out in the wilds, you should stick to the classics: jean cut-offs, sunglasses, wellies and a biker jacket. It may not be the height of innovation but is the best thing when you’re battling an easterly gale and trying to keep the lager in your cardboard cup unharmed. Goals. Don’t: Try to do Alexa Alexa Chung is the patron saint of modern festival dressing. She has done it all: PVC trousers, slip dresses and over-the-knee socks, often with a Barbour, usually with a bit of side eye. These are clothes that suit someone walking through the backstage area pretending they don’t notice photographers. They are not the kind of thing to wear when “having a wash” translates to using a couple of wet wipes in your wonky tent. Don’t: Raid your dressing-up box Wings seem to have faded from fashion, but the vestiges of the child’s dressing-up-box remain. Paris Hilton has a lot to answer for: her Coachella look last year involved a rainbow frock and cat ears. And it goes without saying, no Native American headdresses, bindis or anything that can be perceived as cultural appropriation. Not in a festival, not IRL, not anywhere. Not OK.

He was killed by police, but it was called “misadventure”. I started making paintings about him – I didn’t plan to, but I painted his burial. I was doing a nightclub painting and took out the DJ and put a coffin in instead. He was an electrician, and a very good boxer. After they killed him they chucked him on the floor of the van and the social worker saw them sitting with their feet on him. I couldn’t stop doing paintings of Winston. They take up all your energy. I didn’t realise how draining they were. The show’s title piece shows a Rastafarian being handcuffed on a beach. What’s it about? I started painting Porthtowan beach [in Cornwall] and I said: “I’m going to draw black people on the beach.” But it was too calm, it needed a punch, so I used one of my older paintings Three Wicked Men, which Peter Doig bought for the Tate, to give it a kick up the arse. It was like superimposing something from London on to a beach in Cornwall. I painted Three Wicked Men in 1982 – the title was a reggae record at the time about a businessman, a policeman and a politician. How did Peter Doig become a fan of your work? Peter saw my Royal College MA show in 1983 and really liked it. He was then a student at Central Saint Martins. He saw the odd exhibition when I was in group shows in the 90s. Anne Walmsley, who wrote the book The Caribbean Artists Movement 1966-1972, met up with Peter in Trinidad six years ago where they discussed my work. In 2015 he told me he would like to show my work at [his London gallery] Tramps and in New York. For this new show, he and the show’s co-curator Matthew Higgs stayed with me in Cornwall for two days looking at 40 years of paintings. What are your memories of the London reggae scene in the 1980s? I used to go to Phebes, a club in Dalston at the bottom of my road. It’s now big posh luxury flats. I’d go to the disco bit upstairs first and leave there about 1am and [soundsystem operator] Jah Shaka would be in the basement with a mono system. The people who followed Jah Shaka in those days, some would come in robes looking like African princes. Shaka would get his first record on, get a huge bag of weed out, light up and away we go. What do you have to say about the Windrush scandal? It’s disgusting what’s happening. The ones getting all this rough treatment are probably the hardest working, as they never left this country and now in their 80s they want to go back and see where they’re from and they’re treated like shit. But that’s the Conservative party, it’s full of nasty people – Brexiters, Boris Johnson, Michael Gove. They are racist, but they’re smarter now. The generation born here, they’re not so radical, they don’t protest, so the government is getting away with a lot of stuff. Were the impressionists and cubists a major influence on your work? When I painted the landscape St Just in 1979 I was in love with Monet. I did my degree at Central Art School and we’d literally go to Paris three or four times a year – you’d go see the Monets and come back to your studio. Him and Cezanne made a big impression on me. When I started I was quite cubistic, but the cubists got their stuff from Africa anyway. Picasso just took it and ran with it. How has living in Cornwall influenced your work? The light down here is brilliant. It’s like painting in Italy, where I lived for two years. I moved here in 2016, so Cornwall hasn’t really influenced my work yet, I’m still into the London thing. But it’s got the best coast in the country – the beaches are the closest thing to the West Indies. On camping trips there in the late 80s and early 90s I remember children staring like they’d never seen black people before. Has it changed much? Yes, Cornwall’s changed a lot. Back then you could hardly even get international cuisine. You’d be lucky if you asked for spaghetti and they knew what you were talking about, but it’s a more dynamic culture now. You don’t find a lot of people of colour here – when I tell people I’ve moved here they say, “Why? There’s no black people there!” My partner comes from an arty family and they went to Cornwall in the 1950s when people like Barbara Hepworth and Ben Nicholson were in St Ives. Even [Mark] Rothko lived in Cornwall. Back then, even if you were a Londoner they’d look at you as foreign!"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"books/2018/may/16/cringeworthy-melissa-dahl-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-16T06:30:41Z","webTitle":"Cringeworthy by Melissa Dahl review – why feeling awkward is good for us\r\n\r\n","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/16/cringeworthy-melissa-dahl-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/may/16/cringeworthy-melissa-dahl-review","fields":{"headline":"Cringeworthy by Melissa Dahl review – why feeling awkward is good for us\r\n\r\n","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"I read part of this book in somebody else’s reserved seat on an overbooked train; do train companies have any idea of the anxiety they cause when they suddenly announce that all seat reservations are suspended? As each stop triggered another mortifying conversation about seats, the book explained what was going on in our brains to make the situation feel so painful, why that matters so much to us and what we can learn from it. Melissa Dahl is an American science journalist who has been writing about psychology for 10 years, and her book, about the very specific phenomenon of awkwardness, “began as an attempt to permanently banish the feeling from my life with science!” Like all good scientists, though, she has changed her opinion based on the evidence she collected. Dahl now seeks out and embraces awkwardness, and she thinks that we all should, too. Readers of popular psychology will know by now that we social apes have evolved to find social acceptance critically important. Dean Burnett’s latest book, The Happy Brain, for example, explains why survival within the group has been more important in our evolution than survival in the environment; but Dahl goes further. Isolation “is damaging today too, even without the threat of hungry sabre-toothed tigers”, she writes. Loneliness “can increase a person’s risk of death by 26% – comparable to the health risk posed by obesity”. Babies become self-conscious at the age of about two (scientists learned by sticking Post-it notes on their foreheads and showing them mirrors). And embarrassment – even watching other people embarrass themselves – seems to trigger some of the same processes in the brain as physical pain. We’d be forgiven for avoiding embarrassment at any cost – and some people, with social anxiety disorders, do. But Dahl argues that awkwardness can teach us all sorts of lessons. She offers several convincing examples. Couples who drift into relationship markers such as marriage are less happy than those who discuss each step carefully, for instance: “Having the awkward conversation you’re dreading is often worthwhile.” When job adverts do not specifically state that pay is negotiable, women are far less likely than men to bite the bullet and negotiate a better salary. A 2014 campaign by the charity Scope found that “about two thirds of Britons surveyed said that they felt awkward or uncomfortable around disabled people”. One-fifth of 18 to 34-year-olds “said that they’d purposely avoided interacting with a disabled person because it made them feel so uncomfortable”. This avoidance is clearly a form of discrimination. And, as Dahl notes, some people do not have the privilege of avoiding awkward conversations about race, for example. She writes about the “irreconcilable gap” between the version of us we think we project and the version that other people see, and describes how sometimes it is useful to have a critical friend to point this out. “When those two yous collide in a Skype video chat, revealing that you are having a weirder hair day than you thought, it’s disappointing. When these yous collide in the context of discussing something like racism, it’s sickening … But wouldn’t you rather know when there’s a little racism stuck in your teeth?” She talks to the comedian W Kamau Bell, whose good friend called him out on a joke he had made about Condoleezza Rice that seemed to her racist and sexist. Instead of reacting defensively, he “sort of sat in the awkwardness and leaned into it, and then eventually could very clearly hear that she was right …” If only more people could respond as he did. Dahl and Bell agree about “the power of awkward conversations”. She takes up improv, appears in a show called Mortified, investigates a Reddit channel all about “cringe”, and pays a stranger for a hug. Through this, she learns about the psychological benefits of the bonding qualities of embarrassment; the difference between cognitive and compassionate empathy; and that some situations are too cringeworthy to bear. Dahl is exceptionally good at describing emotions and the visceral physical sensations that often accompany them, and on the whole her personal anecdotes and her more scientific investigations are pertinent and penetrating. Cringeworthy offers several sensible pointers for readers, perhaps on trains, who would like to overcome awkwardness. But the most passionate advice is to be “grateful for this odd little emotion and the power it has to connect us … There will always be awkwardness, and the only way to keep it from isolating us is if we start cringing together.” • Cringeworthy: A Theory of Awkwardness is published by Bantam.

They’re usually variations on a theme – “Millennials have no money”; “Young people are addicted to social media/sexting/long-form TV drama” – but this piece stood out. It was about how American millennials are signing up to $600 etiquette classes to, apparently, help them learn social skills they may not have developed in a life attached to a screen. $600! I heard my generation was full of squanderers and spendthrifts, but this really does take the avocado. Perhaps the people taking these classes already come from wealth and are – I believe this is the technical term – fancy-schmancy. Such people may well think the proper way to fold a napkin could earn them social currency at a dinner party, but those people are clearly not preparing for my dinner parties at which the only napkins have Papa John’s emblazoned on them. It’s not that I wouldn’t like to throw an old-school dinner party, totally unnecessary crockery and all, but it’s tricky in a cramped, shared place. If people are still enamoured of set rules for social interaction, then perhaps it’s time someone gave them an update, and maybe that person could be me. I could undercut the $600 business with my own cheaper etiquette enterprise, in which I advise young people at shared dinners which jam jar to drink out of and when. Instead of a waiter showing you a bottle before opening it, I could show an iPad: here at the new dinner party, devices aren’t banned, they’re encouraged, integrated seamlessly into the parlour experience. Who needs charades when you have a YouTube compilation of toddlers being the absolute worst? And rather than place cards for guests, labels are written in emojis. “I think that might be you, John,” says a meek guest to another, pointing to one with a purple aubergine on it. It’ll be a comedy of manners for the modern age. Eat your heart out, Richard Curtis. Of course, a modern knees-up doesn’t immediately equal qualified adult. For that there will need to be sound financial decision-making, and thinking about shares in terms of the Stock Exchange, not just Facebook interactions. I have a long way to go, and am too old to qualify for the £10k the government should offer 25-year-olds (according to the Resolution Foundation) to start a business or pension.

Prosecutors in Sicily, acting with Britain’s National Crime Agency (NCA), announced the capture of the notorious Eritrean human trafficker Medhanie Yehdego Mered, 35, in Khartoum in June 2016, hailing it as “the arrest of the year”. But within hours close friends said the detained man was in fact Medhanie Tesfamariam Berhe, a 29-year-old refugee and former dairy worker. Further evidence from Berhe’s family, Facebook account and even Mered’s wife, Lidya Tesfu, has since confirmed the view that Italian prosecutors have the wrong man. Berhe’s defence lawyer, Michele Calantropo, flew last month to Sweden, where Tesfu lives with her son – who is listed in the Swedish population registry as Raei Yehdego Mered, and is believed by authorities to be Mered’s first child. “We took a sample of saliva from the trafficker’s wife and son and crossed it with that of the detained man,” Calantropo said. “The result leaves no room for doubt: the man in prison is not the father of the child, and consequently is not the trafficker Mered.” The DNA evidence reinforces the results of an earlier test on Berhe’s mother, Meaza Zerai Weldai, 59, who travelled to Palermo from the Eritrean capital, Asmara, last October. Analysis showed she was the mother of the detained man. It was also reported last year that Mered had been in jail in the United Arab Emirates, on charges of using a forged passport, at the time Italian prosecutors travelled to Sudan to arrest the suspect they believed was the people-smuggler. A recent documentary by the Swedish public broadcaster SVT in collaboration with Guardian reporters revealed the trafficker known as “the General” is currently living in Uganda, spending his substantial earnings in nightclubs. Despite now overwhelming evidence to the contrary, Italian prosecutors continue to insist the man captured in Khartoum is the real smuggler – despite not being able to find a single witness to testify against him. The NCA said it could not comment on a continuing case. Italian prosecutors also declined to comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/sep/14/serial-clevelands-criminal-court-system-podcasts-of-the-week","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-09-14T10:23:07Z","webTitle":"Serial takes on Cleveland’s criminal court system – podcasts of the week","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/sep/14/serial-clevelands-criminal-court-system-podcasts-of-the-week","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/sep/14/serial-clevelands-criminal-court-system-podcasts-of-the-week","fields":{"headline":"Serial takes on Cleveland’s criminal court system – podcasts of the week","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Picks of the week Dr Death The makers of last year’s disturbing hit Dirty John have come up with another dark podcast about a dangerous doctor.

From 2017, we have been investigating the impact of knife crime upon Britain’s young people and exposing the myths that surround it with the Beyond the Blade project. The story of knife crime among the young isn’t one of angels and demons. It’s a story of kids, some of whom have made bad choices. Choices that may have left other kids just like them dead, and families and communities to mourn. Trying to understand why they made the choices they did is not an indulgence – it’s a necessity. In this new series of podcasts, we visited groups of parents, key support workers and young people from around the country - real people doing real work across the country to turn back the tide. They have allowed us to listen to, and record, conversations they’re having within their own communities about knife crime.

You can’t decorate a place to make it a nice place to live.” He is far from alone. Most millennials would need more than two hands to count the number of homes they have lived in since university – one friend of mine has lived in 25 places since she graduated. It is only natural that this perpetual state of instability will have an effect on their wellbeing. “I struggled with depression when I was younger and my living situation was a part of that,” Chapman says. Many young people, like Chapman, have resigned themselves to never owning a house. “It’s one of the things a lot of people are raised to believe is a ‘must’ in life, so to have that seem so impossible made me feel I’d failed in some way,” he says. A recent report from the Resolution Foundation predicted that one in three millennials will never own their own home, and half will be renting in their 40s. A third of those could still be doing so by the time they claim their pensions. A radical solution was proposed earlier this week: bridge the intergenerational gap between millennials and baby boomers by giving every 25-year-old £10,000. This “citizen’s inheritance” proposed by the Resolution Foundation would be funded by changes to inheritance tax and could help young people get on the property ladder. But, as some have pointed out, the average deposit in London is £80,000 and elsewhere it is £20,000. This, coupled with mounting student debts and an increase in insecure jobs, means that while it is a welcome suggestion, it doesn’t solve the problem of unaffordable deposits. Renting, of course, wouldn’t be so bad if tenants’ rights were better protected. As it stands, any landlord can evict a tenant with just two months’ notice after a fixed-term period under a section 21 agreement without providing any reason at all. Tenants are left to find the money to move, pay another lot of letting agents’ fees and get a deposit together. Last week, the mental health charity Mind launched a major housing campaign, with figures showing that nearly 79% of people with mental health problems say a housing situation has caused a mental health problem or made their mental health worse. “Housing and mental health are often linked,” says Paul Spencer, a policy manager at Mind. “The lack of security in rented accommodation can be damaging for mental health and involuntary home moves can have a particularly severe effect … For those of us with mental health problems, it may also mean you have to move away from mental health services or other services in your community that were supporting you.” Even if the strain on your mental health brought on by unstable renting hasn’t reached clinical levels, the effects of not having a permanent place to call home can still be profound. Katie Beswick, 34, is a university lecturer and lives in Devon. She left London, where she is grew up, because she couldn’t afford to live in the capital. She misses the community she had there, and found some of the anxiety issues she had previously had returned when she moved. “I can’t see my family when I want to, I can’t meet up with my friends. All of my contacts, my close friends, are in the south-east. It really upsets me,” she says. “I had a very dark period of time when I first moved and nobody I even remotely knew lived nearby … Simple stuff, like popping over to my mum’s for a cup of tea and a chat, is very calming, but here that isn’t possible.” Beswick’s tenancy feels stable-ish at the moment, and she has finally bought some of her own furniture (it was cheaper to rent an unfurnished place). But were she to face a notice to leave, she says she wouldn’t be able to afford it. “Poor mental health can occur when you move away from your family or other support networks,” says Paul Spencer. “Frequent moves can disrupt relationships with social support networks and make it harder to establish new ones, all the while increasing your sense of personal insecurity.” Tia Spencer, 21, is a bar worker from Manchester. She has just found out that her landlord is selling the shared house in which she has lived for the past three months, and she has to get out within weeks. Prior to this, Tia, who grew up in care, was homeless, and spent months sofa-surfing after being made unemployed. “I thought things would be good for a bit,” she says. “It’s disgusting. The landlord didn’t even tell us. We found a letter in the kitchen.” She has had depression and anxiety issues for a number of years, which became worse when she was forced to move. It is “draining”, Tia says. “You don’t even want to unpack. I can’t reach my long-term goals if I’m constantly worried about where I’m going to be living. It puts my life on hold.” Both Tia and Chapman say they would happily rent for life if renting were more stable, something the Resolution Foundation has recommended in the form of “indeterminate” tenancies, which have been introduced in Scotland. However, they don’t exist in England. “If I don’t buy a house I’m OK with it,” says Tia. “But I want kids and I’d want them to have stability. I hate moving around – I wouldn’t want them to go through it.” The number of privately rented households with children has tripled from 600,000 in 2003 to 1.8m in 2016. “We know that the private rented sector is the least secure and the lowest-quality tenure of all types, and that is obviously not a great place to bring up your kids,” says Lindsay Judge, a senior policy analyst at the Resolution Foundation. “The vast majority of private rented contracts are assured shorthold tenancies, so in theory you could have to get out with two months’ notice. That’s grim for anybody if you don’t want to leave, but if you have got children in school, your social networks, your support systems, these things are more challenging if you have got a family and you are trying to create a stable home.” Having to rent will naturally affect people’s family planning – and the profound disappointment of not being able to reach life goals such as having children is unlikely to have a positive effect on existing mental health conditions. “I’m not someone who has desperately craved children, but I do feel the choice has been taken away from me,” says Beswick. “I’m really angry at the government for allowing the housing market to spiral out of control to the point where a whole generation of us is stuck in a kind of extended adolescence.” There are, of course, some upsides to renting. “Having someone on hand if something goes wrong with the oven or boiler is fantastic,” says Laura Davies, a 27-year-old marketing manager living in Bournemouth with her partner, an assistant retail manager, and her seven-year-old son. That said, “Having a family in rented accommodation isn’t ideal,” she says. “With the real fear that you may one day have to up and leave the place your child calls home, it’s hard to feel you are truly settled … I have sleepless nights and anxiety-filled evenings stressing about what the future holds, housing-wise. I’m lucky that my child is really laid-back. But I’m always worried that my stress will affect him somehow.” She would love to own a home, but with nearly half the couple’s income going on rent, “I doubt that we ever will.” If they had a mortgage, she would be paying less every month than in rent. “But without any savings for a deposit, it leaves us always out of reach of owning.” Chapman says he is not able to save for a deposit, either. “At my age, you start thinking you need a bit more security, and the panic starts to set in,” he says. “When I’m older, I won’t have the energy to keep moving around all the time.” The Resolution Foundation’s report predicted an explosion in the housing benefits bill once millennials reach retirement, with it more than doubling in the worst-case scenario. “The figures are hitting home now,” says Judge. “And I think what will hit home much more in the next 10-15 years is this issue of pensioners in the private rented sector, because the concerns we have about families with children also apply to pensioners. Most people think it’s not a good idea if you’re elderly to have to leave your home with two months’ notice, to have to leave your local community where your support system is.” This will increase pressure on policymakers to make the private rented sector more fit for purpose over a lifetime. The Resolution Foundation’s recommendations of introducing indeterminate tenancies, stabilising rents to avoid the sudden spikes that currently affect tenants (balanced with rules that continue to allow landlords to charge market rents), as well as compulsory landlord registration, could go some way to making the sector more stable for renters. Mind’s campaign, too, is a positive step in highlighting the detrimental effect of poor housing on mental health. Shared ownership and help to buy have been pushed as solutions to unstable living. But these new-build homes are still not affordable for many people. Figures last year revealed that the help-to-buy scheme had been taken advantage of by thousands of high earners. The truth remains that, if you do find yourself able to buy a house, it might end up being hundreds of miles from the community you call home. In 2013, the mother of 26-year-old producer and writer Siana Bangura’s moved the family from Peckham in south-east London to Coventry in the West Midlands, as they were no longer able to afford the rocketing rents in the area. They rent a house privately and Bangura lives at home. “It makes me feel really frustrated and alienated. To be pushed out of where you are from is a lot,” she says. “I’d never identify as having experienced depression in the clinical sense. However, moving away from where I’m from and all my friends live, coupled with navigating life after university, all contributed to a very deep sadness,” she says. Her mum is a lot happier in Coventry, Bangura says. And although Bangura is freelance and not able to save at the moment, she is optimistic that she might be able to own somewhere in the West Midlands one day. “I was like, ‘I am going to give Coventry a chance because I have to.’ It’s been a humbling experience for me.” Like Bangura, millions of us are having to revise our expectations. But a lack of housing affordability isn’t just a question of cash – it has the potential to affect our sense of stability, our wellbeing and mental health, and our family planning. A home is so much more than a roof over your head."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/may/09/fka-twigs-says-uterus-surgery-knocked-my-confidence-as-a-woman","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-09T13:24:10Z","webTitle":"FKA twigs says uterus surgery 'knocked my confidence as a woman'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/09/fka-twigs-says-uterus-surgery-knocked-my-confidence-as-a-woman","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/may/09/fka-twigs-says-uterus-surgery-knocked-my-confidence-as-a-woman","fields":{"headline":"FKA twigs says uterus surgery 'knocked my confidence as a woman'","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The singer FKA twigs has said her “confidence as a woman was knocked” after laparoscopic surgery to have six fibroid tumours removed from her uterus. The 30-year-old Mercury prize nominee, whose real name is Tahliah Debrett Barnett, said she underwent the procedure in December. In a long Instagram post, she said she was a very private person and had been unsure whether she should share the news that she had been recovering from surgery. Fibroids are non-cancerous growths that develop in or around the womb. Around a third of women develop them during their lifetime, according to the NHS. The exact cause is not known, but they have been linked to the hormone oestrogen and usually develop during a woman’s reproductive years, commonly 16-50, when oestrogen levels are at their highest. Barnett said the tumours she had had removed were “pretty large”. She wrote that they were “the size of two cooking apples, three kiwis and a couple of strawberries. A fruit bowl of pain every day. The nurse said that the weight and size was like being six months pregnant.” She continued: “I tried to be brave but it was excruciating at times and to be honest I started to doubt if my body would ever feel the same again. I had surgery in December and I was so scared. Despite lots of love from friends and family I felt really alone and my confidence as a woman was knocked. “But today whilst dancing with Kelly at the choreography house, I felt like my strong self again for the first time in a while and it was magical. Thank you precious body for healing, thank you for reminding me to be kind to myself, you are a wonderful thing, now go create and be other once again.” Barnett said she was aware that a lot of women suffered from fibroid tumours and she “just wanted to say after my experience that you are amazing warriors and that you are not alone. you can get through this”. She ended her message by saying: “And with this I let go of the pain … love always twigs.” In October Barnett launched an Instagram magazine, AVANTgarden, which has tackled issues of race and beauty. Last summer the Twilight actor Robert Pattinson told the US radio host Howard Stern that he and the singer were “kind of” engaged, but more recent reports have suggested they are no longer together. When the pair’s relationship first came to light, Barnett said she received online abuse from his fans. “I am genuinely shocked and disgusted at the amount of racism that has been infecting my account the past week,” she tweeted at the time."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2018/may/08/syria-says-downs-two-israeli-missiles-near-damascus","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-08T21:46:23Z","webTitle":"Syria says it has downed two Israeli missiles near Damascus","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/08/syria-says-downs-two-israeli-missiles-near-damascus","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/08/syria-says-downs-two-israeli-missiles-near-damascus","fields":{"headline":"Syria says it has downed two Israeli missiles near Damascus","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Syrian air defences downed two Israeli missiles near Damascus, state media reported, after explosions were heard at a military base south of the capital. The report arrived soon after US president Donald Trump’s announcement that he would break with the Iran nuclear agreement, a move that has put the region on edge. Israel has warned of open war with Iran, saying it will not allow Tehran to establish a permanent military presence in Syria. Iranian forces have supported the Syrian government in a devastating civil war against insurgents. Syria’s state news agency, SANA, citing a military source on Tuesday, said: “Syrian air defences fired at two Israeli missiles and destroyed them in Kisweh,” an area known to be the location of an army base. The SANA report did not say how many missiles were fired or if others had hit targets in Syria. The news agency posted a video and a photo of flames rising in the night, which it said was caused by the downed missiles. Reuters news agency cited a commander loyal to Syrian president Bashar al-Assad as saying the Israeli strike caused no casualties. Israel did not immediately comment on the reported attack. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) said earlier on Tuesday that it had identified “irregular activity of Iranian forces in Syria” and had decided to unlock and ready bomb shelters in the north, where it shares a frontier with Syria. “Additionally, defence systems have been deployed and IDF troops are on high alert for an attack,” it said. “The IDF is prepared for various scenarios and warns that any aggression against Israel will be met with a severe response.” Israeli media reported that reservists had been recalled. In February, Israel said it had downed an armed Iranian drone it said had penetrated its airspace. Since then, Israel’s air force is believed to have struck Iranian targets operating in Syria several times, including a 9 April strike on Syria’s largest airbase, killing seven Iranians. Tehran, Israel’s archenemy, has vowed to retaliate. Israel’s prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu told his cabinet on Sunday that Iran has delivered advanced weapons to Syria “in order to attack us both on the battlefield and on the home front”. “We are determined to block Iran’s aggression against us even if this means a struggle. Better now than later,” he said. “We do not want escalation, but we are prepared for any scenario.” On Tuesday, Netanyahu expressed strong support for Trump’s announcement about the Iran nuclear agreement, saying it was a “bold decision today to reject the disastrous nuclear deal with the terrorist regime in Tehran”. Israel is believed to be the only nuclear-armed power in the Middle East, a claim it has never acknowledged."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/may/08/canada-trudeau-government-migrant-asylum-seekers","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-08T21:36:04Z","webTitle":"Canada: Trudeau government cools on asylum seekers as numbers from US rise","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/08/canada-trudeau-government-migrant-asylum-seekers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/08/canada-trudeau-government-migrant-asylum-seekers","fields":{"headline":"Canada: Trudeau government cools on asylum seekers as numbers from US rise","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Canadian government has sharpened its tone towards asylum seekers, warning that simply making it across the border is not a “free ticket” to Canada as the number of migrants crossing from the US continues to rise. Since the election of Donald Trump, growing numbers of asylum seekers have been entering Canada by foot, driven by fears over the US president’s approach to immigration. Last year more than 20,000 people entered Canada at remote, unguarded locations along the border, sometimes braving freezing temperatures, fields of waist-deep snow and icy ditches. Doing so allows migrants to skirt a longstanding pact that bars most refugee claimants in the US from applying for asylum in Canada. The flow of people shows little sign of abating, with 7,300 people entering Canada irregularly this year – more than double the number of those who made the journey in the first four months of 2017. This week, Canadian officials sought to tone down the welcoming image they have cultivated since coming to power, offering instead a blunt warning to those considering making the crossing into Canada. “Coming across the border in a way that seeks to circumvent the law or defy proper procedure is no free ticket to Canada,” Ralph Goodale, the country’s public safety minister, said on Monday. Officials said they believe that more than 90% of those entering Canada do not meet the criteria to be considered refugees. “They must prove they need Canada’s protection to keep them safe,” said Goodale. “Seeking asylum is not a shortcut to get around normal immigration rules and procedures.” After rising to a high of about 250 people a day earlier this year, the flow of migrants – many of them Nigerian nationals – has stabilised to around 70 or 80 per day, said Goodale. Canada’s immigration minister, Ahmed Hussen, said he would travel to Nigeria in the coming days to address the issue. Canada has been working with the United States to crack down on Nigerians who obtain tourist visas to the US solely for the purposes of walking into Canada to claim asylum, said Hussen. The federal government has been under pressure to stem the flow of migrants across the border. Last month the opposition Conservatives – who have linked the rise in asylum seekers to Trudeau’s viral tweet welcoming refugees – tabled a motion in the House of Commons urging the government to take “immediate action” on the issue. Canadians across the political spectrum are generally supportive of immigration, but the Conservative MP behind the motion argued that the issue, if not properly addressed, could cause Canadians to lose confidence in the system. “My concern is that if the government does not take steps to rectify [its] failure to manage our borders, we are going to rapidly see Canadians lose that social licence for immigration, because there will be a lack of faith in the ability of the government to ensure planned and orderly migration,” said Michelle Rempel. The New Democratic party and organisations such as Amnesty International have long urged the federal government to suspend the pact with the US that forces Canada to turn away most asylum seekers who attempt to enter the country at official border crossings. Halting the Safe Third Country Agreement would allow asylum seekers to make claims at official ports of entry, reducing the dangers faced by migrants and allowing Canada better control over the process, they argue. The province of Quebec – where the bulk of asylum seekers have arrived after crossing into Canada from the US – has called for more resources to help with the increase in refugee claimants. David Heurtel, Quebec’s immigration minister, said last month: “This is not about money. This is about saying that Quebec can do its part, but our resources are completely saturated and we can’t do more.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/may/08/debbie-abrahams-loses-labour-frontbench-role-amid-bullying-claims","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-08T19:19:46Z","webTitle":"Debbie Abrahams loses Labour frontbench role amid bullying claims","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/may/08/debbie-abrahams-loses-labour-frontbench-role-amid-bullying-claims","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/may/08/debbie-abrahams-loses-labour-frontbench-role-amid-bullying-claims","fields":{"headline":"Debbie Abrahams loses Labour frontbench role amid bullying claims","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The Labour frontbencher Debbie Abrahams has been sacked from the shadow cabinet after an investigation into workplace bullying. The shadow work and pensions secretary, who had been suspended, has now been referred to Labour NEC’s disputes committee over the allegations. A party spokesman said: “After a thorough party investigation into allegations of workplace bullying, Debbie Abrahams has been referred to the NEC disputes committee. She has been relieved of her post as shadow work and pensions secretary.” The Guardian understands that multiple complainants came forward, supported by witnesses, and that the investigation found the MP had engaged in a pattern of bullying behaviour towards her staff. Labour said in March that Abrahams had “stood aside from her frontbench role while the Labour party investigates an employment issue”. Abrahams, who held the work and pensions role since 2016, has strongly denied the claims. The Oldham East and Saddleworth MP said at the time of her suspension that she had experienced “aggressive, intimidating and wholly unprofessional” behaviour from “certain individuals” in Jeremy Corbyn’s office. She said she would make a formal complaint to the party and the parliamentary authorities. On Tuesday she said: “I strongly refute the allegations of bullying made against me. I believe the investigation was not thorough, fair or independent. I will continue to represent the people of Oldham East and Saddleworth, and to hold this Government to account, from the back benches.” Labour backbencher John Woodcock was suspended from the party last week over alleged sexual harassment claims, which he denies. The Barrow MP, a fierce critic of Corbyn, has also questioned the “integrity of the process” that led to the charges against him being made public during a “politically charged time”. Fellow MPs Kelvin Hopkins and Ivan Lewis have also had the party whip withdrawn in recent months pending similar investigations into alleged sexual misconduct, while Jared O’Mara was suspended over offensive blog posts."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/may/08/goodwood-arrests-police-cctv-50-person-brawl","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-08T18:37:29Z","webTitle":"Goodwood hopeful of arrests after handing police CCTV of 50-person brawl","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/08/goodwood-arrests-police-cctv-50-person-brawl","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/may/08/goodwood-arrests-police-cctv-50-person-brawl","fields":{"headline":"Goodwood hopeful of arrests after handing police CCTV of 50-person brawl","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Senior officials at Goodwood are hopeful of arrests in relation to the shocking fight that took place there on Saturday, having handed evidence to Sussex police. Alex Eade, the course’s manager, said his staff were “heartbroken” by events that resulted in four people requiring hospital treatment and made racecourse behaviour a hot topic once more, footage of the fight having circulated on the internet. “Some of my team were in tears,” Eade said, “because we spend so much time making Goodwood the sort of tranquil, special, beautiful place that it is, and then it gets punctured by a few idiots in what was a nasty, vicious fight.” Sussex police have put out an appeal for witnesses, indicating that “around 50” people were involved and confirmed there have been no arrests so far. But Eade hopes that will change, after his staff spent hours poring over CCTV images. “Every one of their actions for the entire day, we have clearly documented and we’ve handed it all over to the police,” he said. “We’ve got a number of very clear face shots of them actually in the act of fighting.” Eade said a group of 10 men appeared to be responsible for the fighting. While they had been served alcohol during the afternoon, they were eventually refused further service. “One of their group had been removed from site and it was in the process of that that the whole thing kicked off. Now, it’s not that our security staff started it, they were fighting amongst themselves, they weren’t fighting with our security staff. “Should the police investigation identify them, we can ban them from Goodwood, which we would certainly do. And the British Horseracing Authority have indicated they would ban them from all racecourses immediately.” Eade believes there is no precedent for such distressing scenes at Goodwood. “We need to make sure it never happens again. If we need more security, we will get more. If we need to make that security more visible, we will do so. If we need to change our alcohol policy, then we will review that.” He added that the men responsible were smartly dressed in suits and had tickets for the Gordon enclosure, the second most expensive of the three enclosures at Goodwood. “Some people say: ‘Put the ticket prices up, that’ll price this type of personality out.’ I don’t think that makes any difference. Some say: ‘Put the alcohol prices up.’ Well, I’m not sure that would make any difference either.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"society/2018/may/09/mps-take-to-task-plans-to-tackle-mental-health-crisis-among-young","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-08T23:01:32Z","webTitle":"Government plans to tackle mental health crisis 'will fail a generation'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/may/09/mps-take-to-task-plans-to-tackle-mental-health-crisis-among-young","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/may/09/mps-take-to-task-plans-to-tackle-mental-health-crisis-among-young","fields":{"headline":"Government plans to tackle mental health crisis 'will fail a generation'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Government plans to tackle the mental health crisis among young people will fail a generation who desperately need help, two committees of MPs warn today. Proposals in a green paper to “transform” NHS mental health care for young people through maximum four-week waiting times to access help and improved support in schools will take too long to effect real change, the committees say. In a joint report, the Commons health and social care and education select committees criticise the plans as unambitious and inadequate given the fast-rising need for care and too reliant on already overworked teachers. “This strategy does not go far enough, which raises the very real prospect of hundreds of thousands of children missing out on getting the help they so desperately need,” said Rob Halfon, the Conservative chair of the latter committee and former education minister. Although ministers have pledged to introduce maximum waiting times is only to be made available across up to a quarter of England by 2022-23. “The suggested speed of delivery will leave hundreds of thousands of children with no improvements in provision for several years and with possibly worsened provision if staff leave to join trailblazer areas elsewhere,” the report says. Children’s charities, mental health groups, teaching unions and health organisations have endorsed the committees’ findings. Mary Bousted, the joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said: “The crisis in child mental health provision will not be ‘transformed’ by the unambitious proposals in the government’s green paper. A government that’s complacent about child poverty and relaxed about excessive testing in schools can’t claim to care about young people’s mental health.” At least 10% of children and young people are thought to suffer from anxiety, depression, self-harm, eating disorders or other mental health conditions. The numbers of under-18s seeking and receiving NHS care have soared over the last decade. But only a quarter who need help get it, according to Public Health England . Javed Khan, the chief executive of Barnardo’s, said: “The government risks missing a golden opportunity to radically transform a failing mental health system. Despite Theresa May describing it as a ‘burning injustice’ that required a new approach from government, we now find ourselves sleep-walking into a deepening mental health crisis.” The government’s plans are based on three key elements: a teacher at every school and college becoming its designated lead for mental health; help for schools from new mental health support teams; and the guarantees of help within four weeks. However, the report adds: “The proposals put more pressure on the teaching workforce without sufficient resources.” It highlights the negative impact of social media on young people’s mental wellbeing and suggests that pupils should be taught about the benefits and risks of social media as part of the school curriculum. Jeremy Hunt, the health and social care secretary, last month claimed that social media companies’s alleged failure to enact safeguards to control young people’s access was “morally wrong” and “unfair on parents”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/may/12/home-listening-trio-wanderer-haydn-gould-piano-trio-saint-saens-george-benjamin-music-matters","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-12T13:00:31Z","webTitle":"Home listening: the tricky business of the piano trio","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/12/home-listening-trio-wanderer-haydn-gould-piano-trio-saint-saens-george-benjamin-music-matters","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/may/12/home-listening-trio-wanderer-haydn-gould-piano-trio-saint-saens-george-benjamin-music-matters","fields":{"headline":"Home listening: the tricky business of the piano trio","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"• Put a piano together with a single violin and a single cello and you have a potential problem, since the huge sound of the modern keyboard can easily drown out two string instruments. So the form of the piano trio needs careful handling: in Haydn’s time the keyboard was expected to be the primary soloist, with the strings accompanying. But in five superbly conceived piano trios of the 1790s, as sensitively played and balanced by Trio Wanderer (Harmonia Mundi), the violin becomes emancipated; rising above the textures in the remarkable E flat minor Trio Hob XV 31. In this form, Haydn feels free to experiment: the XV 14 Trio in A flat seems to push the surprises to their limits, and there are quite wonderful modulations and unexpected sidesteps throughout. Deft, subtle playing. • Move forward a century to the 1890s, and Saint-Saëns’s underrated Piano Trio No 2 (Champs Hill) uses a totally different structure. Instruments weave a symphonic web of argument and counter-argument: a five-movement piece full of an emotional turmoil we do not usually associate with Saint-Saëns. The turbulent opening, the jumpy Allegretto (unusually in 5/4 time), two shorter movements and then a densely wrought finale with intricate counterpoint are all powerfully projected by the Gould Piano Trio. The much earlier Piano Trio No 1 is more innocent, but typically skilful, and there is a postscript in the unusual movement La muse et le poète of 1909. Bizarrely, the CD nowhere allows us to know the names of the Gould’s three players: they are Lucy Gould (violin), Alice Neary (cello) and Benjamin Frith (piano). • The operatic event of the moment is the appearance at the Royal Opera of a new work from the composer of the much-praised Written on Skin, George Benjamin. Lessons in Love and Violence was premiered last Thursday. In preparation for the Radio 3 broadcast, on 2 June (when the Observer’s Fiona Maddocks will discuss the opera with Tom Service), Music Matters featured an interview (available on iPlayer and as a podcast) with Benjamin and his now constant librettist, Martin Crimp. Kate Molleson asks all the right questions about how words and music interact in the creation of a new work, but the mystery of the process remains."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"books/booksblog/2018/may/09/screened-out-why-tv-and-film-glam-up-plain-women-in-books","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-09T13:15:16Z","webTitle":"Screened out: why TV and film glam up plain women in books","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2018/may/09/screened-out-why-tv-and-film-glam-up-plain-women-in-books","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/booksblog/2018/may/09/screened-out-why-tv-and-film-glam-up-plain-women-in-books","fields":{"headline":"Screened out: why TV and film glam up plain women in books","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"When the BBC’s ratings winner The Woman in White ended on a plot twist on Monday night, fans of the 1859 novel were less than pleased, with some speculating that it set the scene for an unexpected sequel in a similar fashion to the TV incarnation of Margaret Atwood’s The Handmaid’s Tale. In the book, Wilkie Collins keeps Marian Halcombe at the home, moving in with her sister Laura and brother-in-law Walter to become a surrogate parent to their children (and, according to some literary critics, throwing a semi-incestuous sapphic spanner in to the works). The BBC adaptation instead whisked Marian away to go travelling around the world – possible, although not easy for a single woman in the 19th century. But that wasn’t the first break with the source material that the BBC’s take gave us. Because while Jessie Buckley is spirited and delightful in the role, she’s far too pretty to be Marian . One of the greatest heroines of Victorian literature, Marian is introduced in Collin’s novel through Walter Hartright’s rather voyeuristic eyes. Walter drools over his future sister-in-law from afar, particularly her figure – “visibly and delightfully undeformed by stays” – at least until he gets close enough to see her face: “Never was the old conventional maxim, that Nature cannot err, more flatly contradicted – never was the fair promise of a lovely figure more strangely and startlingly belied by the head that crowned it. The lady’s complexion was almost swarthy, and the dark down on her lip was almost a moustache.” As Cher Horowitz from Clueless might put it, she’s a total Monet (great from a distance, but a mess up close). Buckley is the latest in a long line of striking women actors trying to “plain up” – Sally Hawkins as Anne Elliot (“her bloom had vanished early; and as even in its height, her father had found little to admire in her”), Talulah Riley as Mary Bennet (“the only plain one in the family”), Mia Wasikowska as Jane Eyre (“Don’t address me as if I were a beauty, I am your plain Quakerish Governess”) – and just the latest attractive woman to play Marian: there was Diana Quick in the 1982 TV adaptation, Tara Fitzgerald in the 1997 film, then Maria Friedman in the oddly compelling musical by Andrew Lloyd Webber in 2004. Collins’s most memorable characters are all marked out by their unconventional appearance. In Poor Miss Finch, Oscar Dubourg’s skin is a shocking navy blue thanks to his epilepsy treatment – luckily his fiancee is blind; less luckily, she regains her sight and nearly marries his identical twin brother. And there’s The Law and the Lady’s eccentric genius Miserrimus Dexter, who is “literally the [top] half of a man”. At a time when physical disability was either considered a manifestation of bad character or reason for pity, Dexter is brilliant and charming. In contrast, Armadale’s Lydia Gwilt is beautiful on the outside but morally repugnant, able-bodied but profoundly unscrupulous. But what is “ugly” in literature can only go as far as “unconventionally beautiful” on telly, it seems. The latest Woman in White is yet another example of sexed up adaptations; even the creepy Count Fosco, described in the novel as approaching 60 and “corpulent”, is played by Riccardo Scamarcio, who is visibly neither. With Fosco, Collins was manipulating a prevailing Victorian idea that all fat people were jolly and inoffensive, unsettling readers by introducing a villain in the guise of comic relief. On a practical level, these changes make sense: Marian is such a scene-stealer that Walter needs a reason to prefer with Laura over her, while the complicated nature of Marian and Fosco’s interactions boils over into sexual tension, as opposed to stomach-churning sleaze. But perhaps there is another reason why we’re meant to find Marian unattractive, why the reader is supposed to take Walter’s preference for blonde-haired Laura for granted. Marian is “swarthy”, Walter says, and Laura describes her sister’s “dear Gypsy face”. That, plus the “thick, coal-black hair, growing unusually low down on her forehead”, seems a a clear indication Collins didn’t envisage his heroine as being white. Although much has been written about Heathcliff’s skin tone in Wuthering Heights, Marian’s race seems to have flown under the radar. It’s a minor point of scholarly debate, but when it comes to an adaptation it becomes flagrant whitewashing – a lead role in a primetime period drama going to an actress of colour could be a career game-changer, not to mention reminding viewers that the Victorian period was nowhere near as white as we’ve been led to believe. The latest Woman in White played fast and loose with its source material, but if the producers had wanted to break with convention, there was a far more faithful – and radical – way they could have done it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2018/may/12/tim-jonze-on-the-best-festivals","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-12T12:00:29Z","webTitle":"‘Festival memories are hard to verify.

Did I really see a baby crowdsurfing?’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Whoever decided to ask a battle-scarred festival veteran – someone who once attended 11 consecutive Reading and Leeds festivals, no less – to write about their favourite memories failed to foresee an obvious problem. Namely, that after 11 consecutive Reading and Leeds festivals (plus a dozen or so Glastonburys, a handful of T in the Parks, a sprinkling of Indietracks and the occasional depressing event set up in a massive Portuguese car park and most probably headlined by Muse), your memories are likely to be somewhat squiffy. They’re the kind of memories that have been doused in several litres of Lightning Strike cider, left to marinate in a hedge for four days and woken up with ill-advised tribal facepaint. And, like the bearded man in the healing fields who claims he can levitate through the 17th dimension, they’re probably not to be trusted. So when I check my own festival memories I have to wonder if many of them actually happened. Did I really see a baby in a buggy crowdsurfing through a packed field? Can it be true that I carried one of my friends across a mud-plagued Glastonbury site while he told passing strangers that he was the supreme ruler of the universe, only to then watch him pass out in a toilet block and urinate on himself? Was the night I spent inhaling toxic plastic fumes as tents and toilet blocks were set ablaze around me a figment of my imagination, a fever dream brought on after eating an undercooked chicken pad thai? Whether it’s watching Kevin Rowland confuse an entire crowd by wearing white stockings and suspenders or witnessing Michael Eavis redefine the very definition of the term “singing” while onstage with Stevie Wonder, the thing about festival memories is that they often take on a strange, hallucinatory air. Sure, you buy your ticket to watch Oasis or Beyoncé or Skepta – but then you come back telling friends that actually you went to see six shows by a fully grown man pretending to be a lobster while singing Christmas songs instead. That is the whole glorious point. The best festivals should exist at the point where reality and surreality meet, and your mind is no longer completely sure what’s happening. There should be giant spiders spouting fire, DJ sets that involve you climbing onstage to dance in your wellies, and deep and meaningful conversations about life, the universe and where you put your last piece of chewing gum. You’re left with a muddy mountain of experiences, many of which are hard to verify and almost all of which have no application once back in the real world. It’s unlikely that many potential employers out there are going to be impressed by your ability to fashion semi-waterproof shoes out of two Sainsbury’s bags and a lanyard. Remembering where your tent is located at 5am after several hours in the rave fields might be a game-changer at the time but it doesn’t really translate to anything particularly useful in the office environment. But that’s not important. What’s important at a festival is that you had the best possible time – and that’s especially likely to be the case if you can barely remember any of it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"}]}}
