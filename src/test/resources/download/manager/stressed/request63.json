I like to think that while I may have misgivings about much of what the current technological revolution is visiting on us, I yet manage to resist that dread ascription “luddite”. It’s one Bridle also wishes to avoid; but such is the pessimism about the machines that informs his argument, that his calls for a new “partnership” between them and us seem like special pleading. As futile, in fact, as a weaver believing that by smashing a Jacquard loom he’ll stop the industrial revolution in its tracks. At the core of our thinking about new technology there lies, Bridle suggests, a dangerous fallacy: we both model our own minds on our understanding of computers, and believe they can solve all our problems – if, that is, we supply them with enough data, and make them fast enough to deliver real-time analyses. To the Panglossian prospect of Moore’s Law, which forecasts that computers’ processing power will double every two years, Bridle offers up the counterexmple of Gates’s Law, which suggests these gains are negated by the accumulation in software of redundant coding. But our miscalculations concerning the value of big data are only part of the computational fallacy; Bridle also believes it’s implicated in our simple-minded acceptance of technology as a value-neutral tool, one to be freely employed for our own betterment. He argues that in failing to adequately understand these emergent technologies, we are in fact opening ourselves up to a new dark age. He takes this resonant phrase from HP Lovecraft’s minatory short story, “The Call of Cthulhu”, rather than the dark ages of historical record, although the latter may turn out to be a better point of reference for our current era. Lovecraft’s new dark age is, paradoxically, a function of enlightenment – it’s the searchlight science shines into the heart of human darkness that brings on a crazed barbarism. Bridle’s solution is to propose “real systemic literacy”, alongside a willingness to be imprecise – cloudy, even – when it comes to our thinking about the cloud. I’m not against this; indeed, I often think that in a world crazed by its sense of certainty, the best way to stay calm is to allow yourself the luxury of doubt. But while I can see it as making good stoical sense for the individual, I’m not sure it’s sufficiently rousing to prepare humanity, en masse, to cope with what’s coming down the steely, preprogrammed track. Bridle offers us techno pessimists plenty of examples to worry about. Some – such as death by slavish adherence to GPS navigation systems, and the woeful effects of the computational fallacy – I was already familiar with; but others did give me novel heebie-jeebies. I hadn’t bitten down on the fact that the very heat generated by the internet itself is a strong factor in global warming, which pretty much nixes any view that a more wired world will be a more sustainable one. Nor was I aware of the increase in a phenomenon known as “clear-air turbulence” (although really, it speaks for itself), which may well ground a lot of commercial aviation by the middle of this century. And while I may have known at an intuitive level that the Syrian conflict had an environmental dimension to it, Bridle is the first person I’ve read who authoritatively labels it as a resource war, provoked by drought. Meanwhile, those hot and powerful secret government computers are being used to speciously survey us (he makes a convincing case for the complete uselessness of CCTV systems), while with their spare processing capacity they try to crack the prime-factoring encryption system that’s vital for online privacy and commerce. That the US National Security Agency has already cracked some of the more commonly used prime number factors was, again, news to me. And I don’t think of the fake variety: for Bridle isn’t just a purveyor of the armchair jeremiad, who sits there blowing filter bubbles – he does fieldwork as well on our hideous and looming fate. I particularly enjoyed his inquiry into the weird and wobbly realm of British airspace and the link between drone programmes and so-called “plausible deniability” – the invisibility cloak for so much of our rulers’ dabbling in the dark arts. But perhaps the strangest and most unsettling aspect of the coming new dark age is the emergence of machine intelligence. Here Bridle makes an excellent and possibly original point: we’re accustomed to worrying about AI systems being built that will either “go rogue” and attack us, or succeed us in a bizarre evolution of, um, evolution – what we didn’t reckon on is the sheer inscrutability of these manufactured minds. And minds is not a misnomer. How else should we think about the neural network Google has built so its translator can model the interrelation of all words in all languages, in a kind of three-dimensional “semantic space”? I’d wondered why it was that Google Translate had massively improved – moving from being a reliable provider of nonsensical silliness, to, well, an effective and instantaneous way of translating. The problem is, we have a general idea how the program is doing it – but it can’t tell us exactly; and, as Bridle observes, this is tantamount to transgressing the first of Isaac Asimov’s famous Three Laws of Robotics – for if we’re in ignorance of what our robots are doing, how can we know if we’re being harmed? Intelligent computer systems are already menacing us with weird products devised algorithmically and offered for sale on Amazon, as well as bizarre and abusive “kids’” videos, which are mysteriously generated in the bowels of the web, and uploaded by bots to YouTube. Bridle borrows Timothy Morton’s modish conception of the “hyperobject” as a way of discussing our inability to apprehend the totality of the risks embodied in such vast phenomena as machine intelligence and global warming – but I’m not sure that acknowledging the ungraspable nature of anything really helps us to grasp it. Bridle looks to so-called “centaur chess” as a way forward for our wetware: computers may now effortlessly beat the grandest of masters at the game, but one of the defeated, Garry Kasparov, has developed a fight-back method, in which humans partnered with computers can indeed regain the podium. On this basis, Bridle argues, it’s possible to conceive of a new kind of “guardianship” of our frazzled planet and its poisoned wells, one in which we all work together. This seems Pollyanna-ish as much as Panglossian to me – I’m more struck by Nicholas Carr’s observation, in his takedown of the coming era of self-driving cars, The Glass Cage, that our inability to grasp the emergent techno realm may be a function of our having devised tools that do away with our need to use tools. Most of us already float free from the world of making, doing, extracting and refining – and observe it indolently and imperfectly through the scumbled lens of the cloud. We carry on ditching single-use plastic, and ordering stuff from Amazon, and giving our personal information away promiscuously, not, I’d argue, because global warming and AI are too big to grasp, but because we understand only too well that real change could only be effected by a great mass of individuals. And that, as Bridle acknowledges, is an impossibility, given the new technologies atomise rather than fuse our social formations. Still, no doubt once the microprocessors malfunction and the pumping system splutters to a halt, we’ll hopefully pick up pretty much where we left off before the Enlightenment – or possibly the Renaissance. One thing about the old dark ages was that they only seemed dark in retrospect, once the dread weight of state power had been reimposed. I bet there were plenty of people besides the Goths (and the Visigoths for that matter), for whom the fall of the Roman empire was a cause for celebration. I realise this isn’t a popular view. And I expect many readers will find Bridle’s perceptive and thought-provoking book terrifying rather than enjoyable – but then as I implied at the outset, I’m very much of the glass half- empty type.

James Ibori was jailed for 13 years for stealing nearly £50m from the Nigerian government and using it to buy properties in the UK. The conviction of Ibori, one of Nigeria’s richest men, in 2012 was hailed by ministers as a triumph for a Scotland Yard anti-corruption unit. His appeal against the conviction alleges that a police officer in the unit took bribes. On Thursday, Ibori’s barristers told the court of appeal he was unable to get a fair hearing because evidence from intercepted communications had been banned from being aired in court. Matthew Ryder, Ibori’s QC, said prosecutors should therefore not oppose his appeal, allowing his conviction to be quashed. “The United Kingdom is the only country in the world that has an absolute statutory ban on the use and disclosure of intercepted material in court proceedings,” Ryder said. He added the “draconian” ban meant Ibori had a “fatal handicap” and would be unable to fully explore the allegation of police corruption. During the appeal, which he launched in March, Ibori’s lawyers have alleged that DC John McDonald, an officer in the anti-corruption unit, received corrupt payments from a firm of private investigators. The investigators had been hired by Ibori during the original Scotland Yard investigation into him. The firm, Risc Management, is alleged to have made the corrupt payments to acquire information from McDonald about the investigation. Ibori’s lawyers have alleged that Scotland Yard recorded telephone conversations between McDonald and a Risc employee. The Crown Prosecution Service opposed Ibori’s appeal, arguing that the corruption allegations cannot be substantiated. McDonald had been cleared in 2013 after a Metropolitan police investigation. The detective denied wrongdoing. Risc Management has consistently denied wrongdoing, saying it had never paid a serving police officer for information and would never have approved such payments. John Kinnear, QC for the crown, said the appeal should be dismissed as the existence of evidence derived from intercepted communications did not mean that a fair hearing was impossible. Lord Justice Gross said he would deliver a judgment on the appeal at a later date. In 2012, Ibori – described by prosecutors as at one time a “petty thief with his hand in the till” at a branch of a DIY store in Ruislip, Middlesex – pleaded guilty to stealing millions from the Nigerian state and laundering it in the UK. He had amassed a portfolio of six properties in the UK, South Africa and the US worth $6.9m at a time when he was being paid £4,000 a year as governor of a region in Nigeria. He had sent his children to a British private school. Bhadresh Gohil, who had been one of Ibori’s lawyers, was jailed in Britain in 2011 for laundering the stolen money. In February, three court of appeal judges dismissed an attempt by Gohil to have his conviction overturned because it was tainted by the same allegations of police corruption. The judges ruled Gohil had known about the alleged corruption at his original trial but chosen not to raise it at that point. They criticised the “grave” failure of prosecutors to hand over thousands of pages of documents containing intelligence gathered by the Met about the corruption allegations."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/live/2018/jun/22/county-cricket-surrey-v-somerset-essex-v-notts-and-more-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-22T18:05:00Z","webTitle":"County cricket: Surrey go top as Jennings hits ton for Lancashire – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2018/jun/22/county-cricket-surrey-v-somerset-essex-v-notts-and-more-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2018/jun/22/county-cricket-surrey-v-somerset-essex-v-notts-and-more-live","fields":{"headline":"County cricket: Surrey go top as Jennings hits ton for Lancashire – as it happened","bodyText":"Surrey went top of the table with an innings and 69-run win over Somerset at Guildford – the first time they have won three consecutive games by an innings since 1958, when they won the Championship. Somerset were bowled out for 210 following-on, stranding James Hildreth on 89. There were four wickets each for Morne Morkel and Jade Dernbach. Ben Cox made an unbeaten 58 as Worcestershire declared on 484 for seven to set Lancashire 602 to win. Keaton Jennings kept hopes just alive with 135 not out; Lancashire were 269 for four at the close. Tom Moores walloped a brilliant 87, hitting seven fours and seven sixes, in Nottinghamshire’s second‑innings 266 against Essex. In the pink-ball game at the Ageas Bowl Hampshire took a first-innings lead of 97, Jimmy Adams making 147; Harry Brook took five wickets. Yorkshire were 91 for 2 in reply. Sussex won by an innings and 64 runs at Arundel, Durham unable to recover from losing six wickets for nine runs in the morning; Leicester were bowled out for 186 at Grace Road. Set 381 to win, Middlesex were 82 for 3 at the close. At Tunbridge Wells Kent declared at 446 for eight. Warwickshire, set 519 to win, finished on 229 for one as Ian Bell moved to his third hundred in four Championship innings. Derbyshire were bowled out for 362 at Swansea, a first-innings lead of 79. The debutant Prem Sisodiya took three for 54. An unbeaten stand of 153 from Usman Khawaja (79) and Kiran Carlson led Glamorgan to 201 for three. In the pink-ball game at the County Ground Northamptonshire eased to their first Championship win of the season, a 10-wicket victory over Gloucestershire. Brett Hutton finished with eight for 57. Sorry about the silence everyone, was just writing up: Keaton Jennings, what a man! Unbeaten on 131, Lancashire 263 for 4. Dan Lawrence has been out at Chelmsford - Notts on the march. Gareth Berg guiding Hampshire to a healthy first-innings lead over Yorkshire at the Ageas. Sussex have won - Durham unable to recover from the morning’s disaster. Shame for Arundel though. Stevie Eskinazi still there, but Middlesex have a long road. Stumps at Tunbridge Wells where Ian Bell has ANOTHER century. Warwicks need 290 to win. Not impossible. And hope springs still at Swansea, Khawaja still there, 70 not out. I’ve got to dash now because they’re turning off the wifi. Lovely company - enjoy your evenings. And a second wicket for Milnes at Chelmsford as Essex lurch to 27/2. Hampshire and Yorkshire have transposed into a different century at the Ageas: slow, steady, nothing to cause any alarm. Hampshire trail by 31 runs. Sixties both for Bell and Sibley, and at Swansea Khawaja is still there. Hameed gone. Alas. For a 64-ball 20. Jennings not out 96. Lancs 184-2. Stuart Poynter holding off the inevitable at Arundel, 46 not out. 181/6. Fifties apiece for Bell and Sibley in Warwickshire’s plucky reply. And news of the most unfortunate Jack Leach. He won’t play in Somerset’s next game, the day/night Championship match at Chelmsford, under the 7-day concussion rule. So... hit in the nets by a dog-ball-thrower, out for six weeks, comeback match. Bowl four overs, get hit on the head by Morkel. Glasses broken. Concussion. Out for another week. And today is his birthday. Happy Birthday Jack!! Cook lbw for a four-ball duck in Essex’s pursuit of a humungous number of runs. Need another 439 to win. Highlights from Guildford: I just met Sid, who flew over from Mumbai to Guildford to watch Virat Kohli play. Tea(/d-n lunch) scores: Division One Worcestershire 247 &amp; 484-7 dec, Lancashire 154-1. Lancs need 448 to win. Surrey 459, Somerset 180 &amp; 210 all out. Surrey win by an innings and 69 runs. Essex 206, Nottinghamshire 380 &amp; 266.

Leicestershire 427 &amp; 175-9, Middlesex 233. Leicestershire lead by 369 Kent 197 &amp; 446-8 dec Warwickshire 125 and 128-1. Warwicks need 391 to win Glamorgan 283, Derbyshire 293-5. Glamorgan trail by 33 runs Northamptonshire 282 and 32-0, Gloucestershire 62 &amp; 250. Northamptonshire win by 10 wickets Blimey, Derbyshire lost 5 for 6. Prem Sisodiya 3-54. Glamorgan have made a good start - 42-0 - trail by 37 . Leicestershire 150 for 8, 3 wickets each for Murtagh and Harris. And it’s all over: Waller caught hooking for 0. Hildreth gets an arm around his shoulder from the umpire, not out 89. Surrey win by an innings and 69 runs. Surrey’s first win at Guildford since 2002. Championship-winners 2018, in my book. Two balls later Groenewald chops on, and his leg stump goes wheeling away. Enter our concussion substitute Max Waller. 209/9. Hildreth still 89 An eighth wicket down at Guildford. Dernbach got his man, Davey caught behind for 21. Someone stay with Hildreth, 89 not out. Lancashire have lost a wicket. Davies lbw D’Oliveria 64. That brings Haseeb Hameed in and I think we know how this goes. Come ON Has! Many “come on lads” from the Surrey fielders. The very next ball Josh Davey is dropped at slip on 19 off Dernbach. A bi-plane passes overhead and a mid-afternoon sugar-low drifts across the spectators. Dernbach, however, is not happy. Notts nine down now, lead of 382. Durham teetering-about-to-tumble 119 for 5. Collingwood out for a duck. Graham Clark 45 not out. And that’s six over the fence and onto Woodbridge Road! Hildreth off Virdi. New balls please! England Lions need 233 to win; Dawson 4-30. Top scorer the hyper-talented Rishabh Pant I don’t really want to put this in writing but Lancashire are nearing an unbroken first-wicket partnership of 100. Rikki Clarke getting his knickers in a twist. Durham 79 for 3, last innings near-centurion Will Smith gone for 36. Bell is in at Tunbridge Wells, Warwicks 74/1, chasing 445 to win. Derbyshire now leading Glamorgan by 71 , forties not out for Critchley and Wilson. Adams still going as Hampshire trudge on: 135 off 285 balls. They trail by 88. A deserved half-century for Hildreth off 89 balls, as he nurdles Clarke for another four. A disconsolate Bess trudges off the field, bowled by Clarke for 6. Somerset 145/7. Hildreth playing very nicely here for 48 but he’s running out of partners May 1958 was the last time Surrey won three consecutive matches by an innings. They won the Championship that year, of course. The inscription under the team photo reads: Back Row (L-R) – H. Strudwick (Scorer), R.C.E. Pratt, M.D. Willett, J.K. Hall, K. Barrington, M.J.

Bedser (Vice Captain), P.B.H. May (Captain), A.J. McIntyre (WK), D.G.W. Fletcher, A.B.D. Parsons All still well for Lancashire and Warwicks. Northants have won by ten wickets. It never rains...we have our second concussion substitute of 24 hours. Max Waller will replace Jack Leach who was hit on the head yesterday by Morkel, broke his glasses and was out shortly afterwards. . The plucky Gloucestershire defence is over. Northants need 31 to win. Given the catastrophic drop in insect numbers, lovely to see a dragon-fly flitting about the pavilion at Guildford. Haven’t seen many butterflies at all this year. Division One Worcestershire 247 &amp; 484-7 dec, Lancashire 130 and 26 for 0. Lancs need 576 to win. Surrey 459, Somerset 180 &amp; 106 for 5. Somerset trail by 173. Essex 206, Nottinghamshire 380 &amp; 119 for 5. Notts lead by 293 Hampshire 245-3, Yorkshire 350 Day/Night game. Play yet to start. Division Two Sussex 552, Durham 211 and 52 for 1. Durham trail by 289 Leicestershire 427 &amp; 55-4, Middlesex 233. Leicestershire lead by 249 Kent 197 &amp; 446-8 dec Warwickshire 125 and 25-0. Warwicks need 494 to win Glamorgan 283, Derbyshire 293-5. Derby lead by 10 runs. Northamptonshire 282, Gloucestershire 62 &amp; 245-8. Play yet to start. At lunch, a recovery of sorts by Hildreth and Gregory, but Somerset won’t be dining on hope this evening. Lunch-time updates to follow Under-dog news: no wickets yet fallen at Chelmsford or Tunbridge Wells and still only one down at Arundel. Sorry, I’ve had wifi problems but just before lunch a reminder that Surrey play Yorkshire next week and you can watch the game unfold on the Surrey and Yorkshire websites and Sky digital. Four cameras, “bespoke” commentary - almost, almost, as good as free-to-air. Virdi to bowl from the pavilion end, first time today. Libby out shortly after passing 50, Notts 97 for 5 - a lead of 271. Slow going at Swansea, but Derby nearly have parity with five wickets in hand. A hundred for Alex Hughes, run-out for 103. And I see Lancashire need 602 to win in all the time in the world. All the threes - 33 for 3 - at Grace Road. Leicester’s lead over Middlesex now 227. And Kent have DECLARED!! Lead of 518. Hmmm. Did Bell use up his century quota in the last game? And you were quite right BTL about the goings-on at Tunbridge Wells - Keith Barker was removed from attack after a second warning for running on the pitch. The England selectors have obviously been sent on away days - Trevor Baylis is watching the Lions, Smith is at Guildford. A pat on the back for any greater/lesser spottings. Lions update: India A 85 for 3 - the most striking thing to report so far is Ben Foakes’ catch to dismiss Mayank Agarwal. And Ryan Patel comes on from his lucky end! Durham are 9 for 1, with Cameron Steel the man out, b Jofra Archer for two lovely, but inadequate, fours. Here’s Arundel looking charming anyway. WICKET! Davies caught at gully off Clarke for 9. 69 for 5. At this rate Smith’s not going to see Virdi bowl, unless of course we’re mistaken and he came instead to see the old warhorse at his old hunting ground. This, remember, is a second-string Surrey side. And Morkel takes the ball from the pavilion end for the first time... Morne Morkel’s wife is bowling at her little boy to the side of the pavilion... while Durham complete their morning’s work and prepare to follow-on. They seem to play better on days 3 and 4 but even they can’t get out of this one. Can they? A (below) picture of Danny Lamb - English cricket’s first concussion substitute. I can’t do better than Mes’s “Lamb’s to the Slaughter” but I just hope they’re all nice to him. Not debut of dreams, but a debut nonethless. At New Road, Lancashire have taken a couple of wickets but Cox and Whitely are hitting to and over the boundary boards, a bit of fun before the serious stuff begins. Matthew Milnes is out at Chelmsford, a second for Quinn. Notts: 62 for 2 with a lead of 236. And ANOTHER at Guildford where Abell is flumoxed into inadequacy by Dernbach for 5. 40 for 4. No wickets yet at Tunbridge Wells, where Zak Crawley has moved onto 67, or Swansea. Durham now 9 down, having lost five for seven runs so far this morning. All these wickets-a-tumble on a hot day are proving a bit much to keep on top of. But let’s try: a wicket at Grace Road, where near first-innings double-century maker Ackermann was bowled by Harris for 2. Harris’s second of the innings. And another wicket here at Guildford, George Bartlett has a wafty drive at Dernbach and is caught for 7. Commiserations and a little wave to all the BTL-ers who’ve made the journey today. Oh my Lord, there goes another, next ball, Byrom c Jacks b Morkel, 19. 33/3 And Lancashire get a wicket! Brett D’Oliveria lbw to Bailey for 22. Crumbs from the table, crumbs from the table... England Lions team: Lions team: Gubbins, Kohler-C (debut), Hain, Livingstone, Mullaney (c, debut), Foakes, Dawson, Jordan, Topley, Helm, Fisher (debut). India A won the toss and will bat. Durham on the slide too, can they really have lost three wickets this morning? Er, yes they can - three in seven balls, two ducks and the one batsman with a chance of holding the innings together out for 90. Oh Somerset, not living the dream. Renshaw pinned back on his stumps, lbw for 2. 18/1 Another game to keep your eye on is the Lions v India A at Derby, a young team full of superstars schooled at the IPL against a strong young England. With more lip-smacking weather around the country, a handful of games could finish today. Here at Guildford, Somerset will have to bat much better to take the game into the fourth day, and they’re up against Morne Morkel, four-wicket Rikki Clarke, Ed-Smith watching Amar Virdi and magic man Ryan Patel, swinging the ball this way again in practice this morning. At The County Ground, it’s all over bar the shouting, Gloucester have recovered well after their nightmare of a first innings, but with two wickets in hand they only lead Northants by 25. Much sympathy for Wantage Road administrators, who will miss out on the Friday night crowd. Lancashire’s batting will have a chance to right a basket-ful of wrongs at New Road where presumably Worcestershire will declare sometime today, with the lead already 478. Kent will hope to wrap things up at Tunbridge Wells against Warwickshire - though the pitch should prove easier for Warwickshire too second innings. Durham’s batsmen have a lot to do at Arundel, while Nottinghamshire’s batsmen should bat Essex out of the match today at Chelmsford. Leicester are on top at Grace Road, though they start today at 0 for 1. Things are more even in the pink-ball game at The Ageas and at Swansea. Hello and welcome to the third day of this Championship round. It’s a another beauuuutiful day at Guildford, the players are on the pitch lifting impossibly heavy medicine balls and bending low for slip catching practice. And the big news for both sides is that Ed Smith has arrived … more to follow."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jun/22/donald-trump-republicans-immigration-house-senate-red-wave-separations-dreamers","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-22T20:15:41Z","webTitle":"Trump: Republicans should 'stop wasting their time on immigration'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/22/donald-trump-republicans-immigration-house-senate-red-wave-separations-dreamers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jun/22/donald-trump-republicans-immigration-house-senate-red-wave-separations-dreamers","fields":{"headline":"Trump: Republicans should 'stop wasting their time on immigration'","bodyText":"A Republican effort to reform the US immigration system teetered once again on the brink of failure on Friday, as the Trump administration continued to face fierce backlash for its crackdown on migrants at the southern border. As Republicans scrambled to build support among their fractious party for an immigration plan that would meet Donald Trump’s vision for an immigration overhaul, the president advised GOP lawmakers to “stop wasting their time” on an issue that has split the party for more than a decade. GOP leaders in Congress were twice forced to postpone an immigration bill, presented as a compromise between moderate and conservative members of the party, as negotiators made an 11th-hour push for consensus. The vote was first delayed to Friday and then to next week. “Republicans should stop wasting their time on Immigration until after we elect more Senators and Congressmen/women in November,” Trump tweeted. “Dems are just playing games, have no intention of doing anything to solves this decades old problem. We can pass great legislation after the Red Wave!” Democrats, who were not involved in negotiations over the Republican bills, blamed the president for standing in the way of immigration reform. Trump continued his attacks on Democrats, claiming in a later tweet that they were telling “phony stories of sadness and grief” for electoral gain. Most forecasters in fact predict a possible “blue wave” in the November midterm elections, meaning a sweep of Democratic wins to take back the House and possibly the Senate. Delicate negotiations over the Republican immigration bill are playing out against a backdrop of extraordinary international outrage over Trump’s “zero-tolerance” enforcement policy, which was captured by dramatic scenes of children in cages and young migrants crying for their parents. Trump partially reversed the policy this week under pressure from the pope, the British prime minister, the United Nations, every living first lady including his wife and prominent Republican leaders. The fate of the 2,300 children who were separated from their parents remains unclear. Some experts are concerned that separations may continue, even though Trump declared when signing his executive order that “we are going to keep the families together”. The Department of Defense is ready to make space available on military bases for as many as 20,000 unaccompanied migrant children, a spokesman told the Associated Press. Despite Republican control of Congress, GOP leaders have struggles to unite their fractious party on immigration. Trump swooped into a Republican meeting earlier this week, but members left with the impression that his support was half-hearted at best. And his equivocation on Twitter has not helped leaders recruit support for the bill. “Game over,” the Republican congressman Mark Sanford, a Trump critic, told CNN, saying Trump’s tweet “takes the wind out of the sails in what might have been a fairly productive week of looking for a compromise”. Trump’s morning tweet was the latest wrinkle in a weeks-long process that began with a rebellion by a group of moderate Republicans who launched a petition drive to force a series of immigration votes. The “compromise” plan was brokered by Republican leadership to quell the uprising – and became the vehicle to address two urgent crises triggered by Trump’s hardline immigration agenda: his cancellation of a program that shielded from deportation hundreds of thousands of young, undocumented immigrants brought to the US as children, known as Dreamers, and the zero-tolerance policy which led to the family separations. As proposed, the bill would include $25bn for Trump’s border wall, a campaign promise. It would also limit legal immigration, provide a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers and end family separations. Yet after a two-hour closed-door meeting on Thursday evening, negotiators told reporters they were exploring modifications to the bill to appease conservatives. One element would require employers to use E-verify, a federal database that determines the legal status of workers. The other provision would deal with visas for agricultural workers. The House on Thursday defeated a more hardline immigration plan that would have dramatically restricted legal immigration without guaranteeing a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers. The vote was closer than many Republicans expected, leaving some conservatives to wonder if the focus had been on the wrong measure. “There’s been a full court press the past 48 hours on the compromise bill,” Mark Meadows, chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, told Fox. “Perhaps if we had done that on the first bill we would have gotten to that sweet spot of 218 votes. But you know, history is over with that bill.” Senate Republicans have moved forward with a different approach, hoping to pass a narrowly crafted standalone measure that would allow families to stay together in detention while increasing the number of federal immigration judges. Meanwhile, Trump appeared alongside relatives of victims of crimes committed by undocumented immigrants. The family members, whom Trump referred to as the “human toll of illegal immigration”, shared their stories in harrowing detail. Several speakers emphasized that their’s was a “permanent separation”. In his remarks Trump railed against illegal immigration, lamenting that countries are sending “bad ones” to the US. Yet his administration has widely targeted immigrants with no criminal record and no history of violence. And despite his focus on violent crime, studies have shown that undocumented immigrants are less likely to commit serious crimes than US-born people. “We’ll not rest until our border is secure, our citizens are safe and we end this immigration crisis once and for all,” Trump said, speaking after the families. “Your loved ones have not died in vain.” In a dramatic ending to an exceptionally chaotic week in Washington, Democratic congressman Ted Lieu used his time on the House floor to play a recording of immigrant children crying out for their parents. Karen Handel, a Republican congresswoman who was presiding over the chamber, ordered Lieu to suspend his speech, arguing that playing audio was a breach of House decorum. “I think the American people need to hear this,” Lieu protested. After roughly five minutes, Lieu yielded the floor and the House adjourned for the weekend, once again leaving the issue of immigration for another day."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/jun/22/magid-magid-sheffields-lord-mayor-ive-had-a-lot-of-stick-but-i-dont-care","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-22T14:24:27Z","webTitle":"Magid Magid, Sheffield’s lord mayor: ‘I’ve had a lot of stick, but I don’t care’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jun/22/magid-magid-sheffields-lord-mayor-ive-had-a-lot-of-stick-but-i-dont-care","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jun/22/magid-magid-sheffields-lord-mayor-ive-had-a-lot-of-stick-but-i-dont-care","fields":{"headline":"Magid Magid, Sheffield’s lord mayor: ‘I’ve had a lot of stick, but I don’t care’","bodyText":"Magid Magid was in his local Sainsbury’s recently when a shopper asked him to pose for a picture by squatting. The 28-year-old cheerfully obliged, crouching on the supermarket floor “with a loaf of bread in my hand”. Today, our photoshoot takes for ever, because as soon as we leave the town hall he keeps being stopped in the street. But his fame extends far beyond his home town of Sheffield. A Jordanian friend told him his mum had seen him on the news in Amman. “I’m like: ‘What the heck?’ I didn’t expect this much attention,” he says. Magid has become a global celebrity since being elected lord mayor of Sheffield in May. His elevation was reported as good news all over the planet and when we meet in his office – the lord mayor’s parlour, to be precise – he can’t stop smiling. But, in fact, his appointment was not celebrated with universally excited fandom at first. “You’re a disgrace to this city,” people shouted at him from passing cars. “I am disappointed that Magid has seen fit to tell everyone that he is a black, Muslim immigrant,” complained a letter to the local press. Another resident wrote of his appointment: “It’s an insult to the people of Sheffield ... There must be many Sheffield-born people who are worthy of being the mayor. What has Sheffield finally come to?” There were complaints about his choice of music for his inauguration ceremony – the Imperial March from Star Wars – and Magid pulls out a copy of a local paper from his desk drawer to show me “the most ridiculous” letter, which lamented: “We are losing our identity.” How did he feel about the criticism? “Do you know what, it was a small minority. But it felt large, because it was all I was hearing.” Did it make him wobbly? “Yes,” he admits. “Yes, of course. I’m human.” What changed everything was a single photoshoot. Every lord mayor’s appointment since the 19th century has been commemorated by an official portrait. “So I said to myself: that picture’s going to outlive me well past when I’m dead. I wanted a picture that encapsulated me, because I always think a picture should tell. Because look at all of them” – he gestures around the parlour to solemn faces lining the flock-wallpapered walls. “It’s just a boring headshot. It would have been so good if every lord mayor had the opportunity to be creative with their picture, to tell their story.” Wearing his official gold livery collar and black Dr Martens boots, he posed by squatting on the marble bannister plinth of the town hall stairs. “I shouldn’t have done that, because it’s health and safety, but nobody was looking,” he grins. In other pictures, he wore a bright-yellow baseball cap turned back to front, his chains over a jumper. “Then people were like: ‘You’re disrespecting the town hall, disrespecting our traditions.’ That’s all I was hearing.” But when the images were posted on social media, they went viral. Messages from all over the world began “blowing up my inbox. And then I’m like: wow. I’m doing the right thing.” He beams. “And the only reason we’re here today – the only reason we got so much attention – is because I decided to be myself; because – I know it sounds a bit cliche – I did things my way and [did] what I believe in. Had I stuck to the norms, the traditions, I don’t think you’d be here today from the Guardian. So now, do you know what, I wake up in the morning and I think: ‘I couldn’t give a fuck today, I couldn’t give a shit,’ I’m just going to do what I want to do. Of course, I’ve had a lot of stick. But I don’t care.” Magid didn’t even tell his mother or his sister he was going to become lord mayor until his appointment was announced. The ceremonial position lasts for one year and rotates between the parties represented on the council; of his 121 predecessors, the youngest had been 40 and none had been a Green. His party colleagues nominated him because, as one said: “I’ve never met anyone who doesn’t like him.” This is easy to believe, for he could not be more charming. Magid was five when he fled Somalia with his mother and elder sister. They spent six months in Ethiopia before arriving in Sheffield, where life wasn’t easy. His mother supported the family by working as a cleaner, but she struggled to learn English and Magid grew accustomed to seeing her being racially abused in the street. His teenage years were troubled and for a while he was a gang member. I ask him to be specific about his adolescent misdemeanours, but he grows uncharacteristically coy. “It was just a case of being mischievous.” Was he ever arrested? “Have I ever been arrested?” he repeats slowly. “I think I might take a pass on that question.” He was rescued by, of all things, a love of travel brochures. After raising money to climb Kilimanjaro, he studied aquatic zoology at the University of Hull, where he founded a mixed martial arts club and was elected to the students’ union’s sports executive. He had never voted when he stood for president of the union; he didn’t even know what a picket line was. “I think the only reason I got elected, with a big majority, was because I think people could just relate.” After graduating, he became a digital marketing consultant and stood successfully as a Green party council candidate in 2016, “because the people on the council just didn’t reflect its electorate”. Unlike most elected politicians, Magid lives in a shared house with three people he had not met before moving in. His day begins not with the Today programme, but with YouTube – “I’ve got a big TV in my bedroom, so I just stick that on” – and he is still trying to get used to the chauffeur who pulls up outside his house in a Jaguar to take him to work; he won’t let him open the car door. “It’s like protocol, apparently,” he marvels, laughing. “But it’s a bit ridiculous.” In one sense, he identifies with the new generation of political outsiders who have been winning office all over the world. “It’s a symptom that our democracy is not working properly.” He corrects himself: “No, it’s not working at all. It’s definitely not reflective, not just of people of colour, disabled people, of women, but of any of us, really. We’ve got a cabinet of millionaires in this country, probably 90% of them went to private school [the figure is actually 35%], and they make decisions for the rest of the country.” However, despite having starred in reality TV earlier this year – on the third series of Channel 4’s fugitive show Hunted – he takes great exception to any suggestion of parallels with Donald Trump. “That doesn’t sit with me very well, it really doesn’t. He is part of the establishment. He got given $1m [as a loan by his father] when he was a kid. He doesn’t represent the people. It’s just a complete con.” When Trump visits the UK in July, “I’ll definitely be protesting. Definitely.” But if Trump is a great disruptor, Magid’s plans for Sheffield come under the same category. Every month, he will invite a member of the city’s creative community to showcase their talents at the council meeting. “Call if a half-time show, call it what you want.” The first, in June, was a scientist called Hassun El Zafar, who performed magic tricks. “There was a water rocket launched across the chamber and he talked about how science is a creative art in itself. It was amazing.” Magid wore a black T-shirt to the meeting, bearing the slogan “Immigrants Make Britain Great”, and a tartan beret. What did the councillors make of it all? “They were a bit hesitant and whatnot at first – but then they came around to it and they were laughing and then they all loved it.” He also invited the letter-writers who condemned his appointment in the local press to a round-table meeting, because “I believe we should be having uncomfortable conversations, rather than sweeping things under the carpet”. The man who had complained that the city’s people were “losing their identity” didn’t show up. “But others did and they came around to it at the end of the day.” Really? “Yes, genuinely, they did.” Magid strikes me as unusually untroubled by self-doubt. He agrees. He is well aware of some hostility on the council towards him and his ideas, but he says it is concentrated in one party, which he won’t name. His plan is to “kill it with kindness and bury it with a smile. You could be the most racist person to me; I will still open that door for you. You can’t solve hate with hate. That doesn’t solve anything whatsoever. I will still be kind to you, because at the end of the day you’re human; we all go through the same problems, same issues, face the same things, and I believe people can come around just by meeting people. I treat people with kindness, because arguing doesn’t solve anything.” He knows there are people who are waiting for him to mess up – “100%, massively” – and he is sure he will, sooner or later. “I’m not perfect. I’m going to make mistakes.” (He is keen to correct reports, however, that he plans to “pimp” the lord mayor’s parlour at public expense: “There’s no way on earth I’m going to spend public money on refurbishments.”) But nothing can detract from the symbolism of his appointment. “It’s really easy for everybody to feel: ‘Oh, isn’t it amazing,’ but in reality my story is very unlikely, because of this government’s policies.” Were he five years old today, he points out, this government would not have allowed him and his family entry to the UK. He watched the plight of the refugee boat turned away by Italy recently with horror. “I feel disgusted, because had they been white Europeans I doubt very much they would have been sent away. If that had been white Europeans it would have been a different story.” I ask him about his political ambitions and he laughs. “Nobody joins the Greens to have a career in politics.” What about reality TV – does he have any plans to do more of that? He is single, but he looks appalled when I suggest Love Island; laughing again, he shakes his head. “No. And I don’t regret going on Hunted, but I would never do anything like that again. I hadn’t realised it would all be contrived; it wasn’t really real at all.” He pauses for a moment. “There is one show that seems genuine, though. And I love dancing. So, yeah, I wouldn’t do anything else – but I’d do Strictly.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/22/love-island-emotional-abuse-entertainment-adam-collard-gaslighting","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-22T11:24:49Z","webTitle":"Love Island normalises emotional abuse – and we call it entertainment | Lizzie Cernik","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/22/love-island-emotional-abuse-entertainment-adam-collard-gaslighting","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/22/love-island-emotional-abuse-entertainment-adam-collard-gaslighting","fields":{"headline":"Love Island normalises emotional abuse – and we call it entertainment","bodyText":"Filling a secluded Spanish villa with a selection of scantily clad twentysomethings and several TV cameras might not be a recipe for everlasting partnerships, but it’s certainly a hit for ratings. Since making its comeback in 2015, Love Island has established itself as Big Brother for the Snapchat generation, attracting more than 3 million viewers. But this week the reality show took a darker turn when Adam Collard, a self-styled Don Juan, displayed worrying signs of emotionally abusive behaviour towards his fellow contestant Rosie Williams. Pegged by viewers as a raging narcissist from the moment he entered the villa, he was quickly accused of “gaslighting”, a malicious form of mental abuse designed to alter the victim’s perception of reality. During long-term relationships it’s often used as a method of control, belittling the person on the receiving end and destroying their confidence and self-esteem over time. In Adam’s case the behaviour came after he lost interest in the woman he had spent 10 days pursuing, and found himself drawn to newcomer Zara. Rather than admit he was a flighty, hormone-driven 22-year-old who couldn’t keep his pants on if he tried, he proceeded to dismiss and ignore Rosie, repeatedly accusing her of being crazy in an attempt to turn the tables. He finally cemented her heartbreak during a row, delivering the blows with a self-satisfied smirk, cruel eye-rolling and the emotional maturity of a boiled potato. Of course, relationships that kick off with televised sexy time on a popular gameshow are unlikely to result in fairytale endings. But, regardless of the length of courtship, contestants should have the right to respect and basic human decency, without being branded a “bunny boiler” for expressing a modicum of emotion. Many of us have fallen victim to the charms of a feckless Romeo, and blaming a woman for succumbing to sweet talk is just another form of casual misogyny, one we’ve almost accepted because it’s so common. While some have defended Adam’s actions as a laudable attempt at being a lad, Women’s Aid has issued a warning about psychological abuse, urging viewers to recognise unhealthy behaviour in relationships. His actions, described as “manipulative” by viewers, demonstrated “clear warning signs of emotional abuse”, something that needs to be highlighted as problematic. It’s not the first time reality TV has come under fire for depicting psychological abuse, with women regularly made to feel inadequate or “insane” for revealing emotion or questioning a man’s actions during an on-screen relationship. Last year Made in Chelsea’s latest villain, Harry Baron, was heavily criticised on social media after manipulating a woman he was dating to foist the blame on her. Over in Brentwood, The Only Way Is Essex has been slammed for its promotion of “toxic masculinity”, with both James “Lockie” Lock and Myles Barnett accused of abusive behaviour. Despite concerns about misogyny, our dedication to reality TV shows no sign of waning. For many viewers, the shows create excitement and drama, an antidote to busy lives and dreary commutes. And besides, contestants know what they’re getting into – don’t they? In fact, we’re so involved with these shows that we manage to overlook the frequent psychological abuse, despite its prevalence offscreen. According to the latest partner abuse survey from the Office for National Statistics, emotional abuse is the most commonly reported type of cruelty in relationships, experienced by more than 62% of the women who responded and 56% of men. Figures from Women’s Aid suggest that 95% of domestic abuse victims have also suffered as a result of coercive and controlling behaviour, with these actions often proceeding physical violence. In 2015 this type of emotional abuse was formally recognised as a crime, punishable by up to five years in jail. Despite heightened awareness, it’s still worryingly common, with mental health organisation HelpGuide suggesting the problem is regularly minimised or unrecognised by victims. Whether the perpetrator is male or female, psychological abuse often begins slowly, and controlling behaviour can be easily misinterpreted. In the early stages of a relationship, emotionally abusive partners are also known for “love bombing”, showering their partner with obsessive adoration and affection, which can make the abuse even harder to spot. Though psychological manipulation affects both sexes, in reality television the perpetrators are usually men, who religiously adhere to archaic dating stereotypes in a bid to be unofficially crowned as shagger of the year. From Adam’s snakey antics in Love Island through to the grand – and frankly creepy – romantic gestures of the Made in Chelsea gang, we’re normalising the idea that women are disposable prizes to be collected like stuffed Disney toys at a funfair. Though contestants choose to go on these constructed reality shows, Love Island and its competitors should still have a duty of care to the people they televise. Humiliation and emotional abuse might be good for ratings, but taking advantage of human vulnerability for entertainment has consequences. Reality shows aren’t going anywhere, so perhaps it’s time we stopped condoning the behaviour of contestants and made some real noise about its impacts. • Lizzie Cernik is a journalist and features writer, covering relationships, travel and women’s issues Comments are pre-moderated to ensure the discussion is about topics that have been addressed in this article"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"books/booksblog/2018/jun/25/poem-of-the-week-typewriter-by-matthew-francis","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-25T08:18:52Z","webTitle":"Poem of the week: Typewriter by Matthew Francis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2018/jun/25/poem-of-the-week-typewriter-by-matthew-francis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/booksblog/2018/jun/25/poem-of-the-week-typewriter-by-matthew-francis","fields":{"headline":"Poem of the week: Typewriter by Matthew Francis","bodyText":"Typewriter One day I’ll fetch the Smith Corona from the cupboard, set it on the desk and unclasp its blue plastic shell to expose the nakedness of its baby-grand workings. Remember the punch and peck words had in those days, the strain of Q in the little finger, the type head leaning out on its stalk from its semicircular roost, the angelus ting that marked the end of a line the slap of the silver lever that jerked time forward, the shift key that tilted the world on its fulcrum, the grey formalities hedged by tabs and margins that turned language into geometry, the braille of the other side of the page under the fingertips? What was struck here could never be unstruck, in spite of backspacing and xs, packets of Tipp–Ex paper and the vial of Snopake, its screw-cap gritted shut. Not used to taking ourselves so seriously, we prodded at the ampersand tangled in its nest, the curly brackets aiming their bows in opposite directions. Switch on the anglepoise lamp; outside the window it’s carbon-paper dark. There’s ribbonsmudge on your fingers and a new sheet of foolscap rolled into place on the platen. This week, in a new, previously unpublished poem, Matthew Francis fulfils the performative declaration of the opening stanza: he fetches the Smith Corona, “unclasp(s) its blue plastic shell” and with judicious detail, precise but not overdone, gives us the look, function and feel of it. If you’ve ever used a typewriter, you’ll remember at once how it was. If you never have, you might marvel at the slightly gnarled complexity, and be rather glad you missed out. Though the typewriter’s invention was commercially driven, Francis’s observation of its “baby-grand workings” may suggest lofty solo aspiration, creation rather than copying. It’s also a suggestive mechanical analogy. In fact, according to Wikipedia, Giuseppe Ravizza called the prototype he designed in 1855 Cembalo scrivano o macchina da scrivere a tasti (“Scribe harpsichord or machine for writing with keys”). Listing the typewriter’s particular features, Francis begins with a direct, companionable appeal to his readers: “Remember the punch and peck words had in those days …?” This is nicely onomatopoeic, and perhaps contains a suggestion, a mere hint, that language itself might have been a different entity when muscle and metal were involved in its production. But even here, the tone steers clear of the siren-haunts of nostalgia; playfully insistent on mechanism, the speaker leaves it largely up to the reader whether to interpret “the punch and peck” as wholly affectionate. The question of connection between the writing implements and the writing itself is a fascinating one. Henry James, in the novels he composed after rheumatism in his right wrist forced him to give up handwriting, can undoubtedly be overheard dictating those ever-rolling sentences to his typist. He admitted the effect himself, and noted that he eventually came to depend on the noise made by the machine as background to his creative flow. Francis reminds us that keyboards make demands that are literally digital, and may be painful (“the strain of Q in the little finger”) – at least for anyone aspiring beyond the horribly amateurish, but tempting, two-fingered approach. Suggestive metaphors unroll: the “roost” of keys (those pecking birds, stretching their necks and ready to be fed), the inexorable “angelus ting” of the carriage called to meet its margin, no more to be challenged than the call to prayer can be disobeyed by the faithful. Francis is a poet of voyages, and this set of tercets is a voyage in miniature, noting the topological contrasts of typewriter island, from “the silver lever” to “the grey formalities” of the tabulator, and including that particularly magical change of perspective produced by “the shift key that tilted the world on its fulcrum”. The typewriter key strikes deep, producing the raised effect of Braille on the wrong side of the paper. “What was struck here could never be unstruck,” the speaker reminds us, once again adding a warningly percussive sound effect. So we typists come unstuck, and face retribution. Typing, like sinning, may be exhilarating: the self-correction is contrastingly laborious. But the naming is fun, and Francis gives us both Tipp-Ex paper and Snopake (the cap inevitably “gritted shut”). Oh yes, I remember it well, and how it could live up to its name, encrusting the paper with solid-packed layers of white. And heaven help the author if, in a rush of inspiration, the keys were hit again before the snow was dry. In the sixth stanza, Francis goes back to his core idea, the significance of type’s permanence. Using the first-person plural, his speaker unearths the ampersand and the curly brackets as if they were rare plants or insects. They might also denote a new, sophisticated metalanguage, symbolising modernism or some other refinement of textual nuance. The final stanza is where the emotional connection between human and typewriter is unveiled. It’s an enclosed, atmospheric scene of lamplit concentration. New coinages catch the excitement. The night-sky is “carbon-paper-dark” and the speaker (now addressing himself, and us, as “you”) merges with the machine – which seems to have a new ribbon as well as fresh paper: “There’s ribbonsmudge on your fingers / and a new sheet of foolscap rolled into place on the platen.” Do we own our words as we once did, when putting them down meant hammering them on to actual paper, adding our muscle power to the printed text? Do they excite us as much? Such questions only hover, of course, but they are in the air, and in this poem, waiting for the future to answer. Matthew Francis’s most recent poetry collection is a lively retelling of the first four stories of the Welsh epic, The Mabinogi, recently issued as a Faber paperback. His most recent novel, The Book of the Needle, was published by Cinnamon Press in 2014."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"technology/2018/jul/03/hoverboards-why-they-havent-got-off-to-a-mcflying-start","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-07-03T05:00:30Z","webTitle":"Hoverboards: why they haven't got off to a McFlying start","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jul/03/hoverboards-why-they-havent-got-off-to-a-mcflying-start","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/jul/03/hoverboards-why-they-havent-got-off-to-a-mcflying-start","fields":{"headline":"Hoverboards: why they haven't got off to a McFlying start","bodyText":"We could start by saying “they” didn’t promise us hoverboards. People want hoverboards because they saw one in the disappointing sequel Back to the Future Part II . But that doesn’t mean people haven’t tried to make them. Like other colourful retrofuturist fantasies, hoverboards were a lustmotif that spoke to a whole generation in the way that flying cars and jetpacks did to baby boomers. Problem No 1: how would this thing hover? We have four choices: some type of thrust, a cushion of air, maglev or magic. If it sits on a cushion of air, it is probably a hovercraft, which have been around since the 1960s. One alarming effort by Airboard originally claimed to be a genuine hoverboard but turned out to be a personal hovercraft, looking more like an industrial floor scrubber you can ride. Essentially a floaty scooter, its noisy internal combustion engine allows it to bob about menacingly on a cushion of air, with a drive wheel on the ground to steer it. Looks fun but it doesn’t hover, isn’t a board, and people just don’t want to be seen on a giant lawnmower. If our hoverboard uses maglev – and we have a few examples of those – it inconveniently requires superconductors, cooled with liquid nitrogen to around -135C. Naturally, it also requires a magnetic surface. But they do look the part. First up, California-based company Arx Pax’s Hendo hoverboard. Watching the demo, it feels ostensibly close to that skateboard ideal – it looks a riot to ride, with whooping trialists gleefully floating about 15cm above the floor. But on closer inspection, it screeches like a defective train and is so hard to control even professional skateboarder Tony Hawk spins like a top until he is flung off. And unfortunately the battery lasts just a few minutes. And $10,000 (£7,500) a pop? Next! But what if this tech were extended to an entire skatepark, as carmaker Lexus has done with its Slide hoverboard? Perhaps the closest example yet to Marty’s machine, this gadget houses a liquid nitrogen-cooled superconductor to float above a hidden magnetic track. It keeps the board in place using “quantum locking” – a property of type 2 superconductors that overcomes the tendency of magnets to wobble off and repel each other, using a sort of magnetic, sticky “vortex”. Slide certainly brings us a mite closer to Marty – it looks the part, glides quietly – but there’s no getting away from the fact that, as with any maglev, it needs a special surface. It might be well hidden but there’s still a magnetic track under that skatepark. And that won’t satiate a public hungry for Marty McFly kicks. What about conventional thrust propulsion? The US company ArcaSpace comes admirably close to the ideal with its ArcaBoard. It’s capable of hovering a foot in the air, by dint of its 36 electric propellers generating 200kg of lift controlled by onboard balancing tech to help stabilise it. You can even control it using an app on your smartphone, which is neat. You might only be able to catch some sweet air on this for three minutes, but it’s surely a great start. The drawback – ah, there’s always a drawback – is that there’s no disguising the fact that it looks like a mattress with fans on it. It hardly radiates skateboard chic, and many may balk at forking out $15,000 for a flying carpet. And there doesn’t seem to be much evidence that the rider can control it. What’s the point of a skateboard you can’t do sick tricks on? Then you’ve got flyboards. These are not so much floaty skateboards as flying platforms. The best known example is perhaps Franky Zapata’s jet-propelled Flyboard Air, which evolved from an earlier invention, those funky-looking water-jetpack gizmos also called flyboards – you may have seen beautiful people enjoying them on YouTube. The Flyboard Air is a jet-powered “personal aerial vehicle” capable of vertical takeoff and landing, and can fly at a height of 150 metres at 87mph. While it has obvious emergency and military applications, it was designed to be flown safely, sans licence, by almost anyone who takes a shine to it. A flight lasts 12 minutes but Zapata anticipates longer trips in the future. Canadian inventor Alexander Duru’s Omni Hoverboard is a similar contrivance, which uses fans to create the requisite thrust. It’s essentially a large, rideable drone – think giant desk fan with bootstraps. Its first iteration wormed its way into the Guinness World Records book in the rather uncrowded category of longest hoverboard flight – 276 metres – and the firm is working on a consumer version. Both of these, like many of the drone-derived technologies arriving on the scene, look great fun – even practical – but the nagging problem is … they aren’t skateboards. Last but definitely least are those upright, dweeby, hands-free Segways marketed as hoverboards by Swegways, Airwheels and so on, readily available at any Argos. On any given day, one might see poseurs trundling along the pavement on them, upsetting dogs.

The business secretary, Greg Clark, said it was vital the debate moved on to the need for seamless movement of workers, given that services accounted for 80% of the UK economy. “So far ... the debate has focused mainly on goods,” he said. “About how our new customs arrangements with the EU need to keep the borders flowing and avoid costly delays and paperwork. But in order to provide services, it is people who must not be held up.” Clark said UK businesses had regularly raised the need for the frictionless movement of staff to continue and he had got the message “loud and clear”. “I completely understand when companies say that they rely on efficient mobility as it currently stands, raising concerns that restricting people’s ability to travel at short notice would be as damaging to our economy as frictions and disruption at our borders,” he told a Liverpool business festival. Clark, a key ally of the prime minister who sits on her Brexit sub-committee, said fresh trade deals with countries outside the EU would not compensate for new barriers to selling services in Europe. “We need to recognise that the EU is by far and away the single biggest consumer of our services exports,” he said. About £90bn of services were exported to the EU in 2016, more than the UK’s next eight largest partners combined. “This extraordinary performance has been built on the back of established trading relationships with the EU,” he said. “As we leave the European Union, we must deliberately set out to maintain these rights and introduce as few new barriers to trade in services as possible. This is every bit as important as avoiding barriers in manufactured goods.” Debate over the UK’s future customs arrangement, and the consequences for the border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic, has dominated proceedings in recent months, with the cabinet disagreeing over two future customs models. Clark sits on a working group examining the “maximum facilitation” model, where technology would be used on the border to minimise the need for customs checks. He is known to favour the alternative option, a customs partnership, where the UK would collect tariffs on behalf of the EU, eliminating the need for some new border checks. Clark said that for British manufacturers, selling a product such as a Rolls Royce engine was often the beginning of a relationship to provide more profitable services, such as maintenance contracts. He cited the example of the aircraft manufacturer Airbus, which employs 14,000 people at 25 sites in Britain. Its employees made 18,000 trips to France in 2017, with the company operating an internal shuttle between its site at Broughton and those in Bristol and Toulouse, ferrying about 50 employees a day. After Clark’s speech, the chief executive of Airbus confirmed it was considering cutting thousands of jobs in the UK as it started to “press the button on crisis actions” over Brexit concerns. The company said it was considering dropping plans to build aircraft wings in British factories because of concerns that EU regulations would no longer apply from March 2019 and uncertainty over customs procedures, instead moving production to North America, China or elsewhere in the EU."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2018/jun/22/keepy-uppy-review-york-theatre-royal-football","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-22T10:03:06Z","webTitle":"Keepy Uppy review – back-of-the-net football fun","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/jun/22/keepy-uppy-review-york-theatre-royal-football","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/jun/22/keepy-uppy-review-york-theatre-royal-football","fields":{"headline":"Keepy Uppy review – back-of-the-net football fun","bodyText":"As England pursue World Cup glory, the hero of Tutti Frutti’s new show for children aged three and above has more modest footballing ambitions. Joey just wants to make it to the pitch in time to play in the cup final, but life keeps getting in the way. There’s not much to Evan Placey’s script, which has a sparse but appealing storybook quality, as the action is confined to one morning and the various mishaps encountered by Joey and his mum on the way to the big match. Laundry blunders, pharmacy trips and missing half-time oranges are delays to the journey and excuses for ingenious visual sequences – the real star players in this game. Director Wendy Harris captures the vivid imagination of childhood, when one thing can effortlessly transform into another. With resourceful simplicity, the breakfast table becomes a football pitch, a water bottle becomes a rocket on its way to the stars, and Joey’s prized football is everything from a shower head to a snowball. As Joey and his mum, Danny Childs and Eden Dominique are an exuberant double act, their balletic kicks, flicks and turns revealing the art in the beautiful game. There are moments that stretch the premise to breaking point, but Tutti Frutti are brilliant at showing the triumph in the everyday. Despite the title, Keepy Uppy is less about football than it is about the bond between mother and son, who together can turn even the dullest chore into an adventure. In the end, whether or not Joey scores his big goal doesn’t really matter, as long as his number one supporter is on the touchline. Expectant England fans, of course, might take a slightly different view. At York Theatre Royal until 23 June. Box office: 01904 623568.

At a conference organised by the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, where BBFC director David Austin gave the keynote speech, results from the organisation’s five-yearly public consultation indicated increased concern about such scenes, meaning certification guidelines may become stricter. As part of the consultation, members of the public were asked to evaluate the BBFC’s decision on a number of films that included “sexual or sexualised violence” that were given a 15 certificate. These included Wind River, a “crime western” written and directed by Taylor Sheridan; US horror film Don’t Breathe; and The Innocents, a French-made drama about brutalised nuns during the second world war, directed by Anne Fontaine. In a statement to the Guardian, the BBFC said that a number of the films “might have been more appropriately restricted to 18”. In the case of The Innocents – which was given a PG13 certificate in the US – the initial conclusion was that a 15 certificate was correct. The BBFC is now partway through the second stage of its consultation, which surveys around 10,000 members of the public. The BBFC statement says: “It is premature to say what adjustments might finally be made to [our] guidelines but it is certainly fair to say that the [research] suggests heightened public concerns about the issue of sexual violence and some desire for a further tightening of our already strict standards at 15.” At present, the BBFC’s guidelines state: “Any depiction of sadistic or sexual violence which is likely to pose a harm risk will be subject to intervention through classification, cuts or even, as a last resort, a refusal to classify.” Films with a 12A certificate may contain sexual violence that is “implied or briefly and discreetly indicated, and its depiction must be justified by context”, while in 15-certificate films “there may be detailed verbal references to sexual violence but the depiction of sexual violence must be discreet and justified by context”. Previous BBFC research has emphasised public concern over such material, particularly scenes that “make sexual or sadistic violence look appealing, reinforce the suggestion that victims enjoy rape [and] invite viewer complicity in rape or other harmful violent activities”. In the past, cuts have been demanded from films as varied as No Orchids for Miss Blandish, Psycho, Deliverance and Emmanuelle, while in 1988 the Jodie Foster rape drama The Accused was passed uncut with an 18 certificate “on the grounds that it does not exploit or eroticise sexual violence but is intended to make a serious point”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jun/22/brother-probably-bipolar-making-parents-lives-misery","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-22T11:23:26Z","webTitle":"My brother has mental health issues and his behaviour is making my parents’ lives a misery","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/22/brother-probably-bipolar-making-parents-lives-misery","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/22/brother-probably-bipolar-making-parents-lives-misery","fields":{"headline":"My brother has mental health issues and his behaviour is making my parents’ lives a misery","bodyText":"My brother is 27 and had his first seizure after leaving school.

Townsend has made eight changes for Saturday’s match in Resistencia from the side beaten by the USA, seven at forward. He may have left a number of players at home for a tour that started in Canada but the defeat by a side that had never before beaten a tier-one nation was a considerable setback. “I have learned a lot on this tour about this group,” Townsend said. “We have exposed more players to Test rugby and we believe that will put us in a much better position in the future. It will help us for the season ahead and beyond.” The hooker and captain, Stuart McInally, returns from injury while the second-row Tim Swinson is the only survivor at forward with Townsend expecting Argentina to look to dominate up front. However, the Pumas have become neither one thing nor the other after sacrificing their traditional 10-man game based on set-piece dominance for a wider approach. Their series defeat against a largely experimental Wales side last week prompted their head coach, Daniel Hourcade, to announce he would be standing down after the Scotland match. The decision not to consider players who are based abroad means he has only one team from which choose, the Jaguares, limiting competition for places. Townsend said: “We have to impose our game on them; we have not done enough of that on this tour. We need to keep hold of the ball and put Argentina under pressure because when we do we look really dangerous. “The breakdown is huge in today’s game and we have to have a greater presence after a tackle.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2018/jun/25/commons-people-why-parliaments-evidence-week-is-a-national-victory","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-25T06:30:00Z","webTitle":"Commons people: why parliament's 'evidence week' is a national victory","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jun/25/commons-people-why-parliaments-evidence-week-is-a-national-victory","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jun/25/commons-people-why-parliaments-evidence-week-is-a-national-victory","fields":{"headline":"Commons people: why parliament's 'evidence week' is a national victory","bodyText":"Owen Riches has supported Ipswich Town since he could first stand. Or rather sit. It was being made to sit that launched him, aged 17, into an investigation of safe standing at football that has landed him in a parliamentary debate this week. Riches looked at the evidence from the German Bundesliga league and the safety record of Celtic, where safe standing is allowed, and started a No 10 petition that passed 100,000 signatures. As a result, there will be a debate in parliament on Monday, with safe standing championed by opposition MPs and the government benches already indicating that they are coming around to the evidence. That is how it should be. A style of government where MPs respond to our lived experiences and the emerging evidence about them and use that evidence in their role as supreme scrutineers to review how government is working. Between elections, parliament is the forum for public reasoning about decisions and the state of our society. It is supposed to be alive to shifting public concerns and to new sources of information and evidence. The trouble is, it doesn’t always work like that. Housing, IVF treatment, species monitoring, special needs education and road safety policies are just a few of the life-defining issues where affected communities struggle repeatedly to get decision-makers to pay attention to the evidence. These groups often run ahead of government in engaging expertise, self-educating and gathering data so decisions can be reasoned on the facts. For example, by demonstrating the effects of “mini-Holland” street schemes, the London Cycling Campaign has rebuffed claims they cause gridlock. The beekeepers of Somerset have engaged Exeter University to monitor hornet invasions and build a databank. We are not living in a “post-truth” society. We only need to look around at the many people and groups from all walks of life who are investigating claims and marshalling evidence to work out the nature of problems and how to tackle them. They expect parliament to be doing the same. That is why the first “evidence week” in the UK parliament, opening on Monday, is not some esoteric conversation between analysts and MPs but a national victory. Community groups from all over the UK will share personal stories of why evidence matters to them and others like them. A gym instructor is raising the absence of standards in claims about supplements; Aberdeen Multicultural Centre thinks evidence on climate change has cut through its community’s differences; Men’s Shed in Sheffield is asking for better knowledge about loneliness in older men. They are calling for parliament to make good use of evidence and expertise to shape regulations and to test them in the light of new information. To do this now, in the data age, parliament must go equipped with some new evidence tools too. Government is using algorithms, building smart cities and setting up big data projects. Assessments about which rail lines to build, deployment of troops and the likely impact of a diabetes clinic – are all based on different sources and calculations to those used even half a generation ago. How well equipped is parliament to examine that? And not only to examine. With innovations in environmental monitoring, inequality and disease modelling, and alternative sources of data, parliament could be equipped to debate the picture of the world it has been working to. Innovations in evidence could better connect policies to the real scale and causes of problems they’re designed to tackle. But MPs need to be able to sift and analyse, to ask the right questions and harness expertise from community and research bodies, and to use the full range of the incredible Commons library, 200 years old this year but state-of-the-art on analysis. We are better equipped than ever to make decisions based on sound science, and evidence week can help us hold politicians accountable for their decisions."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jun/22/joe-biden-demagogues-charlatans-are-stoking-fear","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-22T12:47:43Z","webTitle":"Demagogues and charlatans are stoking fear, says Joe Biden","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/22/joe-biden-demagogues-charlatans-are-stoking-fear","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jun/22/joe-biden-demagogues-charlatans-are-stoking-fear","fields":{"headline":"Demagogues and charlatans are stoking fear, says Joe Biden","bodyText":"The former US vice-president Joe Biden has accused “demagogues and charlatans” of stirring up voters’ fears just as they did in the 1930s as the issue of migration convulses politics on both sides of the Atlantic. Biden, seen as a potential Democratic party candidate against Donald Trump in 2020, did not mention the US president by name but linked his anti-immigrant drive and that of European populists and the far right to pre-war fascists who were willing to create scapegoats to retain their grip on power. “In ways that evoke memories of the 30s, frustrated and disaffected voters may turn instead to strongmen,” he told a conference in Copenhagen. “Demagogues and charlatans step up to stoke people’s legitimate fears and push the blame always on the other. There always has to be scapegoats. Now it is immigrants, the outsider, the other.” Biden said: “Rather than some dramatic assault on democracy, however, ... our institutions and freedoms are slowly but determinedly being sanded down, little by little, each small step designed to curb institutional safeguards and concentrate power in the hands of individual leaders. “All round the world, repressive governments are borrowing from one another’s playbook, deriding a critical free press as fake news and questioning, indeed delegitimising, an independent judicatory, hamstringing civil society with increasingly repressive laws. Taken together, they threaten democratic ideals that have been the foundation for the western world.” Biden is heading a transatlantic commission on defending democracy and was effectively launching it at a conference attended by former western leaders including Tony Blair and Nick Clegg from the UK, Stephen Harper of Canada and José María Aznar of Spain. Biden has previously criticised the Republican party’s “fake nationalism” under Trump but in Copenhagen he urged greater understanding of the concerns of blue-collar workers over matters including globalisation and migration. He said: “Voters [are] worried that politicians are not looking out for them. Borders seem less real. Terrorist attacks feel inescapable. There are fears about unrelenting migration. Some are concerned that the demographic and cultural foundations of their society are going to be forever changed or erased.” He said globalisation had deepened rifts, divorced productivity from labour and created less demand for low-skilled labour. “When people see a system dominated by elites and rigged in favour of the powerful, they are much less likely to trust democracy can deliver,” he said. Biden was unflinching in his criticism of the slide away from democracy in central and eastern Europe: “In Poland, the ruling party portrays checks and balances as impediments to achieving key national goals and then uses that pretext to stack the courts with political appointees. “Hungary’s leaders blame nefarious outsider influences [for] Hungary’s social ills and hold up illiberal democracy as the best model.” He praised the European commission’s plans to withhold budgets to countries that do not stand by democratic values as “sharp, timely and important”. The bulk of the Biden commission’s work will be into Russian interference in elections and how the west can protect itself without undermining democracy. He said the depth of Russian interference in the 2016 US elections was becoming clearer by the day. “The Kremlin wants to weaken democratic institutions, divide Europe and its core institutions of Nato and the EU, and delegitimise the rules-based international order. “That’s how Putin believes he can maintain his grip on power. Putin is more than happy to use our greatest strength – our open and vibrant societies – against us, using the internet and social media to spread disinformation and exacerbate internal divisions.” In a warning that democracy may be on the wane in the west, the conference organisers released a poll showing people in illiberal states were more likely to think government was on their side than those in free democracies, possibly reflecting the lack of debate in those societies. Clegg, the former deputy prime minister who sits on the Biden commission, said democracy had suffered a body blow because millions of voters around the world felt “the system screwed up in the banking crisis and they are now paying the consequences through no fault of their own”. He said Britain was going through “an unprecedented experiment” with its decision to leave the EU. “There is no other democracy anywhere in the modern world that invites its population to vote on its future, decides by a wafer-thin majority to go in a completely different direction to where it has been going for 40 years against the explicit and stated wishes of those that have to inhabit that future – the young.” Blair warned that faith in democracy was in decline, saying: “There is more than a mild flirtation in the west with what we can loosely call rule by the ‘strongman’ ie the leader who has supreme control over the levers of government, sets a direction and dismisses all opposition to it with varying portions of disdain or repression,” the former prime minister said “We must understand the attraction of this model since its footprint is growing.” Harper, the former Canadian prime minister, said: “Democracy is ultimately justified on its record and for a lot of our citizens in the last 30 years their outcomes have not been very good for a long period of time.” The Danish prime minister, Lars Lǿkke Rasmussen, said he was less worried by the assault on western democracy from Russia than one from allies within the western alliance. He pointed to “the tendency to withdraw from international negotiated agreements and forums – Paris, Iran ... and now the human rights council”. In attacking the G7 and questioning Nato “uncertainty is inflicted on the very foundations of our progress”, he said, adding there had to be an end to “the ambition of only putting your own country instead of seeing the big picture”. Brexit, he said, reflected the same attitude: “A desire to maximise what you gain and minimise what you give.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jun/22/legalise-medical-cannabis-uk-billy-caldwell-law-reform","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-22T12:50:13Z","webTitle":"Is it time to legalise medical cannabis in the UK?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/22/legalise-medical-cannabis-uk-billy-caldwell-law-reform","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/22/legalise-medical-cannabis-uk-billy-caldwell-law-reform","fields":{"headline":"Is it time to legalise medical cannabis in the UK?","bodyText":"In around 2700 BC, the Chinese emperor Shen Nung, revered as the father of Chinese medicine, ate the flowers of a certain pungent weed. “Medical cannabis. Stop eating. Let go. Eat more, you will see white ghosts walking around,” he wrote in his pharmocopoeia, The Herbal. “Eat long enough, you will know how to talk to the gods.” Shen Nung claimed the plant could treat more than 1,000 ailments, a citation accepted by historians as the first reference to the medicinal qualities of cannabis sativa. Five millennia later, and medicinal cannabis is the subject of fierce debate in the UK. On Saturday 16 June, the home secretary, Sajid Javid, allowed Charlotte Caldwell from Castlederg, County Tyrone, to resume the only treatment that stops her 12-year-old son, Billy, having daily, life-threatening epileptic seizures: cannabis oil containing illegal levels of the intoxicating compound THC (delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol) and CBD (cannabidiol), which is a non-psychoactive, legal cannabinoid. Just days after resuming cannabis treatment, Caldwell says her son’s condition is markedly improved. “He’s progressing well. I’m in awe of him, he keeps bouncing back.” The case has reignited the debate over medicinal cannabis in the UK, in what campaigners see as an unjustified and callous application of the law against a global backdrop of legal reform. But change is coming fast, thanks to the work of Caldwell, a tireless tornado of a woman. “People say I’m brave,” she says. “But Billy suffered numerous life-threatening seizures last week. They leave him utterly depleted – unable to lift his arm or even drink from his cup. The stuff I have to endure is nothing compared to that.” Caldwell began treatment with the oil in the US, where medicinal cannabis is largely legal, in 2016. Her GP, Brendan O’Hare, then prescribed it, and Billy became the first person to receive a prescription for the drug in the UK. A year ago the Home Office ordered O’Hare to stop prescribing it, prompting Caldwell to fly with Billy to Canada to obtain fresh, legal supplies. On 11 June, Caldwell openly smuggled seven 40ml bottles – a two-month supply – of the oil, made by Canadian firm Tilray, into Heathrow. As it contained 2% THC – banned in the UK in concentrations above 0.3% – customs officials had to confiscate it. Some were said to be in tears as they did. During the past 19 months of cannabis treatment, Billy’s seizures had stopped. What was a highlight during that period, I ask Charlotte. “A few months back, Billy’s balance improved so much I was able to buy him trainers instead of special-needs boots,” she says. “I was so excited, I got him three pairs. Normal, wee Nike trainers. It was amazing.” Following the confiscation of his medicine, Billy began to have seizures again and was admitted to London’s Chelsea and Westminster hospital five days later, sparking a political and, perhaps, moral crisis that was resolved only when Javid granted an individual exemption to the Misuse of Drugs Act. The government has since announced that it will assemble an expert panel to review the law. But time is short: Billy is only allowed the medicine for the next 20 days, and only under hospital supervision. “MPs say they will assemble an expert panel led by clinicians, and I applaud that,” says Caldwell. “How soon will this happen? When will it produce recommendations and when will they be implemented?”David Nutt, a former government adviser on drugs, says it is time for a comprehensive shift in policy. “It could – and should – be a turning point,” he says. “His licence is only for 20 days and it must be used in hospital. They will need a new approach to let him out and this must then apply to other cases. Hopefully, we can adopt a policy such as that of Germany, which recognises more than 50 indications for medicinal cannabis, and avoid more lives being threatened, as Billy’s was.” Billy’s exemption does not mean the law has changed overnight, says Harry Sumnall, a professor in substance use at Liverpool John Moores University. “This does not necessarily pave the way for access to cannabis for others. That would require a comprehensive review of drugs and medicines regulations.” There are four cannabinoid medicines licensed in the EU, with another, Epidiolex, likely to be licensed in the coming year for treatment-resistant epilepsy syndromes. In the UK, only the THC-containing Sativex oral spray is licensed as a cannabis medicine – for adult MS patients. However, it is rarely prescribed off-label for other conditions, due to its high cost. Underlying all this is the human endocannabinoid system (ECS), a neuromodulatory system. It consists of three elements: cannabinoid receptors, naturally occurring or “endogenous” cannabinoids (such as anandamide, which is responsible for the “high” experienced by long-distance runners) and the enzymes that synthesise and degrade these endocannabinoids. Cannabinoid receptors are distributed throughout the body, from the gut to the bladder, kidneys, liver, lungs, heart and brain. Sleep, mood, appetite, fertility and libido are affected by the ECS, and cannabis products activate or influence all these processes. Legal reform, though overdue, is partly hampered by the complexity of the plant, which contains hundreds of chemicals. That means established methods of medicinal regulation and research are hard to apply, creating a chicken-and-egg situation. Until the drug is removed from its place in the schedule 1 list, which asserts that the plant has no medicinal use, testing cannot be carried out easily. Sumnall is in favour of reform, but says the emerging industry is plagued by non-scientific methods. Is cannabis oil the new snake oil then? Sumnall notes that some sources claim the drug can treat more than 30 wildly varying conditions, from cystitis and depression to Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s. “Despite positive reports of symptom relief from patients, formal medicinal product licensing requires demonstration of safety and efficacy in accordance with scientific norms. This is not to deny that cannabis products might bring relief, but patient experiences are different from the types of evidence needed for medicine development,” he adds. “There is an element of snake oil here, undoubtedly,” says Gavin Sathianathan of pressure group United Patients Alliance and Forma Holdings, which develops businesses in legal medical cannabis markets around the world. “But that would not be possible if we had well-written, well-enforced regulation.” Steve Moore of thinktank Volteface says reform is urgently required. “Parents should not have to break the law to keep their children alive,” he says. “Now is the time for change.” Today, that change seems to be approaching. “I have now come to the conclusion that this is the right time to review the scheduling of cannabis,” said Javid on Tuesday, overturning decades of needless, damaging inertia. Dame Sally Davies, the chief medical officer for England, will oversee medical applications to use the drug on a case-by-case basis in a process she said would be more “clinically led”. Caldwell remains undeterred by all the talk of the complexity of rewriting British drug laws.

Women’s Aid said a survey of some of the most vulnerable women they have supported, who were unable to access a refuge immediately, found 12%, were forced to sleep rough before making contact, including pregnant women and women with children. Others had even given up the search and stayed with their abuser. The 264 women surveyed were being supported through the No Woman Turned Away project, which works with women who were unable to secure a refuge place through calling the national domestic violence helpline and had a number of complex needs, such as having children or mental health problems. Almost half, 46%, were forced to sofa-surf during their wait for a refuge space, of which 65 did so with their children; and nearly one in ten, 8%, gave up their search and stayed with the abuser. Government funding for refuges is under threat, prompting warnings that the number of spaces available could reduce further and lead to more women sleeping rough. The government plans to remove refuges and other forms of short-term supported housing from the welfare system. It would mean women escaping abusive partners would not be able to pay for their accommodation using housing benefit, the last guaranteed source of income available to refuges. The benefit makes up an average 53% of refuge funding. Katie Ghose, the chief executive of Women’s Aid, said: “Statutory agencies need to stop putting obstacles in the way of women fleeing domestic abuse and start supporting them to safety. “It is no wonder that women and their children who are literally fleeing for their lives end up sleeping rough or returning to an abusive partner if they are turned away from services who should be helping them.” She said the report showed that survivors needed the specialist support provided by domestic abuse services when they were at their most vulnerable. “We’re calling on the government to give survivors a cast-iron guarantee that their dangerous planned changes to how refuges will be funded are firmly off the table and that refuges will be protected. “We want to work with the government to develop a sustainable funding model for all domestic abuse support services so that every woman and child can receive the support they need to help build a life free from abuse.” Of the women supported by the project, nearly 100 approached their local housing team for support. More than half of them, 54%, were prevented from making a homeless application, which meant they were refused help with emergency accommodation. Nearly a quarter, 23%, were told they were not a priority need despite having multiple vulnerabilities, and 15% were required to provide proof they had experienced domestic abuse. The government is introducing a domestic abuse bill, which has recently closed to consultation. It is heavily focused on criminal justice measures and includes proposals to ban suspects from contacting their victims, drinking alcohol or taking drugs. There are also plans to electronically tag suspects as part of a new civil protection order. Women’s Aid and other groups have said the measures will be ineffective without a bedrock of support services to care for survivors of abuse. • In the UK, the domestic violence helpline is 0808 2000 247. In Australia, the national family violence counselling service is on 1800 737 732. In the US, the domestic violence hotline is 1-800-799-SAFE (7233).

The confirmation clearly stated: “No need to call to reconfirm this reservation.” We arrived at the hotel at 9pm to discover that no booking had been received and we would have to find accommodation elsewhere. We called Expedia, which seemed oblivious to the stress for two women in a foreign country late at night with nowhere to stay. We were on the phone for two-and-a-half hours while it offered inferior hotels or a room with a shared bed. The calls kept disconnecting while we were kept on hold, and Expedia never once called back – we had to ring and go through the initial screening process each time. Eventually, around midnight, we were told rooms had been found at a hotel across town and we had to accept. The call disconnected while we were on hold and, after an hour, we called the alternative hotel ourselves. The manager said he had rooms spare but had received no call from Expedia, so we had to fund a taxi to get there and pay the £220 for the rooms ourselves. By then, it was 1am, and I was starting to feel ill with the stress. Next morning I had to spend another three hours on the hotel phone negotiating with Expedia either to find us alternative accommodation, or pay for where we were. Yet again, I was put on hold for up to an hour at a time. It eventually agreed to pay for our stay at the new hotel and offered money towards our meals, but insisted I claim back the first night’s accommodation, phone and taxi expenses once back in the UK. We had lost half a night and a morning of our holiday. Moreover, we’d booked and paid for a traditional Moroccan hotel in the city centre and ended up in a modern hotel with poor food in the countryside, and had to pay £44 for a taxi into town each day. On my return I asked for a refund of the extra £285 I’d had to spend, but all I’ve been offered is a £75 voucher. DH, Southsea, Hampshire It’s a disgrace that more than six weeks after receiving your complaint, Expedia had done nothing to atone for your spoiled £800 holiday. Within a day of hearing from the Observer, however, it was galvanised into action. It offered to refund your expenses in what it calls a “goodwill gesture,” and added £100 compensation and £200 in vouchers should you wish to risk your leisure time with it again. In an abrupt statement it says it apologises for the stress but declines to explain how it messed up so appallingly.

Hold my beer","bodyText":"John Cleese has railed against the “Lazy, fat, beer-sodden, pseudo-French Belgian bastards” who failed to show sufficient enthusiasm at a recent gig in Hasselt, an inoffensive medieval city in Limburg province with the misfortune to have a stadium large enough to accommodate him. I can’t work out if this was post-bad-gig petulance, Clarkson-lite banter or genuine antipathy to Belgium as the cradle of the EU, given that Cleese is a member of Artists 4 Brexit, declaring he “doesn’t want to be ruled by a bunch of European bureaucrats”. Regardless, he is wrong. And not just because Hasselt is Dutch-speaking (he later corrected his tweet to “pseudo-Dutch”, which is at least linguistically accurate). I feel obliged to defend Belgium’s honour, as a non-Belgian but long-time resident of this small, strange country. The fact that I am about to leave after 12 years has only fanned the flames of my outrage. I am already viewing Belgium and Belgians with tearful, rose-tinted nostalgia. My surreal encounters with local administration, the time the post office ran out of stamps (actually, the post office generally) and run-ins with my saxophonist neighbour are all forgotten. From Simenon to Stromae, this place and its people are perfect (and they were doing surrealism long before Monty Python, incidentally). Let me crush Cleese’s calumnies in turn. Lazy? It seems a bit misguided to start throwing this one around as the Red Devils, Belgium’s astonishingly successful football team, start their World Cup campaign. The Devils – who at their best are fast, fluid and a delight to watch – have been described as “genuine challengers” for this summer’s title. Just wait until they are dancing elegant rings around England next Thursday and then tell me Belgians are lazy, John. Then there’s heptathlete Nafi Thiam, the spectacular 6ft superwoman who stole Jessica Ennis-Hill’s crown at the Rio Olympics. And what about cycling? Take any road on any weekend in Belgium and you will meet a terrifying onslaught of not just Mamils (middle-aged men in Lycra), but every demographic, peddling furiously through their conveniently flat land. Also, wasn’t this a comedy gig? What exactly was Cleese hoping for – a spontaneous outbreak of high-intensity circuit training between gags? Fat? Is it possible to get fat in Belgium? Emphatically, yes. After my first summer job here, I waddled back to England nearly a stone heavier from gorging on pralines for pennies, triple-cooked chips and face-sized waffles covered in chocolate sauce. Belgium is a place of magnificent indulgence, where no coffee comes without its speculoos biscuit, no beer without its selection of savoury nibbles. In 2014, a petition was even launched to have the Belgian frite recognised as Unesco cultural heritage; the fritkot – the traditional shack where a usually irascible man slathers one of 95 pale pink sauces on to a giant cone of frites whilst possibly also frying you a puck of grey mystery meat – won that status nationally in 2017. Even so, Belgian obesity rates are below the EU average: four points lower than the UK’s men, nine lower for women. Admittedly these figures are provided by Eurostat, “a bunch of European bureaucrats” par excellence. Anecdotally, however, I can assure Cleese that most Belgians – and especially Flemish Belgians (such as the ones he would have encountered in Hasselt) – of my acquaintance are tall, slim Übermenschen: their calves rope-like knots of muscle from all that cycling, hair lustrous, eyes bright. Flemish cities are inspiringly progressive places: a paradise of bikes lanes, community compost heaps and organic allotments. Ghent introduced a meat-free day way back in 2009. And the beer-swilling? I must concede this one. My first boss here in Brussels reportedly insisted on a personal beer fridge rider in his contract when he joined the firm. Beer is served at office seminars, in soft-play centres and school fetes. But in 2018 when everything, literally everything, is a flaming heap of refuse, would you begrudge us a little hop-based comfort? You are probably wondering why I, a non-Belgian, am defending a country that isn’t even mine. Shouldn’t a Belgian be doing this? I think it’s because Belgians don’t really care. Responses to Cleese’s tweet were mainly jokey: “The one exciting thing that happened to us this year was to be insulted by you,” wrote one. Another declared herself “honoured and proud”. A sense of huffy national pride is utterly alien to the Belgian psyche: it’s one of the things I love best about this place. Their country may be the butt of jokes across Europe, but Belgians are too busy eating small biscuits and drinking beer to mind. This is why Belgium needs people like me to defend its honour: cut this wonderful, surreal, underrated land and I will bleed – fatty, beery blood. • Emma Beddington is a freelance writer"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/22/high-court-backs-uk-refusal-to-issue-gender-neutral-passports","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-22T11:22:37Z","webTitle":"High court backs UK’s refusal to issue gender-neutral passports","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/22/high-court-backs-uk-refusal-to-issue-gender-neutral-passports","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/22/high-court-backs-uk-refusal-to-issue-gender-neutral-passports","fields":{"headline":"High court backs UK’s refusal to issue gender-neutral passports","bodyText":"The equality campaigner Christie Elan-Cane has lost a high court challenge against the UK government’s refusal to issue gender-neutral, or X, passports. Mr Justice Jeremy Baker upheld Home Office policy after the court was told it would affect other legislation, cost too much to change computer records and increase the need for consular support abroad for gender-neutral British citizens. Elan-Cane, who has pursued the issue for more than 25 years, has claimed that non-gendered people suffer discrimination and are being deprived of their “legitimate identity”. UK passports restrict sex designations to male or female. Ten countries permit their citizens to opt for a third category, X, or unknown. Canada was the most recent to offer its citizens gender-neutral passports. Other country that allow a third option are Australia, Denmark, Germany, Malta, New Zealand, Pakistan, India, Ireland and Nepal. X passports are approved by the ICAO, the UN agency that regulates international air travel. During the hearing, Kate Gallafent QC, for Elan-Cane, argued that HM Passport Office policy breaches the right to respect for private life, and the right not to be discriminated against on the basis of gender or sex, under the European convention on human rights (ECHR). She said: “For the claimant, obtaining and using a passport currently involves making a false declaration as to the nature of the claimant’s gender identity, which causes the claimant considerable distress.” Sir James Eadie QC, on behalf of the home secretary, submitted that the policy did not interfere with rights under the ECHR. He argued that if the policy constituted an interference with article 8 – the right to respect for private life – it was justified by the need to “maintain an administratively coherent system for the recognition of gender”, to maintain security and to combat identity theft and fraud, and “to ensure security at national borders”. In his decision, Baker said: “The government is currently collecting and collating research material with a view to undertaking a comprehensive review of the issues both surrounding and those raised directly by the claimant in this case … [Elan-Cane] will be entitled to scrutinise with care the results of the government’s current review, which will be required to be undertaken without any undue delay.” Elan-Cane said: “I am bitterly disappointed that my case for the judicial review of the UK government’s discriminatory passport policy was not upheld. Not just for myself but for everyone who is compromised by this policy. “The UK’s passport application process requires applicants to declare whether they are male or female. It is inappropriate and wrong that someone who defines as neither should be forced to make that declaration.” Elan-Cane, who was represented pro-bono by the law firm Clifford Chance, is considering whether or not to appeal. Narind Singh, a partner at the firm, said: “Gender identity is a fundamental part of an individual’s intimate, personal identity and X passports are a crucial step in the protection of the human rights of this group of individuals, who otherwise face an unacceptable choice between forgoing a passport, and making a false declaration, and using a passport which misrepresents their identity. “We are considering with Christie the possibility of seeking leave to appeal today’s judgment. We will continue to assist Christie in this fight. We welcome the court’s ruling that Christie will be entitled to scrutinise the outcome of the review that the government is undertaking, and we will continue to assist Christie to hold the government to account.”Tom Mountford, a barrister who also represented Elan-Cane, said: “In this decision, the UK courts have, for the first time, recognised that the right to respect for an individual’s private life, guaranteed by article 8 of the European convention on human rights, includes the right to respect for the fundamental identity of non-gendered, intersex, trans and non-binary people identifying as neither, or not exclusively, male or female.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/live/2018/jun/22/royal-ascot-2018-day-four-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-22T17:34:11Z","webTitle":"Royal Ascot 2018: Alpha Centauri storms to Coronation Stakes win – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2018/jun/22/royal-ascot-2018-day-four-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2018/jun/22/royal-ascot-2018-day-four-live","fields":{"headline":"Royal Ascot 2018: Alpha Centauri storms to Coronation Stakes win – as it happened","bodyText":"The fourth day is over and there’s no doubting what the highlight was. Indeed, Alpha Centauri’s win was the standout equine display of the week. It was none too shabby a performance from her trainer, Jessica Harrington, either. The Irish trainer is best known for her exploits over jumps. She has won the Champion Hurdle, the Champion Chase and the Gold Cup at the Cheltenham Festival and while she has had classy horses on the Flat this was her first Group One winner in Britain and her first at Royal Ascot. The official handicapper is rating Alpha Centauri the best Coronation Stakes winner for many years and that’s no surprise. We don’t know yet where she will be racing next but racing followers can’t wait. Don’t forget to join us tomorrow – it’s a Saturday and that will mean the biggest crowd of the week. The adding of an extra (weekend) day has been superbly successful and helped popularise Britain’s premier Flat meeting. Crystal Ocean should strut his stuff in the Hardwicke Stakes and the Diamond Jubilee sprint features a fascinating clash between the Australian challenger Redkirk Warrior and the brilliant Godolphin runner Harry Angel. The sun will be shining and you’ll have no excuse. Fire up the laptop and we’ll be here from around midday onwards. 1 Dash Of Spice (S De Sousa) 7-2 Fav 2 Sir Chauvelin (D Tudhope) 33-1 3 Walton Street (W Buick) 7-1 4 Appeared (Andrea Atzeni) 8-1 And they’re off ...

Dash Of Spice takes the lead and clears away ... 4-1 Dash Of Spice 6-1 Thundering Blue 15-2 Eynhallow 15-2 Walton Street 17-2 Count Calabash 10-1 Appeared Full betting here Beaten only by a very well handicapped rival in this race last year, Appeared is just 2lb higher and will be a big player if in the same form as the rest of Roger Varian’s older horses this year. 1 Agrotera (J P Spencer) 11-2 Fav 2 Ortiz (Hollie Doyle) 66-1 3 Escape The City (K T O’Neill) 66-1 4 Desert Diamond (Josephine Gordon) 10-1 And they’re off ... Why We Dream and Betty F are off fast ... with Perfection all on her own on the farside ... Ortiz is making a move ... Qazyna going well ... Agrotera comes through to grab the spoils and land a proper gamble. Jessica Harrington has been back on ITV Racing and said she will discuss plans for Alpha Centauri with the owners. Would be wonderful to see the winner at the Breeders’ Cup later in the year and though she was coy on that idea it would seem to be an obvious plan given the owner’s history of sending top-class horses there. Eqtidaar clung on for victory in the Commonwealth Cup at Royal Ascot. Sir Michael Stoute’s three-year-old had failed to win in three starts since making a successful racecourse debut at Nottingham last summer, and was sent off at 12-1 for what looked another hot renewal of this six-furlong Group One. Stoute was saddling his third winner of the week and said: “We’ve always liked this horse. When he ran here in the Pavilion Stakes last year it didn’t go quite right for him and at Newbury (last time) he was on the wrong side of the track and at halfway he was beaten. Angus Gold, racing manager for winning owner Sheikh Hamdan Al Maktoum, said: “They always thought a lot of him after he won first time out. He disappointed at Kempton and he came back full off muck and he scoped dirty. We’ve not discussed his future. It was just nice to get that under the belt. He’s top of our league, obviously. Let’s see what Sir Michael and Sheikh Hamdan want to do. He is quite a big, long horse and in terms of the July Cup, whether that [Newmarket] is his track, I’m not sure.” PA 11-2 Agrotera 11-1 Ganayem 12-1 Desert Diamond 12-1 Hence 12-1 Qazyna 14-1 Ceilidhs Dream 14-1 Poetic Charm Full betting here A big-field handicap featuring lightly raced fillies is no one’s ideal punting vehicle but Poetic Charm looks over-priced at 14-1. She showed a good level of ability last year, when she won two of her three starts, but is bred to be better this year, being a daughter of Dubawi. While she is unraced since September, Charlie Appleby’s three-year-olds have been flying along this year at a 33% strike-rate, with the Derby just one of many prizes that have fallen to them, and it would not be a complete surprise if she had been saved with this in mind. Jessica Harrington, the winning trainer of the Coronation Stakes, has been talking to ITV Racing about that exciting performance by Alpha Centauri. We didn’t get any wiser about what the plan might be as she wasn’t asked unfortunately. All racing fans will be keen to discover where this horse runs next. 1 Alpha Centauri (C O’Donoghue) 11-4 Fav 2 Threading (W Buick) 7-1 3 Veracious (L Dettori) 14-1 And they’re off ... Aim Of Artemis is running wide ... Veracious has the lead and Aim Of Artemis joins the main pack ... Veracious goes for home but Alpha Centauri challenges and goes clear ... And that was the most impressive single performance of the week ... That was a joy to watch and that filly is going to take some beating in future races. 3-1 Alpha Centauri 11-2 Clemmie 6-1 Billesdon Brook 8-1 Teppal 8-1 Threading 10-1 Veracious 12-1 Coeur De Beaute Full betting here To underestimate a filly once is unfortunate but to do it twice would be reprehensible, particularly in the case of Billesdon Brook, whose Guineas success looks a very solid piece of form indeed. Those that finished in the next six places have advertised the quality of that race again and again and she can show up her doubters by landing the Coronation Stakes on day four at Royal Ascot. The Oaks runner-up and the French Oaks winner were among those she beat fair and square that day. Nor was it the first time she had shown impressive speed on fast ground. She gets her ground again and looks the right bet at 13-2, despite a nagging doubt about the form of her stable. 1 Eqtidaar (Jim Crowley) 12-1 2 Sands Of Mali (P Hanagan) 15-2 3 Emblazoned (L Dettori) 12-1 And they’re off ... Main Desire missed the kick ... Unfortunately well outpaced ... Abel Handy is prominent ... Gidu goes well ... Emblazoned and Eqtidaar come through and Eqtidaar gets there ... That’s a third winner for Sir Michael Stoute this week, the winner benefiting from a collapse in the pace. Sioux Nation was a huge disappointment and came under pressure from halfway. Sands Of Mali made a lot of ground up to finish second and was a big eyecatcher. Sioux Nation is strongly fancied for the Commonwealth Cup ... Old Persian was a clear-cut winner of the King Edward VII Stakes at Royal Ascot. Charlie Appleby saddled Masar to win the Derby at Epsom and was enjoying his second Royal Ascot winner of the week following Blue Point’s triumph in the King’s Stand on Tuesday. He said: “Last season we had a great team of two-year-olds, they all wintered well and came into the spring in great nick. This horse has done nothing but progress through the spring. Will [Buick] made a great manoeuvre after the first two or three furlongs to sit on Frankie’s [Dettori, on Raa Atoll] quarters and once he hit the front I was confident he would see it out well. I’m delighted for the team. We’ll enjoy today and regroup over the next week or two.” PA 3-1 Sioux Nation 11-2 Equilateral 6-1 Invincible Army 9-1 Sands of mali 16-1 Eqtidaar 18-1 Emblazoned 25-1 Fleet Review 25-1 Main Desire Full betting here Aidan O’Brien could be in for a big finish to the week, as his Sioux Nation gives him a big chance here, in a race he won last year. A son of Scat Daddy, who has proved such a strong influence for top-class speed, he won the Norfolk at Royal Ascot last year, followed up in a Group One in Ireland and promised better to come with the way he won his warm-up race for this at Naas last month. Equilateral is worth a try at this level, having won a novice contest so easily at Doncaster last month, but his stable has been short of winners lately, for all that a couple of stablemates have gone close here this week. 1 Old Persian (W Buick) 9-2 2 Rostropovich (D O’Brien) 7-1 3 Giuseppe Garibaldi (J A Heffernan) 15-2 And they’re off ... Raa Atoll leads from Rostropovich ... Old Persian has moved into second ... Frankie has slowed the pace in front seemingly ... Old Persian leads with Guiseppe Garibaldi trying to make ground ... but Old Persian holds on ... Godolphin have another winner this week and their trainer, Charlie Appleby, is having an excellent season highlighted by his victory with Masar in the Derby. Main Edition maintained her unbeaten record with victory in the Albany Stakes at Royal Ascot. Mark Johnston’s filly followed up her debut win at Windsor with a runaway success at Goodwood three weeks ago and she was a 7-1 shot stepped up to Group Three level in Berkshire. Johnston said: “We came here knowing that she was pretty useful after two runs and two wins. We think our team of two-year-old fillies this year is very strong and this is was one of the leading bunch. It’s great for her and it says a lot for all the others as well.” Paddy Power introduced the winner at 16-1 for next year’s 1000 Guineas, with RaceBets going 14-1. Johnston said: “I think it’s very early days to talk about that, although we were joking with the owner that we’d be back here next year for the Coronation Stakes after she’s won the Guineas! The media and the bookies will all start talking about it now, but there’s a lot of big two-year-old races before we come round to that. Let’s get this year out of the way and see where she stands.” PA 5-2 Delano Roosevelt 4-1 Raa Atoll 7-1 Old Persian 15-2 Rostropovich 8-1 Giuseppe Garibaldi 11-1 Wells Farhh Go 18-1 Elector 33-1 Highbrow 66-1 Alternative Fact Full betting here It’s 14 years since Aidan O’Brien won this race for the one and only time, which is a bit worrying because few trainers would have suitable runners for this race as often as he would. But he’s having a good week with three-year-old colts that weren’t quite up to Classic level, following the wins of Hunting Horn and Kew Gardens, so it could be worth giving another chance to Delano Roosevelt. He stayed on to be sixth in the Derby and may do better around this more conventional track. The unexposed Wells Farhh Go is an interesting alternative. There was some potentially significant news for the sport released last night when it was announced that Ascot would start publishing sectional timing at the track. It’s a topic I’ve been coming back to ALL my racing life - and I started in racing journalism in 1986. How can we start to analyse a race unless we have the means to use times? It starts with the race commentary and phrases such as “looks a good pace” etc. I don’t blame the commentators though. They have no idea because we are not seeing times as they are being run. How can those who study racing analyse fully afterwards unless we have the recorded sectionals of the race? How can racing be sold as a mature betting medium unless the sport does this? The only way we started to realise about how good Tuesday’s impressive Royal Ascot winner Calyx was was through the clock. Chris Cook wrote about the announcement in a story the Guardian published yesterday. You can read all about it here: 1 Main Edition (James Doyle) 7-1 2 La Pelosa (W Buick) 12-1 3 Fairyland (J A Heffernan) 5-2 And they’re off ... Stillwater Cove is already four lengths clear ... Main Edition leads on the nearside ... Fairyland is finishing well ... Main Edition still leads ... and holds on from La Pelosa ... The winning filly was highly rated by her trainer Mark Johnston and could prove pretty useful. The favourite, Just Wonderful, is not bred to be ideally suited by six furlongs and is one to note when back over farther. The bookies are getting worried ... 9-4 Just Wonderful 100-30 Fairyland 8-1 main Edition 11-1 Angels Hideaway 12-1 La Pelosa 20-1 Byrons Bay 20-1 Octave Full betting here Mark Johnston seems to have a smart juvenile in Main Edition, unbeaten in her two runs so far and an impressive winner at Goodwood three weeks ago after travelling kindly round that tricky course. She’s a half-sister to one Royal Ascot winner, Beachfire, and also to the classy Major Cadeaux, beaten less than a length in the Coventry. Wesley Ward put in a good word for his Stillwater Cove after another of his youngsters won yesterday but his two-year-old winners at Ascot have been over five furlongs and the last 200 yards here might be a stretch for the US raider. It is just under 20 minutes before the first race of the afternoon on day four at Royal Ascot and Sioux Nation, in the Commonwealth Cup, looks like being the best-backed runner of the day. Aidan O’Brien’s sprinter has emerged as the 7-2 favourite for the first Group One of the day, while Equilateral, who was vying for top spot in the market this morning, has drifted out by a point to a top price of 5-1. Another of Ryan Moore’s mounts, Delano Roosvelt in the King Edward VII Stakes, is also attracting solid support and is now top-priced at 5-2 having been available at 3-1 this morning. Raa Atoll, Frankie Dettori’s partner in the same race, is also popular and is in to 4-1 (from 5-1), while Old Persian is on the drift and out to 13-2 to give William Buick his third winner of the week. A couple of fillies at each-way prices have attracted support in the Coronation Stakes. Teppal has been nibbled at from 10-1 earlier in the day and is now top-priced at 17-2, while Mark Johnston’s Threading, briefly available at prices up to 12-1 earlier on, is now no bigger than 8-1. 1st Green 2-1 fav And here are the runners and riders ... 1st Carriage THE QUEEN The Earl of Snowdon Mr. Peter Troughton Mr. John Warren 2nd Carriage Sir Nicholas Bacon Lady Bacon The Hon.

It’s almost that time ... for the royal procession down the centre of the track. I attended a Serpentine gallery exhibition by artist Mark Wallinger back in 1994 when one of his installations, called ‘Royal Ascot’, consisted of a series of video monitors on top of wheeled flight cases, each isolating the royal carriage’s leisurely progress down the track on the Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday (respectively, as it was then) of the meeting with the added TV commentary. The British Council described the work thus: ‘Simultaneous footage exposes precise choreography: the Queen’s frozen smile and rigid curls, the tilt of her head, her gloved wave, the Duke of Edinburgh raising his top hat, the national anthem striking up. Appropriately for an event whose media coverage focuses on the parade of hats and dresses rather than the sport, here we have a close-up on clothes, on the Queen’s dolly mixture of pinks, tangerines, limes; the difference from day to day is barely discernible, just as the four BBC commentaries merge in a confused blather. This repetition of imagery, all backed by bright green turf, brings into play Andy Warhol’s late screenprints of Elizabeth II from his ‘Reigning Queens’ series (1985), a quartet of the postage stamp icon in camp conjugations of Hollywood make-up and bubblegum colours.’ The Duke of Edinburgh, who has retired from royal duties and apparently hated his trips down the road from Windsor Castle to the races, is missing but little else has changed including the blather. This is last year’s ITV broadcast. See if you can spot the difference ... Continuing our series on why not to travel by train to Royal Ascot, the Dominican jockey Joel Rosario featured in a diary item in the Times today. For those that can’t get over the paywall here is the piece: ‘Joel Rosario who coaxed home Shang Shang Shang to win the opening Norfolk Stakes [on Thursday] by a nose, revealed that he has learnt from previous experience at the royal meeting. After he rode his previous winner there, No Nay Never in the same race back in 2013, he took the train back to London. Anyone who has taken that journey during the royal meeting will tell you that it’s an unpleasant experience and Rosario said: “I’m taking a taxi back today”.’ Enough said. I can pass on some good news about the carriage horses who smashed their way into a clothes shop on Ascot High Street yesterday. Both will recover form their injuries and there is no danger to their lives, according to two grooms I spoke to who were working with other carriage horses here on Friday morning. The grooms did not wish to be named because they work for a rival firm to the one whose carriage was involved in the crash. However, they say that the horses involved are based this week at the same Windsor-area stable as their team and report that both have survived with nothing more serious than cuts and abrasions. The carriages are typically pulled by four horses and none of the four involved in Thursday’s crash are working on Friday; only the leading pair were apparently injured, when they collided with a shop window after bolting downhill and across a roundabout. A witness described one of the horses as lying on its side on the pavement while onlookers tried to stem the flow of blood from its side. A horse ambulance arrived soon after and it appears efforts to save the horse have been successful. After three days of pointing backers in the right direction this week this could get tricky. My titfer tipster is plumping for purple but one thing is sure this has been a glum week for layers offering odds on the monarch’s Hat Stakes and apparently green is the colour of choice for backers today. “Last year was one of the best ever but after three days of the public predicting the correct colour of the Queen’s hat, this has resulted in the most expensive for this particular novelty bet on record at Royal Ascot,” said Alexander Kostin of Bonuscodebets.co.uk. Today’s betting: 2-1 Green, 3-1 Orange, 4-1 White, 5-1 Blue, 5-1 Purple, 6-1 Pink, 10-1 Red, 20-1 Silver, 25-1 Gold, 50-1 Black. 2.30 Albany Stakes Main Edition 13-2 3.05 King Edward VII Stakes Delano Roosevelt 3-1 3.40 Commonwealth Cup Sioux Nation 9-2 4.20 Coronation Stakes Billesdon Brook 6-1 5.00 Queen’s Vase Poetic Charm 14-1 5.35 Duke of Edinburgh Handicap Appeared 11-1 Some restraint has taken over here, with four tips at 13-2 or shorter and two of them from the Aidan O’Brien yard which started the week poorly but has since found its stride, much as it did at Royal Ascot last year. Delano Roosevelt, Sioux Nation plus the Guineas winner to repeat in the Coronation counts as a pretty conservative set of tips by my standards, although in this case a lot of people seem to have decided the Guineas winner cannot be trusted to follow up. John Gosden 4 wins Aidan O’Brien 3 Sir Michael Stoute 2 Charlie Appleby 1 Willie Mullins 1 Marco Botti 1 Eve Johnson Houghton 1 David Marnane 1 John Quinn 1 Simon Crisford 1 Mark Johnston 1 Wesley Ward 1 Like his jockey, Gosden will be ruing defeat for First Eleven in the last race yesterday. O’Brien is 1-2 with most firms to be top trainer by the end of racing on Saturday, while Gosden is available at 13-8. In other news, Wesley Ward is a winner at Ascot for the sixth year in a row and the 10th time in all. Frankie Dettori 4 wins Ryan Moore 3 William Buick 2 Andrea Atzeni 2 Oisin Murphy 1 Charles Bishop 1 James Doyle 1 Billy Lee 1 James McDonald 1 Silvestre de Sousa 1 Joel Rosario 1 Ryan Moore closed the gap with a double yesterday, than Frankie went back in front with Gold Cup victory. But there was a sting in the tail of the Italian’s day, as he was undoubtedly on the best handicapped horse, First Eleven, in the King George V but couldn’t get a clear run and finished only third. “That’s horse racing,” he told me grimly as he returned with the saddle. It is also the reason why he’s on offer at 6-4 with several firms to end the Royal meeting as top jockey, while Moore is odds-on. 2.30 Albany Stakes Mark Johnston seems to have a smart juvenile in Main Edition, unbeaten in her two runs so far and an impressive winner at Goodwood three weeks ago after travelling kindly round that tricky course. She’s a half-sister to one Royal Ascot winner, Beachfire, and also to the classy Major Cadeaux, beaten less than a length in the Coventry. Wesley Ward put in a good word for his Stillwater Cove after another of his youngsters won yesterday but his two-year-old winners at Ascot have been over five furlongs and the last 200 yards here might be a stretch for the US raider. 3.05 King Edward VII Stakes It’s 14 years since Aidan O’Brien won this race for the one and only time, which is a bit worrying because few trainers would have suitable runners for this race as often as he would. But he’s having a good week with three-year-old colts that weren’t quite up to Classic level, following the wins of Hunting Horn and Kew Gardens, so it could be worth giving another chance to Delano Roosevelt. He stayed on to be sixth in the Derby and may do better around this more conventional track. The unexposed Wells Farhh Go is an interesting alternative. 3.40 Commonwealth Cup O’Brien could be in for a big finish to the week, as his Sioux Nation gives him a big chance here, in a race he won last year. A son of Scat Daddy, who has proved such a strong influence for top-class speed, he won the Norfolk at Royal Ascot last year, followed up in a Group One in Ireland and promised better to come with the way he won his warm-up race for this at Naas last month. Equilateral is worth a try at this level, having won a novice contest so easily at Doncaster last month, but his stable has been short of winners lately, for all that a couple of stablemates have gone close here this week. 4.20 Coronation Stakes To underestimate a filly once is unfortunate but to do it twice would be reprehensible, particularly in the case of Billesdon Brook, whose Guineas success looks a very solid piece of form indeed. Those that finished in the next six places have advertised the quality of that race again and again and she can show up her doubters by landing the Coronation Stakes on day four at Royal Ascot. The Oaks runner-up and the French Oaks winner were among those she beat fair and square that day. Nor was it the first time she had shown impressive speed on fast ground. She gets her ground again and looks the right bet at 13-2, despite a nagging doubt about the form of her stable. 5.00 Sandringham Handicap A big-field handicap featuring lightly raced fillies is no one’s ideal punting vehicle but Poetic Charm looks over-priced at 14-1. She showed a good level of ability last year, when she won two of her three starts, but is bred to be better this year, being a daughter of Dubawi. While she is unraced since September, Charlie Appleby’s three-year-olds have been flying along this year at a 33% strike-rate, with the Derby just one of many prizes that have fallen to them, and it would not be a complete surprise if she had been saved with this in mind. 5.35 Duke Of Edinburgh Handicap Beaten only by a very well handicapped rival in this race last year, Appeared is just 2lb higher and will be a big player if in the same form as the rest of Roger Varian’s older horses this year.

The last of those was an eight-length success, which takes some doing in any company, but he still has plenty to find on paper to trouble Sioux Nation. Victory for Sioux Nation would be a big boost for Ryan Moore in his attempt to finish the meeting as the leading jockey for the eighth time in nine years, and Friday looks a lot like it needs to be “moving day” for Moore, who starts the day one win behind Frankie Dettori. Moore rides the likely favourite in the first three races and the second-favourite in the fourth, while the shortest-priced runner in Dettori’s book of rides is Raa Atoll, a 5-1 chance for the King Edward VII Stakes at 3.05. The fourth day at Royal Ascot was once something of the week’s poor relation, the place where some of the meeting’s less significant events were washed up when the event expanded to five days and there was nowhere else to put them. It has been much revived, though, by the arrival of the Group One Commonwealth Cup three years ago to support the Coronation Stakes, which just goes to show what can be achieved when you are willing to bend the rules just a little. There are roughly 10,000 horse races in Britain each year and only 36 of those have the Group One status, which puts them at the very pinnacle of the pyramid. It is supposed to be earned over a period of years, or even decades, rather than handed out on request. It does seem to help when those doing the requesting have a connection to the Queen, however. The Commonwealth Cup was a Group One from the word go and it has certainly delivered on its promise, swiftly becoming a rival for the Coronation Stakes as the feature event of the afternoon. Last year’s renewal was the best yet, as Caravaggio beat Harry Angel, a subsequent dual Group One winner and the favourite for Saturday’s Diamond Jubilee Stakes, and Blue Point, who took the King’s Stand Stakes here on Tuesday. Caravaggio was odds-on to beat 11 opponents 12 months ago, but this year’s Commonwealth Cup provides a very different challenge for the punters, with a full field of 22 runners due to go to post and two horses – Sioux Nation and Equilateral – vying for favouritism at 4-1 (the same price as the market leader for the 28-runner Wokingham Handicap tomorrow) …"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"travel/2018/jul/09/best-nightlife-hong-kong-old-town-central","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2018-07-09T12:52:52Z","webTitle":"The best nightlife in Hong Kong's Old Town Central","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/jul/09/best-nightlife-hong-kong-old-town-central","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2018/jul/09/best-nightlife-hong-kong-old-town-central","fields":{"headline":"The best nightlife in Hong Kong's Old Town Central","bodyText":"Hong Kong’s Central district lies at the very heart of the city, encompassing soaring towers and historic edifices. It’s also home to some of the city’s very best nightlife, from the all-night partying of Lan Kwai Fong to some cutting-edge cocktail establishments. But which is your perfect venue? Here’s everything you need to know about Old Town Central’s nightlife scene. For the bright young thing The central nightlife drag of Lan Kwai Fong can offer a messy night out or an altogether classier evening, depending on which establishment catches your eye. One of the most high-class – and physically highest – is Cé La Vi, sitting right at the top of the California Tower building. This bar and club’s main selling point is its stunning open-air rooftop terrace, which allows you to soak in the glow of the surrounding buildings and peer down to people-watch the misguided revellers of Lan Kwai Fong far below. • 25/F, California Tower, 30-32 D’Aguilar Street, Central, +852 3700 2300, hk.celavi.com For the lefty intellectual Club 71 is a Hong Kong institution. Hidden down the quiet Man Hing Lane alley just off the antiques strip of Hollywood Road, the city’s foremost countercultural bar has long been the watering hole of choice for the city’s left-leaning journalists, activists and authors. The bar was once named Club 64, an ironic allusion to the 4 June Tiananmen Square crackdown. When it moved locations it changed to 71, similarly ironically named after Hong Kong’s national day. Order a drink and take it to the large public park just outside, which is co-opted in the evenings into 71’s beer garden. Next door, T:ME bar (B/F, 65 Hollywood Road, Central) is one of the most welcoming gay bars in the city. • B/F, 67 Hollywood Road, Central, +852 2858 7071, no website For the sake fiend Bar Sake Central doesn’t seem like it’s in the right place for one of the city’s most intimate, atmospheric watering holes. Why? It’s hidden behind a dark curtain in a large, well-lit retail space in the PMQ arts development. But nesting in among all the shelf space stacked high with sake bottles and paraphernalia is a dimly lit 16-seat venue with a continually rotating list of Japanese sakes from across the country, served in gorgeous, paper-thin glassware. There’s also a seasonal menu of otsumami – Japanese “drinking snacks” – that won’t be tied down to a single cuisine, with pork belly agnolotti pasta on offer alongside Cantonese-style squid rice, or tempura made with market-fresh vegetables. Make sure to order a glass of the unpasteurised draft sake, which tastes as if it’s come straight from the brewery – grassy, fruity and overwhelmingly fresh. • S109-113, Block A, PMQ, 35 Aberdeen Street, Central, sake-central.com For the mescal master If you’re after a tequila slammer, you’re in the wrong joint. Mezcal is tequila’s smokier, less refined cousin, run through with a distinctly vegetal flavour. Owner and mezcal fanatic Jay Khan makes regular trips to Mexico’s Oaxaca region to source the 90-strong mezcal menu at Coa – including a few that have never before made it beyond Mexico. There are drinks from every kind of agave plant, each with a unique tasting profile. Khan even has a few bottles of Mezcal de Pechuga, in which the liquor is redistilled under fruits, spices, and – yes – a raw chicken breast. The result is a distinctly savoury tang. If you’re in search of something a little lighter in the Hong Kong heat, the house-fermented pineapple and cinnamon tepache hits the spot. So too does the Oaxacan Paloma, a mix of mezcal, tequila and grapefruit soda, served in a glass lined with pink worm salt – which is pretty much what you think it is. • 6-10 Shin Hing Street, Central, (+852) 2813-5787, coa.com.hk For the cocktail connoisseur The Old Man is inspired by Ernest Hemingway, and an arty portrait of the author looks down upon all who step through the doors of this tiny, extraordinary, cocktail bar. Owned by three of the city’s best mixologists, the drinks here are just as Hemingway himself would have wanted them: strong, superb, and affordable. Well, affordable for Hong Kong, at any rate: all drinks cost $90 (£8.70), which is a rare surprise in a town where cocktails often cost twice as much. Tipples are classic with a twist: Death In The Afternoon is made with absinthe, sparkling wine and a coconut pandan froth, while Farewell To Arms is an intriguing take on a dirty martini, made with butter fat-washed gin, dry vermouth, salted Pernod and nori seaweed dust. • LG/F, 37-39 Aberdeen Street, Central, +852 2703 1899, theoldmanhk.com For the sensitive soul Built into the top two floors of a historic pre-WWII tenement building, Sense 99 is a cool classic of Central. Its lower floor boasts unpretentious drinks, high ceilings and quirky Hong Kong-inspired décor: keep an eye out for the beautiful original floor tiling. Upstairs, there’s a much more intimate vibe, as musicians and gifted (and not-so-gifted) amateurs come to jam on the instruments littered around the room. There’s almost always a few people noodling away, and anyone at all is welcome to join in. If you’ve played your heart out – or if the music is getting a little too “experimental” – then the open-air balcony is a cool, calm place to chat into the early hours. • 2-3/F, 99F Wellington Street, Central, +852 9466 4695, on Facebook"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/25/trial-of-doctor-85-put-spain-in-dock-over-stolen-babies","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-25T04:00:50Z","webTitle":"Trial of doctor, 85, puts Spain in dock over ‘stolen babies’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/25/trial-of-doctor-85-put-spain-in-dock-over-stolen-babies","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/25/trial-of-doctor-85-put-spain-in-dock-over-stolen-babies","fields":{"headline":"Trial of doctor, 85, puts Spain in dock over ‘stolen babies’","bodyText":"An 85-year-old doctor accused of abducting a newborn girl from her mother almost half a century ago will appear in court in Madrid this week, becoming the first person to stand trial over Spain’s long and infamous “stolen babies” scandal. Thousands of families are thought to have been caught up in the illegal practice, which began shortly after the end of the Spanish civil war and continued until well after the death of the dictator, Francisco Franco, in 1975. Some estimates suggested that as many as 300,000 babies may have been taken from their birth mothers and placed with other families who supported the Franco regime. Among those women targeted were single mothers, those with “degenerate” political views or those from poor backgrounds. Eduardo Vela, who worked as a gynaecologist at the San Ramón clinic in the Spanish capital, is alleged to have separated Inés Madrigal from her biological mother in the spring of 1969 and given her to the 46-year-old woman who was falsely certified as her birth mother and who would raise her. Vela faces an 11-year sentence if convicted of unlawful detention, falsifying official documents and certifying a non-existent birth. A nun who worked with him at the clinic had been due to face trial five years ago but died days before she was set to appear in court. Madrigal, who is now 49, says her mother told her the truth when she turned 18 and had supported her daughter’s efforts to discover more about her origins until she died two years ago aged 93. “I always say she didn’t give birth to me but I was born in her heart,” Madrigal told the Guardian. “She lived to look after me and see me happy.” Madrigal, a railway worker and president of the Murcia branch of the SOS Stolen Babies association, said that she did not expect the two-day trial to yield the answers she had spent years searching for. “Obviously I don’t think that Eduardo Vela is going to tell me the truth,” she said. “He’s not going to tell me who my mother is or about the circumstances in which I was taken from her. I’m not so naive as to believe that’s going to happen but I’d love it if we could get the records of all the women who gave birth at the San Ramón clinic. But that probably won’t happen and I have to resign myself to reality. I’m just hoping there’s a favourable sentence.” Far more important, said Madrigal, was the trial’s potential to give rise to similar actions and see thousands of shelved cases reopened: “This is a really important issue because, for 60 years, we were the baby supermarket for Europe and for South America, not just Spain.” Madrigal’s lawyer, Guillermo Peña, said that while Spanish police had known about the scandal since at least 1981, years of cover-ups had ensured that the activities at the San Ramón clinic remained opaque to this day. “We know what the East German border police and Stasi did,” he said. “But when it comes to the stolen babies, we’re talking about a more closely guarded secret than the elixir of eternal youth. There’s just no way of finding certain files and records.” Peña said Madrigal’s case offered Spain a chance to move past the sociological and psychological barriers of the past and recognise what had happened to so many families. “It’s about making sure that nobody can doubt that or or say it was made up by some mothers and fathers who couldn’t get over the death of their children,” he said. “No. This happened here. And if there’s one conviction, many more could follow.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/22/un-envoy-confident-of-yemen-deal-to-prevent-hodeidah-port-violence","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-22T09:32:17Z","webTitle":"UN envoy confident of Yemen deal to prevent Hodeidah port violence","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/22/un-envoy-confident-of-yemen-deal-to-prevent-hodeidah-port-violence","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/22/un-envoy-confident-of-yemen-deal-to-prevent-hodeidah-port-violence","fields":{"headline":"UN envoy confident of Yemen deal to prevent Hodeidah port violence","bodyText":"The UN’s special envoy to Yemen has expressed confidence that a deal can be struck between Houthi forces and the Saudi-backed Yemeni government to prevent an escalation of violence around the strategic port of Hodeidah. The rebel-held Red Sea port – the distribution point for more than 70% of the aid reaching Yemen – is under assault from an array of forces, including those of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Martin Griffiths is negotiating a ceasefire in which Hodeidah port would be handed over to full UN control and its revenues channelled to the Yemeni state bank. He held talks with the Houthi leadership in the Yemeni capital, Sana’a, and said he was “encouraged by the constructive engagement”. In a statement he said he expected to meet shortly with President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, the leader of the UN-recognised Yemeni government. Hadi has been in exile and heavily dependent on Saudi sponsorship. The Houthi terms for handing the port to UN control have not yet met the conditions set by the Saudi-led coalition, and Griffiths warned “further military escalation would have severe political and humanitarian consequences”. The UAE’s foreign minister, Anwar Gargash, has demanded an unconditional withdrawal of all Houthi forces from Hodeidah and claimed Houthi forces were seeking to “manufacture a humanitarian crisis” by blocking aid from being unloaded at the port and destroying supplies of water in the city’s residential areas. But Amnesty International has accused coalition forces of deliberately delaying unloading of aid from the port over months, adding that its actions amounted to collective punishment and a war crime. Amnesty said in a new 22-page report, entitled Stranglehold, that since 2015 the coalition had repeatedly tightened its blockade of the two Houthi-controlled ports of Saleef and Hodeidah, seriously impeding Yemenis’ access to food. Using the cover of enforcing a UN arms embargo, the Saudis were slowing the docking of ships by carrying out inspections that delayed vessels by an average of 120 hours in March and 74 hours in April this year, the report said. The inspections were duplicating UN inspections of ships that had been introduced in 2015 after Saudi protests that Houthis were using aid convoys to smuggle Iranian arms. The Saudis, under a deal brokered with the UN, are permitted additional inspections to those carried out by the UN, and if necessary can divert boats to a different port for full inspection. Amnesty had tracked one shipment that was delayed for 50 days after it was cleared for unloading by the UN. A second was delayed for 46 days and a third for 24 days. Only one of the delays had been notified to the UN security council by the Saudi coalition as required under the UN agreement, Amnesty said. Lynn Maalouf, Amnesty’s Middle East director, said: “The time that these inspections are taking is effectively obstructing the flow of humanitarian aid and essential goods, and that is why we have found that this could amount to collective punishment blockades that cause substantial, disproportionate harm to civilians are prohibited under international law.” Amnesty also criticised Houthi distribution of aid, including the delays it imposed on aid workers seeking to distribute food out of Sana’a warehouses. Houthis were also seeking to direct the groups to which aid was distributed and demanding bribes to release food from warehouses. In a sign that the crisis could escalate, despite the UN envoy’s optimism, Gargash said: “The UN, international aid groups and the media report Houthi militia are purposefully and deliberately seeking to manufacture a humanitarian crisis and exacerbate conditions in the port and city. “The Houthis are blocking offloading of aid at Hodeida port; destroying water and sewage supplies.” He claimed Houthis were planting improvised explosive devices and other explosives in the city. He said it was increasingly urgent that the Houthis leave the city unconditionally. Reporters in Hodeidah said the Houthis were digging defences while civilians were largely staying in their homes. A collapse in water supplies in Yemen’s hot summer would be a disaster, aid groups said. The UAE is largely overseeing the offensive on Hodeidah with a 20,000-strong force consisting mostly of Yemenis gathered from southern separatists, Red Sea coastal plain fighters and followers of a nephew of the late president Ali Abdullah Saleh. These forces have captured western coastal towns to form a narrow strip of control from the UAE’s southern bases to the port. The coalition has captured the airport, but will need to enter more densely inhabited areas either to take the port or to cut off the main road out of Hodeidah."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/jun/24/tit-for-tat-tariff-battle-could-spark-downturn-in-global-economy-bis","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-24T10:47:04Z","webTitle":"Tit-for-tat tariff battle could spark downturn in global economy – BIS","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/24/tit-for-tat-tariff-battle-could-spark-downturn-in-global-economy-bis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jun/24/tit-for-tat-tariff-battle-could-spark-downturn-in-global-economy-bis","fields":{"headline":"Tit-for-tat tariff battle could spark downturn in global economy – BIS","bodyText":"An escalation of protectionist measures could spark a fresh downturn just as the global economy is picking itself up after the last one, the international body that represents the world’s central banks has warned. The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) said there were already signs that “the ratcheting up of rhetoric” was weighing on investment. It comes as Donald Trump steps up hostility with some of the US’s key trading partners and allies, raising fears of a full-blown trade war. What began with tariffs imposed on steel and aluminium imported into the US has turned into a broader trade battle with trading partners including China and the EU, as they respond with retaliatory measures. The US president is threatening Beijing with tariffs on $200bn of goods imported from China and on Friday Trump threatened to impose tariffs on European cars after Brussels introduced levies on American goods such as Levi’s jeans, bourbon whiskey and Harley-Davidson motorbikes. Agustín Carstens, the general manager of BIS, said an increase in protectionist measures was a key vulnerability in the global economy that threatened to undermine growth and could spread to financial markets. “One possible trigger of an economic slowdown or downturn could be an escalation of protectionist measures. Its impact could be very significant, if such escalation was seen as threatening the open multilateral trading system. “Indeed, there are signs that the rise in uncertainty associated with the first protectionist steps and the ratcheting up of rhetoric have already been inhibiting investment.” In its annual report on the challenges facing the global economy, BIS said that the ultra-low interest rates implemented by central banks as an emergency response to the financial crisis had served the global economy well but said loose monetary policy was posing a threat to stability. “Ten years after the start of the global crisis, central bankers should feel satisfied with the state of the global economy, after expansionary and unconventional monetary policies were left to bear the burden of recovery,” Carstens said. “But this has left a legacy of higher debts on public and private balance sheets. Still reliant on central bank support and with less room for manoeuvre. Central banks cannot continue be the only game in town.” Carstens said normalisation of monetary policy – raising rates and unwinding other measures such as quantitative easing – was essential “to rebuild policy space”. The process has begun in the US, with the Federal Reserve raising rates earlier this month for a second time this year and signalling more increases will follow in 2018. The European Central Bank has also announced plans to phase out its bond-buying programme by the end of the year after propping up the eurozone economy for the past three years. On Thursday, the prospect of a rate rise in August strengthened when the Bank of England’s chief economist, Andy Haldane, joined two other members of the monetary policy committee voting for an immediate increase in borrowing costs. Carstens said BIS was satisfied with the way the Fed and the ECB were communicating their plans, giving markets plenty of warning. He added: “With this normalisation process, we expect that more volatility will be in the markets but its should be kept relatively under control.” BIS said governments should also play their part in the recovery by keeping public finances under control and not overspending. “[Governments] must ensure the sustainability of public sector finances and avoid procyclical fiscal expansions. The importance of this issue cannot be emphasised enough.” It warned that in some countries the banking system was still not fully healed after the financial crisis, creating vulnerabilities in some economies."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jun/22/live-exports-licence-revoked-for-owners-of-awassi-express","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-22T08:13:38Z","webTitle":"Live exports licence suspended for Australia's biggest operator","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jun/22/live-exports-licence-revoked-for-owners-of-awassi-express","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jun/22/live-exports-licence-revoked-for-owners-of-awassi-express","fields":{"headline":"Live exports licence suspended for Australia's biggest operator","bodyText":"The federal government has suspended the licence of the company at the centre of shocking footage of live sheep exports that sparked calls to ban the trade in the northern summer. The Department of Agriculture and Water Resources announced on Friday that it has suspended the live export licence of Emanuel Exports pending a full review of the company’s response to a show cause notice. The decision to suspend Emanuel – the company that stocked the Awassi Express, which lost 2,400 sheep due to heat stress in 2017 – effectively knocks out 50% of the live sheep export industry, pending the review into a separate incident. RSPCA Australia senior policy officer, Jed Goodfellow, told Guardian Australia the Al Shuwaikh livestock carrier was due to arrive in Fremantle to pick up another load of sheep from Emanuel which will now not be able to export them. The move follows the decision by Livestock Shipping Services to suspend its live sheep export trade, following proposed new rules reducing stocking density by 28% to improve animal welfare. Emanuel is under criminal investigation, and two departmental investigations, into the company and the Awassi voyage after allegations of overstocking, failing to have sufficient food and water available, animal injury and illness not being treated, and accredited vets and stockmen leaving vessels prior to unloading. In a statement the department said the laws that regulate the export of livestock include strict requirements to ensure the health and welfare of animals. “It is the responsibility of each exporter to ensure it meets those obligations,” it said. “The department takes those responsibilities very seriously.” The Emanuel Exports director Nicholas Daws said it would “cooperate fully with the department in its review”. “It is not appropriate to provide any further public comment until the Department has completed its review,” he said. Goodfellow said the suspension was evidence that if laws are enforced live exports would become impossible. “This is another step toward the inevitable end of cruel long-haul live sheep exports,” Goodfellow said. “Now is the time for government to put the best interests of Australian sheep producers and animals first, to provide certainty for the future, and legislate for an orderly phase-out.” In May the Turnbull government decided against a ban on live exports in favour of tougher penalties for directors who breach licence conditions and improved animal welfare measures. Liberal MP Sussan Ley, with backing from colleagues Sarah Henderson and Jason Wood, introduced a private members bill to ban live sheep exports in the northern summer from next year, and, in five years, totally ban the transport of sheep and lambs to the Middle East or to any routes through the Persian Gulf or Red Sea. The private members bill forced the Turnbull government to pull its bill to improve standards from the notice paper, because Labor intended to amend it to help Ley introduce a ban."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/jun/25/state-of-the-rugby-nations-guardian-writers-verdicts-on-the-june-tests","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-25T12:48:40Z","webTitle":"State of the rugby nations: Guardian writers' verdicts on the June Tests","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jun/25/state-of-the-rugby-nations-guardian-writers-verdicts-on-the-june-tests","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jun/25/state-of-the-rugby-nations-guardian-writers-verdicts-on-the-june-tests","fields":{"headline":"State of the rugby nations: Guardian writers' verdicts on the June Tests","bodyText":"(World rankings as of Mon 25 June; ups and downs calculated from Mon 28 May) 1 New Zealand ◀ ▶ Lethal in the second halves of the first and third Test but on the surface hard to gauge considering the hands France were dealt. Julian Savea’s confirmed move to Toulon (he is out of favour but has 46 Test tries) was another reminder of their greatest battle but in most positions there is remarkable depth and Scott Barrett was superb in the second row. Damian McKenzie is box office but his game management when called upon at No10 remains up and down. Still the team to beat by a distance though. Gerard Meagher 2 Ireland ◀ ▶ Confirmation that they are, without question, the leading lights of the northern hemisphere. Such resilience to overcome the Wallabies in Sydney at the end of a quite breathtaking series and, indeed, season for Ireland. Joe Schmidt managed to rotate his squad to the extent that only Ross Byrne did not feature and still claim Ireland’s first series win in Australia for 39 years. The depth he is striking upon is formidable – particularly in the back-row – and while it feels almost mundane to mention their half-backs, Conor Murray and Johnny Sexton remain so integral. Not so long ago the standout fixture of the coming autumn was New Zealand’s trip to Twickenham, not any more. GM 3 Wales ▲ (4 places) Wales were flatlining while England moved to second in the world rankings, armed with two Six Nations titles, but as Warren Gatland approaches his final year in charge, he has probably never had a stronger squad. Summer victories over South Africa and Argentina in a two-Test series took them to third behind Ireland and New Zealand: still some distance to go, but they look equipped for the faster, more reactive game that Test rugby now demands. Gatland has options in most positions, no longer reliant on a group that has served him for most of the decade with many showing signs of wear and tear. Paul Rees 4 England ▼ (1 place) England’s tour of South Africa had virtually everything. Fast starts, altitude sickness, sparkling tries, self-inflicted errors, belated redemption ... at times it felt like a giant game of snakes and ladders. No-one will ever know what would have happened had England prepared differently for the first two Tests at altitude; their 2-1 series defeat was particularly harsh on Jonny May, whose form from start to finish was outstanding. Doubts still remain, however, about their consistent ability to dominate sides up front even when they are comfortably ahead on the scoreboard; perhaps that will change if all their key men can report fit and fresh this autumn. The biggest conundrum remains Danny Cipriani. Even on a wet day in Cape Town unsuited to his creative talents he offered one fleeting moment of genius which could make the difference between England enjoying a successful World Cup or falling just short in Japan. He deserves to start again in November. RK 5 Australia ▼ (1 place) Getting there. The first Test victory in Brisbane was a reminder that they will be some force by next year’s World Cup but discipline became an increasing problem as the series wore on and Kurtley Beale’s try in Melbourne was one of the few times they carved Ireland open. Will Genia was badly missed after his injury in the second Test and while Michael Cheika appears to still be raging, he knows his team are more or less on track. David Pocock fitted back in seamlessly. GM 6 South Africa ◀ ▶ This was South Africa’s most encouraging series for a while. It was not just the outcome: Faf de Klerk and Duane Vermeulen were both outstanding, coach Rassie Erasmus is clearly making a difference and, slowly but surely, the nation is falling back in love with the Springboks. To see Siya Kolisi become the first black African to captain the Boks in a Test match was one of the year’s most uplifting and significant sporting moments. They should approach the Rugby Championship with renewed confidence. Robert Kitson 7 Scotland ▼ (2 places) A comfortable victory over an Argentina side that showed little resistance in Resistencia meant a rare away victory over a tier one nation for Scotland, but it did not entirely make up for the previous week’s defeat to the United States. A year ago, Scotland lost in Fiji but went on to impress in the autumn and the Six Nations. They are behind their rivals when it comes to depth, but at full tilt they are getting there. PR 8 France ◀ ▶ Reasons to feel hard done by in all three Tests against the All Blacks at the hands of officials and it is such a shame because in the first two they were competitive to say the least. The best defensive side of the Six Nations showed some of that resolve but still they do not look like one who can go for 80 minutes. If their upward curve can continue however, England will be genuinely concerned and amid all their injury problems, players such as Anthony Belleau have impressed. Fantastic to see Wesley Fofana back, too. GM 9 Fiji ▲ (1 place) Fiji lost their final Test of the window, a surprise 27-19 defeat in Lautoka by Tonga – the first time they had lost to them since 2011. But, they were crowned Pacific champions for the fourth straight year the previous week when they beat Georgia 35-17 after defeating Samoa a week earlier and that was enough to lift them above the ailing Argentinian side. Guardian sport 10 Argentina ▼ (1 place) Another wretched series prompted the Pumas’ head coach, Daniel Hourcade, to resign. The Pumas were one of the stories of the 2015 World Cup, dumping their 10-man game and attacking from all over the pitch, but after the tournament they introduced a rule that said no one would be considered for selection if they were based outside the country. It has stifled competition for places and with Hourcade continuing to preach an expansive game, they became predictable and forgot what it took to win. PR Tier two and Italy The United States’ victory over Scotland was the most impressive result this month for an emerging nation. Japan won the first Test against Italy, but given their superior position in the rankings, it was more of a surprise when they lost the following week before comfortably overcoming Georgia. The United States, who are in England’s World Cup group, defeated Russia, who will open next year’s World Cup against Japan, 62-13 a week before the Russians beat fading Canada by 23 points.

Now, the pollution, set to worsen in the approaching winter, is getting to her. “Even just going outside for a second, opening your door, your home fills with smoke, your clothes, everything smells like it,” she says moving around her ger, a spacious and neatly kept traditional Mongolian yurt, to make tea. Darii lives on the outskirts of Ulaanbaatar, an area known as the ger district or sometimes, affectionately, the “g district”, where rural migrants have collected over the last two decades. Here, gers and houses built out of wood and other scrap material creep up the hills that box in Ulaanbaatar. Every winter, as many as 220,000 households burn coal to stay warm. When families can’t afford coal they sometimes burn tyres and other scraps. The hospitals are packed every winter, as thousands of children fall sick. Visibility is so bad that two people can be walking hand in hand and not be able to see each other. Air pollution, or “smoke” as the residents call it, often reaches several times that of Beijing or Delhi. “I wanted more for my children but the air is prohibitive,” Darii says. “I’ve never seen air pollution like this before… The food, pollution, everything, is really bad in Ulaanbaatar.” Mongolia’s rural residents have flooded the capital in search of a better life. Now, as pollution worsens, officials and residents are looking for ways to lure people back to the countryside. ‘If we do not act, shall we all die?’ Today, Ulaanbaatar, a city designed to accommodate about half a million people, holds three times this number – almost half of the country’s population of three million. Harsh winters have killed off millions of livestock, forcing rural herders to the capital for work. In 2004, almost 70,000 people moved from rural areas to the city, equivalent to the population of an entire province. Since then as many as 45,000 have moved to the capital annually. Most collect in the ger district, an area officials say accounts for 80% of the city’s air pollution. Under pressure, the government decided last year to ban migration, and recently extended the ban until 2020. But high levels of pollution persist. About 15,000 people marched in Ulaanbaatar, last year protesting against the smog, in one of the country’s biggest demonstrations in years. In January, concentrations of PM2.5, breathable airborne particles, reached 3,320 micrograms per cubic meter, more than 133 times the level the World Health Organization deems safe. “If we do not act, shall we all die burning whatever we want?” asked Batbayasgalan Jantsan, the city’s deputy mayor in charge of green development. “What are the primary rights of human being?” he asks. “The right to life. The right to a healthy and safe environment. The state is obliged to provide that. The state has to protect its citizens from environmental pollution.” Many say a migration ban alone is not enough to resolve the pollution problem. The real issue, experts and locals say, is the stark divide between the city and the countryside. Erdeneburen Ravjikh, the former state secretary of Mongolia’s ministry of construction and urban development, is on a mission to reverse this mass migration and repopulate the countryside. ‘I want to go back home’ Growing up in the steppe of southern Mongolia, Erdeneburen thought a lot about how to upgrade his rural hometown, Gurvansaikhan. There was no central heating, just coal-fired metal stoves. Getting water required a mile-long trek, and the bathrooms – wooden stalls outside – were brutal during the winter when temperatures fell to as low as -40C. “I used to freeze my arse off,” he says. Most families lived in gers, and made their living by raising goats and selling cashmere. Many of the people Erdeneburen grew up with have left. He has also spent most of his adult life outside his hometown. “In order to fight air pollution, we need to develop the rural areas, to make life good so people stay,” he says. “The main reason people move to Ulaanbaatar is the quality of life – having proper heating, proper toilets, good water supply.” After four years of fundraising, designing, and construction, today, Gurvansaikhan looks more like a suburban neighbourhood dropped in the middle of the Gobi desert. Paved roads cut through the town, lined with solar-powered lamps. Residents share a wastewater treatment plant, a central heating system, and a water plant. City planners have even kept trees and shrubbery alive in the desert. Officials at the city, provincial and national level are now working on a program to encourage citizens to migrate from Ulaanbaatar to the provinces. “Creating jobs in the countryside is important. This is what citizens want. They say, ‘I want to go back home, but I need a job’,” Batbayasgalan said. Convincing people to move will take time. More than half of the country’s GDP is generated in Ulaanbaatar. Last year when unemployment in the city was 8.7%, in rural areas it was as high as 10.7%. Erdenechimeg Sanlig came to the capital from the countryside six years ago with her children, following their oldest daughter to university. She goes home once a year and always finds that not much has changed. “Having animals is difficult,” she says, sitting on a neatly made bed inside their ger, a traditional Mongolian yurt on the outskirts of Ulaanbaatar or tent. A television plays the local news. Next to a microwave, a cabinet holds a cup of toothbrushes and a roll of toilet paper. A pink table decorated with images of Disney princesses, for her three granddaughters, sits on the far side of the tent. “In the countryside our children would not find jobs. It’s better here to find jobs,” she says. Still, increasingly more residents in the ger district are growing tired of life in the capital. Many complain about the food, the congestion, as well as the pollution. Before the ban, migration to the capital had already been falling since 2014. Last year, the number of people leaving Ulaanbaatar exceeded the amount moving in for the first time since the 1990s. Zolzaya Amgalan, 32, and her husband Myanganbaatar Tsend, 41, have been here for the last three years with their son and daughter. When their son was a little more than a year old and struggling to walk, a doctor diagnosed him with rickets, and advised the family take a break in the countryside for a year. “The difference was obvious. In the countryside the air, food, everything is good for the kids,” Zolzaya said. “If there were more development [in the countryside], of course we would move. Everyone would want to move.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/bike-blog/2018/jun/26/mini-holland-schemes-have-proved-their-worth-in-outer-london-boroughs","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-26T06:00:28Z","webTitle":"'Mini-Holland' schemes have proved their worth in outer London boroughs | Peter Walker","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/bike-blog/2018/jun/26/mini-holland-schemes-have-proved-their-worth-in-outer-london-boroughs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/bike-blog/2018/jun/26/mini-holland-schemes-have-proved-their-worth-in-outer-london-boroughs","fields":{"headline":"'Mini-Holland' schemes have proved their worth in outer London boroughs","bodyText":"The so-called mini-Holland schemes – much-debated changes to boost cycling and walking in outer London boroughs – have done precisely that, according to the first formal study into their impact. The research found that after one year, people living in parts of such boroughs were, on average, walking and cycling for 41 minutes a week more than those living in comparable areas. Among the most notable elements of the study, led by Dr Rachel Aldred of Westminster University, is that while the schemes were primarily billed as seeking to boost cycling, the bigger increase in active travel came on foot – an extra 32 minutes weekly on average, with nine more minutes by bike. The research, published on Tuesday in the journal Transportation Research, studied the travel patterns of just over 1,700 people in three mini-Holland areas – Waltham Forest, Enfield and Kingston – and in various other outer London boroughs which have not seen such changes. The mini-Holland schemes were announced by Boris Johnson in his second term as London mayor, as an outer London adjunct to the new wave of separated “cycle superhighways” he began to build in the centre. The mini-Hollands included some separated lanes on main roads, but also other interventions such as systems to make certain streets access-only for motor vehicles while maintaining through routes for bikes. This made them arguably even more controversial than superhighways, with noisy early opposition including a demonstration outside Walthamstow town hall, and a failed judicial review attempt in Enfield. One of the main objections was the idea the mini-Hollands would benefit cycling at the expense other other modes. But Aldred’s study says: “We found no evidence of this. For instance, there was no evidence that time spent in cars was increasing (due to congestion), nor that walking environments were becoming less attractive due to the introduction of cycle lanes.” There was no significant reduction in overall car use in the mini-Holland areas compared with elsewhere. However, those in the boroughs experiencing the new scheme showed a change towards more positive public attitudes to cycling. It also found the changes seemed to be consistent across demographic and socioeconomic groups, going against another complaint from opponents, that cycle schemes tend to be disproportionately used by white, middle-class travellers. The paper does seem to show that a certain level of action is needed for the effects to be shown – the effects in “high-dose” mini-Holland areas, which had directly experienced change were notably stronger than “low-dose” neighbourhoods elsewhere in the borough. The study, which tracked changes between May and June 2016 and the same period a year later, discovered that people in high-dose areas were 24% more likely to have done any cycling in the previous week compared with those in non mini-Holland boroughs. While in absolute terms the average increase in walking time was greater than for cycling, at 32 minutes against nine minutes, proportionally it was the other way round, with a 13% rise for walking at an 18% increase for cycling. Aldred, who will continue to study the schemes, said it was notable to see such an impact in the first year of operation: “This includes new uptake of cycling, not just existing cyclists riding more. “It is also important to note that while the schemes are sometimes perceived as being ‘for cyclists’, they are encouraging more walking – in fact, the increase in walking is greater in absolute terms than the increase in cycling.” Dr Will Norman, who is in charge of cycling and walking under London’s current mayor, Sadiq Khan, said the mini-Hollands programme – now rebranded “Liveable Neighbourhoods” – had proved its worth. “This study is further proof that our mini-Holland programme is already making a big difference,” he said. “The fact that more people are choosing to cycle and walk more often brings huge benefits, not only to the health and wellbeing of individual Londoners but also to the wider community. I’m proud that the programme is giving all boroughs the opportunity to bid for funding to make similar positive changes to their areas.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/jun/25/nearly-150000-scottish-nhs-staff-nurses-offered-pay-rise","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-25T13:38:14Z","webTitle":"Nearly 150,000 Scottish NHS staff offered minimum 9% pay rise","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/25/nearly-150000-scottish-nhs-staff-nurses-offered-pay-rise","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/jun/25/nearly-150000-scottish-nhs-staff-nurses-offered-pay-rise","fields":{"headline":"Nearly 150,000 Scottish NHS staff offered minimum 9% pay rise","bodyText":"Scottish nurses, midwives and paramedics are on course to receive a minimum pay rise of 9% over the next three years, ending nearly a decade of pay restraint. Health service unions have recommended their members back the deal, which will affect about 147,000 NHS staff, including hospital technicians, porters, ancillary workers and pharmacists. Under the deal, employees currently earning up to £80,000 will receive a minimum cumulative rise of 9% and those earning £80,000 and over will receive a flat rate increase of £1,600 a year. Shona Robison, the Scottish health secretary, said the deal was the most generous offered to NHS workers in the UK, but was tied to an agreement about changes in sickness policy, terms and conditions, and organisational changes. It should help the NHS address significant recruitment problems in parts of Scotland, she said. Some nurses would see their wages increase by 27% by 2020-21 and some porters by 25%. “We’re doing all we can to recruit new talent and retain existing staff, ensuring NHS Scotland has the right skills and experience to meet future demand and rising expectations,” said Robison. NHS workers in England have been offered a three-year deal that would give those at the top of their bands a rise of 6.5%, with many other staff at a lower point in those bands to receive cumulative rises of 9-29% by 2020-21. Miles Briggs, the shadow Scottish health secretary, said NHS staff deserved the increase. Scottish health workers earning above £26,000 would also pay higher income tax rates than their England and Welsh counterparts, he said, adding: “It was clear that a greater uplift was needed to cover this.” The Scottish and UK governments are focusing heavily on improving NHS funding to address often significant financial and recruitment problems. NHS policy across the UK is split between the three devolved governments in Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast, and the UK government in London. Theresa May, the prime minister, has confirmed the NHS in England will receive an extra £20.5bn by 2023. Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, has already pledged NHS funding in Scotland will increase by £500m above inflation by 2021. In advance of the three-year pay deal, Sturgeon told a Scottish National party conference two weeks ago that NHS staff would get an immediate pay increase worth £160m."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/jun/25/britains-best-junior-doctors-review-celebrating-the-nhs-with-a-quiz","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-25T19:00:08Z","webTitle":"Britain’s Best Junior Doctors review – celebrating the NHS with a quiz","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/25/britains-best-junior-doctors-review-celebrating-the-nhs-with-a-quiz","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/jun/25/britains-best-junior-doctors-review-celebrating-the-nhs-with-a-quiz","fields":{"headline":"Britain’s Best Junior Doctors review – celebrating the NHS with a quiz","bodyText":"Quiz question. You live in Market Harborough in Leicestershire with your partner, who is taken ill suddenly with severe chest pains. So you bundle them into the car and speed on to the A6. Which way do you turn – north-west towards Leicester Royal Infirmary or south-east towards Kettering General? (For the purpose of my quiz, the hospitals are equidistant from Market Harborough, even if in truth they are not.) Perhaps this medical-themed quiz show (BBC Two), in which junior doctors – from those hospitals in the opening episode – compete against each other, will help us decide. Whichever hospital has the most knowledgeable junior medics is obviously the one to head for. Kind of University Challenge with a stethoscope, then, and part of a series of programmes this week celebrating the 70th birthday of the NHS. Jo Brand – who used to be a nurse – is asking the questions and telling the bum jokes. There is a resident expert for explanations, expansion and help with medical jargon. She is a serious expert, with more letters after her name than in it: Dr Helen Lawal BSc DFSRH MRCGP. Clearly, this is going to be loads of fun for doctors and student doctors, but can a medical quiz really work for the rest of us? Well, let’s take a look, shall we … Question one: this fingernail (concave, spoon-shaped, could be useful to a recreational drug user) is caused by the deficiency of which mineral? Question two: which of these injuries is most common – arm fracture, hand fracture, leg fracture, knee fracture or foot fracture? Question three: what is the name of this obstetric device? Question four: identify this human parasite. (Answers: iron, arm, ventouse, fluke worm.) In The Doctor’s Surgery, teams are given a real live patient with an actual condition and only one minute (quite realistic, maybe even generous) to come up with a diagnosis. Which Ward? is a round about specialisms. In The Operating Theatre, they have to draw where certain nerves are located on a pair of twin male models in their pants. There is a Rapid Response round, too. You know what? I don’t do too badly. I get the ventouse, because my eldest got ventoused into the world and I will never forget it: vacuum-assisted vaginal delivery; pulled out with a sink plunger, basically. And I correctly diagnose the woman’s acute glaucoma because I know another woman – my mum – who had that the other day; nearly lost her sight. And tachycardia in the quickfire round, I know that, too. So three right; that is about what I get normally on University Challenge. Whoever devised the questions did well; there is enough I-know-someone-who-had-that going on to make it engaging for the non-medic, plus a bit of I-have-almost-certainly-got-that for the hypochondriac; I will certainly be consulting Dr Google HTTPs about some of these things, including the fluke worms. Even when I did not know the answer, I could just about understand – and was interested in – what they were talking about. Lawal and Brand’s bum jokes help. Possibly not one to recommission, but for a 70th birthday celebration it was fun. That would have been a good question to ask those young docs: a 70-year-old patient is critically ill – malnourished, exhausted, dying. Do you a) switch off the machine because they are costing too much money? Or b) find more money to spend on them because they are important, you love them, they are pretty much your – and everyone else’s – mother? I know the answer to that one, too. At the end of the game, Kettering have five points, Leicester have 19. No contest: head north-west. The junior doctors at Kettering know nothing; I think even if I lived next door to Kettering General I would still head to Leicester. How the NHS Changed Our World (BBC Two) is more standard birthday fare, a five-programme series highlighting the pioneering work done in NHS hospitals. In this first, Dr Giles Yeo is at the Royal Papworth hospital to find out how they have turned heart transplant surgery from something extraordinary into something practically routine. Hello; here is a familiar face. It is Eddie McGinnis, Eddie Large of Little and Large, seven years older than the NHS. He got a new heart at Papworth. Everyone came when he went in, he remembers – his wife, his son, two daughters, Syd Little and his wife. He was really touched, “but I realise now it was for the reading of the will”.

The main thread follows four generations of a family struggling with what this means for their youngest member, Mumei.

In recent years, their live performances have become legendary for their length: if you catch them on a night when their frontman is enjoying himself, you can find yourself wondering if you’ll ever see your home and loved ones again. But tonight, hemmed in by strict curfew, they play for a little over two hours. Whether you find that a relief or disappointment doubtless reflects the depth of your devotion to the band. There are people here whose loyalty is visibly fathomless. Gentleman of a certain age still express their fealty by getting themselves up like Smith in the mid-80s, which means that even before the usual eruption of disagreements about whether to enjoy the band standing or seated, there are people struggling to see the stage past extravagant examples backcombing. Still, they don’t seem to feel too shortchanged by a set that offers a chronological journey through their album catalogue: two songs from each, the first half moving forward from their debut, the second starting with the unreleased Step into the Light and ending in 1979. It’s a journey largely conducted via b-road, until they break out a string of early singles at the end of the set, the only hit on offer is the perennially lovely Pictures of You. No matter, the audience are so devoted they greet album cuts as deep as Alt.end like hit singles. It all offers an intriguingly concise insight into the band’s development, from their beginnings as post-punk’s leading purveyors of suburban wet-weekend ennui – if you didn’t know they were from Crawley, you might have guessed they came from somewhere like it on the basis of Three Imaginary Boys’ etiolated vocal and mood of box-bedroom angst – to something richer and stranger: the misty, twilit atmosphere of At Night; the chaos of Bananafishbones, the latter, Smith notes, representative of a moment in their career “where the drugs really kicked in”. Along the way, they gradually became stadium fillers, a state of affairs that no one expected in the early 80s when critical consensus sniffily concluded they were Joy Division’s poor southern relations. It seems less inexplicable with the benefit of hindsight. On the surface, the gulf between A Strange Day, taken from 1982’s famously bleak Pornography, an album that opens with the line “it doesn’t matter if we all die” then gets progressively less jaunty from thereon in – and the widescreen gloss of 1985’s A Night Like This seems immense, but played in close proximity, you can see the roots of the latter in the former: even when staring into the nihilistic void, Smith couldn’t stop himself writing exquisite, oddly commercial melodies. The devotees would doubtless tear you limb from limb for suggesting it, but the structure of the show also means it lags in the middle. It’s not that the Cure’s more recent albums are without highlights, as evidenced by a buoyant version of The Hungry Ghost from 2008’s largely unloved 4:13 Dream; more that the songs feel laboured, as if what once came naturally started becoming harder work and the lightning of inspiration flashed less frequently, although the unreleased and airily beautiful Step into the Light suggests it may have struck again. If the forthcoming album Smith vaguely intimates between songs proves variable, well, there’s always the back catalogue, which as tonight’s scenic-route excursion proves, is a deep, varied and frequently wondrous thing."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2018/jun/25/book-of-hours-review-dundalk-louth-contemporary-music-society-gavin-bryars","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-25T15:23:47Z","webTitle":"Book of Hours review – tender minimalism to restless bravura","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jun/25/book-of-hours-review-dundalk-louth-contemporary-music-society-gavin-bryars","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/jun/25/book-of-hours-review-dundalk-louth-contemporary-music-society-gavin-bryars","fields":{"headline":"Book of Hours review – tender minimalism to restless bravura","bodyText":"A medieval Book of Hours was an intimate thing, personalised prayers decorated in gold leaf for the wealthy, or simple print for the poor. The point was to punctuate the everyday with private moments of beauty and reflection – the 15th-century equivalent of a mindfulness app. Contemporary classical music can tread awkwardly around notions such as “beautiful” and “reflective”, as though they’re anathema to complexity and intellect. Curators might court fans of the soft-grained or the tough but tend to avoid the collision. Not so at Louth Contemporary Music Society, where director Eamonn Quinn sidesteps protocol with a rogue charm and a quiet punk mettle – or maybe just a simple strategy of programming whatever he wants to hear. The location is unlikely and perfect, debunking the delusion (again) that serious art only happens in world cities. Quinn started putting on concerts in Dundalk just over a decade ago. He invited the big names (Glass, Pärt, Lucier, Wolff, Gubaidulina, Riley, Sciarrino) and to his astonishment they came, infiltrating the Irish border town with world premieres and inflamed debate over late-night noodles. The programming is un-faddish, un-cliquey, unpredictable, embracing the abstruse and the plainly sweet. This year’s edition ranged from the tender minimalism of Gavin Bryars to the saturated silences of Michael Pisaro to the restless cerebral bravura of Rebecca Saunders. And because it was all framed as a Book of Hours for our times, somehow the mix sat right: beauty and provocation given carte blanche to coexist, as any meditation might flit through multiple conflicting states. Some of the concerts were at Dundalk Gaol, a former Victorian prison where notions of time and reflection must have meant a great deal. The exquisite Gothic Voices built new music out of old: 13th-century troubadour songs leading to sweet-sour music by Karen Tanaka and Linda Buckley. Pisaro’s new score Wind &amp; Silence was the standout, setting words by Robert Lax with intent space and perspective, making the voices sound like sculptures spinning on an open prairie, wind blowing through them. Pisaro’s mighty silences can be confrontational as well as comforting. In the same space was a concert devoted to Saunders, whose music is as athletic as Pisaro’s is stately. We heard fearless performances of Caerulean from clarinettist Carol Robinson, Bite (flutist Helen Bledsoe) and Solitude (cellist Severine Ballon). But it was Juliet Fraser premiering a virtuosically limber vocal piece that stole the show. O Yes &amp; I is a stunning new Joyce setting that taps the action of a wandering mind – ideas firing so rapidly and untethered that forming actual words would slow her down. Elsewhere there was the dilated beauty of Wolfgang von Schweinitz’s KLANG auf Schön Berg La Monte Young; the fragile, forcible sound play of a new flute piece by Sciarrino; a joyous piano miniature by Gérard Pesson. True to form, the festival ended with the most unexpectedly disarming blow of all: Gavin Bryars’ seminal 1971 tape work Jesus’ Blood Never Failed Me Yet – familiar to the point of innocuousness, you might think, but with 40 local schoolkids singing and playing along, Bryars himself joining in on bass and an audience packed with nuns and mums, the experience reduced me to tears."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/25/give-angela-merkel-more-time-to-set-up-bilateral-eu-migrant-deals-say-allies-cdu-germany","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-25T12:32:31Z","webTitle":"Give Angela Merkel more time to set up EU migrant deals, say allies","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/25/give-angela-merkel-more-time-to-set-up-bilateral-eu-migrant-deals-say-allies-cdu-germany","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/25/give-angela-merkel-more-time-to-set-up-bilateral-eu-migrant-deals-say-allies-cdu-germany","fields":{"headline":"Give Angela Merkel more time to set up EU migrant deals, say allies","bodyText":"Allies of Angela Merkel have called for the German leader to be given more time to set up new bilateral migration deals with other European countries, as she returned empty-handed from an emergency mini-summit in Brussels. Sunday’s gathering of 16 European leaders had been hastily assembled to offer a lifeline to the German chancellor, as her interior minister, Horst Seehofer, is threatening to unilaterally turn away migrants already registered in another EU country at German borders unless the chancellor can come up with a European solution to the problem by 1 July. But with the unorthodox meeting failing to reach concrete conclusions, senior members of Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union have rallied around their party leader and called on its sister party, the Bavarian CSU, to adjust their expectations. “I believe there will be progress by the time of the EU summit on Thursday and Friday,” said Günther Oettinger, the European commissioner for budget and human resources. “But there won’t be an agreement of the dimension that some in the CSU are expecting.” The centre-right politician said he believed Merkel had “strong arguments for carrying out further discussions at a European level”. Armin Laschet, the CDU state premier of North-Rhine Westphalia, warned Seehofer that unilateral action on the German border could trigger a chain reaction that could damage the country’s national interest. “If we as Germany go alone now, then Italy might withdraw from the Dublin agreement and stop registering [asylum seekers], and we end up with more refugees than before,” said Laschet. “If Germany closes its borders shut and Italy doesn’t accept any returns, then the refugees would obviously in the long term end up in Italy,” said the agriculture minister, Julia Klöckner. The EU’s Dublin regulation requires asylum seekers to make their application in the first EU country they arrive in – meaning Italy and Greece currently bear a disproportionate burden. The former finance minister Wolfgang Schäuble warned that Merkel would have no choice but to relieve Seehofer of his job should he go ahead with border closures without the chancellor’s permission. “If a minister goes against the chancellor, she has no choice. She must uphold the dignity of her office,” said Schäuble, who is currently president of the German Bundestag. Meanwhile, the architect of the 2016 migration deal between the EU and Turkey said on Monday Merkel would stand her best chances of escaping from the current dilemma by concentrating on a deal between a smaller group of European states. “Those who are seeking a solution, like the German chancellor and [France’s] President Macron, have to be clear that they are only going to find a solution with the help of countries who are genuinely interested in finding one,” said Gerald Knaus, director of the European Stability Initiative thinktank. “And there you have one country offering itself up, and that’s Greece.” Reintroducing effective border controls on Germany’s southern borders, Knaus said, “would be such a dramatic intrusion in the daily life of people who live there that it would be the first step towards the collapse of the European project”. Meanwhile, on a visit to Libya, Italy’s anti-immigration interior minister, Matteo Salvini, said he had proposed setting up migrant reception centres at Libya’s southern borders to help staunch the flow of migrants across the Mediterranean Sea to Italy. Salvini, whose far-right party the League has campaigned to bar migrants fleeing Africa and expel those already in Italy, and has been in a governing coalition since the start of June, did not say in which countries such centres could be located.

In the 12 months to July 2017, figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) revealed that 95 students killed themselves, which equates to 4.7 suicides per 100,000 students. The ONS said that although overall suicide rates in students had gone up, they had not risen consistently and remained lower than among the general population. The analysis is published at a time of mounting concern about student mental health, as universities report record numbers of referrals for counselling services and amid greater media awareness of suicide among students. At the University of Bristol there have been 10 student deaths in little over 18 months. Later this week, the universities minister Sam Gyimah is hosting a student mental health summit at the University of the West of England in Bristol, where there have been two additional student deaths in the city. The figures, published on Monday, show no dramatic increase in the number of suicides as some feared, but those in the sector say it remains an urgent challenge for universities. On face value, the suicide rate for 2016-17 – the latest available figures – is the same as in 2015-16, but the real figure is likely to be higher because some deaths may not yet have been registered. Researchers note it can take months or even years for a suicide to be registered by a coroner’s court, so deaths that occurred in 2017 may not be registered until significantly later. The ONS figures focus for the first time exclusively on university students. They are therefore lower than usual ONS estimates of student suicides, which have previously included students in further education. Sarah Caul, an ONS senior researcher, said: “Today’s analysis will help to develop policies and initiatives for those at greatest risk of suicide. “The rate of suicide in 2016-17 in higher education students was 4.7 deaths per 100,000 students. Although higher than in earlier years, the comparatively low numbers of suicides per year make it challenging to identify significant differences. Meanwhile, the rate for suicide in female students is significantly lower than the rate in males.” Between 2001 and 2017, 1,330 students died from suicide, of which 878 (66%) were men and 452 (34%) women. More than four-fifths of the deaths (83%) were among undergraduates doing their first degree, which accounted for 1,109 deaths, while postgraduates accounted for 17% (221 deaths). There were also differences between students of different ethnic backgrounds, though the ONS urged caution about drawing any conclusions because the numbers involved are so small. White students had a rate of 5.1 deaths per 100,000, compared with 2.7 for those of black ethnicity and 5.4 for students with Asian ethnicity. Those classified as “other” had a rate of 5.9 deaths per 100,000. Over the period examined, the suicide rate among university students was at its highest in the 12 months up to July 2005, with a rate of 5.2 deaths per 100,000 students, which then fell to 3.2 deaths per 100,000 students the following year and dipped further to 2.6 in the 12 months ending July 2008. John de Pury, the assistant director of policy at Universities UK, said: “This new release is the most comprehensive data we have on the rate of suicide among university students. “Although there is a lower rate of student suicide among university students in England and Wales compared with the general population of similar ages, there is no room for complacency here. This remains an urgent challenge for universities and society.” Louis Appleby, who leads the National Suicide Prevention Strategy for England, said the figures were the most accurate to date as they were linked to national records at the Higher Education Statistics Agency. He said the figures were reassuring because they showed students were not at high risk and that rates remained low. But he added: “It does look as if the rates may be going up in the last 10 years. It’s difficult to be certain about that because they are relatively small numbers. “Ninety five students died in the most recent year. It’s difficult to get away from the human tragedy of that. The message to universities is just as it was always: they need to do more.” On the higher rates of suicide among male students, he said: “Every suicide study has found found high rates in men. The difference is not unusual. It’s what you would expect in every population.” • The Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123. In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255.

Following a litany of user complaints across support forums, specialist media, class action lawsuits and 31,000-strong online petitions, Apple said it had determined that a “small percentage of the keyboards” were affected by the issues. The keys can feel sticky and letters or characters can fail to appear when the key is pressed, or keys can repeat unexpectedly. The problems stem from a new design of Apple’s keyboard, introduced with the MacBook in 2015. It uses a V-shaped “butterfly” switch mechanism under the keys. This made the keyboard 40% thinner, with a smaller amount of key travel, compared to the more traditional X-shaped, scissor-switch mechanism used in other keyboards. Keys were found to be prone to becoming stuck when small amounts of dust and debris collected under them, leading to inoperable keyboards and irate users. A second iteration of the keyboard was launched in 2016, which also appears to be affected. “Apple or an Apple authorised service provider will service eligible MacBook and MacBook Pro keyboards, free of charge,” the company said in a new support document. “The type of service will be determined after the keyboard is examined and may involve the replacement of one or more keys or the whole keyboard.” The 12in MacBook made from early 2015 and the 13in and 15in MacBook Pros made from 2016 are covered by the repair programme up to four years from when they were purchased. Apple also said that consumers who had already paid for a repair could request a refund of the charges, which could have cost hundreds of pounds. This is the second time in 12 months that Apple has relented on support issues to attempt to appease customers and maintain brand loyalty. In December, it admitted to slowing down iPhones with ageing batteries and reduced the cost of its battery replacement programme. Market watchers welcomed the news in appeasing customers of Apple’s computer line. But Patrick Moorhead, the head of Moor Insights &amp; Strategy, said the issues simply illustrate just how loyal users were to Apple’s brand and platform. He said on Twitter: “Apple Keyboardgate demonstrating. Just how loyal and forgiving Mac users are.

Frydenberg used an interview with News Corp to send the positive signal about coal before Tuesday’s internal deliberations, with some Nationals still on the war path about the government either subsidising new coal plants or bankrolling the refurbishment of existing assets. While economic modelling associated with the national energy guarantee assumes there will be no new coal built under the policy, Frydenberg said: “I would welcome a new coal-fired power station for our country because it supplies reliable baseload power and it has served us well in the past and will continue to serve us well in the future.” Frydenberg said the national energy guarantee would prolong the operating life of the existing coal fleet – an eventuality which some of the state and territory governments, which will ultimately make or break the policy, profoundly object to. “We have twenty coal-fired power stations in Australia today with an average life of 27 years,” the federal energy minister said. “While they may not live forever, they will certainly live longer than that 27 years and the Neg will provide that level of stability for the investors and the owners of those assets.” He said under the guarantee, “the reliability that coal provides the system will be valued and [coal is] much more likely to be staying in the system under the Neg than not”. In order to bolster the case for the Neg, and keep a lid on the internal complaints from restive conservatives, Frydenberg has organised a delegation of business leaders to address a special meeting of the Coalition backbench committee on energy and the environment early on Tuesday morning, before the regular gathering of the Coalition party room. The most outspoken critics of the policy are the former prime minister Tony Abbott and the chairman of the backbench energy and environment committee Craig Kelly. Nationals, who met separately on Monday, are divided on the policy. Nationals MP Mark Coulton told Guardian Australia before Tuesday’s discussion the Neg was “heading in the right direction” but he said the government needed to be highly attentive to safeguarding reliability and power price reductions. “I think we are on the right track but we have to look after affordability and reliability,” Coulton said. “Wherever this lands I’m concerned to make sure my oldies [in his electorate of Parkes] can still afford to run their air conditioners.” He said of his colleagues there were different views about the Neg, but he said the junior Coalition partner had not split into “camps”. Fellow National John “Wacka” Williams said he believed the Neg was “a step to defeat an emissions trading scheme or a carbon tax”. But like Coulton, he said lower power prices and reliability needed to be paramount in the government’s thinking. He said power companies “had to guarantee supply and if they fail to do that, it gives the government the option of stepping in to guarantee supply, and that means building a coal-fired power plant”. Victorian National Andrew Broad, who is a supporter of the Neg, has been pushing behind the scenes for months for the government to supplement the policy by funding the refurbishment of the existing coal fleet to extend the operating life of the new coal plants and lower their greenhouse gas emissions. “I think the government should provide a fund to assist with that process,” Broad said. Dissidents have been escalating their criticisms about the Neg over the past fortnight because the current sitting is their last chance to try to scuttle the policy, or lock Frydenberg into a no-compromise posture, before a make-or-break meeting of state and territory energy ministers in early August. Any state or territory could veto the Neg when the Coag energy council meets in August. The ACT has warned it will be very difficult to sign up if Frydenberg is not in a position to offer any compromises. Tuesday’s backbench committee meeting will be attended by representatives of the Business Council of Australia, the Minerals Council of Australia, BHP, the National Farmers Federation and the Ai Group – groups that are all broadly supportive of the government’s energy policy. Also in Canberra this week is a coalition of environment and activist groups that are focussing attention on Labor as the policy moves into end game. A number of environment groups have warned the Neg contains an emissions reduction target that is too modest to see Australia meet its commitments under the Paris climate agreement."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/jun/25/mind-gym-flotation-octavius-black","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-25T12:08:58Z","webTitle":"David Cameron's schoolmate to receive millions from Mind Gym flotation","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/25/mind-gym-flotation-octavius-black","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jun/25/mind-gym-flotation-octavius-black","fields":{"headline":"David Cameron's schoolmate to receive millions from Mind Gym flotation","bodyText":"The founders of the behavioural science firm Mind Gym, including a school friend of David Cameron, are poised for a windfall of nearly £50m when the company joins the stock market this week.

Black and the company’s chair, Joanne Black, who are married, will make £24m between them, while Bailey will cash in £22m. The three will retain a 64.6% stake. Black said: “When we started out 18 years ago at my kitchen table, [behavioural science] was readily dismissed; now, the way businesses use behavioural science determines their success. “Mind Gym’s IPO [initial public offering] will raise our profile and help us lead the development of psychological tools to make companies more diverse, ethical, agile, productive, innovative, healthy and profitable.” The company, whose profits rose from £4.8m to £7.8m over the past 12 months, has worked with 62% of FTSE 100 and 59% of S&amp;P 100 companies, including groups such as Unilever, GlaxoSmithKline and Microsoft. It specialises in business transformation, managing employees, and learning and development. Recently, the growth of the #MeToo movement prompted about half of its existing clients to approach Mind Gym to help them improve their company culture, the company said, leading to the launch last week of a product called Respect, which focuses on dealing with harassment. The company has 293 self-employed coaches who present its products to clients’ staff in 90-minute training sessions. These coaches have to pass an assessment test to become certificated after a five-day training programme. They have to show relevant experience to enter the assessment programme, although the company does not reveal the exact qualifications needed. Mind Gym’s growth over the past five years has been driven by a strong performance in the UK and a successful launch in the US. Its next big move is to raise its profile in northern Europe.

Christine Tacon, the Grocery Code Adjudicator (GCA), already oversees 10 retailers including the big four supermarkets – Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Asda and Morrisons – and has the power to issue multi-million pound fines if suppliers are treated poorly. The competition watchdog is currently assessing a group of up to four additional retailers that could come under Tacon’s remit from August, if it finds their grocery sales amount to £1bn or more. Amazon’s shift into groceries, after buying Wholefoods Market and teaming up with Morrisons for its Amazon Fresh food home deliveries, is thought to have potentially put it within the GCA’s sights, while Boots’s sale of sandwiches and drinks as well as shampoo, toothpaste and suncream, may also put the health and beauty chain in the frame. Tacon said she was particularly keen to include those retailers that were treating suppliers poorly while competing directly with the 10 companies she currently oversees. She said Boots and Amazon were two of the chains mentioned by suppliers. Complaints relating to Amazon had been about not paying in full. Complaints relating to Boots had been about retrospective payments and variation to agreements. After this article was published, Boots said that there was nothing untoward in such practices, which were standard in the industry. “Payments are always agreed in advance with suppliers and are used for promotional activity to the benefit of consumers,” the company said in a letter to the Guardian. Tacon said she could not be certain the two retailers will come under her remit as there was “no cast-iron definition” of groceries, and it was difficult to assess the amount of relevant goods they sold. She said retailers might argue that products such as toothpaste, for example, should not be included, which might take their overall grocery turnover below the £1bn cut-off point. The potential extension of GCA’s powers comes as Tacon named Asda as the worst of the UK’s big four supermarkets in its treatment of suppliers for the second year in a row. The Walmart-owned chain did better than the Co-op, which is currently under investigation by the watchdog, and Iceland, which once again hit the bottom of the pile, but sits well behind its major rivals, according to CGA’s survey of 1,000 suppliers. About 7% of Asda’s suppliers said it rarely stuck to the legally binding industry code which covers trade terms and 1% said it never did so. That compares to just 3% of Tesco suppliers who say it rarely sticks to the code while none said it never complied. Still, Tacon said Asda had shown improvement in the past year. “I am delighted to report significant improvements across all regulated retailers,” she added. In one measure of her powers, Tesco, which faced a major investigation by the GCA in 2015, has overtaken Sainsbury’s and Waitrose to become the major supermarket best rated by suppliers, although it still sits behind Aldi, which has come top of the annual survey. Tacon said she hoped Asda’s dealings with food producers and grocery manufacturers would improve if its planned merger with Sainsbury’s went ahead, because the latter had better systems in place for dealing with suppliers and had consistently scored better in the annual survey. Nevertheless, she warned that she could not prevent suppliers being squeezed by a new bigger retailer after the merger as she did not have the power to intervene when suppliers were agreeing prices with retailers. “If a company is prepared to supply something at a lower price who am I to interfere? We end up with better prices for consumers,” she said. Tacon said she was open to the idea of her remit being extended in some way but warned “I’m not the industry fairy godmother” highlighting she had only been able to improve practices at the supermarkets because her role was clearly defined and backed by strong powers. She added the vast majority of suppliers now felt that retailers were sticking to the industry code and her “collaborative, business-focused approach” was getting results. The biggest issue faced by suppliers is now a delay in payments which 19% said they had experienced. • This article was amended on 12 July 2018 to clarify the different types of complaints that Ms Tacon said suppliers had made to her about Amazon and about Boots, and to add Boots’ response."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"guardian-masterclasses/2018/jun/25/writing-persuasive-copy","type":"article","sectionId":"guardian-masterclasses","sectionName":"Guardian Masterclasses","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-25T08:27:25Z","webTitle":"Writing persuasive copy | Barnaby Benson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/guardian-masterclasses/2018/jun/25/writing-persuasive-copy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/guardian-masterclasses/2018/jun/25/writing-persuasive-copy","fields":{"headline":"Writing persuasive copy","bodyText":"Learn the skills necessary to write and commission copy for different media – from product descriptions to marketing materials.

Three nations are in contention for the final two places up for grabs in the last 16. Already qualified for second round: Uruguay, Russia, Spain, Portugal, France, Denmark, Croatia, Argentina, Sweden, Mexico, Brazil, Switzerland, England, Belgium. Confirmed second round matches: France vs Argentina (Sat) Uruguay vs Portugal (Sat) Spain vs Russia (Sun) Croatia vs Denmark (Sun) Brazil vs Mexico (Mon) Sweden vs Switzerland (Tue) Groups yet to be decided Group G England and Belgium are locked together at the top of the group, both guaranteed to progress. Their final match will determine who tops the group. As they have identical records so far, if their final match is drawn, the team with the better disciplinary record (currently England with two yellow cards as opposed to Belgium’s three) will top the group. If they end up with identical disciplinary records, lots will be drawn to decide who finishes first – which could be key to potentially avoiding a route that includes facing Germany or Brazil in the quarter-finals. Qualified: England, Belgium. Eliminated: Tunisia, Panama To come: England v Belgium, Panama v Tunisia Group H Japan will progress if they get at least a draw against eliminated Poland. Colombia and Senegal face each other. A draw in that game will be enough for Senegal to progress. A draw might also be enough for Colombia to progress, but they would be relying on Poland beating Japan at the same time. Eliminated: Poland To come: Japan v Poland, Senegal v Colombia Groups already decided Group A Russia and Uruguay both qualified - with Uruguay’s 3-0 victory in the final game seeing them finish top.

Eliminated: Iran, Morocco Group C Australia were right to fear France and Denmark playing out a tepid Disgrace of Gijón style draw. It might not have quite been “the disgrace of Moscow”, but the first 0-0 draw of the tournament meant both European sides progressed. France topped the group. Australia have little ground for complaints, however, as they succumbed to Peru’s first World Cup victory since 1978, rendering the result in Moscow irrelevant to the Socceroos chances of progressing. Qualified: France, Denmark. Eliminated: Peru, Australia Group D Argentina got the win they needed in the final round of matches to join group-winners Croatia in the next round.

She returned after four difficult years, but her adolescence was scarred by involvement with older men, sex work, depression and drugs. This daring coming-of-age memoir is about the fear and power of young female sexuality, plus the magical thinking of children and Yrsa’s endearing relationship with her brother, Roo. Daley-Ward first made her name as an “Instagram poet” but this book – experimental, poetic and profound – confirms her abundant talent as a writer. I Found My Tribe Ruth Fitzmaurice Vintage, £8.99, pp224 Ruth Fitzmaurice’s film-maker husband, Simon, was diagnosed with motor neurone disease in 2008, dying nine years later aged 43. While this award-winning book centres on his story – of illness and heroic resilience despite a desperately reduced life – it is Ruth’s often joyous reflections on life, death and children (she is the mother of five) in the face of suffering that make it a surprisingly uplifting read. Vivid descriptions of nature jump off the page, and Fitzmaurice’s voice is gloriously idiosyncratic, switching from kooky (“My very best friend in the world is a tree. Hello tree”) to robust (“I have decided to become a superhero”) to melancholic (“Does my husband dream of lost kisses?”). Ostensibly a swimming memoir, it is much more than a story of the restorative powers of water. Florida Lauren Groff William Heinemann, £14.99, pp288 A single US state is the anchor for Groff’s latest short story collection, which often features women who are either fighting loneliness or struggling to find space inside their own lives. A character in Eyewall, haunted by ghosts of her past, thinks: “I never thought I could be so alone.” In Ghosts and Empties, a wife leaves her husband to put their sons to bed and takes “night-time walks” that remind her of a bigger world outside. The collection becomes a fictive psychogeography of US life – men and children feature too – and Groff’s storytelling stretches across time (including pre-civil rights Florida) to create a kaleidoscopic portrait of one state. • To order The Terrible for £8.49, I Found My Tribe for £7.64, or Florida for £12.74, go to guardianbookshop.com or call 0330 333 6846.

He’s not affectionate, but he’s quiet. He’s also about 50 years old – my wife has had him since she was eight – and will probably outlive us. When you know you’re going to have to bequeath a pet to someone eventually, the fact that it requires very little maintenance is a plus. Things are different in the new house – the garden is full of seedlings and unestablished annuals, with no raised borders. Left to his own devices, the tortoise will mow through a whole bed in an afternoon. What he can’t eat, he squashes. My wife bought a rabbit run to pen him in, but every moment he’s in it is spent trying to figure a way out. I find this very hard to watch. “He hates it,” I say. “He’s got to learn,” my wife says. “He’s going to win this,” I say. “I know it, and you know it.” Here is the new routine: in the morning my wife puts the tortoise in the rabbit run on the lawn, with a few radish tops for company. I spend an hour sitting in my office shed watching the tortoise circle the perimeter of his cage, probing for weak points. When I can’t stand it any longer, I lift him out and place him where I can keep an eye on him. The next time I look, he is gone. At about midday my wife comes out and starts screaming about some decimated sweet peas. “Why did you let him out?” she says. “I didn’t,” I say. “He must have climbed over the bars.” “Don’t be stupid,” she says. “I’m not telling you how he does it,” I say. “Because I’m on his side.” She puts the tortoise in the kitchen, where it crawls under the dog’s bed to sulk. The next day, the routine is repeated. I try providing the tortoise with such a bounty of salad that he has no room left for annuals, but he likes variety: two grapes, a lettuce leaf, a bit of bindweed and an entire bush my wife planted the day before. The next day I wake the youngest one at midday. “What,” he says, from under the duvet. “I need you to babysit the tortoise while I work,” I say. The duvet flaps down to reveal one cold blue eye. “Do I have to read to it?” he says. “Just follow him around and keep him out of trouble,” I say. “After two hours I’ll take over.” “Yeah, I’m not doing that,” he says. “One day you’ll look back and realise it was the best job you ever had,” I say. The duvet flaps up. On Tuesday I make a big speech about the monstrous injustice of the cage, and disassemble it. On Wednesday morning my wife refuses to put the tortoise outside, but once she leaves the house he pushes open the garden door and thunks down three steps. I turn to find him outside my office staring up at me, with an expression that says: if anyone asks, you haven’t seen me. Unfortunately when my wife comes home the tortoise is still there, sunning himself on the bricks. “Look,” I say. “He’s learned.” “He hasn’t,” she says, picking him up. “And neither have you.” For two days the weather is overcast and cold, and the tortoise doesn’t stir from under the dog bed. On the next sunny morning he knows what he has to do: get outside, and disappear. At about 11 I hear the thunk of his shell as he negotiates the kitchen step, but I don’t look up. At 12 he passes my office door with some leaves hanging off his chin, but I say nothing. At sunset my wife goes looking for the tortoise, but she can’t find him. “You’ve done this,” she says. “I’ve done nothing,” I say. I see him most mornings these days, but by afternoon he’s under cover and by evening he’s back in his hiding place. To be honest, I know exactly where he goes, but my lips are sealed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jun/25/heathrow-airport-how-mps-are-likely-to-vote-on-the-third-runway","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-25T11:14:00Z","webTitle":"Heathrow airport: how MPs are likely to vote on the third runway","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/25/heathrow-airport-how-mps-are-likely-to-vote-on-the-third-runway","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jun/25/heathrow-airport-how-mps-are-likely-to-vote-on-the-third-runway","fields":{"headline":"Heathrow airport: how MPs are likely to vote on the third runway","bodyText":"On Monday evening MPs will vote on whether or not Heathrow airport should have a third runway. It is a deeply factious issue and, not unexpectedly, the divisions are complex. Conservatives – mainly for The Tories have imposed a three-line whip – the highest level of party discipline – to ensure the party’s MPs back the transport secretary, Chris Grayling. The vast majority will, but with a few high-profile exceptions. Justine Greening, the former education secretary, and Zac Goldsmith both have west London constituencies and are avowed opponents of the scheme. Goldsmith famously resigned from his Richmond Park seat in 2016 in protest at the plan, then lost in the subsequent byelection to the Liberal Democrats and had to wait until the 2017 general election to return to parliament. The biggest controversy circles, as ever, around Boris Johnson. The foreign secretary represents Uxbridge, right in the airport’s flight path, and once vowed to “lie down … in front of the bulldozers” if necessary. However, while Greg Hands resigned last week as a trade minister to vote against the government, Johnson has stayed silent, and is expected to be abroad at the time of the vote, thus avoiding difficult decisions – something which has enraged some of his fellow Tory MPs. Labour – a mix The party’s official policy is to oppose the expansion and, indeed, when it was in the news last year it was heavily trailed that it would do so. However, while many Labour MPs are against the plan, there is another factor at play: Unite. The union represents more than 34,000 workers at the airport. Its head, Len McCluskey, has written to all Labour MPs urging them to back the expansion plans. The result is that party whips are offering its MPs a free vote, and anything from around 40 to nearer 100 are expected to back the government. This could see a series of shadow cabinet members going against Jeremy Corbyn. Those tipped to do so include Angela Rayner, Nick Brown, Barry Gardiner, Dawn Butler and Ian Lavery. Scottish National party – was for, now against The SNP government in Scotland has been supportive of the Heathrow plan, arguing that it would benefit the Scottish economy. As such, the party’s 35 representatives in Westminster were expected to back the move. However, it is widely reported that the SNP is cooling on the idea, officially over doubts about the merits of the expansion, though possibly also to avoid the symbolism of voting with the government. Liberal Democrats – against The party’s 12 MPs are expected to line up firmly against the plan, not least as the Twickenham constituency of their leader, Vince Cable, is directly in the airport’s flight path. Other parties Democratic Unionist MPs are connected to the government through the informal coalition, and support the expansion plan anyway. Plaid Cymru have backed a bigger Heathrow in the past, on the condition that rail links to Wales are improved. The sole Green MP, Caroline Lucas, has been one of the most vehement critics of the scheme, calling it a huge environmental step back."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/from-the-archive-blog/2018/jun/28/tour-de-france-ottavio-bottecchia-1924","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-28T10:00:07Z","webTitle":"Tour de France: 'skirting the frontiers of human possibility' - archive, 1924","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/from-the-archive-blog/2018/jun/28/tour-de-france-ottavio-bottecchia-1924","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/from-the-archive-blog/2018/jun/28/tour-de-france-ottavio-bottecchia-1924","fields":{"headline":"Tour de France: 'skirting the frontiers of human possibility' - archive, 1924","bodyText":"Cycling notes: new race 9 March 1903 A new race, Le Tour de France, is to be started in June. It is to be run in six stages on consecutive Sundays, as follows:- Paris to Lyon (500 kilometres), Lyon to Marseille (350 kilometres), Marseille to Toulouse (300 kilometres), Toulouse to Bordeaux (250 kilometres), Bordeaux to Nantes (400 kilometres), and Nantes to Paris (400 kilometres). The first prizes will be 2,000, 1,200, 1,000, 800, 1,500, and 2,000 francs respectively, while 1,500, francs will be given to the rider who does the best aggregate time. The turn of the wheel by William Bolitho 21 August 1924 Once upon time there was an honest young mason who had three young children and a wife whom he adored. Now it came about that in one month, without speculation or luck, by his own hands and legs he won his fortune and bought the biggest house in the village where he will live happily ever afterwards. This is one of the twenty favourite themes of modern folklore; its catchword is quick and honest riches its latest setting the 1924 Tour de France, or the story of Ottavio Bottecchia, champion cyclist. In that wide stretch of Europe inhabited by short-headed, black-eyed, energetic men who lose their tempers and talk with their hands, a region roughly corresponding to France, Switzerland Walloon, Belgium, Italy and Bavaria, this Tour de France is the living Iliad. It comes about yearly. Two hundred of the toughest professional cyclists from these countries start from Paris for 5,418 kilometre race round the borders of France - almost exactly the distance that separates Paris from Baghdad. It takes them a month, the whole of baking July, in fifteen stages. The first prize amounts to 60,000 francs, enough even nowadays to make workman a man of fortune. It is the best-paid and best-known road race in that most modern and most democratic sport. Henri Desgranges, one of the personalities of France, owner of a daily sporting paper, the man who translated sport to France thirty years ago, invented it. Every year he stiffens its conditions, hardens its regulations, and by meditation on the geography of its route makes its hell for human endurance harder. It is the only way in which man who cannot read or write can earn a fortune in a month without gambling, except with his neck. Naturally it skirts throughout its length the extreme frontiers of human possibility. France is politically celebrated for her uncommon share of natural frontiers, the mountains of the Pyrenees on the south, the mountains of the Alps on her middle east. The road of the Tour follows these asperities with devilish exactness. The claimants for the quick fortune are strong men. In most years only a fourth of them finish the course, and they go to bed for a fortnight. Bottecchia is young mason from Frioul in Italy. He fits the legend of the poor young man who loves his family exactly; for the rest, he hates the bicycle, thinks of nothing else but his home. He cares nothing for honour, has no ambitions but that best house in the village, never smiles, never talks, and all the other professionals hate him. He is long and thin, with a nose like pick-axe. Last year he appeared for the first time and won second place. As soon as he was well, on the money he had gained he went into diligent training for the big prize again. His rivals in Italy, particularly Brunero, after discussing the oaf and the upstart with their national talent for criticism, put him out of their minds and wiped out the memory of his snatched win in their lesser triumphs on the track, on the road, throughout the year. Bottecchia helped them to forget by keeping on training for the Tour de France in strict seclusion. At the start in Paris for this year’s tour Bottecchia met three chief enemies: Brunero, the legitimate idol of Italy, the reigning king of the road, who was out to win for ambition; the Pélissier brothers, the glory of France, who had duty to their fellow-countrymen; Alavoine from Versailles, a giant who is older than he was, who must show us all that he is immune from age. Besides these, 180 others - young hopes feverish for fame. They started at three o’clock in the morning with 30,000 to see them off. On this Tour de France the start is always given in the small hours of the morning to give the cyclists a chance to get away. If there was a more uncomfortable hour than that before dawn Desgranges would choose it. For the whole run is done, with hardly a break, between two lines of spectators ranged round the border of France like an ornamental edge of applause and curiosity. In the wildest parts of Brittany and Savoy there is never a kilometre without a waiting car or motor-cycle. In the big towns on the evening of arrival they mobilise regiments of police to keep a streak of road open to the control table. The book of rules for the racers has 200 pages, each a guard against fraud or violence that the cunning of these 180, mad to win by any means may devise. Each competitor, says the first article, must race as if he were alone on a lonely road - mend his own tyres, drink out of his own bottle, sponge the blood out of his eyes in fall, or bandage a broken leg as best he may without the slightest assistance from competitor or follower until he arrives at the end of his stage. The course turned into dolorous allegory. First, Pélissier the Great, last year’s victor, who began the Tour (“this job for convicts” he called it) because of “patriotic duty to his fellow-countrymen,” being their incomparably best racer, abandoned the contest in Normandy. He fell into dispute with Desgranges as to whether the supplementary jersey he threw into ditch en route counted as “tools,” and so on no account to be got rid of between stopping-places. Alavoine, who was racing for a different sort of pride, the old hero, fell to twentieth rank at the Pyrenees. For the first week the lonely shingled paths of Brittany, past dour Stations of the Cross and innumerable exiled churches, then past the 300-mile stretch of sand and flint that descends down the Atlantic side. Then come, in the Basque country, the Justices of the Peace, those calm, Inhuman shoulders of the great Pyrenean range; Aubisque, Tourmalet, Aspin, Peyreermode, which no car can climb without resting to cool, which separate and inexorably classify the racers. Until then these cling together, saving their forces for this Pyrenean climb, the hardest test humanity has invented for the ultimate strength of legs. Bottecchia had been thinking of these giants in silence since Paris. On their shoulders he won the race. Without once stopping, hardly checking speed, putting up the record for the stage, he forced Aubisque, Tourmalet, and the rest and drew up in Lucon, his face a grimacing mask of fatigue, a good hour in front of Brunero and Mottiat. Huot and Buysse, daring youngsters,had kept him company farthest - half way up the first ascent. Brunero, the man who raced for glory, had been inexorably parted from the man who raced for home by the great knuckles of the mountain. He arrived bruised, collapsing as silent for once as his butt Bottecchia. Half of the rest limped back to country railway stations to take the train for Paris. The rest of the race - the dust of the Midi, where crowds out of human memory blocked the roads and brought dozens to bloody spill, the terrible ten-mile rise of the Crau, near Nice, the heart-breaking asperities of the Savoy and the Lower Alps, where the villages in the distance seem like painted toys, past old streets of folk-lore roofs in Alsace, to the black slag-cemented roads in the North Country - was the history of Brunero’s chase to catch up: ambition against home-seeking. And the stronger, won. Bottecchia had beaten Alavoine, he had outlasted Pélissier; at Strasbourg his last determined rival, Brunero gave up. The young mason of Frioul entered Paris conqueror. Delirium of flowers and voices waited for him; best of all, the envelope with the cheque. The people, those strata too near the fundamental needs of life to taste any of the refined virtue of amateurism, understand Bottecchia, the professional of professionals, who only fought for money. For them the acted legend has the end they most approve. William Bolitho became Manchester Guardian Paris correspondent after the first world war and covered events such as the 1919 Versailles peace conference and a communist rebellion in Germany’s Ruhr valley. He later became a columnist on the New York World. Tour de France by Garry Hogg 9 July 1943 I shall stick no more black-knobbed pins into my map of France. Till recently I had felt some satisfaction in doing so. The Ruhr was already full of them - pins that had been used in the first World War to indicate advances and salients in the near-static warfare of Flanders, now used to mark industrial sites bombed by our aircraft. When Abbeville was attacked, and Le Creusot, I had not felt it personally, for they were remote from the parts of France I once tried to make my own. But now event and memory have come too close to one another, and all because of a little village in Normandy with the improbable name of Vingt-Hanaps. Searching my large-scale map to identify some recent targets of the Anglo-American bombers, I encountered the name unexpected: Vingt-Hanaps. “Twenty Goblets”: by what odd freak of fancy was it so named? True, the village lies in the heart of cider-making country. In Vingt-Hanaps moreover lived my old friend Georges Enjalbert. Over my wall map hangs a calendar, and perhaps it was because I looked up from the name to the date, July 1, that the little pieces of the picture slipped into position and suddenly Georges Enjalbert was beside me, for July was his great month, the month of the famous Tour de France. I had in those days a cycle with a tricoaster hub. Such things had not been seen in France. As I rode into Vingt-Hanaps, northward bound for Caen and the Channel Coast, something in its intricate mechanism failed. A short stocky man, with heavy black brows and swarthy skin contemplated me in silence as I stood outside his smithy helpless. “Qu ya-t-il, m’sieur?” he asked me civilly as he looked up. In his hand, held like a toy, was a large hammer. I explained in laborious French, and within an hour a miracle had been wrought. I sat on a stool outside his smithy and watched him as he worked and talked. He must have been born a mechanic. His passion was long-distance cycling. Together we turned the pages of old copies of Le Miroir des Sports as we drank the good cidre du pays. His great finger lay across a crowded photograph. There he was in his heyday among the aces at the start of the annual race round the French borders, nearly three thousand miles to be covered in twenty days’ cycling, with enforced rests on six days only. Forty-odd competitors – Belgian, Italian - and Georges Enjalbert among them. Georges Enjalbert clocking in at a control-point, being hosed by enthusiastic supporters as he sped by, racing at breakneck speed down precipitous slopes, pedalling apparently as fast (such is the resourcefulness of your sports cameraman) up equally precipitous hills, being forcibly fed and watered en route, and finally riding victoriously round the Paris Vélodrome with garland about his shoulders that made all the leis of Hawaii look like buttonholes. In May and June, as work slackened, Georges took more and more time off from the smithy. His cycle claimed him. I remember the first time I saw him in cycling rig. Gone were the heavy cord breeches, the leather apron, and stained shirt. A bright yellow-and-black maillot was stretched taut about his great chest. Silk tights fitted his haunches like pale-blue skin. From them bulged his great thighs - true cyclist’s thighs, massive and corded, tapering into slim calves and neat ankles. This Tour de France, I learnt from him, was a trial of almost fantastic dimensions. Westwards from Paris to Caen, a 150-mile starting lap; thence to Rennes and the interminable flat miles of Les Landes on the Biscay shore. A lap of two hundred miles through the Pyrenees over slopes and saddlebacks that I had found tough even for walking - and no cyclist competing in the Tour de France has been known to demean himself by dismounting. Marseille, Nice: the sun is formidable enough there in July even for someone who has nothing to do but lie and sip iced drinks. Yet still these lonely figures race on, widely separated now, looking desperately tired on their tiny, brilliantly coloured machines, but pedalling all day at twenty miles an hour, a speed which for most of us would be impossible for more than few minutes. Nor does their speed appreciably lessen among the hundreds of miles of the Juras, Alps,and Vosges which they must next traverse. July, then, is Georges Enjalbert’s month. Were it not for the war even now he would be speeding, as a tourist-routier, since he is too old to compete among the aces, round this boundary of France. About his shoulders would be looped in figure-of-eight the slender spare tyre, on his gleaming handlebars his twin canisters of refreshment, on his face that look of implacable determination that I used to see towards the end of his practice runs in May and June. War has changed all that. Along the Grandes Routes Nationales the German legions march and countermarch behind their vaunted Atlantic Wall. Are they, I wonder, sometimes mysteriously impelled to draw aside, feeling the presence of ghostly figures speeding westwards on ghostly machines, league after arduous league? Is their night of hatred and mistrust crowded with yellow-and-black maillots, like that Georges Enjalbert, within which beat stout hearts, the hearts of men awaiting the signal to drive the grey-clad soldiers from their land? I like to think so. And I like to think that when the Atlantic Wall has crumbled the coastal road will feel once more those spinning, silent tyres in a resurrected Tour de France.

Director Robby Graham creates works for indoor and outdoor stages, both for Southpaw and with other directors. He and Bradley Hemmings are collaborating on the forthcoming open-air production of Jonathan Harvey’s Beautiful Thing for the finale of this year’s Greenwich and Docklands festival. Before that, visitors to the same festival got a chance to see Graham’s open-air Icarus, a more purely dance-based work in which you sense hip-hop more as a spirit than a style: in the combative prowess of its performers (five men and one woman), in its punchily rhythmic dynamics and the feline twists of its somersaults and handsprings. It opens with an arcane collective ritual in which the men – Icarus in white, four accomplices in black, all smeared with shamanic face paint – jab their arms upwards, then brandish white flags, as if to invoke some higher power. Icarus (Samuel Baxter) is bestowed an impressively mythic pair of wings – echoes of Angels in America (Graham was movement director for the 2017 National Theatre production) – and lifted skywards into a hurtling encounter with Laura Vanhulle as an imperious, gold-painted sun goddess. For the most part this is a well-made, technically very proficient performance, artistically straightforward but certainly effective for its free-festival setting. The ending takes it up a level: Icarus slowly and spectacularly self-combusts into pungent clouds of smoke that disperse to reveal the sun goddess standing proud on a ground littered with bodies. It’s awesome. Icarus is on tour until 29 September.

It smells weird,” says Lungfish’s Daniel Higgs during a set of noodling banjo. It’s a line that feels emblematic of Birmingham’s Supersonic, a festival “for curious audiences”. If Supersonic’s bass scent is weirdness, its top notes are infinitely varied: Japan’s Goat open with a hushed silence and then build a flow of minimal percussion into a sort of hyper-Steve Reichian blur as drumsticks flurry in constant motion. Philadelphian experimentalist Moor Mother’s set ricochets all over, with her fierce spoken word being driven by harsh noise, bass music, techno and even metal, while Dutch band the Ex are all taut, recoiled energy that is unleashed in frenetic bursts of guitars. On day two, Factory Floor’s Nik Void begins a set of rumbling drone music that soon gives way to a rather thumping early-evening techno set. Yves Tumor recalls Death Grips’ nihilist punk and wears a pink cowboy hat over his bandage-wrapped face, while seizure-inducing strobe lights flash as harshly as his ribcage-shaking beats. Two South African artists, Angel-Ho and FAKA, pull out last minute due to visa issues, so an ad hoc supergroup featuring members of Pigs x 7 and UKAEA replaces the latter. Unsurprisingly, their set is gloriously chaotic: all improvised noise, wild electronics and screeching vocals. On day three, Group A play an industrial-tinged set that blossoms into full-blown psychedelic techno; there’s a Dennis McNett masked procession from venue to venue, a spoken word and musical collaboration via the collective Modern Ritual, a pummelling and ferociously heavy set from Manchester’s Gnod, electro K-pop from Tirikilatops and a soothing finish of traditional folk from Shirley Collins. The weekend is also peppered with films, workshops, talks, DJ sets and even Black Sabbath karaoke in tribute to the setting. Supersonic is a festival of cross-genre pollination, but also one that questions what genre is: brain-frying psych followed by avant-folk via ear-bleeding noise and minimal techno all just makes sense here. It manages to cram so many different sounds into a 72-hour period that it leaves your brain feeling like its own pulsing modular synthesiser."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/jun/26/from-beavis-and-butt-head-to-pimp-my-ride-which-mtv-shows-should-be-revived","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-26T06:00:26Z","webTitle":"From Beavis and Butt-Head to Pimp My Ride: which MTV shows should be revived?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jun/26/from-beavis-and-butt-head-to-pimp-my-ride-which-mtv-shows-should-be-revived","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jun/26/from-beavis-and-butt-head-to-pimp-my-ride-which-mtv-shows-should-be-revived","fields":{"headline":"From Beavis and Butt-Head to Pimp My Ride: which MTV shows should be revived?","bodyText":"Having realised that it doesn’t really serve any purpose in 2018, MTV is getting into the nostalgia business. It recently revealed plans to revive some of its most-loved legacy properties. Daria is coming back, as is Aeon Flux, The Real World and Made. While this is good news – anything that breaks up the wall-to-wall monotony of endless Catfish episodes is frankly much-needed – it doesn’t seem like it goes as far as it should. In its day, MTV was an absolute wonderland of television, and there are so many other shows it could haul back in from the wilderness. Beavis and Butt-Head For a glorious stretch in the mid-1990s, Beavis and Butthead operated as a sort of MTV Mystery Science Theater 3000. Popular music videos of the day would play out, while a couple of sniggering delinquents sat back and ripped them apart. “These guys are pretty cool for a bunch of mimes,” they said about Kiss. They called Styx “Your mom hanging out in bars again”. Imagine Beavis and Butt-Head retooled to be awful to YouTubers. It would be the only thing I’d ever watch. Clone High There were only ever 13 episodes of the blisteringly inventive Clone High – a cartoon about teenage clones of everyone from Lincoln to Gandhi – but the talent involved was impeccable. It was the first big runout for Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, who filled both The Lego Movie and the 21 Jump Street franchise with jokes that were originally destined for Clone High. The pair often talk about trying to bring it back. Fingers crossed they succeed. The Osbournes Obviously, nobody would ever produce a straight remake of The Osbournes in 2018, because it’d just about be the saddest television programme in all of history. But the series is so seminal – it essentially invented reality TV as we know it – that it deserves to be commemorated somehow. Remake it with George Osborne’s family? The Ben Stiller Show Dear God, the writers this show had. As well as Stiller, the room included Brent Forrester (who went on to write on The Simpsons and The Office), David Cross and Bob Odenkirk (who went on to create Mr Show), Dino Stamatopoulos (who went on to write for everything you’ve ever liked) and Judd Apatow (who went on to become Judd Apatow). A reunion wouldn’t exactly appeal to the youth of today, but it would still be incredible. Jackass Jackass hasn’t been on television for 16 years, and you shudder to think what sort of reception it’d get in these censorious times. A show about the simple pleasures of elaborately hurting yourself and others in the name of pure entertainment, it was very much a moment of its time. But perhaps MTV can make a show based on its nearest possible equivalent: an endless loop of lads partaking in the cinnamon challenge. Singled Out Again, not a great show to bring back as is, since its hosts were a now-notorious anti-vaxxer (Jenny McCarthy) and a man who has just been accused of sexual assault (Chris Hardwick) – claims which he denies – but leave them out of this and you’re left with what’s now, on reflection, a surprisingly wholesome dating show. A British version, for a time hosted by Richard Blackwood and Tess Daly, aired on Channel 5, but it was rubbish. Pimp My Ride A wonderful television programme that needs to come back in one form or another. The premise was simple – you would give your car to Xzibit and he would remodel it so elaborately that you’d never be able to drive it again for fear of being mistaken for a satanic clown by terrified locals determined to run you out of town – but an enduring one. Bring it back. Liquid Television A 30-minute compilation of shorts from independent animators Liquid Television was the walking definition of hit-and-miss. It could be indulgent and sloppy at times, but it was also the perfect incubator for shows such as Aeon Flux and Beavis and Butt-Head. If MTV handed over a cheap slot to promising new animators today, it’s almost guaranteed that we’d still be talking about some of the results 20 years from now."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jun/25/all-children-in-detention-in-the-northern-territory-are-indigenous","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-25T20:00:09Z","webTitle":"All children in detention in the Northern Territory are Indigenous","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jun/25/all-children-in-detention-in-the-northern-territory-are-indigenous","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jun/25/all-children-in-detention-in-the-northern-territory-are-indigenous","fields":{"headline":"All children in detention in the Northern Territory are Indigenous","bodyText":"All children now in detention in the Northern Territory are Aboriginal, according to data from the families department, prompting calls for reform of the justice system. In response to questioning at an NT estimates hearing late last week, the department confirmed that “as of today, 100% of the children in detention are Aboriginal. The proportions have not changed since the royal commission.” “There are 17 young people in Don Dale Youth detention centre and 21 in Alice Springs. Four of those in Don Dale are from the centre, two from Alice Springs and two from Tennant Creek,” the deputy chief executive of operations for the department, Jeanette Kerr, told the committee. “In terms of Indigenous children, they are all Indigenous.” There are now 38 young people in detention in the NT. Between 35% and 37% are from Darwin and Alice Springs, 9% are from Tennant Creek and the rest are from across the territory. In response to the recommendations of the Don Dale royal commission, the NT government says it has allocated $71.4m to rebuild Don Dale and Alice Springs youth detention centres, but only $9.9m over four years “to divert young people from crime and stop future offending”. Under its “Safe, thriving and connected: generational change for children and families” plan, the NT government also set aside $22.9m over four years to “improve youth detention operations and reduce recidivism”. In a statement read to the committee, the member for Nhulunbuy, Yingiya Mark Guyula, said: “The royal commission provided evidence that the ways that the Balanda [white] system treats Aboriginal children is inhumane, costly and does not work.” “In my electorate of Nhulunbuy, we want to see our elders in control of raypirri – or discipline – for our young people. We want troubled young people out on homelands with oversight from elders, and access to education from our people and through the school system. “The problem is, this requires a genuine partnership between government and Yolngu leaders, with funding to assist our young people.” NT’s families minister, Dale Wakefield, told the committee: “It is an area that we are going to need to continue to develop. “I think it is probably going to look different from place to place. Whilst the member for Nhulunbuy has a very strong vision for what happens on Yolngu land, I think that will look very different on Warlpiri land. “We need to make sure ... that local communities can make decisions around the ways they want to respond to young people who are not meeting community expectations in terms of their behaviour.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/live/2018/jun/26/trade-war-tensions-markets-bank-of-england-retail-sales-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-26T17:00:08Z","webTitle":"Bank of England challenged over 'gobsmacking' travel expenses - as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2018/jun/26/trade-war-tensions-markets-bank-of-england-retail-sales-business-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2018/jun/26/trade-war-tensions-markets-bank-of-england-retail-sales-business-live","fields":{"headline":"Bank of England challenged over 'gobsmacking' travel expenses - as it happened","bodyText":"With enthusiasm draining away as the close of trading approached, European markets failed to hold on to the bulk of their early gains, limited as these were anyway. The fears about a trade war after Donald Trump raised the stakes in his attacks on China and elsewhere continued to dominate sentiment. A rise in the oil price gave a lift to the FTSE 100 but elsewhere markets slipped back by the close, in some cases into negative territory. An early rise on Wall Street did little to support shares elsewhere. So the final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 28.08 points or 0.37% at 7537.92 Germany’s Dax dipped 0.29% to 12,234.34 France’s Cac closed down 0.05% at 5281.29 Italy’s FTSE MIB edged up 0.3% to 21,419.27 Spain’s Ibex ended up 0.2% at 9637.4 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 80 points or 0.34%. Here’s our story on the latest on the spat between Donald Trump and Harley-Davidson over trade tariffs: And here’s the criticism of the Bank of England over its expenses: On that note, it’s time to close for the day. Thanks for your comments, and we’ll be back tomorrow. A London magistrates court says Uber can continue operating in London, but for a trial period: A court decided the ride-hailing firm should be awarded a new, 15-month probationary licence, after being told of sweeping changes to its practices. The ride-hailing firm’s future in one of its biggest global markets had been in jeopardy after Transport for London ruled last September that it was not “fit and proper” to hold a private hire vehicles operator’s licence. At the start of a two-day hearing, Uber admitted that London’s original decision not to renew its five-year licence had been correct. TfL cited concerns about public safety and security, including reporting of crimes, and background checks on drivers. But Uber’s lawyers convinced Westminster magistrates court that it had since cleaned up its act, while continuing to operate in the capital pending its appeal. Chief magistrate, Emma Arbuthnot, said that Uber should pay all costs of the appeal. TfL’s lawyer said a figure of £425,000 had been agreed. Our full report is here: The nervous gain made by markets in the wake of Monday’s falls is hardly a convincing recovery. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: There is little reason to believe that this respite from the recent selling in the larger markets is anything more than a breather before the pressure starts once more. No one is showing any signs of backing down in the escalating and dangerous trade war that was started by the US. Today, the focus of US President Donald Trump’s ire is iconic motor cycle manufacturer Harley Davidson, which is threatening to get round the EU’s retaliatory import tariffs by increasing production outside the US. Trump is warning the company of a big tax being levied should it move production to Thailand, and we are seeing an important proxy play out for future cases given the growing impact this trade war is having on US-based firms. US consumer confidence has taken a knock this month, with today’s Conference Board survey highlighting a particularly noticeable decline in future expectations. While many believe that the US will emerge in an improved economic standing in the aftermath of this current trade war, the fact is that we have a huge degree of anxiety over how this will play out. With China eradicating tariffs on Soybeans (one of the biggest US exports to China) from five Asian countries, it is clear that China is positioning itself for a further breakdown in US-China trade relations. There may not be a full blown trade war but markets will continue to be hit by the continuing tensions, says Ingvild Borgen Gjerde at Capital Economics: Despite the small rebound in equity markets today, fears of a global trade war have increased further this week. This, together with a likely slowdown in the US economy next year, will probably continue to weigh on equities. The news over the weekend that the US is taking further steps towards implementing protectionist policies, and that it is broadening its approach, strengthen the perception that we are genuinely moving closer to a full-blown trade war. This, rather than the proposed measures themselves, explains yesterday’s sell-off in equity markets. Information technology (IT) stocks were hit particularly hard yesterday, which is not surprising. Admittedly, the measures are meant to protect US technology. But they could hurt the sales of US IT firms in China, or limit their ability to operate there. However, some of the stocks that fell the most in the US were consumer discretionary stocks, with very limited exposure to China. And some of the IT firms with larger-than-average exposure to China fared better than those with less exposure. Indeed, the stocks of the so-called FAANGs, the group of large US consumer discretionary and IT firms, were among the hardest hit stocks in the US yesterday. (See Chart.) This follows surprisingly strong performance so far this year, and suggestions that the FAANGs are emerging as some form of safe haven amid rising global trade tensions. ....We disagree with this notion. While most of the FAANGs might not be very exposed to China, they are still highly cyclical. They are therefore particularly vulnerable, as a trade war would raise the risk of an economic slowdown. We still do not anticipate a full-blown trade war, and we do not expect the protectionist measures implemented or proposed thus far to kill the current economic expansion on their own....However, as equity markets usually lead the economy rather than the other way around, the current escalation of trade tensions is adding to the pressure on global equity markets. What’s more, cyclical sectors remain particularly vulnerable in this environment, with or without exposure to China. Markets are managing to hold on to their - fairly limited - gains. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: The morning’s positivity managed to carry over into the US session, though the gains were nothing compared to Monday’s losses. The Dow Jones managed to rise 0.3% after the bell, sending the beleaguered US index back above 24300. This despite another strong day for the dollar, with the greenback rising 0.4% against both the pound and the euro, sending the former below $1.323 and the latter towards $1.165, and jumping half a percent against the yen. The most recent Conference Board consumer confidence reading had little impact on either currency or index, the possible negative impact of the worse than expected month-on-month decline countered by the upwards revised figure from May. Commenting on the US data Lynn Franco, director of economic indicators at the Conference Board, said: Consumer confidence declined in June after improving in May. Consumers’ assessment of present-day conditions was relatively unchanged, suggesting that the level of economic growth remains strong. While expectations remain high by historical standards, the modest curtailment in optimism suggests that consumers do not foresee the economy gaining much momentum in the months ahead. It should hardly come as much of a surprise, given the amount of talk about the recent trade tensions, but US consumer confidence has slipped back in June, coming in below expectations. The Conference Board consumer confidence index fell from 128.8 in May (itself revised up from 128) to 126.4. Analyst had forecast a level of 128. Here’s our latest report on the new spat between Donald Trump and Harley-Davidson: President Donald Trump on Tuesday threatened Harley-Davidson with a “big tax” and said the motorbike company’s decision to shift some motorcycle production overseas, “will be the beginning of the end”. A day after the company announced it was moving some production overseas to mitigate the impact of Trump’s tariffs on European steel and aluminium Trump used Twitter to say the company is using “Tariffs/Trade War as an excuse” to hide previously announced plans to move jobs to Asia. The Milwaukee-based company said on Monday it came to its decision because of retaliatory tariffs it faces in an escalating trade dispute between the US and the European Union. Trump warned Harley-Davidson that any shift in production “will be the beginning of the end”. “The Aura will be gone and they will be taxed like never before!” Trump said in one of several tweets on Tuesday. He was referring to tariffs Harley-Davidson would face on motorcycles produced overseas and shipped back to the US for sale. The president has held up the motorcycle maker as an example of a US business harmed by trade barriers in other countries, but Harley-Davidson had warned that new US tariffs could negatively affect its sales. Trump recently imposed steep tariffs on aluminium and steel imported from Canada, Mexico and Europe in his attempt to reduce trade deficits between the US and its trade partners. But those countries have treated Trump’s action as an insult and have chosen to respond in kind. The US and China are also volleying back and forth over tariffs. The full story is here: After Monday’s slump, US markets have indeed managed to open in positive territory, even if the gains are not particularly convincing. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 47 points or 0.2% while the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.19% higher and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.29%. Technology stocks, which on Monday were among the biggest fallers after Donald Trump latest trade threats hit the sector, are leading the recovery. Gold is typically seen as a haven for investors in times of market turmoil, but not at the moment. It has been heading lower for a while and is down another $8 an ounce to $1257 so far today. Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at Forex.com, said: Gold has been falling sharply of late, dropping by a good $50 in the space of nine trading days. At the time of writing, the yellow precious metal was trading around $1257, its lowest level since December 18. The perceived safe haven metal has been unable to find much demand from flows out of the equity markets which have been tumbling amid concerns over global trade disputes and the outlook for rising interest rates. Indeed, the trend of central banks turning hawkish has continued in recent weeks. The Fed has indicated that it will probably raise borrowing costs two more times this year, while the ECB’s QE will end at the end of this year – albeit the first rate rise has been delayed – and there are now more hawks at the BOE (3) than expected (2). As central banks tighten monetary conditions, yields could rise further. This means the opportunity cost of holding noninterest-bearing assets like gold will increase (on a relative basis) along with expectations for higher borrowing costs. Unfortunately for gold, which is priced in the dollar, interest rate expectations in the US have been rising faster than in other regions. This has helped to underpin the dollar and undermine foreign currencies, and pressurised buck-denominated gold further. Thus, for gold to make a meaningful comeback, the dollar will have to depreciate and depreciate sharply. This can only happen if incoming US macro data were to deteriorate sharply, or the global economy – in particular, the EU – starts to expand at a faster pace than the US economy. However, as things stand, this looks unlikely and we therefore may see further dollar strength in the coming days and weeks. So, the outlook for gold looks bleak. A few minutes until Wall Street opens and the futures market is predicting the US markets - like those in Europe - will stage a minor recovery. After Monday’s 328 point decline, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is forecast to open up around 40 points. Getting back to the trade wars.... Donald Trump has savaged Harley-Davidson for deciding to move some production out of America to avoid EU tariffs on US goods. The president accused the motorbike manufacturer of misleading customers yesterday, by using tariffs as an ‘excuse’ to shift jobs. He says it will be the ‘beginning of the end’ for Harley, unless it scraps the plan. Overnight, the Financial Times spoke to Harley workers in Milwaukee. Most apparently still support Trump, and think he’s using his business smarts. Here’s a flavour: “He wouldn’t do it unless it needed to be done, he’s a very smart businessman,” said one Harley employee whose name is embroidered on his work shirt — though he asks not to be quoted by name. “I think he’s playing poker: I’ll hit you with this, you’ll hit us with that, I think this will bring them to the table — unless he’s completely crazy,” chimed in another.... More here. Before being quizzed over those whopping travel expenses, Bradley Fried told the Treasury committee that the Bank of England was committed to improving diversity. Reuters has the details: The Bank of England’s next governor must embody values of inclusion and accountability, as well strong economic skills, the new chair of the central bank’s court of directors said on Tuesday. “Those values include inclusion, they include accountability, they include collaboration, decisiveness and empowerment. We would want that in the new governor,” Bradley Fried told lawmakers. Incumbent governor Mark Carney is due to step down on June 30, 2019, and finance minister Philip Hammond is expected to announce his successor before the end of this year. Fried also acknowledged the criticism for only having one woman (Silvana Tenreyro) on the Bank’s nine-strong Monetary Policy Committee which sets interest rates. That image doesn’t match the Bank’s commitment to inclusivity and equality, Fried insisted. There’s also only one woman (Elizabeth Stheeman) on the Financial Policy Committee alongside 12(!) men - including two facing tough questions about their trans-Atlantic flights.... Back in parliament, the new chair of the court of the Bank of England has faced some uncomfortable questions about expenses. Bradley Fried has been asked to justify how two members of the BoE’s Financial Policy Committee, Donald Kohn and Anil Kashyap, ran up £390,000 of travel expenses in the last two and a half years. This is “a simply staggering sum”, says Conservative MP Simon Clarke. Is it really a sensible use of the bank’s resources? Fried argues that Kohn and Kashyap’s expertise mean it was value for money, given the skills which they provide to the FPC. “In the context of the skills we needed on the committees at the time… Having seen these committees in action and the contributions they have made, as high as their expenses have been, so staggering, I think, has been their contribution”. Anil Kashyap is a professor at the University of Chicago, while Donald Kohn is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington. Both men are travelling between London and America to attend FPC meetings - with the Bank picking up the tab. Clarke says his constituents would be “gobsmacked” to hear that one return flight from Chicago for Mr Kashyap to attend a meeting in February cost £11,084.89. Clarke says: “These meetings must be scheduled months in advance. I cannot understand how that figure was arrived at. Are FPC members allowed to fly first class, he wonders. Our people fly business class, replies Fried, but he’ll check this issue. Onto taxis! Donald Kohn, it transpires, took a flight from Washington to London costing £8,000 and added an extra £469 in taxi fares. Clarke says this is “just unconscionable”. He adds that there are “disturbing echoes” of the culture that was exposed by the House of Commons expense scandal in 2009. As if this wasn’t enough, Clarke reminds Fried that the Bank’s 2016 summer party cost £100,000. That’s “one hell of a party”. Is that public money? if it isn’t, whose money is it? Fried says he will “reflect” on this issue and “figure out with our financial manager what framework is appropriate.” Clarke puts his finger on another dubious issue. The Bank of England’s Sports Centre facility at Roehampton - where it costs £1,464 per year to a humble member of the public, but Bank staff only pay £50 a year. That, Clarke says, is “an extraordinary good deal, and suggests an extraordinary subsidy being offered here”. How does that fit with the Bank’s mandate of promoting monetary and financial stability? Fried admits that the issue will be examined: Roehampton is part of what we look at. We will be looking at Roehampton. Andy Bruce of Reuters has dug out an example of Donald Kohn’s expenses - including more than £56,000 in one three-month period last year. The Chinese stock market’s slide into a bear market today has sent shivers through the financial world, particularly in Asia. With shares down 20% since January, and worries about trade rising, investors fear more losses ahead. Qian Qimin, strategiest at Shenwan Hongyuan Group in Shanghai, says the threat of trade protectionism could push shares lower. “The market may keep falling since it’s still hard to gauge the impact of trade tensions. Investors will keep cutting risk.” Analysts at Danske Bank have warned that some international companies could pull out of China, leading to an outflow of capital. “We envisage that US companies in China will increasingly repatriate profits as they risk being caught in the crossfire in the trade war. The prospect that America blocks some technology exports to China (and maybe other countries too?) is also alarming traders. Yoshimasa Maruyama, chief market economist at SMBC Nikko Securities in Tokyo, explains why such a move would be significant: “Unlike the seemingly spur-of-the-moment tweets by President Trump and the retaliatory exchange of tariffs, Washington’s bid to protect intellectual property is an issue at the heart of a trade row between two powers battling for future global supremacy.” “It’s turning out to be a long-term bearish factor for the financial markets, as the United States is unlikely to back down at least through its midterm elections.” Jonathan Haskel seems to be talking sterling down, even before he gets his knees under the table at the Bank of England. Sterling has dropped by half a cent today, to $1.322, as Haskel tells MPs that there may be more slack in the UK economy than we think. If he’s right, that could mean interest rates rise more slowly. Haskel is generally coming over as a more dovish policymaker, which is significant as he’s replacing the hawkish Ian McCafferty... The man who will be replaced by Jonathan Haskel is also speaking this morning, explaining why he voted (in vain) to raise UK interest rates last week. Ian McCafferty, who leaves the Bank of England monetary policy committee this summer, is arguing the economy is much stronger than official figures suggest. In his final major speech, McCafferty declares: “We should not dally in making the next move. In his view, low unemployment is starting to drive wages higher and energy prices are rising - both of which could keep inflation above the Bank’s 2% target. “Continuing with the slow reduction in monetary stimulus without undue delay could well prevent the need for a more aggressive tightening later on. Over in parliament, economics professor Jonathan Haskel is being quizzed by MPs about his appointment to the Bank of England’s monetary policy committee. Haskel has warned that rising protectionism could threaten the UK economy by driving up costs and hurting economic demand. Haskel told the Treasury committee: If protectionism were to break out into a widespread trade war I would of course be very concerned, for in such a situation economies would have higher inflation (due to higher import costs), lower demand (due to confidence etc.) and likely lower supply (to the extent that supply chains were interrupted that couldn’t otherwise be established). Haskel also warns that Brexit’s effect on the UK economy is still very uncertain. On productivity (his specialist area), Haskel says he’s less pessimistic than some other experts. He believes that some firms are making significant investment in artificial intelligence which aren’t yet bearing fruit. Haskel is due to join the BoE’s monetary policy committee in September, and he’s now being grilled about gender balance, following the row over his appointment (over four female candidates). He says that Imperial College, where he works, are making efforts to improve the pipeline of female candidates into economics. This includes outreach programmes and efforts to engage with schools (Imperial experts who will turn up and perform a “whole load of explosions”). Wes Streeting MP jokes that the Treasury Committee might enjoy a demonstration; Haskel gently points out that the House of Commons has already had one near-miss with explosions.... Newsflash: Britain’s finance minister has warned that a trade war would be disastrous, not least for the United States. Speaking during a visit to India, chancellor Philip Hammond has told CNBC that we are living in “uncertain times” right now, thanks to Donald Trump’s approach to trade and tariffs. He told CNBC India: The old certainty for many decades has been that the United States was completely wedded to open markets and free trade. And now the United States is questioning the value, the fairness, of some of our arrangements. Hammond warns that a full-blown trade was could be devastating. “I very much hope that we can avoid a full scale trade war (because) that would be a disaster for everyone, not least for the United States. Hammond also pledge that the UK would remain “an outspoken proponent of open markets and free trade, low tariffs barriers and low non-tariff barriers”. The chancellor is one of the key voices pushing for a relatively ‘soft Brexit’, under which Britain’s existing trade links with Europe are largely maintained. This chart shows how China’s Shanghai composite index has fallen pretty steadily since its recent peak at the end of January. The slump in Chinese shares this year will worry policymakers in Beijing. Many small investors will have suffered hefty losses as the Chinese market has slid 20% from January’s high. Financial speculation could destabilise the economy, at a time when officials are trying to tackle financial risks and shadow banking problems without hurting growth. Peter Garnry of Saxo Bank says China is under pressure to settle the trade dispute with America: After yesterday’s tumbles, European traders will have approached their desks nervously today. But so far, the City looks relatively calm. The FTSE 100 has rise by 23 points in early trading, having plunged by 173 points yesterday. The news that China has fallen into a bear market hasn’t caused a wider panic. The French and German markets have also risen by around 0.3%, as investors try to digest some mixed messages from the White House overnight. Wall Street was spooked last night by treasury secretary Stephen Mnuchin’s claim that America could restrict investment from “all countries that are trying to steal our technology.” That message was then undermined by trade advisor Peter Navarro, who went on TV to declare: “There’s no plans to impose investment restrictions on any countries that are interfering in any way with our country. This is not the plan.” So we’ll have to wait and see what Donald Trump signs off later this week. In the meantime, these escalating tensions are making investors increasingly nervous, says Naeem Aslam of Think Markets. If the US stops Chinese investment in certain US sectors, it will have a strong counteraction. Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin has said that more details on this would follow by the end of this week and this is going to keep investors even more nervous. On top of this, Trump administration is further adding to this uncertainty by keep sending conflicting statements; one person would say it is fake news and another would say more details on the topic would emerge sooner than later. Dickie Wong, head of research at Hong Kong-based broker Kingston Securities, says the gloom is deepening in China, as America threatens to escalate the trade dispute. Wong says (via CNN): It’s a combo effect of concerns about the trade war and China’s GDP growth. Last week Donald Trump threatened to impose tariffs on $200bn of Chinese imports, on top of the $50bn already being targeted. Newsflash: China’s stock market has fallen into bear market territory, as fears of a trade war with America hits confidence. The Shanghai Composite index has dropped 0.5% today, which means it has fallen more than 20% from its recent peak in January. Energy stocks and banks led the selloff today, as traders worried that escalating trade tensions would hit Chinese economic growth and financial stability. Reports that the US will soon block Chinese firms from investing in America, and restrict the export of cutting-edge technology to China, has sent a shiver through the trading floors. Airline stocks also had a bad day, amid worries that the weakening yuan would drive up the cost of servicing debts issued in US dollars. Bloomberg reports that anxiety in China is growing: “Pessimism will keep growing as many companies are on the edge of margin calls and bond defaults,” said Sun Jianbo, China Vision Capital president in Beijing. “The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index will fall at least 10 percent from the current level.” Trade war fears are hitting currencies across the developing world today. Jameel Ahmad, global head of currency strategy at FXTM, explains: Concerns over the possibility of an upcoming trade war are expected to remain front and centre of investor focus once again today. The Chinese Yuan, Malaysian Ringgit, Thai Baht, Indian Rupee and Indonesian Rupiah are once again trading lower against the Dollar, while the Japanese Yen is still outperforming as a result of investor reluctance to take on risk during an atmosphere of market uncertainty. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial market, the eurozone and business. The markets are edgy today after growing worries of a trade war sent shares sliding on both side of the Atlantic yesterday. Yesterday’s selloff wiped 328 points, or 1.3%, off America’s Dow Jones industrial average while the Nasdaq shed 2%. China’s yuan has slumped to a near six-month low, as the threat of a deepening dispute with America hit confidence. Analysts believe Washington will press the button in tough restrictions on Chinese investment in the coming days, which would further escalate tensions with Beijing. US treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin denied last night that America was targeting China, saying that “all countries” which pilfer US technology could face restrictions. Mnuchin may have been trying to help, but he’s actually raised fears of a broader crackdown by the US. As Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets puts it: This trade spat story looks to have good legs on it everyone. Buckle up. In weak trading, the yuan has fallen to 6.5573 against the US dollar today, the lowest since last December. The news that US motorcycle manufacturer Harley-Davidson would move some production out of America, thanks to EU tariffs, also hit sentiment yesterday. Analysts warned that it shows the perils of tit-for-tat trade barriers: Having triggered the current flurry of tariffs, Donald Trump has tweeted that manufacturers should be patient: But other US companies may follow Harley’s lead, to avoid Europe’s new 25% tariffs on some US goods. Also coming up today MPs will be kicking the tires of Britain’s newest central bank policy maker, Jonathan Haskel, who joins the Bank of England in September. Haskel is a productivity expert, but the City don’t know much about his views on monetary policy. The hearing may provide some hints on whether he’s a hawk or a dove, and thus likely to vote for interest rate hikes. Haskel’s appointment caused a stir last month; he was the only man on a five-person shortlist, so the Treasury missed the opportunity to tackle the Bank’s gender problems. On the data side, the CBI is publishing its estimate of UK retail sales this month. We’ve already had one piece of bad retail news - struggling Carpetright has just posted a whopping loss of £70.5m for the last year, as it presses on with its store closure plan. Carpetright also warned that some suppliers are tightening credit terms, following ‘adverse publicity surrounding the Group’s restructuring’. Plus, the latest survey of US consumer confidence is released later today. It hit a three-month high - will trade tensions have weakened it?

On Monday the company abruptly announced it was closing down in Singapore, where it was founded, only weeks after it closed its operations in Melbourne. Hundreds of oBike customers in Singapore and Australia have complained that the company is refusing to refund deposits and is uncontactable. Others said their initial deposit had been converted into an ongoing subscription fee without their permission. When the Singaporean newspaper the Straits Times visited oBike’s headquarters on Monday it found the building had been abandoned. The company’s Australian helpline has also been disconnected and oBike has not responded to emails or media requests. A report by the Business Times of Singapore found that oBike had been in financial trouble before its Monday announcement, with losses of more than S$4m a year. In 2017 the company earned S$912,000 in revenue, but recorded a loss of S$4.25m. It had assets of S$11.3m, but liabilities of S$22.7m, and owed months of unpaid fees to one of its PR firms, Ruder Finn. On 12 June it removed all its bikes from the city of Melbourne after the mayor threatened to impound them and charge the company A$3,000 for littering. However, a spokesman for the city of Sydney said oBike continued to operate in Sydney. “The city has found bike share operators to be responsive to requests,” he said. “The city of Sydney has agreed on a set of guidelines with five other inner-city councils which set out minimum standards and expectations for dockless bike share operators.” But a former oBike customer, Gao Yang, told Guardian Australia he had been waiting three weeks for a refund. “I came to Australia last July and was happy to learn that they were here, but shortly I realised how wrong their entire system is,” he said. “Pricing, app design, customer service, back-end IT support, promotions. Everything they did signalled to the market that they were in deep shit. Now they have problems refunding our money. “I wouldn’t call it scam. I just think they have a completely wrong business model.” The consumer group Choice said customers could pursue their money under the Australian consumer law. “The Australian consumer law has clear protections to stop companies using unfair terms in contracts,” said Erin Turner, Choice’s director of campaigns. “Anyone who has had their ‘refundable’ deposit converted into a subscription fee without their active consent should first make a complaint to oBike and, if that doesn’t work, take the issue to their state or territory consumer affairs body.” The NSW fair trading department said that if oBike did not respond, customers should lodge a formal written complaint with it. The founder of the competitor bikeshare ReddyGo, Donald Tang, said the bike share model could still succeed in Australia if it was given more support. “We still believe bike share is a good model to fill the gaps of traditional public transport,” he said. “To make this model successful we also have to understand that, apart from operators’ responsibility, we also need support from other parts of this society.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jun/26/emil-gayed-operated-wife-concerns-raised-surgeon-canberra-20-years-ago","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-26T06:57:29Z","webTitle":"Emil Gayed: concerns raised about disgraced surgeon in Canberra more than 20 years ago","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jun/26/emil-gayed-operated-wife-concerns-raised-surgeon-canberra-20-years-ago","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jun/26/emil-gayed-operated-wife-concerns-raised-surgeon-canberra-20-years-ago","fields":{"headline":"Emil Gayed: concerns raised about disgraced surgeon in Canberra more than 20 years ago","bodyText":"Concerns were raised about a disgraced gynaecologist, now under investigation for performing unnecessary and harmful surgeries on women, as far back as 1996 when he practised in Canberra, a doctor who worked with him at the time says. On Monday the New South Wales health department announced that an independent investigation was being launched into Emil Shawky Gayed, and it would his time working across four public hospitals in the state. This followed revelations by Guardian Australia that dozens of women had received substandard treatment by Gayed at Manning Rural Referral hospital in the mid-north coast town of Taree, including one woman who later died. But a doctor has told Guardian Australia that Gayed was a problem when he worked as a locum at the Woden Valley hospital in Canberra, which was renamed Canberra hospital in 1996. At the end of his six-month contract, Gayed applied for a permanent position at the hospital but was unsuccessful. He then moved to NSW to work. “There had been a lot of concerns expressed about him by midwives, major concerns,” said the doctor, who does not want to be named. “A lot of it was about the attitude that he had towards women, and that puts midwives off in a blink. He was very dismissive. He didn’t listen to their concerns and did lots of procedural stuff without consent.” The doctor said Gayed had performed surgery on his own wife while he worked at the hospital, which should have raised ethical concerns but did not. His wife had suffered complications after Gayed performed ablation on her, which involves surgically removing the lining of the uterus, and she ended up in intensive care. An internal review of Gayed by the Manning Rural Referral hospital found Gayed performed ablation up to 60% more frequently than other gynaecologists at that hospital. On Tuesday a spokeswoman for the Hunter New England area health district said 45 former patients of Gayed’s had made contact with the Manning hospital in the past fortnight. “Manning hospital is continuing to review pathology records of Dr Gayed’s patients to identify any abnormal results that may require further investigation or follow up,” she said. The doctor who worked with Gayed said discovering that the surgeon had operated on his wife had been a “standout moment”. “He operated on his wife in the private sector, but she suffered complications and was transferred into Canberra hospital intensive care unit. There were all sorts of ethical principals about operating on your own wife.” There was a culture at the time that meant concerns raised by midwives, nurses and less senior doctors were ignored, the doctor said. An added issue was that Gayed would consult in private rooms, which were not subject to scrutiny, and performed follow-up consultations after surgery in the public hospital in his private rooms as well. “When someone didn’t like advice given by a particular practitioner and if I gave a second opinion the response would be, ‘They’re public patients, they have to accept the care they get,’” the doctor said. “These doctors were at least a generation before me. And [speaking up] has branded me for the rest of my career. Every time I get to a position where I can change things, these guys rear their ugly heads.” About the time Gayed worked at Canberra hospital, the doctor said, the system was being reformed to make it a tertiary teaching hospital. Many of the older-generation obstetricians and gynaecologists were unhappy about this, the doctor said. This transition involved promoting midwife-led models of care. “Essentially, it’s about money,” the doctor said. “If you make the public system attractive for people to come to, women won’t use the services of obstetricians who also work in the private system. “At the time the obstetricians ran the department. People were admitted as public patients but I saw money in paper bags handed to specialists so that patients could be treated privately, despite being officially admitted as a public patient.” Guardian Australia has contacted the Australian Capital Territory’s health department for comment. A professor of midwifery and research director at the Western Sydney University, Hannah Dahlen, said she was not surprised that concerns raised by non-specialist doctors or midwives would have been ignored or dismissed. “In my career I have reported several unsafe or unethical medical practitioners to management and little to nothing eventuated,” she told Guardian Australia. “It’s like a dirty secret that keeps being kept until it ulcerates and is exposed and then everyone says, ‘How could this happen?’ “When you complain you are told that the doctor will be talked to or that this is the way they are, and after a while you start to be anaesthetised with this mind-numbing attitude. “What often happens is they get moved on and then it happens all again and rural areas, where they are fewer options, become the dumping ground for problematic practitioners.” Do you know more? melissa.davey@theguardian.com"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jun/26/labor-will-repeal-tax-cuts-for-companies-earning-10-50m","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-26T09:41:30Z","webTitle":"Labor will repeal tax cuts for companies earning $10m-$50m","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jun/26/labor-will-repeal-tax-cuts-for-companies-earning-10-50m","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jun/26/labor-will-repeal-tax-cuts-for-companies-earning-10-50m","fields":{"headline":"Labor will repeal tax cuts for companies earning $10m-$50m","bodyText":"Bill Shorten has pledged to repeal tax cuts for firms earning between $10m and $50m as the Turnbull government continues efforts to try to secure Senate support for tax cuts for Australia’s biggest companies. After months of declining to reveal Labor’s position, the Labor leader told journalists on Tuesday he would repeal the already legislated tax cuts for firms earning between $10m and $50m, without running that decision past the caucus or the shadow cabinet. Shorten’s public announcement, while consistent with some signalling over the past couple of months, appeared off-the-cuff and took his colleagues by surprise. The Labor leader said the opposition was still considering its position on tax relief for companies with turnovers between $2m and $10m, but asked whether he would repeal the tax cuts for firms between $10m and $50m that have already been legislated, Shorten replied: “Yes.” Shorten said Labor supported providing tax relief for small businesses but handouts for larger companies were a matter of priorities. “Fundamentally you’ve got to look at priorities,” he said. “I just don’t agree with Mr Turnbull that the four big banks deserve $17bn in tax cuts over the next 10 years. I would rather see $17bn put back into our schools. “I don’t agree with Mr Turnbull that multinationals should get a tax cut yet we are carrying out cuts to our hospitals and healthcare system. It is all a matter of values. Now, he’s entitled to his opinion. He’s made it very clear that he’s for the top end of town and I’m for hospitals and school funding.” Last year the Senate legislated tax relief for companies with turnovers of up to $50m. The Turnbull government went on the offensive immediately. The finance minister, Mathias Cormann, said Labor’s position would lead to “less investment, lower growth, fewer jobs and lower wages”. The treasurer, Scott Morrison, said the position on company tax added to Labor’s commitment to rollback elements of the income tax plan legislated last week. As well as rebuffing some of the legislated company tax cuts, Shorten has pledged to repeal stages two and three of the government’s income tax cuts, in a “rollback” campaign reminiscent of Kim Beazley’s stance on John Howard’s GST in the early 2000s. Stage two of the income tax cut plan, which begins in 2022, lifts the top threshold for the 19% rate from $37,000 to $41,000 and lifts the top threshold for the 32.5% tax rate from $90,000 to $120,000. Stage three abolishes the 37 cent tax bracket from mid-2024, flattening the tax scales so workers earning between $40,000 and $200,000 pay the same rate. Shorten’s decision to unilaterally announce the opposition’s position on the company tax cut on Tuesday comes as Labor’s internal dynamics have been unsettled by a speech by Anthony Albanese last week, in which he called for more bipartisanship and more constructive relations with business. There has also been unrest between the factional groups over the replacement of the departing frontbencher Tim Hammond, a stoush that was resolved on Monday night. As well as picking another political fight with the government on tax, the Labor leader also used the opportunity of the party’s regular caucus meeting to signal to colleagues that the byelection fights in Braddon and Longman were hard yards. “Longman is very close and Braddon is very difficult but we do have the better candidates, the better policies and the better values,” Shorten told caucus colleagues. The government pilloried Shorten’s “captain’s call cluster” in question time, and suggested a connection between the Albanese manifesto last week and the leader’s positioning on rolling back the company tax cut. The Business Council of Australia lashed Labor’s decision. Its chief executive, Jennifer Westacott, said: “Here’s another uncertainty the opposition wants to put into the economy.” She said repealing the already legislated tax cuts meant firms would face a tax increase. Westacott said Shorten often said he stood for Australian workers: “If you stand for workers, you have to stand for businesses because we employ 10 million of them.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/25/jason-cundy-apologises-female-world-cup-commentators","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-25T23:10:17Z","webTitle":"Jason Cundy apologises for comments on female World Cup commentators","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/25/jason-cundy-apologises-female-world-cup-commentators","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/25/jason-cundy-apologises-female-world-cup-commentators","fields":{"headline":"Jason Cundy apologises for comments on female World Cup commentators","bodyText":"The former Chelsea and Tottenham defender Jason Cundy has apologised after his claim, broadcast on national television, that female football commentators are too “high-pitched”. The TalkSport presenter offered up his opinion on ITV’s Good Morning Britain, before being labelled “a sexist pig” by the show’s co-host Piers Morgan. Vicki Sparks became the first female commentator for a live World Cup match when she presented Portugal’s Group B clash against Morocco from Moscow last Wednesday. However, Cundy was not a fan and told the programme: “I found it a tough listen. I prefer to hear a male voice. For 90 minutes listening to a high-pitched tone isn’t what I want to hear. “When there’s a moment of drama, which there often is in football, I think that moment needs to be done with a slightly lower voice.” Cundy is the latest former footballer to find himself in hot water for appearing to patronise female pundits, after Patrice Evra clapped an opinion aired by Eni Aluko on ITV last week. The ITV reporter and presenter Jacqui Oatley responded on Twitter: “Frustrating that this “female commentator” debate is still such an issue, 11 years after my first MotD game and 8 years after I did 7 live World Cup commentaries on 5 Live. “Voice/style preference is always subjective – to say it ‘shouldn’t be allowed’ says more about the critic.” Cundy insisted he was not questioning the expertise or otherwise of female presenters, adding: “It’s nothing to do with her insight, the way she delivers it or her knowledge or her ability to do the job – it’s the voice.” On Monday night he went further and offered an apology via Twitter. He wrote: “I want to sincerely apologise for the comments I made on Good Morning Britain. I came away realising just how foolish and out of order they were and how I deserved the backlash I have received. “There are times when you have to hold your hands up and admit you are wrong and have been an idiot – and this is definitely one of those times. I regret the comments and also the hurt and anger they caused. I realise there is absolutely no place for these demeaning attitudes towards female commentators and I’m truly sorry.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/26/jorge-sampaoli-argentina-world-cup-back-on-track","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-26T07:00:26Z","webTitle":"Argentina’s Jorge Sampaoli hits back amid reports of squad revolt","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/26/jorge-sampaoli-argentina-world-cup-back-on-track","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/26/jorge-sampaoli-argentina-world-cup-back-on-track","fields":{"headline":"Argentina’s Jorge Sampaoli hits back amid reports of squad revolt","bodyText":"After five days of soul-searching that has seen everyone from Diego Maradona to Lionel Messi’s mother have their say on where it has gone wrong so far for their team, it was left to Jorge Sampaoli to put things in perspective on Monday. “The week was difficult after the defeat,” the coach admitted. “Tomorrow the World Cup starts for Argentina.” Yet, if you had believed the reports, the man who led Chile to the Copa América in 2015 might not have even been in charge as his side prepare to face Nigeria in St Petersburg knowing that only a victory can keep alive their hopes of qualifying for the knockout stages. Speculation that Sampaoli had been sacked in the early hours of the morning after the devastating 3-0 defeat to Croatia – and that players had demanded Jorge Burruchaga, the general manager and a 1986 World Cup winner, should take over – were angrily dismissed by their FA’s president, Claudio Tapia, who accused the media of “hurting the national team”. Javier Mascherano also attempted to defuse any suggestion that they had demanded Sampaoli ditch his favoured three-man defence in an attempt to improve the service to Lionel Messi, who has yet to score in Russia. “The relationship with the coach is totally normal,” he said on Monday. “Obviously, when we feel some discomfort or we see something, we express it to him because otherwise we would be hypocrites.” Unlike for the opening draw against Iceland and the loss to Croatia, however, Sampaoli decided against revealing his hand 24 hours before kick-off, claiming he had yet to inform the players of his team but that it is “in his head”. “The way the match was structured against Croatia didn’t suit Messi,” the coach said. “We’ll try to make it better and hope that he will be able to receive the ball a lot more.” Maradona, who coached Argentina to the quarter-finals in 2010, has been among Sampaoli’s chief critics this week, accusing the 58-year-old of “lacking a plan”, but also blaming Tapia for a failure to plan ahead that has seen the country’s previously all-conquering youth sides fail to qualify for several recent major tournaments. While Messi escaped his ire, the captain’s mother also revealed in an interview with Argentinian television that her son “suffered and cried” after the Croatia defeat. “His dream is to win a World Cup. It’s what he wants the most,” said Celia Cuccittini. His 31st birthday on Sunday was marked by a peck on the cheek and a pat on the back from Sampaoli before training, amid reports he had been one of the instigators of the revolt, while down the road in Bronnitsy – a small town 30 miles to the southeast of Moscow that is Argentina’s base in Russia – there was another celebration going on. Known as the farthest point of Napoleon’s advance after the fall of Moscow in 1812, local residents arranged a party in honour of the Barcelona forward that featured a 60 kilogram life-size chocolate sculpture of their hero as its centrepiece. A team of five workers at had worked for nearly a week to produce it before being distributed among supporters. In response to the rumours about his position, Sampaoli said: “The week went from low to high, and with respect to what was said, I cannot clarify things that did not exist. They make you feel like a criminal because you lost a game.” He has a contract until 2022 and with the Argentina FA in severe financial difficulties, would usually expect to lose his job if they are eliminated. But against a resurgent Nigeria – who in November beat Argentina 4-2 in Krasnodar – they face a difficult task. “The two teams are going to try their best to qualify, which makes it a very attractive match,” Sampaoli added. “I am convinced that we have a big opportunity to make it through.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/26/tuesday-briefing-democracy-under-threat-says-election-watchdog","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-26T05:26:15Z","webTitle":"Tuesday briefing: Democracy under threat, says election watchdog","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/26/tuesday-briefing-democracy-under-threat-says-election-watchdog","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/26/tuesday-briefing-democracy-under-threat-says-election-watchdog","fields":{"headline":"Tuesday briefing: Democracy under threat, says election watchdog","bodyText":"Top story: System must be ‘fit for purpose in digital age’ Good morning briefers. I’m Martin Farrer and this is what you need to know this fine summer morning. Britain’s election laws need to be reformed urgently after a series of online political campaign scandals threatened to damage democracy, the Electoral Commission has warned. In the wake of the Cambridge Analytica revelations, the electoral watchdog says parliament and the devolved governments must make changes to combat misinformation, misuse of personal data and overseas interference in elections. John Holmes, chair of the commission, says action is needed “to ensure that the tools used to regulate political campaigning online continue to be fit for purpose in a digital age”. His recommendations include a requirement that all digital political campaign material states who paid for it, a law to clarify the ban on overseas campaign funding and bigger fines for anyone who breaks the rules. Sir John’s comments come after the Observer and Guardian reporter who exposed the Cambridge Analytica scandal, Carole Cadwalladr, won the Orwell journalism prize for her investigation. Receiving the award in London, she said there was “a systemic failure ... Our laws do not work and our regulators are unable to regulate”. * * * ‘Where’s Boris?’ – Boris Johnson has come under attack from fellow Tories after he missed the Commons vote that saw MPs overwhelmingly support plans to build a third runway at Heathrow airport. The foreign secretary is a longstanding opponent of the plans, leveraging his opposition to help his London mayoral campaigns and to win the safe west London seat of Uxbridge. But he managed to be in Afghanistan when the vote came last night, drawing derision from many. There were even suggestions that his failure to stand up and be counted on the touchstone issue could end his ambitions to become party leader. Our columnist Rafael Behr says it is final proof that Johnson totally lacks principle. * * * Get shorty – Rafael’s column might equally apply to Johnson’s fellow Brexiter, Nigel Farage, who has been forced to deny reports that he bet against the pound on the night of the referendum. According to Bloomberg, Farage was privy to private polling data that showed that the Leave campaign had won but said on Sky News that he believed the Remain camp had edged it. The “concession” by Farage, himself a City trader, was big news and pushed the pound to the $1.50 mark. When the true outcome emerged, sterling plummeted in value. Traders who bet correctly on the fall are thought to have made millions. Last night a spokesman for Farage said he “had no financial interest in currency movements” on the night. * * * Off road – BMW fears it will be forced to close its factories in the UK, putting 8,000 jobs at risk, if components for Mini and Rolls-Royce cars are snagged up in customs delays after Brexit. The German manufacturer says its logistics would not be able to cope with obstructions to its supply chain. At the same time, the UK car lobby group SMMT says today that investment in the industry is declining because of lack of clarity over the Brexit negotiations. * * * Health failure – The NHS may lead the world in equal access, but a new study has found that it underperforms compared with the health systems of other developed countries in preventing common causes of death. The report, which will fuel further debate about the current state of the NHS, also found that the UK has fewer doctors, nurses, hospital beds and CT and MRI scanners than 18 other comparable countries. * * * Director’s cut – In a moment of surrealism worthy of one of his films, David Lynch’s recent interview with the Guardian has become the unlikely centrepiece of a Donald Trump rally. The president seized on comments by the Sanders-supporting director that he could be a great president because he had shaken up the establishment. Trump joked that the favourable remarks meant the maverick’s career in Hollywood would be over. World Cup Gareth Southgate is facing a dilemma over Harry Kane and has hinted he may rest his captain to give others playing tine in England’s final Group G game against Belgium. Southgate’s opposite number, Roberto Martínez, meanwhile, has refused to rule out making as many as 10 changes in Kaliningrad. An angry Carlos Queiroz lashed out at Fifa and the VAR system after his Iran team’s 1-1 draw with Portugal and elimination from the World Cup while Spain progressed as Group B winners thanks to a last-gasp Iago Aspas goal that salvaged a 2-2 draw with Morocco. In Group A, Uruguay sailed past Russia with an efficient, unfussy display, while Saudi Arabia snatched a 2-1 win over Egypt, after which their coach Héctor Cúper dismissed suggestions Mohamed Salah is set to quit international football. Switzerland’s Granit Xhaka and Xherdan Shaqiri have escaped a ban following their controversial celebrations in the 2-1 World Cup win over Serbia last Friday. It’s the turn of Groups C and D today with Australia and Argentina needing wins against Peru and Nigeria respectively. Follow the buildup with our live blog now. Lunchtime read: Trials and tribulations The life of a barrister can appear glamorous and romantic, with clever people using clever words to fight points of law in ancient, august settings. But Sarah Langford, a criminal barrister, writes today about how the reality can be very different – endless train journeys to courts around the country, interminable waiting and the need to be not just the client’s brief but also their psychiatrist, counsellor, social worker and mother combined. Most of all there is a sense of futility at the way the system treats young offenders. Using the case of one client, Dominic, a serial-but-charming teenage offender turned serial-but-embittered adult offender, she describes the “pointless and predictable lurch between prison and court, court and prison” as he was failed by justice. Sport Trevor Bayliss has tipped his assistant, Paul Farbrace, to succeed him as the England head coach when he stands down at the end of the 2019 home summer. Set the primary target of winning next summer’s World Cup, Bayliss is not winding down though and has told his one-day batsmen to learn from Jos Buttler’s icy display of escapology at Old Trafford on Sunday. Not even a convincing two-set win over Stan Wawrinka was enough to persuade Andy Murray he is ready for Wimbledon next week – but it will be a major surprise if he is not there and raging to play. And Sir Michael Stoute, who last week became the all-time leading Royal Ascot trainer, may attempt to extend his latest sequence of big-race wins by running Eqtidaar in the July Cup. Business Donald Trump’s trade policy might be starting to backfire after Harley-Davidson said it would be moving production to other countries to avoid tariffs on US goods. The president accused the motorbike maker of “waving the white flag” but anxiety about his belligerent policy has spread to international stock markets with Asian shares down again overnight. The FTSE100 is set to open up 0.25%, however, while the pound is up at $1.329 and €1.135. The papers The Guardian leads with “Urgent action needed to defend UK democracy, says watchdog” over calls from the Electoral Commission that reforms are needed in light of Cambridge Analytica and other scandals. The Independent labels the Heathrow expansion “Air Farce One”, whereas the Times goes with: “MPs back £14bn Heathrow expansion”. “Tax and spend will harm Tories,” says the Telegraph, “Trump tariffs drive Harley to build EU bikes outside US,” says the FT. The Mirror has “Bucks Fizz Jay: My mouth cancer nightmare” while the Express splashes with “Exhausted doctors act ‘like drunks’”, with a surgeon’s claims overworked staff are putting patients’ lives at risk. The Mail has more on its passports investigation, saying: “Passports for sale on Facebook”.

The cool thing is when you come out of those meetings everyone acknowledges: ‘You know what, there are things I can do better, now I will do better rather than making excuses.’” If this sounds familiar, mandatory self-criticism was a central tenet of Maoist political doctrine and used extensively under The Chairman. Whether the great leap forward for Mercedes was down to the engineers and indeed drivers acknowledging their ideological errors to one another – and what one might now refer to as the party hierarchy in Brackley – or just the upgraded-spec engine may become clearer in Austria and Silverstone. Mercedes have the momentum Sebastian Vettel’s mistake into turn one, meant a straight comparison between the pace of his Ferrari and Hamilton’s Mercedes was difficult to gauge but a broad perspective suggests the British driver’s team have the front foot for the remainder of this triple-header. In qualifying pace Hamilton appeared to have gained six-tenths of a second on Vettel since Canada. A variety of factors will have played their part: the new engine, the temperature, the track and even Vettel losing third practice due to rain – the session this season when he has usually superbly fine-tuned his ride. But there was also the use of the 0.4mm-thinner tread tyres, last seen when Hamilton was utterly dominant in Spain. They are employed by Pirelli on tracks where there is a fear of overheating and the Mercedes clearly enjoys the characteristics of this rubber more than the Ferrari. They will be confident going into Austria then but positively beaming in Hamilton’s back yard when the thin tread reappears at Silverstone. Max turns the tables With three podium finishes in four races Max Verstappen has gone some way to silencing his critics. Vettel was one, suggesting the Dutchman needed to adapt his driving style after he hit the German in China. It was clearly with not a little glee that Verstappen replied when asked his opinion on Vettel’s incident. “I think next time you see Seb you should ask him to change his style. Because honestly, it’s not acceptable. That’s what they said to me at the beginning of the season. And then, of course, Seb shouldn’t do anything, and just drive again and learn from this and go on. That’s my advice to everyone in this room.” He got a good laugh but shortly afterwards it became clear that the issue genuinely really did still rankle for the young driver. “It just makes me angry, because it won’t be as bad on him as it was for me. But I didn’t change a thing, and now everything is going right. At the end of the day they will never get the last laugh because I know what to do. It’s just annoying.” Ricard has lessons to learn The pride of French fans at the return of their grand prix after a 10-year absence was a pleasure to behold on race day, with the grandstands awash in a sea of tricolours but the sellout crowd of 65,000 spent much of their weekend with gritted teeth. Traffic problems plagued the circuit with many fans stuck in queues for hours on end attempting to enter and leave the track. Given that it was funded by seven local authorities to the tune of €14m, more infrastructure investment might have been expected. They are learning the lessons that took Silverstone so long and has largely successfully addressed with efficient traffic management and an extensive park-and-ride system. At Ricard there were disgruntled fans who said they would not return and while the passion in France is clear, guaranteeing an improvement next year is key to the future of the race. McLaren meltdown The weekend began poorly for McLaren when “chocolate-gate” emerged: reports that there was widespread dissatisfaction at the team, epitomised when staff were given 25p chocolate bars as a bonus for hard work. The team were left trying to shift the attention back to racing but on track there was no respite. The car has a well-identified problem in a lack of grip through low-speed corners and at Ricard its shortcomings were manifold. Fernando Alonso and Stoffel Vandoorne had their worst qualifying of the year, with the Spaniard ultimately retiring from last place and Vandoorne finishing in 12th. Alonso’s frustration was clear but their problem goes beyond confectionery. The team’s CEO, Zak Brown, admitted the aerodynamic issue did not show up in the wind tunnel and thus was having to be addressed and fixed on track at race weekends. Which raises the most serious question. How did McLaren, of all teams, allow their design to come so far with such a fundamental issue unidentified?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jun/25/permit-patty-eight-year-old-selling-water-san-francisco-video","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-25T19:56:36Z","webTitle":"California woman threatens to call police on eight-year-old black girl for selling water","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/25/permit-patty-eight-year-old-selling-water-san-francisco-video","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jun/25/permit-patty-eight-year-old-selling-water-san-francisco-video","fields":{"headline":"California woman threatens to call police on eight-year-old black girl for selling water","bodyText":"A white California woman who said she was calling police on an eight-year-old black girl selling water has faced international backlash, with critics dubbing her “Permit Patty” and business partners severing ties. Alison Ettel went viral over the weekend after footage spread of her on the phone, saying she was calling the authorities on a girl because she didn’t have a permit to sell water, drawing instant comparisons to the many high-profile cases of white Americans harassing people of color with 911 calls. The video filmed on Saturday in San Francisco captured Ettel on the phone complaining about “illegally selling water without a permit”, as she tried to hide from the girl’s cousin who was filming her. “This woman don’t want to let a little girl sell some water. She calling the police on an eight-year-old,” the cousin narrated, before turning to Ettel: “You can hide all you want. The whole world gonna see you.” People uncovered Ettel’s identity soon after the publication of the videos, which have been viewed more than 8m times on Instagram and Twitter in just two days. Ettel, the CEO and founder of TreatWell, a company that makes cannabis-based tinctures, began losing business relationships within hours of the release of the footage. Meanwhile, an online supporter of the girl has since donated a trip to Disneyland for her and her family. Ettel, who did not respond to the Guardian’s requests for comment on Monday, has defended her actions in numerous interviews. She told the San Francisco Chronicle, “It was wrong, and I wish I could take it back.” But in an interview with the Huffington Post, she also said “this has no racial component to it” and further claimed she was only “pretending” to call police. Then in a statement to ABC News, Ettel said she was annoyed by the “yelling” of the mother and daughter and that she called police not to “report them”, instead saying: “I simply wanted to know if what they were doing was legal.” The incident follows two similar controversies in the Bay Area, which despite its liberal reputation has increasingly faced scrutiny and backlash over racism and gentrification. In Oakland, across the bay from San Francisco, a white woman was dubbed BBQ Becky and became the subject of viral memes after she called police on a group of black people barbecuing in a popular park. Weeks later, a white man nicknamed Jogger Joe faced widespread outrage when video emerged of him trashing a homeless man’s belongings. Black Americans have in recent months also had the police called on them while waiting in a coffee shop, napping, working out, selling real estate, moving into a new home and golfing. In one television interview, the eight-year-old girl, identified as Jordan, said: “I did not want to see the police, because I was scared.” Her mother, Erin Austin, told one reporter that she had recently lost her job and that they had planned a trip to Disneyland. “My daughter just wanted to help.” The girl said of Ettel: “She asked me where is my permit. And I didn’t know what a permit was.” Her family could not immediately be reached for comment. Barbary Coast, a San Francisco cannabis dispensary, was one of the first to sever ties with Ettel and TreatWell. “As soon as I saw it, I put the word out to staff to pull it off the shelf immediately and let her know we weren’t doing business with her any more,” Jesse Henry, Barbary’s executive director, told the Guardian. He said he would never work with TreatWell again. “That type of behavior just isn’t acceptable.” An Oakland dispensary also announced it was no longer selling TreatWell, saying in a statement that even though it was a “best-selling” product, “integrity is always before profits”. A musician who saw the video donated four tickets to Disneyland to the girl and her family."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/26/thailands-junta-renews-corruption-crackdown-on-buddhist-monks","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-26T05:15:33Z","webTitle":"Thailand's junta renews corruption crackdown on Buddhist monks","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/26/thailands-junta-renews-corruption-crackdown-on-buddhist-monks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/26/thailands-junta-renews-corruption-crackdown-on-buddhist-monks","fields":{"headline":"Thailand's junta renews corruption crackdown on Buddhist monks","bodyText":"Thailand’s Buddhist temples have long been tainted with allegations of greed, corruption, sex, murder and child abuse, while monks, sworn to lives of abstinence, have often been caught living compromisingly flashy lifestyles. But while there were previously seen as untouchable, over the past month the Thai military government have suddenly moved to crack down on corruption in the temples, arresting six of the country’s most high-profile monks. A seventh fled to Frankfurt to seek asylum, with the Thai authorities following him to Europe in hot pursuit. It is the military junta’s boldest move towards cleaning up the Sangha, the name of the Thai Buddhist order, and among the six arrested are several elderly monks on the Sanghka supreme council, the country’s Buddhist governing body. Two senior abbots at Bangkok’s famous Golden Mount temple were also among those arrested but most surprising was the arrest of Phra Buddha Issara, a rightwing firebrand monk known both for his political activism and his alleged ties to the Thai prime minister Prayut Chan-ocha. Both serve in the Queen’s guard military unit, though Prayut now denies any connection to Issara. “The arrest of these monks is clearly designed to place the state in control over any monks who might stray from loyalty to the junta, especially as we are approaching elections,” said Paul Chambers, a lecturer at Naresuan university who specialises in Thai politics. “This is their way of demonstrating that the state is really above the Buddhist sangha.” While the military junta, who took over Thailand in a bloodless coup in 2014, have long pledged to stamp out corruption, the timing of the four temple raids has been seen as significant and politically motivated. Prayut’s government are under greater pressure than ever to follow through on their promise to call elections in February 2019, and cleaning up corruption in the temples is percieved as a canny move that would play well to the electorate when they run as a political party. Buddhism is one of the three pillars of Thailand, alongside the monarchy and the nation (90% of the country is Buddhist), and there is a widespread sense of disgust at the level of corruption and illegal activity that goes on in the temples orchestrated by the monks. Some of the temples generate millions in donations ever year, with donations actively encouraged as a way to bring worshippers good karma, and yet are subject to no external regulation on how the money is spent. The junta’s past attempts to exert their authority over the temples have not proved successful. In February last year the junta raided the popular Dhammakaya Temple, looking for its spiritual leader Phra Dhammachayo on allegations he had embezzled £28m of temple donations. The temple’s well-known allegiances to former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who is despised by the military and was toppled in a military coup in 2006, was also perceived as a motive of the raid. However, Dhammachayo eluded arrest and there was a backlash against the military government for being too heavy handed in the raid, which saw 4,000 officers descend on the temple for three weeks. “After the seige of the Dhammakaya temple, people really started to look askance at what the military was doing to the monks and question their motives, and it really did damage to Prayut’s reputation” said Chambers. “So these new arrests might be designed to give the military a more popular image and make people forget about the failed mission last year. And the monks they have arrested – with Buddha Issara as the exception – they already had a really corrupt reputation so are an easy target.” After the failure of the Dhammakaya Temple siege, the junta announced last March it was was drafting a law which would significantly weaken the Sangha council. It has not presented it to parliament yet but these new arrests could be laying the groundwork for the legislation. Perhaps the most surprising of all the recent arrests was Buddha Issara, who was formally stripped of his position as a monk and sent to Bangkok remand prison to await trial on charges of robbery, forgery, and illegal detention of officials during the protests in 2013 and 2014, prior to the coup. Issara had in fact been a long advocate for reform in Buddhism and last August condemned the military junta for not acting on their promise to clean up the temples. “Are they still serious about tackling corruption or are they only moving against certain people and groups?” he said, adding that when it came to monks: “No one can touch them.” The arrest of Issara has been perceived as a sign that either the junta fear he is too much of a loose canon politically or is that the junta are attempting to prove themselves as ethical, and deserving of political longevity, to the new Thai monarch, King Maha Vajiralongkorn, who inherited the throne last year. Thailand has recently seen a rare upsurge in protests and demonstrations, and the arrests have also been seen as the junta giving the monks a strong signal of what will happen if they don’t toe the line politically, especially the large number who still have loyalty to the pro-Thaksin red-shirt movement. Investigations are still ongoing and it is thought there will be more arrests going forward."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"crosswords/quick/15028","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2018-07-06T23:00:14Z","webTitle":"Quick crossword No 15,028","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/quick/15028","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/quick/15028","fields":{"headline":"Quick crossword No 15,028","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"crosswords/quick/15025","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2018-07-03T23:00:12Z","webTitle":"Quick crossword No 15,025","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/quick/15025","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/quick/15025","fields":{"headline":"Quick crossword No 15,025","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"australia-news/live/2018/jun/26/coalition-energy-frydenberg-tax-politics-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-26T08:07:43Z","webTitle":"ABC apologises for saying prime minister decided byelections  date– as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2018/jun/26/coalition-energy-frydenberg-tax-politics-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/live/2018/jun/26/coalition-energy-frydenberg-tax-politics-live","fields":{"headline":"ABC apologises for saying prime minister decided byelections  date– as it happened","bodyText":"And on that note, we will leave you there. Labor has a new policy, Tony Abbott didn’t get the support he wanted but is still threatening to cross the floor, and Scott Morrison has given us the snake of envy. That’s about enough for one day, I think. A massive thank you to the Guardian’s brains trust, and to Mike Bowers, for not only bringing me country bakery bread, but also for being Mike Bowers. And to you, as always, for reading and following along. It means more than you know to have you support our efforts, even if you don’t always agree. We will be back bright and early tomorrow for the second-last sitting before the winter break so, as always, take care of you. Just a glimpse The ABC has apologised for its news coverage of the byelection date: News: On Friday 25 May 2018 the 7pm News broadcast a story on the ramifications of the decision to call a series of byelections on 28 July. The story attributed that decision to the prime minister despite him having denied earlier that day that he had made the decision. The story should have included that denial and a similar statement from the Speaker of the House of Representatives. ABC News apologises for the error. Pauline Hanson on company tax cuts in the Senate just a little bit ago I haven’t flip flopped, I said no originally and then I said yes, then I said no and I stuck to it.” Sorry. My post was a little delayed because I was just checking the definitions of flip flop, in case I was wrong, or it had changed. But no, the informal US English usage of the term is still “when someone completely changes plan”. Or, if it is easier, take out ‘I haven’t flip flopped’ and you’ll get a pretty good definition of what a flip flop is. Nick Champion has taken the renaming of his electorate on the chin (not that there is much choice): I welcome the decision to rename the seat of Wakefield to Spence. Renaming Wakefield after Catherine Helen Spence is a great tribute to someone who gave so much to our society and in the reforming of Australian politics. Spence fought for female suffrage initially in South Australia and, after succeeding in 1894, continued to campaign in New South Wales and Victoria. Of her many achievements, Spence is recognised as Australia’s first female political candidate, Australia’s first professional female journalist and also the author of the first legal studies textbooks produced in Australia. I am proud to have served as the member for Wakefield since 2007 and look forward to continue serving as the member for Spence.” Malcolm Turnbull let slip this in QT today, in response to Susan Templeton, but I think he means the byelections (I am just rereading the pinks and greens). But for the record: The honourable member will be doing the rounds and saying, vote for the Labor party and pay more tax. I don’t think that will be a very compelling message, but we don’t have long to wait. I didn’t even realise it had been five years: The Coalition looks to have secured support for its higher education bill which lowers the threshold for repayments on student debts from $54,000 to $45,000 a year. That will mean people earning $45,000 a year will have to pay at least 1% of their income ($450) towards their student loans, rising to 2% for those earning more than $52,000 ($1,040) and 3% for those earning more than $62,000 ($1,860). The sums are a little different because the bill has changed since then, but our columnist Greg Jericho wrote in May 2017 that the effect for those with student loans is a steep increase in their effective rate of taxation and more money out of their pay packets. The bill also imposes a lifetime cap on taxpayer loans of $104,440 for most students, but under changes students will be able to incur more debt up to this limit if they pay some back. The bill is opposed by Labor and the Greens but has won wide crossbench support from David Leyonhjelm, Cory Bernardi and others. Centre Alliance’s Stirling Griff confirmed to Guardian Australia that his party supports the $45,000 threshold and the replenishing cap. After moving amendments to lower the threshold even further, Pauline Hanson’s One Nation is also on board, according to Fairfax media. For the first time today, let’s get some Mike Bowers magic into you. The Senate just voted on a motion put forward by Peter Georgiou to basically give more GST to Western Australia (“recognises that it is in the interests of the nation that tax revenue be fairly distributed”) and that the productivity commission report into GST be released immediately. It lost 47 to 6. Pauline Hanson voted with her senator. Chris Bowen has put out a statement on what Labor was trying to get at in question time: Another day, another reminder that Scott Morrison isn’t up to the job of treasurer and is more interested in out-dated Reaganomics and the Tea Party than paying off debt and protecting the Australian economy. Scott Morrison said at a doorstop: ‘I don’t consider tax relief a cost to the budget.’ What a truly bizarre and looney tune comment to make. This shows Australians everything that is wrong with the Turnbull government digging massive structural holes in the budget, courtesy of the $140bn income tax and $80bn big business handout while gross debt is projected to remain above half a trillion dollars. Memo to Scott Morrison: cuts in tax do cost the Budget. The government is being fiscally reckless when it says it will bring the tax cuts forward if the economy improves, but will deliver them even in the face of a significant economic downturn: meaning either the budget will worsen substantially or essential services and supports will be cut yet again. This latest line of thinking that somehow cutting tax pays for itself is concerning, because it suggests that if Australia faces another external economic shock in the future, and the revenue dries up, we won’t see tax cuts for big business or high income earners repealed, but more cuts to health, education and other basic services. Aspiration count: 10 Snake: 4 Arrogant: 2 Last week Penny Wong asked a question of the Senate president, Scott Ryan, after Alice Workman’s Buzzfeed story on the ETU member who was asked to turn her shirt inside out during a parliamentary tour. Wong: There has been some media reporting online of an alleged incident involving a young apprentice visiting parliament house who was allegedly asked by a security guard to take off her shirt because it had a union logo on it. I appreciate you’ll need to make inquiries. I ask: is this policy of not allowing someone wearing a union logo T-shirt into the parliament approved by the Department of Parliamentary Services? Is it a policy endorsed by or known to the presiding officers? Today, Ryan got back to her: “I would like to respond to the question asked by Senator Wong in the chamber last Thursday, following reports in the media, relating to a member of the public being asked to remove or cover up clothing that displayed a union logo. “All people entering parliament house are subject to security procedures and prohibited items are not to be brought into parliament house. “Items that might cause danger to people or damage property, might be used to disrupt order or decorum, or compromise security arrangements must be cloaked before entry into parliament house. “These items include weapons, aerosol or paint cans, laser pointers and obvious protest paraphernalia. “Protest paraphernalia, including clothing with specific messages, if allowed into parliament house may, depending on the circumstances, have the effect of bringing the protest into parliament house and can be used to disrupt the order of the parliament. “Operating policies and procedures No 10.5 notes if a person is found inside the building with a prohibited item, parliamentary security service staff ask that person to surrender that item. “I am advised that on 19 June a protest organised by Unions ACT was conducted on the authorised assembly area within the parliamentary precinct. “On 20 June I am advised a PSS officer noticed potential protest material or paraphernalia being taken into the building through the main front screening point by a small group. The PSS officer spoke to a pass-holder and the visitors who owned the material before contacting the team leader. “One of the visitors was carrying a poster that was promptly passed to the pass-holder who accompanied the group. “The clothing worn by the visitors displayed material related to the demonstration of the previous day. “After speaking with the PSS officer, the team leader took into account these matters and made an assessment that their clothing was potentially protest paraphernalia. The clothing in question contained more than a small logo. “Where a personal assessment is made that an item of clothing worn by a person may be protest paraphernalia, they are requested to cover it, change the item, or turn it inside out. “The team leader approached the visitors and requested that clothing displaying protest material be covered, changed or turned inside out. The team leader suggested to the group that they could use the nearest bathrooms for changing purposes. After some discussion the visitors appeared to comply before leaving the area. “I am advised the PSS team leader was asked if his decision was because their clothes displayed union logos. “The team leader explained displaying a union logo was not the issue, the issue with the clothing was the slogans and images contained on the clothing. “From the inquiries made as a result of this question and the media report, the department has determined that the manner in which the relevant security service team leader addressed this situation was professional and courteous. “As is evident from the many union representatives that attend parliament house on a regular basis, there is no policy precluding access by association, nor does the policy prohibit the display of logos. “Parliament house receives thousands of visitors each day. “The parliamentary security service officers bear a significant responsibility for interpreting policies and making judgments ... which balance the right of people to access the building while ensuring that proper decorum is maintained. “My advice is that this particular policy has been in place since January 2009 and it has not since been reviewed. All security policies are currently on a review program by the Department of Parliamentary Services which commenced last year.” Labor is going to take a look at the claims in Ryan’s answer. Malcolm Turnbull, who I think would be horrified to learn that Tveeder struggles to translate him at times because of how his words run together, does us all a solid and calls time on QT. Fun fact: Tveeder can transcribe Tim Storer word perfectly, because he is just that methodical with how he speaks. Be more like Tim Storer, parliament. Never here, Paul Fletcher is here to save us from this drudgery! Just joking. He mentions the “latte line” and the “goats cheese circle” and now I just want another coffee and some cheese. So, I guess it is not a total loss. Susan Templeman to Malcolm Turnbull: “The finance minister has said tax cuts for the top 20% of income earners would go ahead even if another GFC hits. Given gross debt under this minister has blown out to a record half $1tn and he has already made savage cuts, won’t this just mean that if a downturn hits, this government will again cut schools, Medicare and pensions?” Turnbull: “The honourable member should take to task the person who wrote that question for her, because it was very unfair to have her asking a question that is so misleading and so inaccurate. “In fact, spending on hospitals is increasing substantially, and the minister for health just described the $30bn increase over the next five years agreement, and spending on schools is increasing every year because we have introduced the first truly national consistent needs-based commonwealth funding policy for schools. So I thank the honourable members for her question, but the premise of it was entirely wrong. “We are able to keep funding for those essential services increasing because we have the budget under control, and at the same time, we could bring it back in to balance a year earlier, and at the same time, we are able to provide tax relief to hard-working Australian families and indeed for small and medium family businesses. “The very businesses that the honourable member has many o fin her electorate, which will be hit hard by a Shorten Labor government.” It goes on, but I cannot. We are getting our daily dose of Greg Hunt, and I think the matrix may be broken, because I have seen this episode already. Tanya Plibersek to Malcolm Turnbull: “The prime minister said earlier that the government’s [tax cuts] is funded by hard-working Australian families. Why is the prime minister taking $80bn from hard-working families and the services they rely on and giving it straight to big business?” Turnbull: “Mr Speaker, it is obvious that economics has joined aspiration and geography as mysteries to the deputy leader of the opposition. When governments reduce tax, whether it is personal income taxes as we have done last week, or business tax, as we did last year – and of course as the opposition is proposing to jack up business taxes again – when taxes are reduced, the government is not giving anything away. It is taxpayers’ money. It is taxpayers’ money the government is taking less of. The fact that the deputy leader of the opposition does not understand this speaks volumes for the contempt the Labor party holds Australians, hard-working Australians and businesses, large and small.” Josh Frydenberg delivers another dixer straight to Tony Abbott on the Neg. Abbott looks very busy not listening. Bill Shorten to Malcolm Turnbull: “Yes or no, does the prime minister consider that the big banks deserve a $17bn tax cut?” Look, we all know we are not going to get a yes or no answer here. It is physically impossible for the prime minister not to actually say a million words in his allotted time, when he feels he is on a roll. He has had his barrister strut on all afternoon. The papers have been gathered with flourish. The glasses have been on and off and the finger is in full pointing mode. There is no way we are getting a yes or no answer here. Update: shockingly, we do not get a yes or no answer here. We do get Warren Snowdon serving sass levels not seen since my post-formal though, so there was that (he was almost named, but withdrew – and is just sinbinned for the normal time). Peter Dutton seemed to trip over his dixer answer today. I guess its hard to combine the CFMEU basically being the mafia, with deaths at sea and strong border policies and keeping you safe and Labor is terrible every single day, without occasionally tripping over your script. Catherine King to Malcolm Turnbull: “By the time they are fully implemented, stage three of the personal income tax scheme and big business handout will cost at least $25bn a year. Where is the money coming from? Won’t this mean even more cuts to schools, Medicare and pensions?” Turnbull: “The deputy leader of the opposition is mystified by aspiration and the member for Ballarat is mystified as to where the money comes from. I will let you know: it comes from hard-working Australians. “It comes from Australian businesses making profits and paying tax. It is their energy, their enterprise, their aspiration, which drives the Australian economy. Nothing more clearly distinguishes the unreality, the disconnected, the out of touch nature of modern Labor, that they do not recognise that everything that we do here, every dollar we spend, comes from the efforts of hard-working Australian families. “That disconnectedness. It is their money. When we cut taxes, what we’re doing is enabling Australians to keep more of their money. “Labor thinks it is them giving them a gift. It is not. It is hard-working Australians’ money. “We are able, because of good budget management, to pay for all those essential goods and services, including the ones Labor neglected, like those pharmaceutical benefits listings which were deferred in 2011 as Labor’s budget showed. Labor couldn’t fund the PBS and Labor neglected those services and we are funding them with increasing amounts every year. We are keeping our nation safe. As the minister has just described. We are doing that providing more tax relief to hard-working families and Australian businesses and bringing the budget back into balance a year earlier. “That is the difference between a strong economic management under the Coalition and the debt, deficit, failure and disappointment of the Labor party.” God, take out Labor party and that last sentence just takes me back to family dinners. Christopher Pyne is now talking drones. The parliament holds it breath, it is just that excited. (Having already made a cup of tea, I am now considering going to get a biscuit, because come on. The press release has already been sent out. This is just punishment now.) Michael McCormack took a dixer, so I made a cup of tea. Chris Bowen to Scott Morrison: This morning, the treasurer said about his big business tax cut, he said, I don’t consider tax relief a cost to the budget. Is the reason the tax cut is underfunded is because the treasurer believes he can conjure the money out of thin air? Isn’t it a fact that spending $80bn on a big business tax cut just means more cuts to Medicare, schools and the pension?” Morrison (who has notes, so he obviously knew after what he said at the press conference this would come up, or at least his office did): “Reducing company tax promotes investment, creates jobs, drives growth. Who said that? Member for McMahon 2013. That snake charmer over there (he is immediately made to withdraw). He says some more things – or uses some other Labor quotes – but he is so excited and making so many loud noises, the transcription feed just cannot cope. And neither can I. Tanya Plibersek to Malcolm Turnbull: “Last year, the National Australia Bank made a net profit of about $5m, but cut 6,000 jobs. Why is the government trying to cut a deal with One Nation to reward the big banks with a $17bn handout? Why do his arrogant and out of touch policies always reward the top end of town while workers get punished?” Scott Morrison takes it. He also has notes. He needs them for this: “I was talking about the boa constrictor before, the one that suffocates and constricts the blood supply to the body as it defeats it. “That is what Labor’s policy will do to our economy. There are plenty of other snaky characters. If you look at the king brown snake, it has the largest reported venom output of any snake in the world. Who’d that remind me of? The leader of the opposition.” He’s stopped from going further by the Speaker. Tony Smith: I don’t like the track he is going down. He is about to get bitten. But there are more snake puns to come! The snakes and ladders approach of tax policy that we have seen from the Labor party, saying to people that they reckon they will put them on the ladder of opportunity and the truth is they are just going to slide all the way to the bottom under Labor’s tax policy.” Bill Shorten to Malcolm Turnbull: “Why is the government negotiating to give big business a handout after the byelections? Don’t voters deserve to know the truth that this government is teaming up with One Nation to give the banks $17bn?” Turnbull (he is very excited to answer this question. He has papers and everything to read from): “The honourable member has asked me about the voters in Longman being entitled to hear the truth, and that is absolutely right. They are, they are, and they did not get the truth from the leader of the opposition on 22 June when he was on radio, and he was on radio and he said that, you could not get chemotherapy on Bribie, you had to go to Brisbane to get it, couldn’t get it anywhere near Caboolture, and a lady called Patsy called in. “She rang into the radio program and she sought to correct the leader of the opposition. It is one of the most excruciating calls to listen to. The patronising way in which he talks over Patsy, cuts off, does not want to listen to her, and he says, he says, ‘Patsy, I can’t see why you are so frustrated,’ and Patsy, Mr Speaker, spoke for all Australians, certainly all the voters in Longman, when she said, ‘I’m frustrated because you’re not telling the truth, for God’s sake.’ “She called him out for one falsehood after another. Then he talked over the top of her at the hospital and he said in a rather patronising way, ‘Well, we disagree there, Patsy. You are entitled to your opinion.’ She said again, speaking for all Australians and everyone in Longman, ‘Are you serious?! I live here.’ I know, Mr Speaker. The fact is the leader of the opposition is misleading the people in Longman as he is misleading the people right around the country. “Funding has increased. And even when Patsy, living there, living in Caboolture, calls up and seeks to get the facts straight, using the services of the hospital, the medical services, when she called up, this arrogant, out of touch leader of the opposition talks over the top of her and says rather grandly ...” Tony Smith cuts off his oration and says that he said a little bit ago, he mentioned how he didn’t like the term “arrogant and out of touch” being used in questions, and that stands for answers as well. Turnbull finishes with, “I say again, she spoke for all Australians when she said to the leader of the opposition: I am frustrated because you are not telling the truth, for god’s sake.” Mark Butler to Josh Frydenberg: “Is the prime minister aware that the energy council has called new coal-fired power stations unaffordable and there is no reason to build them? Energy Australia has said coal-fired power is a solution my grandfather would have built. “AGL said no private capital will invest and Origin has said it will be unlikely they would be investing in new coal. How on earth can the prime minister suggest twice today that coal-fired power might be around forever?” Frydenberg: “I haven’t had a question from the member for Port Adelaide for 250 days, Mr Speaker. He lost his seat, he lost the presidency, now he has lost his relevance, Mr Speaker. “The reality, Mr Speaker, as the prime minister said, is coal is an important part of our energy mix. The member for Port Adelaide knows what happened in South Australia when the northern power station closed and the wholesale prices went up by more than 80%. “The member for Maribyrnong now turns his back because it was a Labor government in Victoria that tripled the royalties on the coal-fired power stations of Victoria. Saw the closure of Hazelwood which also saw wholesale prices in Victoria going up 80%, Mr Speaker. “And now it is up to the Labor party to tell the workers, the blue-collar workers in the mines and the power stations across the country, that their policies will close them down. And put them out of a job. “Will they go to the electorate and tell the 230 workers at the Gladstone power plants that under their policy they will be out of a job? Will they go to the election of Gippsland and tell the 500 workers at the power plant there that under the Labor party’s emissions scheme, they will lose their job. And will they go to the member for Shortland’s electorate and tell the 300 workers there that they will lose their job? “Mr Speaker, when it comes to coal, we know that you cannot trust what the Labor party says because the member for Shortland is the shadow minister for climate change and energy and he proudly put on his website, he proudly put on his website about the Carmichael mine and I quote, ‘I welcomed the jobs it will provide in Queensland, Mr Speaker.’ Now, what do you think his website says it now? “He has gone to the same school on websites as the member of Barton-went to. Now his website says the following. ‘I remain opposed to the Carmichael mine.’ “So, the Labor party, the leader of the opposition, he will go to the miners in Mackay and tell them he supports them. He will then go to the baristas at Batman and tell them that coal has no future. Don’t look at what Labor says, look at what Labor does. Only the Coalition can be trusted to deliver more affordable and reliable power.” In her dixer, Kelly O’Dwyer keeps referring to a “cluster” of a decision by Labor and Bill Shorten, and I just can’t help thinking a word is missing there. Did she mean cluster-daisy? Cluster-fudge? Cluster-fiddlesticks? THESE ARE THE ANSWERS WE NEED! Steve Ciobo lined up a whole dixer just for this pay-off We have, of course, the member for Grayndler. Who, me? he says to the Sydney Morning Herald. We know that that member, Mr Speaker, has a different view. He sees himself as the new messiah of the Australian Labor party. He wants to lead them into the promised land. Like the Life of Brian on that side, Mr Speaker, like the Life of Brian, you have the opposition frantically ringing up the backbench saying, he is not the messiah, he is just a very naughty boy. “Because we conceded, they are opening the gulf between the two of them. Of course, he claims he is not the messiah either but that immortal line from Monty Python, only the true messiah would deny his divinity. The fact is, we now see the splits opening up on Labor. He is going hard left and he is trying to be more centrist.” Question: is there a time limit on when we will stop hearing Monty Python quoted by politicians and are we there yet? Andrew Wilkie asks the independents question on whether Tasmanian businesses will be able to compete for government contracts, given the government’s preference to award contracts to national suppliers - many of who do not have a presence in Tasmania. Malcolm Turnbull says the government has already looked at that: The new Commonwealth procurement rules require that benefit the Australian economy be considered when assessing the value for money for tender system non- construction procurement above four million and construction procurement above 7.5 million. And potential suppliers to government will continue to be treated equitably and cannot be discriminated against based on their size, location or ownership.” It goes from there to an attack on Labor for its commitment to repeal the company tax cuts, so it’s quite the journey. Mark Butler to Malcolm Turnbull: “Last month the security board repeated the consensus view that there would be no way that anybody would be financing a new coal-fired power generation plant and this was not contentious at a factual level. “How can the Prime Minister today tell the Parliament that coal-fired power might be around forever? Is there anything this Prime Minister won’t do to stop the members for Warringah and Hughes from crossing the floor and undermining his government?” Turnbull: “I’m not quite sure what the honorable member believes qualifies him to have some sort of infallible crystal ball, but over the years I have found that predictions about technology are often mistaken, and so you are better off recognising... (he pauses for interjections, which gives me the opportunity to ask a sidenote - does that also apply to the NBN) Turnbull continues: “The reality is that coal-fired power is a big part of our energy mix at the moment and will be at the part for a very long time and may very well be forever. We will find out in many years to come. “The reality is, in the here and now, we need to have cheaper and more reliable power. The honorable member knows better than most that in his state that combination of left-wing Labor ideology, led by the now dismissed Labor government, dismissed by the people of South Australia, that combined with other incompetence resulted in his state having the most expensive and the least reliable electricity in Australia. We are delivering more reliable and more affordable power because we are working on it with the benefit of engineering and economics. I know they are strangers to the honorable member but believe me, they are the guides to a more affordable and reliable energy future for all Australians.” Scott Morrison goes into ‘at-the-pub-over-a-pint-of-midstrenth-watching-the-Sharks-drop-the-ball-two-yards-from-the-try-line’ mode to answer his dixer. Someone has got their mojo back, eh? But it has done nothing to improve his analogies: The leader of the Labor party, we used to have leaders who talked about the ladder of opportunity. Remember that? This Labor leader is all about the snake of envy. That is what he is about. Australians will slide down the totem pole under this Leader of the Opposition’s policies and the blood supply will be constricted by the boa constrictor over there. The boa constrictor suffocating the economy, cutting off the blood supply, Mr Speaker. That is what the Labor Party are all about. Higher taxes, cutting off the blood supply to our economy...” He runs out of time, so we’ll never know if a mongoose or honey badger enters this story. Tony Burke asks if Malcolm Turnbull could maybe make a “passing reference” to the question and Tony Smith says just so. But we move on to a dixer. Mike Kelly to Malcolm Turnbull (also on energy) “The CEO of Snowy Hydro has stated that building new coal-fired power plants doesn’t stack up. The chief operating officer has said it will mean Snowy 2 is not viable. As the government is the sole shareholder, has advice being sought from Snowy Hydro about the impact of building g new coal-fired power plants on the viability of Snowy two?” Turnbull: I cannot be happy enough to answer a question about Snowy 2. What a great example of the vision of governments in the past, Labor and Coalition governments, and Snowy Hydro 2.0 is the next stage that is going to deliver thousands of jobs into the Eden-Monaro electorate, and it is going to provide a secure dispatch [of] power into the future. “Now, the member referred to some remarks by Paul Broad. He is entitled to his opinion. He is entitled to his opinion, but we have a policy that is entirely technology agnostic. The national energy guarantee provides no disincentives for anyone to build a new coal-fired power station or refurbish an existing one any more than it provides a disincentive for people to build more gas or indeed to build more hydro. “What it does is prioritise dispatch ability, which had been sadly missing from all of the Green left energy policies of the Labor party, and that of course supports thermal power. “As far as Snowy Hydro 2.0 is concerned, I would remind the honourable member of this. Snowy Hydro 2.0 will be a big baseload customer of all providers of energy, generators, renewable, but including coal-fired power. A power station that runs 24 hours a day, like a coal-fired power station, does not have the same demand 24 hours of the day. A big pump hydro scheme will be buying power from coal-fired generators in the off-peak times and will provide that of peak baseload demand. “So it is one that will provide support right across the industry, but the bottom line is let the market decide on which technology to determine, let the market decide what we are prioritising is affordability, reliability and meeting those emissions reductions targets. We can do all three, the Neg does it, it will bring down energy prices for the reasons that has been advanced, it will bring down energy prices and that will be good for families, businesses, large and small, and it will be great for Australian jobs.” And Mike Bowers has just returned from his off-site job to bring you all of the excitement from the chamber, so huzzah! Bill Shorten to Malcolm Turnbull, and it is on the Neg. “The environment minister said, ‘I would welcome a new coal-fired power station.’ Does the prime minister agree?” Turnbull: “Coal has a very important role and I have no doubt it will have, for many years to come, possibly forever. Who can tell? The reality is we have a [multi] technological approach to energy policy. The subsidies are coming to an end. The renewable energy target will be complete. In 2020, it will be all met. What we have the national energy guarantee for the first time, the combination of an ability to ensure that power is affordable, that it is reliable, that you have enough power to keep the lights on and that you meet the Paris commitments ... “We are already seeing our energy policies working. Already we have seen the wholesale price of gas halved in the last 18 months. There was a massive shortage of gas on the east coast of Australia, created by the Labor party, created by a federal Labor government and the Queensland state Labor government that allowed gas to be exported from the east coast without any regard to the consequences. We have resolved that with additional gas supply. “We are already seeing the wholesale cost of generation down 30% over the last year, and finally we are now starting to see a reduction in the cost of energy for mums and dads, small businesses, families, retail prices are starting to come down, among families and the small business. So we are turning the corner on energy costs driven up by the combination of left wing ideology and Labor incompetence. “That is a very dangerous combination. That is what the Labor party brings to economics. We have heard in the leader of the opposition’s latest captain’s call, his latest attack to the member for Grayndler, the member for Grayndler went out and said they should be [open] to business. “They say to thousands of family owned small and medium businesses of the country that if he is elected prime minister, he will jack up their tax. That is what he wants to do. He will put at risk millions of Australians jobs, so not only is he going to put up personal income tax, he is going to put up the tax of the businesses that employ more than half of the Australian private sector.” My phone has been running off the hook for most of the morning, from all quarters of the Labor party (and I imagine it’s the same for much of the press gallery) and here is what I have gathered: The decision to repeal the $10m to $50m business tax cuts was not taken to shadow cabinet. There is conjecture over whether Labor’s economic review committee agreed to repeal it. The caucus was surprised to hear Bill Shorten say “yes” to the repeal question this morning. That’s not to say that it hadn’t been discussed, or some thought it was heading down that path, or anything else. That is just what I’m being told by multiple people, across the factions. The Business Council chief Jennifer Westacott will also wade in on Labor’s announcement – just ahead of question time. I am going to go out on a limb and say she is against it. Ever felt bad about getting a favourite Australian author’s book out of the library instead of buying it, because you want to support them, but money is tight? Well, you are still financially supporting them. Authors and publishers are compensated through the Australian government lending rights scheme, which this year paid out $22.3m through 17,200 creators and publishers this year. “These schemes provide Australian authors and publishers with the means to keep producing uniquely Australian stories to inspire current and future generations,” Mitch Fifield said in a statement. So go hit up your libraries! Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry chief James Pearson is in the building today – he just came round as part of his tour of the press gallery, asking Labor to reconsider its position: “[These businesses] are employing about 1.1 million Australian workers, so straight away over a million workers, well over 10,000 businesses who now face a tax increase. “Now that means, if they were thinking about more investments, taking more risks on the back of knowing that they’ve got a tax cut coming and the next tranche is due on Sunday, they are going to think twice about whether or not they should go ahead and take the risk of increasing investment, knowing that if Labor comes into government after the next election and gets its policy through, then they are actually going to be paying more tax. “But it doesn’t end there because Labor has said it is still reserving its position on whether or not it will honour the legislated tax cuts for companies between $2m and $10m turnover. And that is turnover, not profit, these are small companies. We are talking about the corner pharmacy for example. You are talking about 60,000 companies employing 1.5 million people – they are being told ‘just wait and see’. “They would be forgiven for thinking after today’s announcement that Labor’s trajectory is to reverse their tax cut as well and that is why my message to the Labor party today is ‘please, reconsider this decision’. “It is sending a negative signal to the local business community in general, just penalising companies that happen to have turnover of $10m and $50m, that happen to be employing over 1 million Australians – that is bad enough. “But it is pulling the rug out from under smaller businesses as well, frankly, at a time when Australia is facing increased competition from overseas for investment and for growth, then it is sending the wrong signal and it is making us the odd one out.” If you read through that SA electoral committee decision you would have seen that Mark Butler will no longer be the member for Port Adelaide. Here is what he has to say about that: I have been the proud member of Port Adelaide since 2007 and am obviously disappointed in the decision to abolish the seat. This seat is deeply entrenched in the local community, with a proud and long history. ‘The Port’ is perhaps the best-known and most iconic part of South Australia – home to the State’s oldest football club, one of the oldest local councils, and to a proudly progressive community. I will look at all my options as I continue to serve my community. I know that the Port is a resilient community whose spirit and character will shine through, regardless of the federal seat in which it lies.” Just on what Labor might do moving forward in terms of the other business tax cuts, a spokesperson for Bill Shorten tells me the party “has never supported these tax cuts for big businesses – we voted against them and we haven’t changed our position”. “We’ve always supported tax cuts for small businesses,” she said. “As Bill said, we’re considering a threshold of $2m or $10m turnover. That will be decided by the shadow cabinet, in the normal way.” With Labor’s support, the government will pass its slate of foreign interference and anti-spy laws, but Amnesty has joined GetUp in terms of lingering concerns. From its Australian external affairs director, Claire O’Rourke: “Despite the welcome bipartisan announcement yesterday exempting charities from having to register under the foreign influence transparency scheme, Amnesty International remains concerned about the potential impact on our work from the other bill in the package. “The espionage and foreign interference bill in its current form could wreak enormous damage to Australian civil society. “By making it a crime to hold the Australian government to account on human rights, this bill will help shield government from accountability. These draconian laws proposed will make Australia more like the authoritarian countries this bill is supposed to protect us from. “It’s outrageous that parliament is rushing through this bill without properly considering the ramifications for Australian freedoms. “This bill must be amended to include robust exemptions for charities, so they can continue to contribute to Australian civil society without fear of criminal charges.” Labor’s employment services spokesman, Ed Husic, has commented on this story revealing complaints against the PaTH internship scheme, including “inappropriate trainer behaviour”, delays in $200 payments and a self-described “dish pig” told to work in 37-degree heat. Husic: “Minister Cash has no idea what is going on in this program. She’ll come out and make bold pronouncements that PaTH interns are protected, but it’s only in estimates that we find out the truth. “Minister Cash told the Guardian that [the department] closely monitors all internship placements, yet on May 29 in Senate estimates the department responded differently under questioning. “When asked about ensuring interns only work the amount of hours they are supposed to under the program, the department admitted: ‘We don’t collect data on how many hours each intern’s working.’ “We keep having our concerns reinforced that interns do not have their conditions or safety assured under this program. “The program hinges on the courage of young people, especially young women, to make complaints about their employers. There have been a couple of complaints about inappropriate behaviour but how many have gone unreported?” On Labor’s announcement that it wants to repeal the legislated tax cut for businesses sitting between the $10m and $50m thresholds. According to taxation statistics from the ATO, from 2015-16, there are: 941,166 businesses in Australia, of which 856,528 (91%) have total income less than $2m; 64,395 businesses (6.8%) have total income between $2m and $10m; 20,243 businesses (2.2%) have total income above the $10m threshold. The Turnbull government says there are roughly 14,000 businesses sitting between the $10m and $50m threshold, which equates to 1.5% of all businesses. So Labor wants to repeal the tax cuts for 1.5% of businesses. The Coalition will want the bottom 97.8% of businesses to identify with that 1.5% when it rails against Labor’s “job destroying” measure. More details are slowing emerging from the Yay the Neg! meetings held in the Coalition party room meetings from this morning: A spokesman for Chris Bowen tells me that the full abolition (down to $2m) was in Labor’s 2016 election fiscal plan. Still making the decision on the $2m to $10m tax cuts though, and any decision on that will go to the next election. Fresh from trying to censure states for creating safe access zones, Fraser Anning would now like to censure states looking at euthanasia. He has put forward this motion. Labor has a conscience vote, and I think from memory, government senators do as well (but happy to be corrected). To move that the Senate: (a) notes that: (i) the introduction of euthanasia legislation undermines society’s position on the sanctity of life; (ii) euthanasia legislation has the potential, as seen in the Netherlands, for the expansion of euthanasia to allow elderly individuals to end their life when no medical issues are present; this increases the risk of elder abuse; (iii) in 2016 the Australian Bureau of Statistics recorded 2,866 people had committed suicide; (iv) in particular, the young adult suicide rate in Australia is exceptionally high, with over one-third of deaths (35.4%) among young people aged between 15-24, due to suicide; (v) creating a culture that accepts death as a solution, is counterproductive to combating Australia’s suicide epidemic, and risks the lives of our most vulnerable, and (vi) dying with dignity means using the medical advancements of palliative care as the solution to ease the pain of terminal illness, not the artificial ending of a life prematurely. (b) condemns the Victorian parliament for introducing a law which risks the well-being of Victorians and creates a climate of death. (c) calls on the Senate to reject any move that would allow the expansion of euthanasia. Interesting. Scott Morrison says Labor had flagged its repeal plan in the costings for its own tax plan: This was already in their costings. They actually put in their last set of costings that you have seen the full abolition of the enterprise tax plan. So if they are actually now shrinking what they are proposing to do, they would have less revenue than they were thinking about before. “They have a $10bn black hole out of what they will get out of the retirees tax. “The house of cards he built is crumbling and falling over. I will let him explain his number because he’s got to justify that to the Australian people. “Australians don’t trust Labor when it comes to finance. Bill Shorten will say anything and do anything and then Chris Bowen will stand there beside him looking like a numpy trying to make out it all adds up. Australians get it. They can see it. They don’t trust these guys with the economy or their own money and the rollback of tax relief that Labor are now proposing – $70bn on personal income taxes – ”vote Labor and pay higher tax”, roll back on making business taxes more competitive with a company with an average size of employees of 75. Give me a break. They are not multinationals. This guy needs to get out more!” Amanda Rishworth says Labor has been “very clear from the get-go” about its tax plan. “We have not supported the majority of the government’s corporate tax cuts because we don’t believe that we can achieve a budget repair that is fair, that still properly funds our schools and hospitals and gives income tax cuts to those that need it the most,” she told Sky News. “We have been very, very clear from the outset. We considered our position and now we have made a decision. There will be a clear choice at the election – there will be no uncertainty or illusion. There will be a clear choice at the election about what priorities we would have, that is funding schools, hospitals and income tax cuts for those that will benefit the most – those low- and middle-income households. “And there will be a clear choice between that and the Liberals’ plan to give big companies a tax cut.” Talking to some of the Labor peeps, the decision not to support the business tax cuts, which have already been legislated, was discussed by caucus. The decision to repeal those tax cuts was not. So perhaps a bit of a captain’s call, or at least a leadership group’s call, there. Labor hasn’t said what it will do for businesses with a turnover over $2m. There are about 94,000 businesses in Australia with a turnover between $2m and $50m, according to Treasury figures from a few months ago, and those businesses employ just over 3.3 million Australians. Not only the Snake of Envy. The man who gave us unbelieva-Bill, now presents: Bill Shafton. Scott Morrison is still talking: We believe the enterprise tax plan should apply across all businesses, as you know. By the time there are reductions in company taxes for businesses at that level, the banks already would have paid some $16bn in the bank levy. which basically completely wipes out any benefit that they would directly receive from a lower tax rate. “So, sorry ... We believe the enterprise tax plan should apply across all businesses. For the simple reason that small businesses do business with large businesses. “Take Qantas, for example. They have like 13,000 small-business suppliers. I mean, how do they do better with Qantas if Qantas is paying higher taxes? “I have never understood the argument for taxes remaining high. It is bad enough that there seems to be some view in the Labor party, even though, as we all know, they used to support these changes, that if you ask businesses, demand, mandate them to pay higher taxes, how that actually helps them be more competitive? “How it helps them to employ more people, to increase wages or increase productivity? I don’t understand the argument which says, ‘Pay the government more tax and you will do better and the economy will be better off.’ What is even worse is the global movement in taxes on business around the world is down and if our businesses remain where they are, we will have the second-highest tax rate for business in the OECD. “Now, when it first came down, both under treasurers and prime minister Keating and treasurer Costello, there were 19 countries that had taxes higher than us. There will only be one. How long will that last? “They want to leave us up there in the stratosphere for higher taxes for our businesses and not afford them relief. Even for businesses with a turnover of between $10m and $50m. This is a naked tax grab. This is a tax grab to go and spend money all over the shop in some sort of big plate the cash splash. That is what Bill Shorten wants. He wants a big chest to just splash cash all over the country to pursue only one interest. And it isn’t the national interest. It is his own political interest.” Here’s what Bill Shorten told the Labor caucus today: “Turnbull has no clue how people actually live and I do believe his wealth is connected to that ... Longman is very close and Braddon is very difficult but we do have the better candidates, the better policies and the better values.” Shorten cited the Coalition’s $144bn personal income tax cuts and total $80bn tax package as evidence of Labor’s superior “values”, arguing the income tax cuts would give parliamentarians a tax cut of $7,000. Scott Morrison on Bill Shorten’s announcement: This is terrible news for 1.5 million Australians who work in those businesses that will have to face higher taxes under Labor if Labor is elected. How Labor thinks taxing those businesses with an average of 75 employees is going to help those businesses actually go out there and compete and make their way ahead is beyond me, and I think it just demonstrates how Labor just doesn’t get it when it comes to having plans for a stronger economy. Labor used to talk about the ladder of opportunity. We all remember that. They used to talk about the ladder of opportunity. Well, under Bill Shorten, under the Labor party today, what we have is the snake of envy. This is a snake and ladders game under Labor. It used to be the ladder of opportunity and now it is the snake of envy under Bill Shorten. Australians will slide down under Labor. They will slide down. They will either pay those taxes directly in higher taxes, as we know more than $200bn in higher taxes on the economy, or they will pay for them through the suffocation of the economy through higher taxes.” The ladder of opportunity dates back to Mark Latham’s first press conference as opposition leader in 2003: Now some people today of course will be asking, ‘Who is Mark Latham and what does he stand for?’ Well I stand for the things that I’ve been doing all my life: working hard trying to climb that ladder of opportunity, working hard, studying hard. I believe in an upwardly mobile society where people can climb the rungs of opportunity, climbing the ladder of opportunity to a better life for themselves and their family. I believe in hard work. I believe in reward for effort. I believe in a government that is there to help the people who are doing the right thing – the people who are getting stuck in, doing things the fair dinkum Australian way. And that’s always been the case for me, always the case of working hard and getting stuck in. That was me from public housing seeing that my mum was in a home of her own. I worked hard through school and got through to university, then I moved on to a good job and worked hard. I then ... had the honour to serve in my local community in local government and then for the last 10 years working hard in the Australian parliament. You’ve got to get stuck in and I believe passionately in climbing the rungs of opportunity. And I want that for all Australians. I believe in upward mobility. I believe in climbing that ladder. And the problem in Australia that we’ve got at the moment is the Howard government has taken out too many of the rungs. It has taken out too many rungs. I want to put them back in. The rungs of opportunity that come from good quality healthcare in our society, the opportunity that comes from a decent, affordable education, the basic services that all our community rely on. These are the things we’ve got to restore. We’ve got to put those rungs back into the ladder of opportunity in this country. There are about 14,000 businesses in Australia sitting between the $10m and $50m threshold. Scott Morrison has rounded that up to “about 20,000” and quotes Mark Latham in saying that Labor used “to talk about the ladder of opportunity”. “It used to be the ladder of opportunity, and now it is the snake of envy under Bill Shorten. And Australians will slide down,” he says. I was curious to see whether any of the Labor folks would raise Anthony Albanese’s speech last Friday during their regular caucus meeting this morning. Apparently it was all quiet on that score. Bill Shorten, according to people in the room, downplayed expectations during his pep talk that they would do fantastically well in the “super Saturday” byelections. These would be tough contests, he told colleagues. Also Madeleine King, the WA backbencher, has been elevated to the frontbench after being anointed by the right faction last night. There was some concern that one of King’s colleagues might ambush nominate at this morning’s meeting because the filling of this frontbench vacancy has been internally controversial, but it was all quiet on the western front. (If you’ve missed the King controversy let me cut a long story short: the right powerbrokers wanted Nick Champion to fill the spot left vacant after the departure of Tim Hammond. The left went nuts because putting Champion in would have meant the right was in breach of affirmative actions rules. A women was subsequently sought. Several women were interested in filling the vacancy. King, a West Australian, was ultimately selected. Not everyone is happy about it.) Overnight a Greens motion put forward by Nick McKim to stop the removal of the discount for pensioners, veterans and widows applying for citizenship applications, was passed, with Labor and members of the crossbench – which means it won’t go ahead. The government had moved to scrap the discount, which would have meant those eligible for it would be forced to pay for $285 for their application. With the discounts remaining in place, they will have to pay only $20 or $40, depending on their situation. The South Australian boundary carve up has been announced by the electoral commission: The augmented electoral commission for South Australia today announced the outcome of its deliberations on the names and boundaries of the 10 federal electoral divisions in South Australia. Tom Rogers, the presiding member and electoral commissioner, thanked the individuals and organisations who contributed to the redistribution of South Australia throughout the redistribution process. “All written objections and comments, as well as the information presented at the inquiry in Adelaide on 7 June have been thoroughly considered,” Rogers said. “After a comprehensive consideration of these contributions, the augmented electoral commission has unanimously decided to adopt the redistribution proposed by the Redistribution Committee for South Australia without change,” Rogers said. The redistribution of South Australian federal electoral divisions was required as South Australia’s resident population relative to that of other states and territories means that it is now entitled to 10 federal electoral divisions. Final boundaries The redistribution committee’s full proposal is detailed on theAEC website, along with a full overview of the augmented electoral commission’s conclusions on objections to the redistribution committee’s proposed redistribution. The Division of Port Adelaide will be abolished and changes will be made to the boundaries of all of South Australia’s remaining electoral divisions. “The final boundaries have resulted principally from the need to reduce the number of electoral divisions from 11 to 10. Abolishing an electoral division, together with the need to ensure that all of South Australia’s 10 electoral divisions then meet the numerical requirements of the Electoral Act, means that changes have been made to the boundaries of all electoral divisions in South Australia,” Rogers said. Final names The augmented electoral commission has retained the names of the Divisions of Adelaide, Barker, Boothby, Grey, Hindmarsh, Kingston, Makin, Mayo and Sturt. The previous Division of Wakefield will become the Division of Spence. This is in recognition of Catherine Helen Spence (1825–1910) for her work as an advocate for female suffrage and electoral reform. Once the redistribution is formally determined on Friday 20 July 2018, the number of South Australia’s electoral divisions named after women will double from one to two. Next steps The augmented electoral commission notes this proposal is not significantly different from the proposal of the redistribution committee and therefore no further input from members of the public will be sought. The names and boundaries of the federal electoral divisions for South Australia will apply from Friday 20 July 2018 when a notice of determination is published in the Commonwealth Government Notices Gazette. Note: Electoral events will not be contested on these new federal electoral divisions until a writ is issued for a general election following the expiry or dissolution of the House of Representatives. The Mayo byelection is being conducted on the boundaries in place for the Division of Mayo at the 2016 federal election. Overview maps will be available on the AEC website on Friday 20 July 2018. Detailed maps and a report outlining the augmented electoral commission’s reasons for its formal determination will be tabled in the federal parliament and will subsequently be made publicly available. The Greens spoke about the Neg in their party room – and the need to keep further coal infrastructure out of it – as it stands, if it came up for a vote, the Greens would vote against it. Weak targets and shifting the burden to other sectors – transport and agriculture – were the reasons for that. The Greens also want to look and see what the Labor states will do – whether or not they will stand up for the renewables sector. Higher education is also back on the agenda – the Greens think Centre Alliance may have done a deal with the government. We’ll check that out and get back to you. Back on the drones, Labor is pointing out that the government has already announced the program. Three times previously. There was March 2014 Then February 2016 And then May 2017 And then again today The government does point out that the roll out won’t commence until 2023 though: Australia has already taken delivery of seven Poseidon aircraft and achieved Initial Operational Capability earlier this year. The full fleet of 12 Poseidon aircraft is expected to be delivered and in operation by 2022. The first of the Triton aircraft is expected to be introduced into service in mid-2023 with all six aircraft planned to be delivered and in operation by late 2025, based at RAAF Base, Edinburgh in South Australia. The Orion fleet has performed exceptionally on operations throughout its distinguished service, and the last of these aircraft will be over 40 years old when they are withdrawn from service in 2023.” A Labor peep says reversing those company tax cuts has been the party’s position for awhile, but to be honest, that is news to me. Not sure if I missed it somewhere (very possible, I do occasionally have to sleep) but I think I would have remembered. They have just pointed out that it hasn’t been explicit, but it’s been understood that is where the party was heading. If you’ve been following the national energy guarantee debate this week you’ll know that the energy minister Josh Frydenberg lined up a group of business folks to address the backbench environment and energy committee this morning. The group appeared afterwards to speak to television reporters. The message from representatives of the Business Council of Australia, the Ai Group and the National Farmers Federation was clear: get on with passing the Neg people, we’ll work out the fine print in due course. Jennifer Westacott from the BCA: “If this doesn’t go ahead, this is ground zero and investment will go to other countries.” Innes Willox from the Ai Group: “I think we all made the point there is no real alternative. If this doesn’t work, we go back to chaos”. Tony Abbott also stopped by the camp of TV reporters and made it clear he wasn’t rescinding his threat that he might cross the floor if he doesn’t like what Frydenberg ultimately brings to the parliament. Fiona Simson of the NFF said if Abbott crossed the floor, that would be “very disappointing”. She didn’t mince words. “We think we can make this work ... we don’t want politics to get in the way, and we don’t want internal politics to get in the way.” Willox didn’t either: “To kill this off really would be wrecking-ball politics.” New reviews into legislation surrounding “online safety” have been launched. Mitch Fifield says it’s “timely” The government has appointed Ms Lynelle Briggs AO to conduct a review of the Enhancing Online Safety Act 2015 (the Online Safety Act), which sets out the powers, functions and governance arrangements for the Office of the eSafety Commissioner. Ms Briggs will examine whether the provisions in the Online Safety Act remain fit for purpose. Ms Briggs will, at the same time, review Schedules 5 and 7 of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 (BSA) which regulates the internet and content services industries in relation to prohibited content. The review will look at the type of content covered and best practice approaches for regulating online content.” The Greens have emerged from their party room. We’ll bring you what was discussed there as soon as we can. Labor has put out Bill Shorten’s transcript – the entire exchange can be seen below: JOURNALIST: Mr Shorten, what business does deserve a tax cut? What size of business rather, deserves a tax cut? SHORTEN: Well we’ve actually said that we will support any Australian business with an under $2m turnover to get a tax reduction because we think small business could always do with all of the assistance it can get. Beyond that, we’re considering our position between $2 and $10m turnovers but fundamentally you have got to look at priorities. I just don’t agree with Mr Turnbull that the four big banks deserve $17bn in tax cuts over the next 10 years. I would rather see $17bn be put back into our schools. I don’t agree with Mr Turnbull that multinationals should get a tax cut, yet he is carrying out cuts to our hospitals and health care system. It’s all a matter of values. Now he’s entitled to his opinion, he’s made it very clear – he’s for the top end of town, I’m for our hospitals and school funding. JOURNALIST: So you will repeal the tax cut between $10 and $50m as already legislated? SHORTEN: Yes. Scott Morrison has some words on Bill Shorten’s comments: And Mathias Cormann also has some thoughts: Bill Shorten says Labor will roll back the company tax cuts – which have already been passed – for businesses that earn between $10m and $50m. The party is still considering what happens for those between $2m and $10m. We said that we will support any Australian business with under $2m turnover to get a tax reduction. We think that small business can do with all of the assistance they can get. “We are considering between $2m and 10m turnovers, beyond that, you have to look at priorities. “I just don’t agree with Mr Turnbull that the four big banks deserve $17bn in tax cuts over the next 10 years. I would rather see that being put back into our schools. I don’t agree with Mr Turnbull that the multinationals should get a tax cut yet we are carrying out cuts to our hospital and healthcare systems. It is all down to values. He is for the top end of town. He’s made it clear how he feels. I am for education and health funding.” Asked whether that means he will repeal what has been legislated, Shorten said: “Yes.” Bill Shorten spoke at Ceda’s conference this morning in Canberra – afterwards, he was asked about Labor’s decision to personally attack Malcolm Turnbull and his wealth, given that Labor MPs have their own investment and property portfolios. Listen, let me state this clearly. Good luck to Mr Turnbull for being a very, very wealthy man. It is not his wealth that worries me. It is when he says stupid things. When he says to young couples buying their first home, ‘get rich parents’. When he says to aged care workers in Burnie, why can’t they get a better tax cut, he says, ‘get a better job’. I generally think Mr Turnbull is so out of touch with how millions of Australians live their life. That is the problem.” The “get rich parents” line goes back to May 2016, when during a radio interview, Turnbull, while chatting with ABC radio host Jon Faine, suggested he “shell out” for his children’s first home deposit: On ABC radio on Wednesday, Jon Faine asked Turnbull whether his refusal to touch negative gearing was creating generational conflict, with young people resenting the difficulty of entering the housing market. “They’re saying: ‘For goodness sake, you baby boomers want everything and you’re locking us out,’” Faine said. Turnbull asked if Faine’s children were locked out of the market, and he said they were. “Well you should shell out for them – you should support them, a wealthy man like you,” Turnbull said. Faine chuckled and said: “That’s what they say!” “Well exactly. There you go – you’ve got the solution in your own hands,” Turnbull replied. “You can provide a bit of intergenerational equity in the Faine family.” Oh – and Australia will now have drones surveilling the coast line. This is how Sky Net begins: The Turnbull Government will invest $1.4bn and acquire the first of six MQ-4C Triton remotely piloted aircraft through a cooperative program with the United States Navy. The Triton will complement the surveillance role of the P-8A Poseidon aircraft through sustained operations at long ranges as well as being able to undertake a range of intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance tasks. Together these aircraft will significantly enhance our anti-submarine warfare and maritime strike capability, as well as our search and rescue capability. Our number one priority is keeping Australians safe. This investment will protect our borders and make our region more secure. As part of this investment Australia will also enter into a $200 million cooperative program with the United States Navy for the development, production and sustainment of the MQ-4C Triton. Australia’s alliance with the US is our most important defence relationship, underpinned by strong cooperation in defence industry and capability development. This cooperative program will strengthen our ability to to develop advanced capability and conduct joint military operations. As part of the initial $1.4bn investment in the Triton system, the government will invest $364m on new facilities at RAAF Base Edinburgh and RAAF Base Tindal, as well the necessary ground control systems, support and training required to implement a project of this nature. The project is expected to create about 70 jobs across South Australia and the Northern Territory. Northrop Grumman as supplier of the Triton will play a lead role in delivering the capability in Australia. This investment follows Northrop’s commitment to a $50m advanced Electronic Sustainment Centre of Excellence at the new Western Sydney Airport. Australia has already taken delivery of seven Poseidon aircraft and achieved Initial Operational Capability earlier this year. The full fleet of 12 Poseidon aircraft is expected to be delivered and in operation by 2022. The first of the Triton aircraft is expected to be introduced into service in mid-2023 with all six aircraft planned to be delivered and in operation by late 2025, based at RAAF Base, Edinburgh in South Australia. The Orion fleet has performed exceptionally on operations throughout its distinguished service, and the last of these aircraft will be over 40 years old when they are withdrawn from service in 2023.” Mark Butler stopped by doors to talk energy (within the Coalition party room): Now it appears from reports this morning that instead of focusing on a policy that we know will actually underpin realistic investment, this energy committee, chaired by Craig Kelly, attended by people like Tony Abbott, instead is going to focus on a fantasy of Australia building new coal-fired power stations. When Malcolm Turnbull first floated this idea last year he was given a resounding message from business that new coal-fired power stations are simply uninvestable in this country. Indeed, the only businessman that indicated any interest in partnering with Malcolm Turnbull in such a venture was Clive Palmer, whose last great idea was building Titanic II. The government was also given a message from the Energy Security Board that no investor is going to go near a new coal-fired power station. And Malcolm Turnbull’s own pet project, Snowy 2.0, it has been made very clear, will only be viable with a high renewable energy future and not with new coal-fired power stations. It is time for Malcolm Turnbull to engage in some plain speaking to his party room this morning. The longer the Coalition engages in these fantasies of building new coal-fired power stations, the longer Australians are going to have to wait for an energy policy that will start to put downward pressure on household and business power bills. Sky News is back on at Parliament House, just in time for us to see Christopher Pyne talk drones. He also wades into the aspiration battles. Please let this end soon. Lee Rhiannon, who will retire from the Senate in mid-August, gave a speech during the adjournment debate last night, where she defended the New South Wales Greens – and also took a shot at how the $1.6m Graeme Wood donation was used (spoiler – she would have rejected it, even if it was offered to the NSW Greens, which it wasn’t) and goes on to talk about the party’s declining vote. From her speech: (Page 130 of the Senate Hansard) In 2010, I was elected a Greens senator in NSW, with the party polling 10.69% of the vote. This is the highest vote ever achieved by the Greens in NSW in a Senate election. The Green NSW Senate vote in that election, however, was lower than that for other state Greens parties across the country. A significant reason for that lower Senate result was how the $1.6m that Graeme Wood donated to the Australian Greens was used. This money was spent on advertising to assist the Greens election campaign in every state and territory except NSW. No money was offered to the Greens NSW. If any money had been offered to NSW, I doubt that we would have accepted it, as we oppose large political donations on the basis that they potentially buy influence and distort our democracy. The Greens Senate results in 2010 are informative. They demonstrate that big money buys advertising that, in turn, can win over voters. The results also show how an empowered party — in this case, the Greens NSW — where members have a major say in the campaign and that is promoting policies for the public good can increase votes without relying on big donations. Our members work incredibly hard on election campaigns, and that is why I was elected as an MP and why the Greens have had the electoral success that we have achieved in NSW. Members control party campaigns. Since 2010, there has been some decline in the Australians Greens vote. Some people assert that the Greens NSW is causing the slump in the nationwide Greens vote. That is ridiculous. I’m not keen on making comparisons of Greens NSW voting achievements to those of other states, but I have decided to put this on the record, as the misinformation about the Greens NSW and myself is quite shocking. Recent Greens election results have been inconsistent, but they include strong results in the Queensland 2017 state election and the NSW local government elections in both 2016 and 2017. Obviously a party’s vote is determined primarily by one’s political stance but organisational factors right through to the party’s position on the ballot paper are relevant. The following Greens vote figures by state show that a number of Greens state parties have experienced a higher drop in their federal vote when compared to the drop in the Greens NSW vote. Compared to 2010, the 2016 Greens Senate vote in NSW dropped by 3.3%, in Western Australia by 3.4% and in Victoria by 3.8%. In Tasmania, the Greens Senate vote declined by 9% since the 2010 high-water mark. A similar trend is evident in the Greens House of Representatives vote. I am highlighting that this voting data is not consistent with the narrative built about the Greens NSW. The unethical attacks on the Greens NSW do not help anyone other than the opponents of the Greens.” GST is back on the agenda. Cabinet will have had a look at the review into how we should split the revenue pool among the states and territories by now, but I think there will most likely be internal briefings before we get a look at it – so all those coalition MPs can take it back to their electorates. Particularly the WA ones. Pauline Hanson has adopted GST reform as one of her issues (again) and (again) has said she will disadvantage her home state of Queensland, if it means a fairer share for WA. “I’m the leader of a national party. You’ve got to look at what is fair and just, right across, for all Australians. And I will still stand by that,” she told The West Australian late last week. Last time she said that, during an interview with a Perth radio station, during the WA state election, she denied it. Presented with the evidence, she then back tracked from her comments. The coalition party room is meeting to hear all the benefits of its own policy, as Josh Frydenberg and the moderates work to stamp out a conservative rebellion. If it seems dramatic, that is because it is. Tony Abbott may be a pain, but he is also a former prime minister and a former prime minister crossing the floor against his party is not the visual the Liberals want as they slide towards an election. Frydenberg has giving the signal that he is not against a new coal-fired power plant, which may be enough to appease the dissenters. But then he has to take that attitude into Coag, where Labor states, with their renewable energy targets, aren’t so into coal as the future. So that should be fun. The tax wars are also rolling on, although there is no real movement there – the government still doesn’t have the numbers for its company tax cuts and probably won’t get close until after the 28 July byelections. Meanwhile, the government has stepped up its counter-attack against Labor, with the Daily Tele carrying a story on Malcolm Turnbull donating his $528,000 salary to charity, while the Oz has looked at Labor MPs who own investment homes – which would remain negatively geared, even if Labor wins the next election and axes the investment tax break. And Clive Palmer and Pauline Hanson are still taking potshots at each other and Lee Rhiannon has defended the NSW Greens as the best Greens. So it is situation normal in the 45th parliament. Follow along with Mike Bowers at @mikepbowers and @mpbowers and me in the comments and at @amyremeikis or for some behind the scenes/morning political update on the story at @pyjamapolitics. The Sky News channel is down here, but I will do my best to track down those interviews for you (thank goodness for A-Pac) and we will struggle through. Ready? Let’s get started."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/jun/21/nick-kyrgios-boiling-point-tense-win-kyle-edmund","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-21T17:58:39Z","webTitle":"Nick Kyrgios reaches boiling point in tense win over Kyle Edmund","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jun/21/nick-kyrgios-boiling-point-tense-win-kyle-edmund","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jun/21/nick-kyrgios-boiling-point-tense-win-kyle-edmund","fields":{"headline":"Nick Kyrgios reaches boiling point in tense win over Kyle Edmund","bodyText":"Nick Kyrgios is playing the sort of lights-out grass‑court tennis that should put him in the conversation when Wimbledon starts on Monday week – if he can hold body and soul together. However, there was evidence here on Thursday that his temperament could yet strangle his genius. After pretty much serving Kyle Edmund out of the Fever-Tree championships in three sets, the gifted Australian first proclaimed the loser would be a “massive” threat at the All England Club, then turned on inquisitors who asked him about a burst of swearing at his box near the end of his 7-6 (3), 6-7 (5), 6-3 win on an otherwise pleasant, warm afternoon in west London. “He’s really good on grass,” Kyrgios said of Edmund. “He serves well. His backhand has improved really a lot. He’s got a good forehand. He returns well. He sliced well. His intangibles were good. I would definitely put him [among the few contenders at Wimbledon].” Then it got a little edgy. When asked about his apology to spectators after swearing loudly enough to be heard on the BBC, he said: “Do you swear? No, do you swear? Yes or no? Yes or no? Do you swear? Do you swear?” It will come as a shock only to some vicars and sheep minders in the Orkneys that journalists do actually swear. As for his tennis, Kyrgios’s serve is regularly red-lining around 140mph – even on second serve, occasionally – and he brought his tally of aces to 73 over a total of six hours and 42 minutes across six days, pinning Edmund behind the baseline for two hours and 11 minutes of that journey. When he brought Andy Murray’s comeback match to a conclusion over three sets in two hours and 39 minutes on Tuesday, a hip pain he has been carrying flared, and he conceded on Thursday: “I’m just managing my hip at the moment.” He added that his chronic elbow problem was “fine – that’s the most important thing”. Kyrgios’s British double followed an even more impressive performance in defeat in Stuttgart last Saturday when the world No 1, Roger Federer, needed every ounce of his resilience in a third-set tie-break in the semi-final. Kyrgios next plays the defending champion, Feliciano López. He put 23 aces on Federer, 18 on Murray and a spirit-draining 32 on Edmund. He did not give Edmund a moment’s peace, taking the point on 88% of first serves, 53% at the second attempt. That is enough to break the will of a saint and Edmund did well to stand up to the unceasing pressure. There were no break points in the first 12 games but a couple of poor choices by Edmund and big serving by Kyrgios imperilled the world No 17 in the tie-break. When Kyrgios – four places below him in the rankings – belted a winner from mid-court for set point, Edmund gambled with a net-charge – only to see a perfectly struck backhand fly past him. Edmund had to save his first break point at the start of the second. After a between-the-legs volley (that Edmund punished), Kyrgios held with a 137mph second serve. This was taking on the appearance of his match against Murray – but the Scot had kept the Australia’s ace count down to reasonable proportions (with 11 double faults, as he strove for the quick kill), demonstrating that his defensive game is still in excellent shape after an 11-month break from the Tour. After an hour on court on Thursday, Kyrgios had won the point from 30 of 31 first serves, thanks largely to 17 aces, a phenomenal strike rate. Edmund, ahead in the serving cycle, had to soak up the punches and wait for the counter off the ropes. He did a decent job of holding the shape of his own game until a lazy backhand handed Kyrgios another look in the ninth game. He hung on. Just. Edmund needed an eighth ace to save one of two break points, Kyrgios clocked up a couple of more aces and they went to a second tie-break where, this time, Edmund rediscovered his firepower and precision to level at a set apiece. An over-heated forehand cost the British No 1 his serve in the fourth game of the decider and Kyrgios was back in control. Two more aces and he was 4-1 up. The match was his to lose. He grabbed match point with his final ace – and spluttered into familiar expletives when he pushed a forehand wide for deuce, then dumped a backhand. Edmund crashed to the turf trying to retrieve a drop shot on break point – but there was nothing he could do with Kyrgios’s concluding backhand passing shot down the line. Novak Djokovic remains in awesome form. He took just 65 minutes to beat the former champion and reigning ATP World Tour Finals title-holder Grigor Dimitrov 6-4, 6-1."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/jun/22/australias-craig-foster-under-fire-for-using-wwi-to-urge-france-to-world-cup-victory","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-22T04:08:23Z","webTitle":"Australia's Craig Foster under fire for using WWI to urge France to World Cup victory","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jun/22/australias-craig-foster-under-fire-for-using-wwi-to-urge-france-to-world-cup-victory","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jun/22/australias-craig-foster-under-fire-for-using-wwi-to-urge-france-to-world-cup-victory","fields":{"headline":"Australia's Craig Foster under fire for using WWI to urge France to World Cup victory","bodyText":"The SBS football analyst Craig Foster has come under fire for a series of social media posts invoking a bloody battle of the first world war to urge France to victory in a World Cup match. After Australia were held to a draw by Denmark on Thursday, their World Cup fate does not lie entirely in their hands. To progress to the knockout stage, Bert van Marwijk’s side must beat Peru in the final round of group matches next week and hope the French defeat Denmark. Foster, who heads the coverage on SBS and is well-known for his passionate and outspoken views, posted reminders of Australia’s historical military ties with France in several tweets hours after the Denmark game. “Hello France. Greetings from your Australian friends,” Foster began. “It’s been a while. Sorry we haven’t been in touch more regularly. Friends are like that, but you have always been in our thoughts. There is something we must discuss. “And it concerns our shared history, specifically 1916. You know of what I speak, the time when French/Australian relations were cemented, forever to come to each other’s aid when we are in need. “When Australian diggers fought in great numbers in your country in the Great War, sacrificing so many of our young for your freedom. Villers-Bretonneux stands as a monument to our eternal embrace. Now, we need your best on the 26th.” About 11,000 Australian soldiers died fighting in France and Belgium during the first world war, with 1,200 losing their lives saving the village of Villers-Bretonneux, in what one British general called “perhaps the greatest individual feat of the war”. Foster was accused by other Twitter users of lacking perspective and branded “disrespectful and tasteless” and “moronic and embarrassing”. Another Twitter user wrote “It does a disservice to those brave men to equate their sacrifice to a football match.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/23/the-new-childcare-package-is-the-final-nail-in-the-community-service-coffin","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-22T22:00:39Z","webTitle":"The new childcare package is the final nail in the community service coffin | Eva Cox","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/23/the-new-childcare-package-is-the-final-nail-in-the-community-service-coffin","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/23/the-new-childcare-package-is-the-final-nail-in-the-community-service-coffin","fields":{"headline":"The new childcare package is the final nail in the community service coffin","bodyText":"The government’s new package of fee relief for children’s services has clearly abandoned the basic principle of funding children’s services to meet the needs of children and parents per se. The new funding criteria, starting on 2 July, clearly establish that the government’s interests are limited to the economic benefits of increasing paid work participation by mostly mothers. Their eligibility for hourly based fee relief will be based on activities related to employment or potential employment. This ignores needs of children for time away and their experiences of educational activities, except for 15 hours per week in the year before school enrolment. Where the current funding package offers all children and their parents the benefit of 24 hours (two days) care per week, regardless of the activities of the parent, now this will be terminated. Only if the parent can be officially categorised as “disadvantaged”, or the child as having extra needs, may 12 hours a week be funded. This means parents or children must be labelled, stigmatised or otherwise identified as problematic to gain any access. I was one of the feminists who fought very hard from the 1970s on for funded childcare services for the increasing numbers of women who had paid jobs, or wanted them. It was tough then because women were expected to put mothering first, and there was opposition because of the possible harm of collective care rather than home based mothering. We argued children benefit from access to professional care and social experiences. We won as quality care was clearly beneficial to all concerned. William McMahon had funded professional childcare workers salaries, Gough Whitlam extended the program, Malcolm Fraser separated childcare from preschools, and Bob Hawke accepted the need for core funding a planned model that allocated services to areas of need, with added fee subsidies for the mainly non-profit services. Communities gained services. However, by then market models became fashionable so Paul Keating opened funding fee relief for users of commercial services, which expanded massively. So John Howard removed the remaining direct funding to centres, leaving supply, fees and locations to the economic drivers of profits, not community needs. It was an attractive investment, so most centres are now commercial. Now the final nail in the community service coffin is about to be applied. The socially valuable access to childcare by all will no longer be available and children now in, or needing, two days care will no longer be eligible for subsidies unless they are labelled. Childcare will be no longer contribute to community wellbeing but be funded only as a contributor to GDP, now the only criterion of valuing government spending. Where Howard clearly supported women’s right to not work, he did not exclude children from care. His successors have removed the validity of that option. Yes, we fought for the right of women to paid work, we did not want this to become almost mandatory. Most primary carers (the majority of which are mothers) now contribute their time to paid work, but also are still mainly expected to be responsible for providing for children’s needs for unpaid care. Men who share these roles might still experience some prejudice at their workplace if they want that time out. Depending on personal circumstances, diverse access to care is needed – as a right, not by a limited bureaucratised safety net. Many parents also use casual and short term contracts to allow for unpredictable needs. The proposed reporting of activities and hours worked will make their access, even if employed, harder. Reporting to determine eligibility are not easy as uncertain casual hours and gig jobs increase. There are also questions about the increasing market share of big commercial chains that are not addressed in the proposed changes. The distribution of services in the market model is based on profits, not local needs. There are shortages in some areas and oversupply in others. The model also shows the bleeding of substantial profits to big chains. Long-leased childcare centres provide about 5 to 6% return on capital/costs. Add to that the profits made by the lessee, we can presume that more than 15% profits, plus capital gains on the property, are made from subsidies offered by government plus parental contributions. Location and fees are assumed to be better determined by the glories of competition, as parents were assumed to be ready to move children between services on the basis of costs and location. And parents have no input or say, so the communities of users no longer exist. Quality controls are inadequately funded and many local needs not met, so is the proposed system now worth our $8bn plus spending? The signs are we need a real redesign of the children’s services program. When local services were communal and non-profits, they served communities with informal contacts and inputs. Yes, they drew on local busy people for management committees but these built communities and connected the often isolated. Direct contracts with government meant fair distributions of services and control over fees and mixes of age groups. Current services are not meeting needs. We have record numbers of children in contact with child protection or out of home care and maybe these needs forms of community care to be re-established as part of what we all own? Given our increased levels of distrust of those in power, could this be fuelled in part by the loss of the sense of partnership between parents and publicly provided services for the benefit of children? Does the absence of engagement with children’s services in any way reduce both the connected community of families and the perception that governments do care about children and their needs? Does the government assumptions that the primary parent should do paid work post parental leave further devalue voter level of trust? The loss of community based care is just one example of the changes that have redefined us from citizens to customers of governments. So many changes to social security and community services have reduced us to using contracted out and commercialised services, one government controlled or delivered. Customer-consumer roles are explicitly distrust based, as we are told we are responsible for getting “the best deal”. Could these changes be part drivers of the increasing devaluing of current political models of democracy as it seems to have lost its social equity function? These are urgent questions we need to address, as well as fix children’s services. • Eva Cox is a sociologist and social commentator"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"film/2018/jun/22/john-cameron-mitchell-on-hedwig-caitlyn-jenner-and-how-queer-has-changed","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-22T02:34:39Z","webTitle":"John Cameron Mitchell on Hedwig, Caitlyn Jenner and how 'queer' has changed","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jun/22/john-cameron-mitchell-on-hedwig-caitlyn-jenner-and-how-queer-has-changed","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/jun/22/john-cameron-mitchell-on-hedwig-caitlyn-jenner-and-how-queer-has-changed","fields":{"headline":"John Cameron Mitchell on Hedwig, Caitlyn Jenner and how 'queer' has changed","bodyText":"“I’m off to catch chlamydia from a koala and Patti Lupone!” As creator of the iconic Hedwig and the Angry Inch, and the real-sex-on-screen indie classic Shortbus, this opener from John Cameron Mitchell ranks somewhere in the middle in terms of shock value. Hedwig and the Angry Inch came to life as a queer nightclub act in late-90s New York, and has since become the film and Broadway hit that defines Mitchell’s career – so it’s not surprising that he’ll return to it for his first Australian tour, opening this week at Adelaide Cabaret festival (at which Lupone will also headline). Rather than reprising the role, Mitchell will be performing a cabaret – part-confessional, part-greatest hits. And Hedwig is his greatest hit. In the cult classic show, the character of Hedwig tells the story of his life. Born a boy in East Berlin, he meets a US soldier who convinces him to dress in drag and then change sex, in order to be married. Hedwig’s botched gender reassignment surgery results in an eponymous “angry inch” which acts as a metaphoric rudder, guiding her journey through an America that wasn’t quite ready for her. To Mitchell, the longevity of Hedwig speaks to what the character has come to represent. “Perhaps we’re all forced into certain places we don’t want – everyone can relate to that,” Cameron says. “... A boy is forced into an uncomfortable gender reassignment that he never wanted, and then at a certain point, as we all do, says, ‘What do we do with what we’re given?’ And then the woman becomes Hedwig.” Drag can function in different ways, he says: “To some, it’s armour, to some it’s accessory, and to some it’s a tool ... In telling the story of heartbreak, Hedwig kind of smashes the drag, rips it off and then walks into the world naked, as if to say, ‘This is me.’ “The real test comes when we drop that and we see what’s underneath, including the scars, including the complexity of what [we’ve] been through ... There’s an understanding that perhaps she can let go of the bitterness, let go of the victimhood, maybe even let go of the drag. Let go of the pronouns, let go of whatever.” Much has changed since Mitchell debuted Hedwig and the Angry Inch in 1998. Back then, the Meatpacking District in which the show premiered still packed meat, and its old cobblestone streets were walked by transgender sex workers. Today, it’s yet another New York neighbourhood with a storied past that’s been sacrificed to gentrification. Queer culture, meanwhile, has shifted dramatically – it’s more visible, more celebrated, and in many ways more complicated. The internet groans daily, sometimes literally, beneath the sheer volume of discourse on LGBTIQA identity politics, leading to a call-out culture that often expresses itself along generational lines, in which queer people even target each other for expressing views now deemed outdated, ignorant, or lacking in intersectionality. In this context, Hedwig could be read by younger millennial queers as positively scandalous: a cisgender gay man telling the story of a trans woman who is not trans by choice, but through coercion. If Mitchell were to make Hedwig today, would he be able to get away with it? “I don’t know …” Mitchell ponders the question, but doesn’t answer it; instead, he speaks to a shift in the way queer people relate to each other. “In the US, people have turned their energies to each other because they can’t do much about who is on top of the power structure.” That inward response to powerlessness sits in stark contrast with the earlier punk aspects of queer culture, which Mitchell came up through. “I accuse, therefore I am. That’s the internet,” Mitchell says; he describes the way queer people sometimes interact with each other as a sort of “oppression olympics” in which “outrage becomes proof of existence”. Our “grievances are real and our intentions are good,” but we are “looking for flaws, instead of looking for things in common”. Traditionally, the concept of “queerness” explored an understanding of gender and power through the prism of the outsider. That’s precisely where Hedwig sits and, for the most part, refuses to budge from: her victimhood becomes a huge part of her identity. Queerness rose to wider usage in the 1980s, at the same time that punk was born – and has always been, Cameron says, “a good umbrella term for people who look at the world through a prism of the flexibility of gender, and the understanding that gender and power are connected”. But, he says, it is “changing quickly”. Take Caitlyn Jenner, for example. In the time when Hedwig was originally performed, the public transition of a Republican millionaire and former Olympian, broadcast on reality TV, would have been harder to believe than, well, the story of a coerced-trans punk rocker from East Berlin on a revenge tour through middle America. “Certainly, Caitlyn Jenner has little in common with me, in terms of being queer,” Mitchell notes dryly. “But she is still in that umbrella. There’s room for variety, but acceptance also makes way for mediocrity and extremism, to be honest.” In an era in which marriage equality has brought greater acceptance for many, while a culture war rages against safe schools and bathroom access, does the LGBTIQA experience have space for both the more outwardly respectable and the radical? “That’s weirdly one of our goals: there’s an acceptance of it all – age-wise, sexuality-wise, gender-wise, what you do with your body, whether you leave your body alone, whether you manipulate it to make it feel closer to what you feel like. It’s all about intention and self-discovery and self-realisation.” There are other lessons to be learned from Hedwig’s journey, and not just for a contemporary queer community. “There are energies that we might call male and female within all of us. When you don’t exercise them they tend to die, like a mouse in a wall, and they smell up the place. “You have to use all of these energies, or we all know the costs.” • John Cameron Mitchell appears at Adelaide Cabaret festival on Friday 22 June, before shows in Canberra, Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/commentisfree/2018/jun/22/the-us-withdrawal-from-the-unhrc-is-perfect-for-xi-jinping-and-china","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-22T01:10:26Z","webTitle":"The US withdrawal from the UNHRC is a gift to Xi Jinping and China | Frances Eve","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2018/jun/22/the-us-withdrawal-from-the-unhrc-is-perfect-for-xi-jinping-and-china","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/commentisfree/2018/jun/22/the-us-withdrawal-from-the-unhrc-is-perfect-for-xi-jinping-and-china","fields":{"headline":"The US withdrawal from the UNHRC is perfect for Xi Jinping and China","bodyText":"The US withdrawal from the UN Human Rights Council is a gift to China’s leader Xi Jinping. Quitting the UNHRC won’t make it disappear. It opens a leadership vacancy that China is happy to fill. The Trump administration has stepped back to allow China the space to dominate the council unchallenged and advance its agenda to redefine human rights after the “China model.” As Xi pushes his authoritarian agenda on the international stage while undertaking the worst crackdown on human rights since the Tiananmen Massacre of 1989 back home, now is the time to stand up, not stand down. For the first time, China successfully sponsored a resolution in the UNHRC in June 2017, on prioritising development over other human rights. Human rights are universal, inalienable, indivisible, independent, equal and non-discriminatory. Your right to economic development is equal to your right to freedom of speech; China’s resolution deliberately undermined that principle. China followed that up with another resolution in March of this year, which focused on state sovereignty. It was widely criticised, with a UN expert calling it a “trojan horse” and the Swiss ambassador to the UN saying it “weakens fundamental human rights principles.” The US joined 12 other countries to vote no on the 2017 resolution but was the only country to vote against the March resolution. With the US quitting the UNHRC, it appears the last holdout in the resistance to “human rights with Chinese characteristics” has collapsed. Outside the council chamber, China has deployed procedural and budget rules to “wage war” on UN human rights bodies, with tactics ranging from cutting funding for UN offices, blocking NGOs from receiving accreditation, all the way down to attempts to block individual activists from UN buildings in New York. It is willing to take extreme measures. Chinese activist Cao Shunli died in detention in 2014 after being denied medical care because she tried to attend a council session and speak out about human rights abuses. China reacted angrily when NGOs tried to hold a moment of silence for Cao at the council. China’s behaviour at the UN is anything but rules-based, and this is just a taste of what’s to come. Xi Jinping may say that China will be a “keeper of the international order,” but what he means is that it will keep the exterior of the institutions but get rid of the protection for human rights inside. When China ran for re-election to the UNHRC in 2016, Chinese state media said its objective was to “actively declare China’s own human rights policy”. China’s senior diplomat in Geneva said earlier this year that China’s efforts at the council were intended to “smash the West’s monopoly on human rights”. The UN Human Rights Council is flawed. Despite the downfall of its predecessor, the Commission on Human Rights, for the same reason, current members include some of the worst human rights abusers like China, Saudi Arabia, and Venezuela. UNHRC Members are meant to “uphold the highest standards in the promotion and protection of human rights” but countries are elected by the UN General Assembly based on geographical distribution and mostly run unopposed. Demonstrable commitment to human rights is clearly not essential. Despite its deeply politicised membership, the council is the only international platform for countries to address human rights violations. It appoints independent human rights experts who pull no punches in criticising states (such experts have raised concerns of rights violations in China 104 times in the past eight years). The council has also appointed enquiries into North Korea, Syria, South Sudan, and Myanmar, credible independent investigations that can form the basis for prosecution for crimes against humanity. All 193 UN Member States equally go through a universal periodic review of their human rights record at the UNHRC. Even Israeli diplomats have expressed concern about the US’s departure. The Human Rights Council has undoubtedly failed to live up to its founding principles. But a US working from within would do better to push for positive change and prevent further backsliding on human rights than sitting on the side-lines. The remaining UNHRC members must now work harder than ever to prevent China and other authoritarian regimes from undermining human rights standards and push for the desperately needed reform of the council.

The company said it could ditch plans to build aircraft wings in British factories over concerns that EU regulations will no longer apply from March 2019 and uncertainty over customs procedures, instead opting to transfer production to North America, China or elsewhere in the EU. Airbus, which directly employs 14,000 people at 25 sites in Britain and supports more than 100,000 jobs in the wider supply chain, also said a no-deal scenario would lead to “catastrophic” consequences , which could cost the company billions of pounds in delays. The firm also said it was considering stockpiling billions of pounds of parts to prepare for Brexit disruption. On BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Tom Williams, the chief operating officer of Airbus Commercial Aircraft, was asked if the company was planning to abandon its plans to build new wings in the UK. He replied: “We are seriously considering whether we should continue that development or we should find alternate solutions.” Asked how many jobs were at risk, Williams pointed out that Airbus generates 100,000 jobs in the UK, including 14,000 directly employed by the company. Williams repeatedly called on the government to provide more detail about trading arrangements under Brexit and said the lack clarity was forcing its hand. He said: “Over the next weeks we need to get clarify. We are already beginning to press the button on our crisis actions ... We have got to be able to protect our employees, our customers and our shareholders and we can’t do that in the current situation.” Asked if he was under political pressure from European governments that part-fund Airbus to sound the alarm, Williams said: “I’m an engineer not a politician I have to deal in certainty. And we need to have clarity. We can’t continue with the current vacuum in terms of clarity.” Earlier, Williams said: “While Airbus understands that the political process must go on, as a responsible business we require immediate details on the pragmatic steps that should be taken to operate competitively. “Without these, Airbus believes that the impacts on our UK operations could be significant. We have sought to highlight our concerns over the past 12 months, without success. Far from ”project fear”, this is a dawning reality for Airbus. Put simply, a no-deal scenario directly threatens Airbus’s future in the UK.” In a risk assessment of the Brexit process published on Thursday, Airbus, which generates £1.7bn in UK tax revenues [pdf], gave a damning analysis of Britain leaving the EU without a deal. It said leaving the single market, and the customs union and the European court of justice would heavily disrupt its supply chain. The risk assessment said operating under WTO rules could cost the company billions of pounds every week in loss of turnover and delay penalties. In the event of a no deal, the aerospace firm said it would be forced to reconsider its footprint in the UK, putting thousands of high-skilled jobs at risk. In what the company called an “orderly” Brexit scenario with an agreement and transition period, the aerospace giant warned the current transition endpoint of December 2020 did not give the business enough time to reconfigure its supply chain and was likely to cause production disruption. Darren Jones, the Labour MP whose Bristol North West constituency contains the Airbus Filton wing factory, attacked the government after Airbus’s statement. Jones said: “Time and time again the government has been shown to listen only to hardline pro-Brexit MPs and not to the businesses that employ thousands of British workers, including Airbus. “Thousands of skilled, well-paid jobs are now on the line because of the shambolic mess the government have created over the Brexit negotiations.” Thursday’s statement is not the first time Airbus has demanded further clarity on the Brexit process. In March, Katherine Bennett, the senior vice-president for Airbus in the UK, told the Today programme that a three-hour wait on a lorry at Dover “would be a critically bad issue for Airbus”, as would be delaying cargo flights carrying completed wings to Europe. Bennett said: “It’s critical for our business to ensure that the wings that we build in Broughton and in Filton can get to France and Germany for the final assembly line.” Bennett said Airbus spent about £5bn each year on the UK supply chain. “It’s really important that the parts don’t get held up in warehouses. We have a very just-in-time delivery system.” She welcomed Theresa May’s intention for Britain to remain a member of EASA, the European air safety certification agency, warning that customs remained “pretty critical for us” and said that Airbus very soon would “have to press a button on a decision on stockpiling parts”. She added: “It would be very expensive for us and a burden we don’t want to be suffering. Our key preference is for the UK to remain a home nation for Airbus. But we really need the conditions for us to be effective. We don’t want extra costs on our UK business which may make Airbus think differently about us.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jun/21/we-won-attorneys-see-glimmer-of-hope-for-reuniting-families","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-22T06:00:21Z","webTitle":"'We won': attorneys see glimmer of hope for reuniting families","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/21/we-won-attorneys-see-glimmer-of-hope-for-reuniting-families","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jun/21/we-won-attorneys-see-glimmer-of-hope-for-reuniting-families","fields":{"headline":"'We won': attorneys see glimmer of hope for reuniting families","bodyText":"Attorneys representing parents who have been arrested at the southern US border and separated from their children are cautiously celebrating after receiving word that families will no longer be torn apart and the adults prosecuted. Maureen Franco, chief public defender of the western district of Texas, who earlier this week called the practice of forced family separations “kidnapping”, put a makeshift sign on her office door in El Paso, Texas, on Thursday saying: “Yay. We won.” Families in her district will still end up in immigration detention centers, and it was unclear on Thursday when parents and children who have been split up will be reunited, after Donald Trump’s executive order on Wednesday ending the policy of family separations. Under Trump’s “zero tolerance” immigration policy, announced in April, parents and children crossing the nearby border with Mexico unlawfully have all found themselves separated and then detained separately. The parents are routinely jailed, the children put in foster care or taken to detention camps, some with cage-like confinement, others with rows of tents. In the past year, Franco’s office has represented hundreds of clients, as the idea of arresting adults took hold, even though crossing the border unlawfully for the first time is only a petty offense – the equivalent of a traffic ticket. The government gradually ramped up family separations, and the issue boiled over into political uproar in recent weeks. On Wednesday, after repeatedly claiming only Congress could fix it, and blaming the Democrats, the president changed the policy under immense pressure. “I thought I was dreaming,” Franco told the Guardian. She was informed on Thursday morning by the United States attorney’s office in Austin, Texas, by telephone, that all pending criminal cases against migrants in her district would now be dismissed. “Even before court sessions began this morning we had received notice of 28 dismissals. By now there should be hundreds more,” Franco told the Guardian on Thursday afternoon. Sandra Strelzin Lewis, a federal public defender, said there were chaotic scenes in court that morning. “Literally three minutes before the judge walked into court, a supervising prosecutor walked into court and handed a note to the other prosecutor. He then informed me all charges had been dismissed against my client, Mr Cisary Reynaud Villeda,” Strelzin said. He had crossed the border with his eight-year-old daughter. “My client told me he was extremely relieved and grateful to hear of his dismissal. He expressed the hope he would soon be reunited with his young daughter, whom he hasn’t known anything about since his arrest on June 13,” Strelzin Lewis said. Meanwhile, Franco added that: “Anybody who has not yet pleaded guilty or been sentenced will now be sent to immigration camp for deportation proceedings. But we are telling our clients they can now pursue their asylum claims from immigration camp.” The attorney general, Jeff Sessions, however, ruled earlier this month that victims of domestic or gang violence claiming asylum will no longer be eligible for sanctuary – only forms of state-sponsored oppression, such as religious persecution by the authorities, will be considered, not common crime. And the fate of the migrants in detention in the El Paso area, and elsewhere, is likely to be caught up in further chaos. “Obviously the problem has now shifted a little further down the line. The government does not have enough immigration detention facilities suitable for families in immigration proceedings,” Franco said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jun/22/morning-mail-new-gayed-questions-melania-doesnt-care-socceroos-fight-on","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-21T20:57:16Z","webTitle":"Morning mail: New Gayed questions, Melania 'doesn't care', Socceroos fight on","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jun/22/morning-mail-new-gayed-questions-melania-doesnt-care-socceroos-fight-on","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jun/22/morning-mail-new-gayed-questions-melania-doesnt-care-socceroos-fight-on","fields":{"headline":"Morning mail: New Gayed questions, Melania 'doesn't care', Socceroos fight on","bodyText":"Good morning, this is Richard Parkin bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Friday 22 June.

Additional patient complaints have prompted the Health Care Complaints Commission to broaden the investigation and examine management at the Manning Rural Referral hospital in Taree, where Gayed worked, including whether staff working with him failed to report errors or concerns that led to the death of one patient and left many others suffering the effects of unnecessary surgeries. A US immigration attorney has admitted he is “not confident at all” that family separations will halt immediately, expressing concerns about “wriggle room” within Donald Trump’s executive order. Jeremy McKinney also raised doubt about the official mechanism to start repatriation of children with their families, given limited phone or internet access within ad hoc centres. Hours earlier, Melania Trump made a surprise visit to the US-Mexico border, taking part in briefings and attending a tour of centres where children were being held. But she has come under fire for wearing a jacket on the visit with the words “I really don’t care. Do u?” scrawled in huge letters on the back. At the World Cup, the Socceroos have fought out a valiant but frustrating 1-1 draw against Denmark, with captain Mile Jedinak again the hero from the penalty spot after Christian Eriksen’s early opener. The result leaves Australia’s chances of progressing to the knockout stage hanging in the balance, taking the edge off what was an otherwise impressive performance. They will need to beat Peru in their final game and hope Denmark lose to France. Meanwhile, Lionel Messi’s Argentina are teetering on the brink of elimination after a shock 3-0 loss to Croatia. The Victorian parliament passed legislation late on Thursday that will create a framework for negotiating a treaty with Aboriginal people, in what is being heralded as a significant national first. “Treaty will have benefits for all Victorians – promoting reconciliation, fostering shared pride in Aboriginal culture and helping to heal the wounds of the past,” the Aboriginal affairs minister, Natalie Hutchins, said in a statement. “Aboriginal Victorians will continue to be at the centre of this process, as we work towards establishing the Aboriginal Representative Body.” A report commissioned following the Grenfell Tower fire has found the ABC’s building at Ultimo in Sydney no longer complies with fire codes, with staff told to tidy loose papers and unplug some personal electronic devices as a safety precaution. Employees of the public broadcaster have been assured it is safe to work while the issue is being resolved, but received additional instructions via email. On Thursday the Australian newspaper had to apologise after readers commenting on an article on its website said they hoped the building would burn down. Sport England have continued their dominance of Australia in one-day cricket, running down a total of 310 to take a 4-0 lead in the five-match series. Aaron Finch and Sean Marsh both notched centuries but big-hitting Jason Roy once again led the way for the hosts, striking 101 off just 83 balls. Also in the UK, Nick Kyrgios has created a stir at Queen’s, apologising for swearing during his win over England’s Kyle Edwards. Staunch rivals go head-to-head at North Sydney Oval tonight in the women’s State of Origin, but for Maroons vice-captain Brittany Breayley the match will be just another on a long pathway to the top. Breayley tells Guardian Australia about the importance of having visible role models in women’s sport and what it means for women’s rugby league to be included in the famous Origin culture. “We’ll have our critics out there,” says Breayley, “and there’s going to be positives as well as negatives, but we just have to go out there, train hard, play hard, showcase a great product and show people that women can play.” Thinking time Tasmania’s annual winter festival, Dark Mofo, has infused Hobart with music, eclectic artworks, performances, food, and plenty of bonfires. From Mike Parr’s self-entombment underneath Macquarie Street, a controversial depiction of an upside-down cross, to the entire city being bathed in red light – here are some of the best images so far. Privatisation has been the last fiscal resort of desperate governments for decades, but voters mostly know that the supposed windfall achieved by selling income-generating assets is deceptive, writes John Quiggin. “The politicians’ reluctance to abandon privatisation is understandable if discreditable: when electors throw them out, they are virtually guaranteed a lucrative post-political career in the financial sector. The failure of political journalists to understand what they write and talk about for a living is more surprising. Yet the coverage of the Queensland and NSW elections suggests that there has been no improvement in understanding of the basic issues.” “There’s nothing toxic about masculinity, Ange. But there is only toxicity in being an asshole.” When an AFLW senior coach entered into an online discussion around toxic masculinity following the killing of Eurydice Dixon in Melbourne’s Princes Park it only acted to reinforce the shortcomings within football clubs in addressing these issues, writes Kirby Fenwick. “Far from being two separate ideas lumped together, toxic masculinity describes the restrictive norms of masculine behaviour that are harmful to men and to the community. These encompass traditionally masculine ideals or behaviours like male dominance, emotional repression and self-reliance which in turn promote aggression and superiority in men at the expense of community and emotional expression.” Media roundup “Return of the Jedi”, proclaims the Courier Mail, among the metropolitan mastheads prominently featuring the Socceroos, after captain Mile Jedinak’s nerves of steel helped keep Australia’s thin hopes of reaching the World Cup knockout phase alive. The Sydney Morning Herald reports that the prime minister has lauded “the most comprehensive reform of personal income tax in a generation” following the successful passage of the government’s $144bn package. And the NT News has called on the chief minister to take on the portfolio of child protection as the Territory prepares for a cabinet reshuffle. Coming up Actor Craig McLachlan’s defamation suit against Fairfax and the ABC, launched after they reported allegations of sexual harassment, returns to the supreme court on Friday. The bitter chill of a Tasmanian morning won’t deter hundreds of participants of the annual winter solstice nude swim. Bathers will take the plunge just after 7.30am at Long Beach in Sandy Bay.

The news is the culmination of a two-year effort by Ascot in combination with Longines, one of its long-standing business partners, aimed at making the venue a showcase which other major tracks around the world will seek to emulate. Racegoers and punters in other countries have long taken for granted a detailed breakdown of the times run by individual racehorses in each race but British racing has lagged behind and the subject has become a bone of contention. Advocates of sectional times, which record how long a horse took to run each furlong in a race, say they help to deepen understanding of why a race developed as it did and thereby stimulate interest, potentially leading to bigger TV audiences and improved betting turnover. “I think it’s really exciting,” said Juliet Slot, Ascot’s commercial director, whose aim is to have furlong-by-furlong times being shown on screen during TV coverage of Ascot’s most prestigious race of the year, the King George VI &amp; Queen Elizabeth Stakes, to be run at the end of next month. “It’ll provide us with a whole raft of data which hopefully we can share with our customers and other stakeholders in due course. “Initially, it’s just showing the order and the sectional times for each furlong but we will have further data. What we want to do is start and then improve it. “Longines want Ascot to be a showcase venue for the technology which then in due course will hopefully bring other racecourses from around the world to see how it works. We own the data and what we do with the data will depend on working with different partners as to how useful it will be. The obvious thing to look at is our betting partners and how they could use sectional timing. We want to get it live, get it working, see what the information is and then see what they think.” Eventually, the data could be used to create a real-time visual representation of a race while it is in progress. The technology apparently exists but Ascot wants to consider how such a thing might best be presented and delivered. The available data will eventually include the precise route taken by each horse in a race and the amount of ground it covered. The traditional heated debates about whether or not a particular horse was unlucky will at last have some solid evidence as an aid to discussion. “Ascot’s initiative is welcome, if long overdue, though the care taken to get the technology right is to be commended,” said the form and time analyst Simon Rowlands, who has represented the interests of punters through the Horseracing Bettors Forum. “Sectional times have long been seen as crucial for analysis and understanding in other racing jurisdictions, and interest in them in Britain has increased greatly as a result of their existence at a small number of courses and through the efforts of racing enthusiasts. “The ideal future would see free and readily available sectionals provided at all courses, live as well as after the event, and put properly into context. It is to be hoped that British racing more widely finally embraces this concept for the good of the sport.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/jun/21/royal-ascot-billesdon-brook-land-coronation","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-21T23:03:12Z","webTitle":"Royal Ascot 2018 day four tips: Billesdon Brook can land the Coronation","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jun/21/royal-ascot-billesdon-brook-land-coronation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jun/21/royal-ascot-billesdon-brook-land-coronation","fields":{"headline":"Royal Ascot 2018 day four tips: Billesdon Brook can land the Coronation","bodyText":"To underestimate a filly once is unfortunate but to do it twice would be reprehensible, particularly in the case of Billesdon Brook (4.20), whose Guineas success looks a very solid piece of form indeed. Those that finished in the next six places have advertised the quality of that race again and again and she can show up her doubters by landing the Coronation Stakes on day four at Royal Ascot. The Oaks runner-up and the French Oaks winner were among those she beat fair and square that day. Nor was it the first time she had shown impressive speed on a fast surface. She gets her ground again and looks the right bet at 11-2, despite a nagging doubt about the form of her stable. 2.30 Albany Stakes Mark Johnston seems to have a smart juvenile in Main Edition, unbeaten in her two runs and an impressive winner at Goodwood three weeks ago after travelling kindly round that tricky course. She is a half-sister to one Royal Ascot winner, Beachfire, and also to the classy Major Cadeaux, beaten less than a length in the Coventry. 3.05 King Edward VII Stakes Aidan O’Brien is having a good week with three-year-old colts that weren’t quite up to Classic level, following the wins of Hunting Horn and Kew Gardens, so it could be worth giving another chance to his Delano Roosevelt. He stayed on to be sixth in the Derby and may do better around this more conventional track. 3.40 Commonwealth Cup O’Brien could be in for a big finish to the week, as his Sioux Nation gives him a big chance here, in a race he won last year. A son of Scat Daddy, who has proved such a strong influence for top-class speed, he won the Norfolk at Royal Ascot last year, followed up in a Group One in Ireland and promised better to come with the way he won his warm-up race for this at Naas last month. 5.00 Sandringham Handicap At 14-1, Poet’s Charm looks over-priced. She won two of her three starts last year and is bred to be better this year.

Haley, the former Republican governor of South Carolina, said she was “deeply disappointed” that the UN special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, Philip Alston, had “categorically misstated the progress the United States has made in addressing poverty … in [his] biased reporting”. She added that in her view that “it is patently ridiculous for the United Nations to examine poverty in America” – which prompted puzzlement as Alston carried out his investigation at the formal invitation of the Trump administration. Instead, Haley suggested, the UN monitor should have used his voice “to shine a light” on countries where governments were causing pain and suffering on their own people, such as Burundi and the Democratic Republic of Congo. “The special rapporteur wasted the UN’s time and resources, deflecting attention from the world’s worst human rights abusers and focusing instead on the wealthiest and freest country in the world.” Haley’s remarks deepen the dispute between the Trump administration and the UN human rights council in Geneva that has been blazing all week. Alston will be presenting his report on US poverty to the council on Friday, laying out his key findings to its 46 members and to an empty chair where the US has traditionally sat. On Tuesday, Haley announced that the US was pulling out of membership of the human rights council, describing it as a “cesspool of political bias”. It marked the first time that any state has withdrawn from the council since its inception in 2006. Haley made her counterpunch to the UN monitor – the first substantive comments to emerge from the Trump administration over Alston’s devastating critique of its pro-rich and anti-poor policies – in a response to Bernie Sanders. The Vermont senator had led a joint plea on the back of the UN report from 20 prominent members of Congress, including the senators Elizabeth Warren and Cory Booker and Georgia representative John Lewis, calling on Trump to work with them to tackle “massive levels of deprivation and the immense suffering this deprivation causes”. Sanders on Thursday issued a further response to Haley’s attack on the UN rapporteur. The 2016 runner-up for the Democratic presidential nomination agreed with Haley that Burundi and the Democratic Republic Congo faced far worse problems, but pointedly remarked that America’s poverty was taking place “in the richest country in the history of the world and a time when wealth and income inequality is worse than at any time since the 1920s”. Sanders said it was appropriate for the UN to focus on America, given that 40 million people in the US still live in poverty, more than 30 million have no health insurance, and 40% of Americans cannot afford $400 in an emergency. “I hope you will agree that in a nation in which the top three people own more wealth than the bottom half, we can and must do much better than that,” Sanders said. The sharpness of tone in Haley’s criticisms of the UN rapporteur raises questions about whether the timing of the Trump administration’s decision to quit the UN human rights council was motivated in part by irritation over Alston’s decision to put his spotlight on American inequality. Perceived anti-Israel bias within the council, and the ongoing inclusion among its members of states with poor human rights records such as the Democratic Republic of Congo and Venezuela, were clearly the main driving factors behind the pullout, but it is also clear that Haley was also peeved by the directness of Alston’s conclusions. The rapporteur carried out a 10-day tour in December of poverty hotspots in the US, from California, though Alabama and West Virginia, to Puerto Rico. He concluded that though levels of hardship had been high for decades within America, Trump was taking it to another level by steering the country towards a “dramatic change of direction” that was rewarding wealthy Americans while stripping vulnerable Americans of welfare protections. In a press conference on Thursday, on the eve of presenting his report on the US to the council, Alston said he had “no idea” whether his investigation had reinforced or influenced the timing of the US government’s withdrawal. But he added that the move was “highly regrettable. I think it’s significant that of the 47 members of the council, only one has chosen to leave.” He added: “There is a fear that this is part of a broader attack on human rights and multilateralism.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theobserver/commentisfree/2018/jun/24/geraldine-mccaughrean-childrens-books-may-i-have-a-word-about","type":"article","sectionId":"theobserver","sectionName":"From the Observer","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-24T04:59:17Z","webTitle":"May I have a word about… Geraldine McCaughrean and ‘difficult’ children’s words | Jonathan Bouquet","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/commentisfree/2018/jun/24/geraldine-mccaughrean-childrens-books-may-i-have-a-word-about","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/commentisfree/2018/jun/24/geraldine-mccaughrean-childrens-books-may-i-have-a-word-about","fields":{"headline":"May I have a word about… Geraldine McCaughrean and ‘difficult’ children’s words","bodyText":"I am pleased to announce that I have a new heroine. Please step forward Geraldine McCaughrean and take your rightful place atop the winner’s podium. The Carnegie medal winner and author of 160 books has gone into battle against publishers who prefer not to use “difficult” words lest children do not understand them. She particularly champions words such as soporific, valiant, superb and mellifluous, deemed by some as being too demanding for younger readers. “Publishers will question difficult words, certainly if you’re doing picture books or fiction,” she says. “It used to be free range. I used to get away with murder with complexity of sentences and complex vocabulary and it was never questioned,” she adds, before listing the topics that are now strictly forbidden – witches, demons, death, alcohol, religion.

Announcing the plan at the annual Mansion House dinner for bankers in the City of London on Thursday, Philip Hammond, the chancellor, said the changes would help to improve the resilience of the central bank. It would also help with its “ability to meet its monetary and financial policy objectives in the future”, he said. Hammond said the government would give the Bank £1.2bn, a sum that would underwrite the £500bn lending pot, but the move would not impact public borrowing because the money would remain in the public sector. The half a trillion pound fund could be accessed by commercial banks for funding, including during credit crunch-style financial crises. The move also gives Threadneedle Street greater autonomy in lowering interest rates to zero and providing more money to commercial banks during times of stress, without requiring Treasury permission. Despite its independence from the Treasury, the Bank has needed to approach the government in order to expand its support to the economy – including when it announced an emergency funding scheme for banks in the wake of the Brexit vote. Speaking alongside the chancellor at his penultimate Mansion House dinner before stepping down next year, Mark Carney, the Bank’s governor, said the additional capital would significantly increase the amount of money the central bank could lend without seeking financial backing from the Treasury. Although at first it will amount to more than half a trillion pounds, it could rise to over three-quarters of a trillion pounds. He said the changes could also help the government to strike new deals with emerging markets to facilitate the growth of the UK financial sector, which could increase from 10 times the size of the British economy at present to 15 times by 2030. “We now have a balance sheet fit for a new world order with greater reliance on markets in a wider range of reserve currencies,” he said. As part of the changes, the Bank of England will see the emergency funding programme launched straight after the Brexit vote, known as the term funding scheme – which provides banks with cheap finance during times of stress – become part of the Bank of England’s balance sheet rather than the Treasury’s."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/jun/21/referees-world-rugby-new-zealand-france-clarity-laws","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-21T17:04:18Z","webTitle":"France take the Fall over World Rugby’s lack of clarity on laws | Gerard Meagher","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jun/21/referees-world-rugby-new-zealand-france-clarity-laws","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jun/21/referees-world-rugby-new-zealand-france-clarity-laws","fields":{"headline":"France take the Fall over World Rugby’s lack of clarity on laws","bodyText":"Steve Hansen was asked this week if he would consider putting the series trophy on the line for the All Blacks’ dead rubber against France on Saturday. The answer was unequivocal – “We’ve got it, so we’ll keep it” – while pointing out the decision is not his to make, but the very fact the question is being asked demonstrates the contentiousness of the series. On paper, New Zealand have won it with room to spare, scoring 52 points in the first Test before prevailing 26-13 in the second to take an unassailable 2-0 lead with the third to come in Dunedin, but the scorelines do not begin to tell the story. The first Test was 11-11 when France’s Paul Gabrillagues was shown an extremely harsh yellow card early in the second half and, to compound matters, the referee Luke Pearce awarded it without consulting the TMO. Soon afterwards, the France wing Rémy Grosso suffered a double skull fracture following practically simultaneous high tackles from Sam Cane and Ofa Tu’ungafasi – both All Blacks stayed on the pitch. In the second Test, with France 3-0 ahead and 12 minutes on the clock, Benjamin Fall was sent off for tackling the airborne Beauden Barrett, who landed on his head and had to be removed from the game. The red card has since been rescinded. All the while France’s sense of injustice is palpable. Both incidents have called into question World Rugby’s laws, the discrepancies between the referee’s interpretation and that of judicial panels, and even led to accusations of the All Blacks receiving preferential treatment. Indeed, the France prop Uini Atonio, born in Timaru and schooled in Auckland, suggested on Tuesday that to defeat the All Blacks “you have to beat them 15 against 16”. Both incidents have to be taken in isolation but the unsatisfactory nature of how the first was dealt with aggravated the second. It took until three days after the first Test for World Rugby to release a statement to say Tu’ungafasi had been given a citing commissioner’s warning – the equivalent of a yellow card – highlighting mitigating factors including Grosso’s low body position. In the interim, World Rugby missed the opportunity to issue a proactive statement, instead referring enquiries to New Zealand Rugby (NZR), because, for reasons unclear, it is the host nation that oversees disciplinary matters. After Fall’s red card, meanwhile, it took less than three hours for NZR to announce Fall’s disciplinary hearing. At the hearing, the red card was rescinded because of mitigating factors – namely that Fall was nudged off balance by New Zealand’s Anton Lienert-Brown – and World Rugby issued a statement of clarification on Thursday, reaffirming the guidelines for yellow and red cards for challenges in the air. The Fall incident, however, would still appear to fall somewhere in between. All the while World Rugby has done its best to absolve the referee, Angus Gardner, of blame, pointing out that, to the letter of the law, his decision to send Fall off was correct because the camera angles available to the judiciary panel which showed the mitigating factors (Lienert‑Brown’s nudge on Fall) were not available during the match. At the time Gardner could be heard stating he had “no option” but to send Fall off and it is hard not to sympathise with the Australian referee, not least because of World Rugby’s directives to clamp down on incidents that result in head injuries, not to mention the debate it has provoked. Amid the grey areas, however, one thing can be said with certainty. There are few less enviable tasks this weekend than that which awaits Saturday’s referee, John Lacey of Ireland, trophy on the line or not."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"crosswords/speedy/1193","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2018-08-11T23:00:44Z","webTitle":"Speedy crossword No 1,193","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/speedy/1193","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/speedy/1193","fields":{"headline":"Speedy crossword No 1,193","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jun/21/scott-pruitt-tactical-pants-taxpayer-spending-scandals","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-21T19:03:42Z","webTitle":"Scott Pruitt spent $1,500 of taxpayer money on fancy pants","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/21/scott-pruitt-tactical-pants-taxpayer-spending-scandals","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jun/21/scott-pruitt-tactical-pants-taxpayer-spending-scandals","fields":{"headline":"Scott Pruitt spent $1,500 of taxpayer money on fancy pants","bodyText":"Remember when Trump said he was going to “drain the swamp” and put an end to corruption and frivolous spending in Washington? Well, it turns out that it costs a lot of money and requires a lot of very fancy equipment to do all that draining. Including, apparently, extremely expensive pants. On Wednesday the Intercept reported that Scott Pruitt has now spent more more than $4.6m in taxpayer money on security, according to documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act. This includes $2,749.62 on “tactical pants” and “tactical polos” for the EPA administrator. The pants costs a remarkable $1599.68 for eight pairs, which makes one wonder if Pruitt has heard of a handy tool called Google dot com. When I did a search for tactical pants online you could find them at a far more reasonable price. Fancy-pants Pruitt has been plagued by a never-ending series of spending scandals since taking office. And he’s not the only member of the Trump administration who enjoys spending public money like it grows on swamp-dwelling trees. Here’s a look at some of the other thing the White House has been spending money on. $1,560 on pens Pruitt seemed to think this was a reasonable sum to spend on 12 customized fountain pens from a jewelry store called the Tiny Jewel Box. $2,963 on a standing ‘captain’s’ desk You can’t use your fancy pens on just any old desk. Pruitt works at a captain’s desk. Aye, aye, don’t even know what to say about that. $138,670 on doors In March it was reported that the interior department spent nearly $139,000 to upgrade three sets of doors in the office of secretary Ryan Zinke last year. No, the doors weren’t made out of diamond. Apparently they were made of fiberglass. $67,961,028 on golf According to a website, TrumpGolfCount.com, which is dedicated to tracking the president’s golf habit, this is how much Trump has spent on 112 golf trips since entering office. This is based on estimated costs of his flights and security. $31,000 on a dining set Ben Carson, the housing secretary, caused a stir earlier this year by ordering an eye-wateringly expensive dining set (mahogany with a blue velvet finish, in case you were wondering.) Helen Foster, a senior official in the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (Hud) told the Guardian that she had been told “$5,000 will not even buy a decent chair” after telling her bosses that this was the legal price limit for redecorating the Hud’s secretary suite.

From the Paris accord, to the Iran nuclear deal, to pushing for the inclusion of Russia in a G8, the US president has demonstrated no regard for Europe’s security interests. Europe, in turn, has failed to understand how to deter Trump from sabotaging the transatlantic axis. Currently, Europe is considering sanctions and tariffs on US companies. It shouldn’t. To stop Trump and protect its interests, Europe should sanction Trump himself instead. Since taking office, Trump has systematically undermined Europe while damaging the US national interest. Precisely because Washington’s European allies want to preserve the transatlantic relationship – unlike Trump – they have been hesitant to push back hard. But in its caution, Europe has fallen for a false hope: the belief that Trump can be appeased, that he can be reasoned with and that he can be convinced to abandon his current path with logic. Essentially, Europe has failed to understand that Trump cares more about himself than his country. Like a dictator of a developing country, Trump is less concerned with the prosperity of American families or the country as a whole than with enriching himself and his family businesses. Despite Europe’s commendable patience, its failure to understand what animates Trump has enabled him. For example, while Europe tried to salvage the Iran nuclear deal – an arms control agreement that made the world safer – Trump strung Europe along for months, misleading European partners that a compromise on the nuclear deal could be found when he had already made his decision months prior to kill the hard-fought agreement. But while Europe has realized that it needs to meet pressure with pressure in order to salvage the transatlantic relationship, it is still focused on measures that are unlikely to succeed. Counter-tariffs, clawback sanctions and other economic tools that Europe is considering are hardly sustainable, unlikely to force Trump to back down and will damage both the European Union and US economies. Perhaps more importantly, these economic measures will inflict hardship on millions of American workers who don’t support Trump’s agenda. Trump may even benefit from a rally-round-the-flag effect that often accompanies broad economic sanctions. A more effective approach would be to target Trump’s wallet. There are countless examples of how Trump is blatantly using the presidency to enrich himself. His controversial tax reform will reportedly save him and his family hundreds of millions of dollars. His son-in-law’s family openly uses their connection to Trump as a selling point to entice investors in China. His state department has publicly promoted Trump-owned private clubs. Foreign embassies have concluded that if they want access to Trump they should stay at his hotel in Washington. Curiously, Ivanka Trump secured seven trademarks in China around the same time Trump eased fines on a major Chinese telecommunications company. Most recently, Trump directed the commerce department to resolve its issues with sanctioned Chinese telecommunications company ZTE just two days after China floated a $500m loan to developers working on a Trump project. Like most dictators, Trump can easily weather broad sanctions on the US economy. But sanctions targeting his own companies and wealth will sting in a way that he cannot ignore. And that is exactly what Europe should do: don’t sanction or impose tariffs on Minnesotan companies that share no responsibility for Trump’s policies. Sanction Trump’s own companies and bar them from the EU market. For example, the EU and member states could prohibit officials from staying or holding events at Trump properties, or block the use of European money in financing Trump business and development deals. Just moving ahead on the planned placement of windmills near his Scottish golf course might be more likely to get Trump’s attention than a tax on motorcycles. Targeting Trump’s companies is a more moral strategy. Broad sanctions and tariffs have high cost to the US and the EU, but little cost to Trump. Targeting Trump’s companies has little cost to the EU and US economies, but a high cost to Trump. Moreover, it will deprive Trump of any rally-round-the-flag-effect that broad sanctions tend to generate. In fact, if he tries to escalate, Americans would see that Trump is risking the broader US economy just to protect his own wealth. Many in Congress will welcome this move, as it will shine a light on how Trump’s failure to put his companies in a blind trust has put the United States in a vulnerable position. And if it helps save the Iran nuclear deal or the Paris Climate Accord, the next administration and future generation of Americans will be grateful to European leaders for their courage.

Parks “quite simply make us happier” he said at last month’s launch of a report by Fields in Trust, the charity of which he is president. The research argued for a new way of valuing green spaces, and suggested the NHS saves £111m a year through “prevented GP visits”, thanks to the mental and physical health benefits of spending time outside. It would surely be hard to find anyone who doesn’t think parks are a good thing, more than ever in our age of screens and obesity. Ninety per cent of families with children under five are regular users, along with 57% of adults. But popularity has not been enough to protect parks, which are now at “crisis point”, according to countryside groups and campaigners. Cuts are the reason, and this week’s cry for help echoes previous warnings that if action is not taken to stem the flow of resources away from parks, we could face a return to the 1980s, when many were seen as no-go areas. The Charter for Parks launched today calls for councils to be given a statutory duty to look after parks, in the same way they are required to collect waste and run a library service, and asks the government to recognise people’s “right” to good-quality green spaces. This is not the first time such a demand has been made: in 2016, 220,000 people signed a petition calling for parks to be legally protected. It’s a good idea, and one that the environment secretary Michael Gove should get behind, along with the health secretary Jeremy Hunt, given the importance of green space in protecting biodiversity and air quality. With the pressure on councils to raise money from development, such an obligation would be a valuable counterweight. Over time, were environmental stewardship a more prominent aspect of local authorities’ work, their culture might be altered. But a state with more responsibilities is not the only answer. There is no reason why a nation of gardeners should spend hours tending their own lupins, and leave all the planting in the local park to paid staff. Park “friends” groups are one of the few areas where austerity may have helped some green shoots to grow. But volunteers can’t do it all, and with urgent alarm calls from Newcastle, Bristol and elsewhere (London is better protected, thanks to central government funding for the royal parks), without support these too are now at risk of withering away."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/21/brazil-latest-death-teenager-favela-raid-police-marcus-da-silva","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-21T17:58:29Z","webTitle":"Brazilian teenager dies after police helicopter strafes favela","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/21/brazil-latest-death-teenager-favela-raid-police-marcus-da-silva","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/21/brazil-latest-death-teenager-favela-raid-police-marcus-da-silva","fields":{"headline":"Brazilian teenager dies after police helicopter strafes favela","bodyText":"Brazilians have reacted with outrage and revulsion after the death of a 14-year-old schoolboy, who was shot during a security operation during which a police helicopter strafed a densely-populated Rio de Janeiro favela. After Marcos Vinicius da Silva died in a hospital on Wednesday night, residents of the Maré favela blocked the highway that leads to Rio’s international airport and a bus was set on fire. Police said that six gang members were killed in the operation. The deadly security operation came a day after intense gun battles rattled other favelas near the centre of Rio and two weeks after the cable car to the city’s landmark Sugar Loaf mountain was closed during a battle between police and gang members vying for control of two favelas near Copacabana Beach.Witnesses said that the police helicopter had fired indiscriminately into a densely populated area near a school – an accusation supported by cellphone footage. Teams from the Redes da Maré non-profit group counted over 100 bullet holes in the ground. In an emotional video published on the O Globo website, the boy’s mother, Bruna da Silva, displayed his bloodstained school uniform T-shirt and rucksack. His father, José da Silva, 37, told the newspaper his son had been late for school but decided to go home when he first heard gunfire. He was almost home when he was shot in the stomach. “Why do they see a school uniform and fire? Because they are not police. They are murderers,” he said. “I saw from the window of my house,” said Irone Santiago, 53, who works at the NGO. “They were firing and they were flying very low.” Santiago said that she knew Marcos Vinicius da Silva and his family. “Like any 14-year-boy he had a life in front of him,” she said. “What is our guilt? Because we are black, poor and live in favelas we have to die?” Santiago’s son Vitor, 32, lost the use of his legs after a friend’s car he was in was machine-gunned during a military occupation of Maré in 2015. Luke Dowdney, the British founder and director of Fight for Peace, another Maré non-profit group, also saw the helicopter from around 500 metres away. “It was coming in low and as it came in it was shooting into the favela,” he said. Students at a nearby school reacted in panic, he said: “We could hear the screaming of the kids and desperate parents running.” El País reported that the operation’s main objective was to find suspects believed to have killed a Civil Police inspector in another favela, Acari, earlier this month. The Acari favela is controlled by the Third Pure Command drug gang, one of two that operate in Maré. Two days after inspector Ellery de Lemos was killed, prominent civil police detective Marcus Amim threatened revenge on the alleged murderers, who he named during a television interview. “You will pay for this,” Amim said. “We will hunt you wherever you are.” In a WhatsApp conversation with the Guardian, Amim said he had taken part in Wednesday’s operation but denied it had any connection with his friend’s death. He said its aim had been to carry out arrest warrants and searches related to the drug trade and cargo theft. “Many shots were fired in the direction of the helicopter, which happens frequently,” Amim said. Six drug gang members had been “neutralised”, he added. Rio’s Intervention Observatory – an independent monitoring initiative – has calculated from official data that 444 people were killed by police from February to May, a 34% increase on the previous year. Rio’s latest spate of violence has raised more doubts about the effectiveness of the “Federal Intervention” ordered in February, during which the military took over Rio state security and thousands of soldiers returned to city streets. Thousands of soldiers took part in another operation in favelas between Copacabana and the Sugar Loaf on Thursday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/jun/21/kira-muratova-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-21T17:13:25Z","webTitle":"Kira Muratova obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jun/21/kira-muratova-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/jun/21/kira-muratova-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Kira Muratova obituary","bodyText":"At the Berlin film festival in February 1990, the winner of the Silver Bear – the special jury prize – was The Asthenic Syndrome, an extraordinarily original film from the Soviet Union, directed by Kira Muratova, who has died aged 83. The period of perestroika (reconstruction) from 1985 onwards allowed Muratova to emerge from the shadows and make her absurdist masterpiece unencumbered by the draconian strictures of socialist realism. Nevertheless, because of “obscenity” – there was both male and female full-frontal nudity – it was the only film to be banned in the Soviet Union during perestroika, though that ban was lifted soon after the Berlin award. Right from the start of Muratova’s career as a director in 1961, she was an irritant to the regime. Her first solo directed feature, Brief Encounters (1967), was shelved until the advent of perestroika. A ménage à trois, played by the popular singer-actor Vladimir Vysotsky, Nina Ruslanova and Muratova herself, and influenced by the French new wave, Brief Encounters disturbed the Communist party’s arbiters of taste because of the fragmented structure (characteristic of Muratova) and its nihilism, as much as by the sex and adultery. But this was considered tame compared with The Asthenic Syndrome. The latter is divided into two obliquely related parts. The first section, in black and white, a potent portrayal of mourning, follows an inconsolable doctor (Olga Antonova) who has just buried her Stalin-lookalike husband. The sequence ends suddenly when it is revealed that we were witnessing an “art film” being played before an unenthusiastic audience. The second, longer part, in colour, deals with an unfulfilled schoolteacher (Sergei Popov) who keeps dozing off because he suffers from the sleeping sickness of the title. One thing that is clear from the episodic and enigmatic narrative is that Muratova saw Russia as a madhouse in which there was little to distinguish the sane from the certified insane. “My country had reached bankruptcy and there was nowhere else for it to go. Everything had to burst,” she claimed. Born in Soroca – then in Romania and now in Moldova – Kira Korotkova was the daughter of a Jewish gynaecologist mother and a Russian father, both active members of the Communist party. Her father, who participated in the anti-fascist guerrilla movement in the second world war, was arrested by Romanian forces and shot after interrogation. In 1959, Kira graduated from the Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography in Moscow, having specialised in directing. She then moved to the Ukrainian port city of Odessa, where she made most of her films. Her first two films were co-directed with Aleksandr Muratov, whom she married in 1961. Although they were soon to divorce, she retained her married name, going on to direct Brief Encounters and The Long Farewell (1971), a “provincial melodrama” about an over-possessive mother of a teenage boy in search of his father. Like the former film, it was shelved for some years because of its “elitist” French new wave style – jump cuts, direct sound, natural locations. After many attempts to get projects started, Muratova made Among Grey Stones (1983), only to see it disembowelled by the censors. She therefore disowned the film by using the pseudonym Ivan Sidorov (the Russian equivalent of Alan Smithee). Change of Fate (1987), adapted from the same Somerset Maugham play as The Letter (1940), a Bette Davis melodrama, was Muratova’s first film made under perestroika. In it, she displayed her indifference to traditional narrative by making a whodunit without a denouement, and repeating certain sequences. After the impact of The Asthenic Syndrome, still considered her most successful and personal film, Muratova continued to be her own person, all of her films carrying the authoritative stamp of a true auteur. The Sentimental Policeman (1992), about a cop who tries to adopt a baby he has found in a cabbage patch, was a comedy with serious undertones, as was Passions (1994), a plotless but eventful story of people around horses. Three Stories (1997) had Muratova following the scent of crime tales in which there are no logical motives, while Chekhov’s Motifs (2002) updates and subverts a play and a short story by the great Russian writer. The Tuner (2004), Two in One (2007), Melody for a Street Organ (2009) and Eternal Homecoming (2012) all contain the hallmarks of her style: characters behaving in inexplicable ways, storylines moving in bizarre unpredictable directions, ellipses, a sense of bitter humour reflecting a violent, loveless, morally empty society. Though much darker, Muratova’s films belong beside the blackly humorous oeuvres of Otar Iosseliani and Roy Andersson in the cinema of the absurd. Though her films are less well known outside Russia and Ukraine, there have been retrospectives in New York (2005) and at the enterprising Rotterdam film festival (2013). She is survived by her second husband, the painter and production designer Evgeny Golubenko. • Kira Muratova, film director, born 5 November 1934; died 6 June 2018"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jun/21/family-separations-children-attorneys-not-confident-end-trump-order","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-21T18:37:03Z","webTitle":"Lawyers 'not confident' family separations will end despite Trump order","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/21/family-separations-children-attorneys-not-confident-end-trump-order","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jun/21/family-separations-children-attorneys-not-confident-end-trump-order","fields":{"headline":"Lawyers 'not confident' family separations will end despite Trump order","bodyText":"Donald Trump on Thursday put an end to his family separation policy, but attorneys are concerned the practice will continue, as they struggle to reunite parents and children without any mechanism in place to do so. “If you look at the language of the executive order it provides wiggle room for the administration,” said Jeremy McKinney, an immigration attorney in South Carolina. McKinney said he was “not confident at all” that family separations were coming to an end because the language of the executive order includes provisions that families can stay together, depending on government resources, and that they can be separated if the government decides families are in danger. “We’ve seen this administration make numerous allegations of smuggling at people,” McKinney said. “We’ve all heard the president mention this himself, about people using children as a passport to the US. These types of allegations could be used to break up families.” Separately, he was concerned that the executive order did not include a plan to reunite families. “All of us are currently living in the chaos of the current situation when you’ve got approximately 2,300 children who were separated from their parents” said McKinney, the national treasurer of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. He noted that the government’s plan so far for reuniting families has been providing detained parents with a one-page document instructing adults to contact a phone number or email for help in finding their child. McKinney said detention facilities have different rules about phone access. “Imagine if you’re in a tent city, imagine if you are in some temporary ad hoc central that was created within days, what kind of access you are going to have there?” he said. The first lady Melania Trump said she supported families reuniting during a tour of a border shelter facility on Thursday morning, but chaos remains at the border, where advocates and attorneys wait to see how the latest development plays out. Mass family separations first began in April, when the administration announced a “zero tolerance” policy that saw parents placed in adult detention facilities and children labeled “unaccompanied alien minors” and placed in health department-operated shelters. But in the months leading up to the policy’s official enactment, immigrants rights groups had warned that family separation was already taking place. A group of six immigration organizations filed a complaint with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in December 2017, after documenting at least 175 cases of family separation at the border that year. When asked how it planned to reunite children and families, the health department’s administration for children and families said in a statement it was “awaiting further guidance on the implementation of the executive order”. The agency oversees the care and shelter of unaccompanied children, who have usually crossed the border by themselves and are waiting to be reunited with their parents or other relatives in the US. By separating migrant children from their parents, the government created an influx of unaccompanied children who could shift the balance of these shelters and impact the agency’s ability to reunite children with their parents, because their parent is in detention or has been deported. “Reunification is always the ultimate goal of those entrusted with the care of unaccompanied alien children, and we are working toward that for those unaccompanied alien children currently in our custody,” HHS said. The American Civil Liberties Union in February brought a lawsuit in response to one incident of family separation, where a Congolese mother seeking asylum was separated from her seven-year-old daughter for four months. Lee Gelernt, the attorney on that case, said the circumstances that led to the separation of the child and mother, known as Ms L in court documents, could happen again. Migrant children can be separated from their parents if authorities prove they are unfit to parent the child, are abusive or neglectful, but Gelernt said: “What we’ve seen is the government decide it is in the best interest to take the child away in other situations.” Ms L and her daughter were reunited shortly after the ACLU expanded her case into a class-action lawsuit seeking an end to family separation. Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU’s Immigrants’ Rights Project, said the group is still pushing for the judge to rule family separations illegal because of the loopholes in the executive order. He said the ACLU also plans to ask the judge to demand the government quickly reunite the children who have already been separated. “When the government wants to arrest people they get the resources together,” Gelernt said. “And this is a crisis they created and they need to fix it.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/22/football-transfer-rumours-ronaldo-to-manchester-united-again","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-22T07:44:51Z","webTitle":"Football transfer rumours: Ronaldo to Manchester United?

The first lady was taking part in briefings and attending a tour of a “nonprofit social services center for children who have entered the United States illegally and a customs and border patrol processing center”, according to a statement from her office. Trump’s visit began with a tour of New Hope Children’s Shelter, a nonprofit center in McAllen, Texas, that houses roughly 60 children, mostly teenagers who have traveled from Central America. “Thank you so much for having me today. I’m glad I’m here and looking forward to meeting the children,” Trump said, sitting at a table with the health and human services secretary, Alex Azar, at a center in McAllen, Texas. “I’d also like to ask you how I can help reunite these children with their families as quickly as possible,” she added. Thousands of children have been separated from their parents in recent weeks as a direct result of the Trump administration’s “zero tolerance” policy on unlawful border crossings. The authorities have been arresting, prosecuting and jailing adults while putting their children in separate detention camps. “Her goals are to thank law enforcement and social services providers for their hard work, lend support and hear more on how the administration can build upon the already existing efforts to reunite children with their families,” the statement said. While Donald Trump’s order halts separations, his administration has not said how it plans to reunite the more than 2,300 children who were taken from their parents at the border in recent weeks. In a day of confusion and conflicting reports, the Trump administration began drawing up plans to house as many as 20,000 migrants on US military bases. But officials gave differing accounts as to whether those beds would be for children or for entire families. The US president has said the first lady and his eldest daughter and adviser, Ivanka, influenced his decision to sign the executive order. “Ivanka feels very strongly. My wife feels very strongly about it. I feel very strongly about it. I think anybody with a heart would feel very strongly about it,” Trump said signing the order. “We don’t like to see families separated. At the same time, we don’t want people coming into our country illegally.” The executive order directs government officials to continue its “zero-tolerance” enforcement policy of criminal prosecution for every immigrant who crosses the border illegally, but says that officials will seek to “maintain family unity” by detaining parents and children together instead of separating them while their legal cases wind through a severely backlogged immigration court system. In compliance with the order, the Department of Justice on Thursday asked a federal judge to change the legal constraints regarding the treatment of immigrant families who enter the country illegally. The filing sought permission to detain children for longer than 20 days so that they can remain with their parents. During her tour, Melania Trump sat smiling and chatting with officials in an immaculately clean room, where the walls behind the group were covered in neat, colorful children’s paintings, collages and pictures of hearts and flowers. Before departing, Trump was captured by photographers boarding a plane wearing a green military jacket with the a message on the back that read: “I really don’t care. Do u?” Meanwhile, an hour away, at the federal courthouse in Brownsville on Thursday morning, there was little sign of the president’s executive order taking effect. At a mass plea hearing involving 43 migrants, lawyers for the defendants informed the court that one 18 year-old Honduran defendant, Jenifer Johana Fuentes-Maradiaga, had been separated from her 14 year-old brother. Lawyers for the government confirmed they did not know his whereabouts, so Judge Ignacio Torteya III postponed her sentencing until the afternoon. Rudy Rodriguez, a public defender representing Fuentes-Maradiaga, told the Guardian his client was “worried, concerned and obviously emotional” about being separated from her younger sibling, and confirmed the two had travelled from Honduras alone. The pair had been separated two days ago, Rodriguez confirmed, adding that it was within the government’s power to exercise prosecutorial discretion for separated family members. The Guardian’s reporters in Brownsville and at the other end of the Texas-Mexico border, in El Paso, have seen no evidence that parents who have been separated from their children are being released from jails or that their children are being released from foster families or detention camps to be reunited. In Washington on Thursday, Trump did not confirm whether he was going to continue to prosecute migrants as criminals after they are caught crossing the border without authorization. Melania Trump’s surprise visit comes amid disarray on Capitol Hill, as Republican leaders twice postponed a long-planned vote on an immigration overhaul. Republican leaders had initially planned to hold the vote on Thursday, but delayed plans until Friday in an effort to wrangle last-minute support for the measure, according to a senior Republican aide. By Thursday evening, the party’s was dealt another blow when a two-hour closed door conference meeting failed to move the needle. Lacking sufficient support for the measure in its current form, Republican leaders said they would push the vote to the following week and seek modifications to the bill. Earlier on Thursday, Trump mused on Twitter: “What is the purpose of the House doing good immigration bills when you need 9 votes by Democrats in the Senate, and the Dems are only looking to Obstruct (which they feel is good for them in the Mid-Terms)?” Trump’s morning tweet was the latest wrinkle in a delicate negotiation process that sought to address two urgent immigration crises triggered by Trump’s hardline immigration agenda. The first was his cancellation of a program that shielded hundreds of thousands of young undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers from deportation, leaving their fates in limbo. The second was his administration’s zero-tolerance policy which led to the family separations. The measure, crafted to be a compromise between Republican conservatives and moderates, would provide $25bn for Trump’s border wall, and impose new restrictions on legal immigration while offering a narrow pathway to citizenship for young undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers and language they say would end family separation. Senate Republicans have moved forward with a different approach, hoping to pass a narrowly crafted standalone measure that would allow families to stay together in detention while increasing the number of federal immigration judges to ease the backlog of cases and expedite the process.

But once you hear the sound of the crunching fissure in your headphones, whether it makes you wince or tingle, the sensory effect is undeniable. In China, ice-eating videos have become something of a phenomenon, their stars racking up thousands of views. Along with whispering, tapping, the gentle scratching of a microphone, the unique sound of hair being brushed or skin being stroked – the sound of ice cubes crunching against teeth is a common trigger for ASMR, and the millions of people worldwide who experience the sensation. Short for “autonomous sensory meridian response”, ASMR was first used online in 2010, and describes the tingling, relaxing or sleep-inducing feeling that some people get when the watching videos. Suspicious of ASMR and its effects, the Chinese government has decided to ban the phenomenon, ordering the removal of ASMR videos from their biggest video streaming sites, including Youku, Bilibili, and Douyu. The ruling came via China’s anti-pornography office, which issued a statement explaining that porn was being released under the guise of ASMR, emphasising that this could be a threat to minors, who apparently make up a large part of ASMR’s viewership. In a statement officials said: “All internet companies must genuinely fulfil their duties, and increase efforts to clean up websites, implement content review processes, and protect minors from harmful content.” TingTing57 is a Chinese ASMR star based in Los Angeles who started doing it because she watched it herself and wanted to “give something back to the community”. Her videos are on YouTube, which is blocked in China, but they have been re-uploaded to Chinese streaming sites without her permission. To her, the ban does not come as a surprise, since adult content is illegal in China. However, she hopes that the government’s ban on ASMR is only temporary to “weed out the adult content”. She explains: “People will always try to abuse what’s trending no matter the subject and a lot of people think an easy way to get views is to be overly sexual. ASMR is just a nice relaxing sensation some people get, there’s nothing sexual about it.” TingTing describes seeing Chinese videos that are categorised as ASMR featuring girls wearing little clothing and using two cameras, “one to focus on their chest and the other to focus on their bare legs in a miniskirt”. She says: “Is that ASMR? Maybe, but it’s also pretty risky and vulgar and in the long run hurts the ASMR community by giving people the wrong idea.” A study conducted in 2015 by researchers at Swansea University in the UK found that 85% of consumers of ASMR use it to help them get to sleep, while just 5% reported sexual arousal. The results back up TingTing’s assertion that arousal is not the primary function of ASMR, no matter how much it might resemble a fetish. Similarly, a new study released this week by the University of Sheffield’s department of psychology,found those who reported experiencing ASMR showed significant reductions in heart rate and positive emotional responses like relaxation or feelings of social connectivity. Although the study was the first of its kind in looking at physiological responses to ASMR, its leader, Dr Giulia Poerio, believes the tingly sensation it induces is by no means a new phenomenon. Rather, she says, the videos have given people “the language to describe a feeling that they may have experienced for most of their lives”. Poerio is concerned about the ban in China but says there are workarounds: “Banning the videos could mean that ASMR experiencers are no longer able to harness the benefits of ASMR but there will probably be other video content that induces ASMR unintentionally.” Such as? “A commonly cited example is Bob Ross videos.” So if people in China are struggling for their fix, let the scratchy paintbrush of America’s most bearded artist soothe you."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/jun/27/the-shepherds-hut-tim-winton-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-27T06:30:31Z","webTitle":"The Shepherd’s Hut by Tim Winton review – an Australian odyssey","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jun/27/the-shepherds-hut-tim-winton-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/jun/27/the-shepherds-hut-tim-winton-review","fields":{"headline":"The Shepherd’s Hut by Tim Winton review – an Australian odyssey","bodyText":"The Shepherd’s Hut opens with teenage Jaxie Clackton tearing across the wild badlands of Australia’s arid west in a stolen car. “With the engine working up a howl and the wind flogging in the window [it] brings on this angel feeling. Like you’re just one arrow of light.” The setup is exhilarating, compelling: we are in Tim Winton country, and we are in for a ride. A most enviable writer, both lauded and bestselling, Winton has a particular gift for making the vernacular lyrical. Four times winner of the Miles Franklin award, twice a Booker finalist, in his native Australia he is also an environmental campaigner and general moral compass. Resolutely blue collar – just like his characters – he walks the walk, donating the prize money from the first of his Franklins to saving a strip of reef; he has been made a National Living Treasure. Don’t be fooled by this cuddly title, however: for all its lyricism, the greatest virtue of Winton’s writing is its rawness. His protagonists are always outsiders, beyond the pale, and The Shepherd’s Hut opens true to form. Jaxie’s father is “a deadest cunt”, and his mother was already lost to him years before her cancer. Jaxie and his dad now live in a small town where blind eyes are turned by cops and neighbours. No one would be surprised if the boy fought back against his father’s drunken beatings, but no one would help him, either. So when fate intervenes in the form of a faulty car jack, and Clackton Snr meets a suitably violent end crushed under his own ute, Jaxie knows who will be blamed. He cuts and runs, as his mother should have done years ago, because he is a survivor, and because he has someone to run to: shaven-headed, 15-year-old Lee, with one green eye and one grey. She knows Jaxie better than anybody: he may be “a bull looking for a china shop, but when she’s around I don’t feel like that”. Love, especially young love, is where grace is found in Winton’s novels, but Lee is also Jaxie’s cousin, so his welcome at his aunt’s house – and therefore his chance of redemption – is uncertain. Before he can risk pitching up there, Jaxie must cross the saltflats and find a hideout in the barren endlessness – which is how we come to the hut of the title, and the second key character. When Jaxie first sees him, Fintan MacGillis is slaughtering a goat and singing to himself. A gimlet-eyed defrocked Irish priest in shorts and singlet, MacGillis has been banished to the outback. For him, this is a form of penance; as far as the church is concerned, it is simply to keep him quiet. MacGillis receives supplies every six months or so, but this arrangement is so unorthodox, he is uncertain how long it will be honoured. Faith is a quintessential Winton subject, so a fallen priest in the wilderness is his perfect character, bringing in the big themes: salvation, the greater good and the spirit beyond the self. Given the revelations of child abuse in recent years, however, MacGillis does present some difficulties: he protests a number of times that he is no “pedo”, adding intimations of financial impropriety to underline the point. These qualifications are necessary, but they still feel like impositions on the narrative: the temporal world elbowing its way into the eternal. However, that MacGillis understands himself to be a sinner is clear; he and Jaxie are both in need of deliverance. Wary at first, they hunt, share meat and begin to share confidences. Here, the book is at its strongest: elegiac, transcendent – perhaps most remarkably so in their plain-spoken and blokeish exchanges. Like Patrick White, Australia’s Nobel laureate, whose European settler protagonists faced the new continent’s fierce beauty and came to believe in rock and soil and sun with far more certainty than the Christianity the old country had taught them, so Winton has his old-young pair stare out at the glow of the salt lake by moonlight – so glorious, so treacherous – and watch the stones “walking”. “Oh man, you and them rocks.” “Yes, I know lad. But listen, when they go all loose and watery in the heat […] sometimes I get the quare feeling they’ve come for me, to hold me to account.” For a while, it seems there are only the two of them and the harsh and visionary splendour. But in this remoteness all manner of ugliness can conceal itself – and the worst of it is human. If he is to save himself, Jaxie must run again – but what of MacGillis? In the closing pages, everything converges – but to find out how, you’ll just have to read it. • Rachel Seiffert’s latest novel is A Boy in Winter (Virago).

If you put the phenomenal running stats to one side (Russia have covered more ground per match than any other team in the tournament) one good reason is the form of Denis Cheryshev, who has spent the majority of his life in Spain and plays for Villarreal. The winger has offered strength and flair from the left side but most importantly has shown calm and confidence under pressure. His three goals have come at crucial moments and he looks comfortable on this stage. Cristiano Ronaldo Not so much comfortable on the stage as believing he owns it, Ronaldo has made sure the spotlight is always on him in Group B. The hat-trick against Spain may not have been the best of the 51 he has scored but in terms of generating headlines it was spot-on; his 88th-minute free‑kick truly kickstarted the World Cup. A poacher’s header subsequently took care of a progressive Morocco side, putting Portugal on the verge of the last 16 and Ronaldo at the front of the chase for the Golden Boot. What would the limelight do without him? Gareth Southgate On the other end of the attention-seeking spectrum, England’s manager has been making headlines this past week. First he was profiled in the American magazine the New Yorker, described as being a one-man antidote to England’s footballing malaise with his “radical sensibleness”. This quality appeared to have transmitted itself to his team as England astonishingly stuck to a gameplan in securing a late win over Tunisia. Southgate, and the Football Association, are doing things differently this year and, currently, it’s working. That’s good news for everyone, including the country. Just a shame about that dislocated shoulder. Aliou Cissé Senegal’s 2-1 win against Poland stands them in good stead to qualify from Group H. Both goals had an element of fluke about them but the Teranga Lions earned their luck. Theirs was a victory built on defensive discipline and intelligent use of space; qualities that don’t fit the lazy stereotypes of African football. Cissé claimed the victory, the only one for any African side so far, on behalf of the entire continent. The only black manager at the tournament also took the opportunity to speak up for African coaching. “You see lots of African players in European clubs,” he said. “Now we need African coaches for our continent to go ahead.” Cissé, whose touchline moves have also entertained, is doing his bit for the cause. Hirving Lozano Of all the players listed as potential new World Cup stars, few have shown up so far. Morocco’s Hakim Ziyech played well in a defeat by Portugal, Rodrigo Bentancur has had one good half for Uruguay. Only Mexico’s Lozano has really made people sit up and pay attention. The goalscorer in El Tri’s upset win over Germany, Lozano seized his moment, calmly getting off a shot just before Toni Kroos could shut him down. But he was a menace to Germany throughout thanks to his pace, directness and ability to act out Juan Carlos Osorio’s smart tactical plan. Now the PSV Eindhoven forward has to do it again against South Korea. Bad week Morocco’s medical staff Football has a complacent attitude towards concussion and it was embodied in the actions of Morocco towards one of their own players, Nordin Amrabat. Injured in a clash of heads with Iran’s midfielder Ehsan Hajsafi during their opening game, Amrabat was floored and withdrawn from the game, albeit after being slapped around the face by the coaching staff. He spent the night in hospital and has admitted to having lost his memory for six hours. Fifa’s official guidance is that a concussed player should not take the field again for a minimum of six days. Morocco suggested they would follow this protocol only to select Amrabat against Portugal, five days later. Manager Hervé Renard called Amrabat “a warrior”. The players’ union Fifpro described Renard’s decision to select him as “alarming”. Carlos Sánchez It might be described as an unwritten rule: don’t deliberately handle the ball in the box three minutes into a match. Don’t deliberately handle it at any point, some might say, but certainly when the game is in its opening moments and you will almost certainly incur a red card. Yet that was what the 32-year-old Sánchez did against Japan, putting Colombia at a considerable disadvantage. He was sent off and conceded a penalty, which the Asian side duly scored. Colombia played well with 10 men and drew level but they were overwhelmed in the end and find themselves in a precarious place in the tournament. Sami Khedira Tactically, Mexico did a number on Germany but they also exploited weaknesses in the world champions. Some of these were structural, such as Joshua Kimmich playing in spaces more familiar to a No 10 than a full-back, but some were down to personnel. Khedira has 15 major honours in his career, including titles in the past three Serie A seasons. But the 31-year-old could not compete with the athleticism of Mexico’s midfield. He was ineffective in possession too and all too easily bypassed when out of it. As Germany clambered to get back into the game he was withdrawn with 20 minutes to go. Mo Salah He scored, a consolation penalty thumped into the roof of the Russia net on Tuesday, so the Egyptian King has a World Cup goal to his name. But that is the only consolation in what has been the biggest anticlimax of the tournament. After dislocating a shoulder during an Act of Ramos in the Champions League final, Salah was not judged fit enough to play in Egypt’s opening defeat by Uruguay. Starting against Russia, this bright flame of a player was reduced to a flicker. He wasn’t helped by his position, stationed wide right and away from the action, but each time the ball came to his feet exasperation was not far behind. No player was the subject of greater expectation before this World Cup; those hopes have not been met. Neymar Another superstar carrying the weight of the nation on his shoulders, another pre-tournament injury, a whole host of question marks. Against Switzerland Neymar draw the ball towards him like a magnet. He also drew the physical attention of his opponents, which may have had something to do with it. But while Brazil’s play was unfailing channelled through the Paris St-Germain superstar, his end product flattered to deceive. He was dispossessed seven times in a match from which Switzerland scraped an unexpected point. Since then he has not trained fully for the Seleção, citing pain in an ankle. There are questions to be answered against Costa Rica on Friday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"society/2018/jun/21/even-duracell-bunny-mcvey-lacks-energy-defend-universal-credit","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-21T16:30:26Z","webTitle":"Even 'Duracell bunny' McVey lacks energy to defend universal credit | John Crace","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/21/even-duracell-bunny-mcvey-lacks-energy-defend-universal-credit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/jun/21/even-duracell-bunny-mcvey-lacks-energy-defend-universal-credit","fields":{"headline":"Even 'Duracell bunny' McVey lacks energy to defend universal credit","bodyText":"I have a dream. It is 12 years in the future and neither Iain Duncan Smith nor Esther McVey have been able to find another job after losing their seats in the general election of 2021. They are to be found scavenging from bins or queueing at food banks after their universal credit payments have been delayed for six years. We can always hope. A week later than planned – nothing to do with UC ever runs to time – McVey, the work and pensions secretary, came to the Commons to explain why the National Audit Office (NAO) had completely rubbished the work of her department. On these occasions, she resembles a Duracell bunny on a remedial reading course. Head down, racing through her statement at double-quick time, studiously ignoring inconvenient truths. She began by insisting UC was leading-edge British technology that promoted agile working practices for disabled people. “France, Sweden and New Zealand have all come over to this country to see how our system works,” she said. So they can learn what not to do and design theirs completely differently. After forgetting that the only reason the UC phone helplines are now free is because the government was shamed into not charging by the opposition, McVey finally got round to the NAO report. Basically the whole thing was a load of tosh put together by a bunch of idiots who hadn’t got a clue what they were doing. If the NAO had done its job properly, it would have realised that the DWP had completely revolutionised its systems in the 10 minutes since the report had been written and that everything was now just perfect. The shadow work and pensions secretary, Margaret Greenwood, is not the most dynamic of politicians – she has yet to find a room that she cannot put to sleep – but even she can take advantage of an open goal when she sees it. All that was required was to mention a few of the more obvious failings listed in the NAO report, and she duly obliged. The rollout for UC had been put back a year for the sixth time. Four legal challenges had been upheld. Forty per cent of claimants are not even able to verify their own names on the system. Twenty-five per cent of carers and two-thirds of all disabled people had not been paid on time. Answer that. Now forced to wing it without a script, the Duracell bunny started manically spinning round and round in circles. “I’ve visited groups up and down the country and I’m doing the best I can,” McVey said, sounding rather more desperate than she intended. The opposition should stop moaning. Rather than going on about the two-thirds of disabled people who were being slowly starved to death, Labour ought to be congratulating the Department for Work and Pensions for getting money to the one third on time. Time to stop talking the country down and concentrate on the positives. Duncan Smith, the former DWP secretary who had been the brains – for want of a better word – behind UC, inevitably intervened to agree with McVey that the NAO report was “a shoddy piece of work”. The NAO might just as well have used those same words to describe IDS. And with far more reason and greater accuracy. After all, auditing is what the NAO is paid to do. “I’ve spoken to Darren from Wales,” McVey said. And he had assured her that everything to do with UC was running perfectly. It didn’t seem to have occurred to her that if she was resorting to individual reports from random people who had got a bit lucky, then she had probably lost the argument. Labour’s Ruth George observed that even the DWP’s own reports proved UC was not working, with more than 40% of claimants in hardship after nine months of payments. McVey snorted. Who could believe a word an expert said? Especially one from her own department."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jun/24/wales-street-uk-most-patriotic-bunting-st-georges-flags-england","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-24T17:41:05Z","webTitle":"UK's 'most patriotic' street gets bunting out again for England","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/24/wales-street-uk-most-patriotic-bunting-st-georges-flags-england","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jun/24/wales-street-uk-most-patriotic-bunting-st-georges-flags-england","fields":{"headline":"UK's 'most patriotic' street gets bunting out again for England","bodyText":"When the full-time whistle blew in Russia, the party on a terraced street in Oldham was in full swing. Children ran out to play football while the umpteenth rendition of the Fat Les song Vindaloo blared out on to the street dubbed “the most patriotic in Britain”. More than 1,500 St George’s flags fly on the ironically named Wales Street, where every house is festooned with England colours and each family, even the street’s only Welshman, has caught World Cup fever. Chris Farrand, the mastermind of the patriotic takeover, said: “We were in the pub one day and said it would be good to decorate the street for the World Cup. That was 12 years ago, and now people are knocking on my door saying ‘Are we doing it this year?’” A kilometre of bunting crisscrosses the street, where makeshift signs temporarily rename it England Street. Residents considered changing its name officially but were put off by the associated bureaucracy, said Farrand. What started as an idea in the pub has quickly become a tradition. Every two years, and for national events such as the Queen’s diamond jubilee in 2012, everyone chips in a fiver and the ladders come out, the bunting goes up and the celebrations begin. Even family pets wear England shirts. Kath Nolan, 53, who helps wash the flags ready for their next outing, said: “Everybody mucks in. It’s become tradition here. “We all had young ‘uns when it started. My eldest is 27 now, and they wouldn’t let us not do it now. They were the ones up the ladders when it first started. We’ve just got great neighbours and everybody looks after each other,” said Nolan, as another resident handed two bags of crisps out of a passing car window. “Drive-by crisps,” joked a neighbour. Each of England’s six goals were celebrated on Sunday as if they were being scored in a World Cup final, as children rushed in and out of their homes blowing horns and jumping around. Those who preferred to watch the match at the pub even changed venues at half-time to keep everyone happy. Paddy Hetherington, 60, whose black labrador Nelly was wearing an England shirt, said: “Half the street likes one pub, the other half prefer another. We try to make everyone happy.” At the Lowerhouse Inn, where several residents watched the match, Matt Lill, 27, said he would be reluctant to leave the street to which he moved four years ago. “I don’t think people want to move away from the friendliness,” he said. “It’s rare you see a for sale sign up here, and everybody’s got each other’s key. When you go on holiday, you know your house is safe. This just brings the community spirit together.” Two years ago, residents paid for Welsh flags for the street’s Welshman during Euro 2016. This year, with Wales absent from the World Cup, his English wife persuaded him to join in the festivities, and St George’s flags duly fly from their front door. Television cameras have almost become a part of life on Wales Street. Sky Sports News and ITV’s Good Morning Britain have broadcast this week from the street, which is only big enough for only one car to squeeze through at a time. When BBC Breakfast visited on Sunday morning, Farrand became a hit on social media for finishing his first pint by 8.30am. “Chris from Oldham you wonderful bastard,” one person tweeted. “It’s positive stuff for Oldham and there’s not a lot of positives going on here any more. We’re just waiting for a visit from the mayor now,” laughed Farrand at the Lowerhouse Inn. The street’s newfound fame has attracted a handful of unpleasant remarks online, he said, but they will not let that spoil the fun. “People think we’re chavs because we decorate our street, but its really not like that,” he said. “We all work. It’s like going back to the 70s and 80s, and our street’s bucking the trend. We’re very lucky because not a lot of people have that. People don’t want to move off,” he said. For now, Wales Street is too busy celebrating the result to make plans for the quarter-finals or beyond. “I’m an England fan,” said Farrand. “I’m a pessimist, not an optimist.” But not everyone was sharing his gloomy outlook. Nolan, stretched out on a sunlounger as football anthems played from the house opposite, said: “It would have to be a mega-party, the World Cup final. We’d have to have the street blocked off.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/jun/24/lewis-hamilton-wins-french-grand-prix-sebastian-vettel","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-24T21:32:00Z","webTitle":"Lewis Hamilton hits out over Sebastian Vettel's 'tap on the wrist'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jun/24/lewis-hamilton-wins-french-grand-prix-sebastian-vettel","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jun/24/lewis-hamilton-wins-french-grand-prix-sebastian-vettel","fields":{"headline":"Lewis Hamilton hits out over Sebastian Vettel's 'tap on the wrist'","bodyText":"In a title fight that increasingly looks as if it is going to the wire, performance under pressure at key moments is going to be vital. At the French Grand Prix Sebastian Vettel was once again found wanting and Lewis Hamilton, in the manner England had shown in Russia before the race, was able to step up and clinically take advantage with a dominant display. He took the win and the lead of the world championship once again. If he is to secure his fifth title this season, these are the moments that will make the difference. After a poor weekend at the last round in Canada, where he saw his 14-point lead in the championship turned into a one-point deficit, Hamilton had still warned that he expected Ferrari would falter at some point. He might not have been expecting it to happen so soon, however, and Vettel’s error means he again holds a 14-point lead over the German. There was a celebratory air at Circuit Paul Ricard as the race welcomed France back to the Formula One calendar after a 10-year hiatus and the grandstands were flooded with tricolours and the stirring sound of La Marseillaise. But for Vettel, any optimism would have turned to regret barely moments after the final bars of the mighty anthem had died away. Starting from third behind Valtteri Bottas he had been quick off the line on the faster ultrasoft tyres but was too hot into turn one, locked up and found himself with nowhere to go, clipping the rear of the Finn. Vettel had to pit for a new front wing and Bottas for a puncture. They emerged at the back of the field while Hamilton, clear of the carnage, took to the clean air and controlled the race from start to finish. He took the flag in front of Red Bull’s Max Verstappen and the Ferrari of Kimi Raikkonen. Vettel was given a five-second penalty for causing a collision but drove an impressive comeback, scything though the field to take fifth, as much as he might have expected. But Bottas could manage only seventh after taking damage to the floor of his car from the puncture. Hamilton was pleased with his performance but critical that Vettel had not received a harsher penalty. “It’s disappointing for the team,” he said. “We all go into turn one as hard as we could but when someone destroys your race through an error and it’s only a tap on the wrist and you are still able to come back and finish ahead of the person you took out, it doesn’t add up.” He was joined in the criticism by the Mercedes non-executive chairman, Niki Lauda. “Why Vettel gets only five seconds for this enormous mistake, I don’t understand,” said the driver who won here for Ferrari in 1975. “It is too little. Five seconds is nothing, he destroyed the whole race for himself and for Bottas.” Vettel considered the punishment appropriate but he was left to consider another moment that proved costly. Last season his barge on Hamilton in Baku was ill-judged and his poor decision at the start in Singapore was the beginning of the end of his title fight. He was too hot on the restart in Baku this season and he lost places. He has the charging instincts of a racer but in this fight with Hamilton he simply cannot afford repeatedly to drop points. The German admitted he had been at fault. “My start was too good and I ended up with nowhere to go,” he said. “It was my mistake, I tried to brake and get out of it but I couldn’t. I had nowhere to go, with little grip I unfortunately made contact with Valtteri.” Mercedes had fitted their new engine here and will be buoyed by the clear evidence that it has matched and potentially bettered the step forward that Ferrari made with their new unit, although Vettel remained optimistic his team could have equalled them. “I think we had good pace,” he said. “It is difficult to say if we could have challenged but I think we had the pace to at least go with Mercedes.” His error means waiting until Austria and Silverstone to find out but here Hamilton had climbed into the cockpit, heartened from England’s demolition of Panama, and proceeded to deliver his own masterclass in applying relentless pressure to an opponent under the cosh. Doubtless he hopes he can continue riding the same wave as Gareth Southgate’s men. “6-1, that’s a mighty score,” he said. “What a great result for England today, if they are playing like that they need to keep opening a can of whoop-ass on everyone. That could be awesome, I don’t know how England would take it if we did win the World Cup.

For 40 years Britain has been subject to its perversities, inefficiencies and unintended consequences, creating bafflement, distrust and a generally dysfunctional relationship between farmers and the public. If there is a prize to be garnered from Brexit, it is in resetting this relationship, so fundamental to the health and wellbeing of people and planet. Within the farming industry, there has been no shortage of talk about the historic opportunity to reshape the future. Michael Gove may bring enthusiasm to the task and greater political clout in cabinet than his department has enjoyed for decades, but if he is to succeed where his predecessors failed, he is going to have to turn his words into actions and actually make something happen. The 25-year environment plan, launched earlier this year, certainly provides an admirably bold ambition “to leave the environment for the next generation in a better state than we found it”. Achieving this is a challenge in itself, but doing so while feeding a burgeoning population is an order of magnitude greater in complexity and ambition. To leave this challenge to the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs alone is to reduce it merely to an issue of agricultural practice and production, as has been the case for the past 40 years, in which time agricultural policy has become a flatulence-inducing stew of compromise, bad planning and incoherent bureaucracy. The truth is that we all have a vested interest in how we balance the need for food with the needs of our natural world. There has long been a tiresome parrying of points between the National Farmers’ Union – purporting to speak for all of farming – and the environmental zealots purporting to speak for all things “natural”. Both sides have won the odd battle, but neither has won the war. The NFU’s catatonic insistence that the environment must be restricted to both the metaphorical fringes of UK agricultural policy, and the literal fringes of its members’ farmland, has failed to arrest a decline in much of our environment’s natural assets. It also obligingly sets up the environmentalists’ counter-argument that all of farming is presiding over nothing less than an ecological race to the bottom. While indulging in their mutual myopia, they give the general public a fallacious choice: either feed the people or save the planet. Neither speak for the many farmers, growers and environmentalists who hold a more considered and constructive view that farming and environment can, and must, work in beneficial and mutually sustaining symbiosis. For them, Brexit is an opportunity to restart the conversation. The premise is simple: the purpose of farming is to deliver health; the health of our natural world and all the natural assets upon which life itself depends, and the health of our people, sustained by a balanced diet of wholesome, nutritious food. Defra’s consultation paper on the future for food, farming and the environment in a “green Brexit” links farming only to the health of our environment. It says precious little about the role of farming to produce nutritious food for a healthy population, and so does the government’s new plan to tackle childhood obesity. This at a time when the UK has surpassed the US as having the highest percentage of obese school-aged children, and obesity and poor diet have beaten smoking into second place for driving poor health in the UK. The government must now do something it has never done before: enshrine into legislation the common mission to create and sustain a healthy population and natural world. Even if some of us don’t yet know it, we really don’t want our farmers to stop producing food from the land they tend, but we – and they – may want to stop those ways of producing food that have the biggest impact on our environment, while making the least contribution to our health. Brexit will give Gove and his fellow ministers a generational opportunity, but on a matter so fundamental we must all participate in the public sphere, acknowledge the need to change our behaviours, and act. Farming has to speak less to itself and more widely with society. When faced with bare facts such as declining soil fertility, farming’s contribution to the public discourse can no longer be limited to a staunch defence of the status quo. The public also has some changes to make: food waste, and profligate consumption of food, water and energy, drive demand for the most intensive and extractive methods of production. And no foodstuff, whether derived from animal or plant, is free of environmental cost or moral hazard. The government’s next iteration of its policy on agriculture and environment is as central to all our lives as its policy and spending plans for education and health. An honest, balanced and trusted discourse between farming and society is much needed, but can only be established when we are all prepared to acknowledge our complicity in creating the problem, as well as our responsibility and ability to find a better way to sustain healthy people and planet. • Catherine Broomfield writes on farming and keeps cattle on her grassland farm in Devon"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/24/migration-is-threat-to-eu-free-travel-area-says-italian-prime-minister","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-24T19:02:01Z","webTitle":"Migration is threat to EU free travel area, says Italian prime minister","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/24/migration-is-threat-to-eu-free-travel-area-says-italian-prime-minister","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/24/migration-is-threat-to-eu-free-travel-area-says-italian-prime-minister","fields":{"headline":"Migration is threat to EU free travel area, says Italian prime minister","bodyText":"Italy has warned the future of the EU’s border-free travel zone is at stake as it sought to ease the pressure on Mediterranean countries arising from hosting refugees and migrants. Italy’s prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, was speaking at a mini-EU summit in Brussels, where he said a plan from his government presented at the summit represented a paradigm shift in dealing with migration. But his ambitious move to change what he called obsolete EU rules that govern who is responsible for asylum claimants is likely to encounter opposition from other countries. The 10-point plan by his new populist government revives many ideas proposed by previous Italian governments, such as calling on all EU member states to share responsibility for migrants rescued at sea, and countries being docked EU funds if they refuse to take in refugees. Leaders from 16 EU countries put on a show of unity, as they left an emergency summit in Brussels on Sunday. The unorthodox meeting, boycotted by several EU countries, was called to shore up the conservative coalition government of the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, which is riven by a row over migration. Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, said the talks had been “frank and open,” although they had not resulted in “any concrete consequences or conclusions”. Sunday’s ad-hoc meeting sets the stage for a long-planned gathering of all EU leaders on Thursday, where it will be harder to mask Europe’s deep divisions on migration. Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, can be expected to repeat his fierce opposition to migrant quotas, a policy opposed by other central European countries. The latest meeting was not only a lifeline for Merkel, but an attempt to save the EU’s 26-country border-free travel zone, seen as one of the EU’s crowning achievements. Before the meeting had even begun, divisions were on display, as Italy and Malta traded insults over which nation was responsible for a boat of 234 migrants adrift in international waters. In a stark reminder of the issues at stake, the NGO rescue mission Lifeline was refused permission to dock at Italy, while Malta sent it back to Italian waters. Ministers from Malta and Italy argued on Twitter over which country was acting in a humane way towards the ship. Meanwhile, a Danish ship, the Alexander Maersk, was waiting off Sicily’s coast for a port to disembark more than 100 people it had rescued. Arriving at the summit, Malta’s prime minister, Joseph Muscat, sought to defuse the row, saying it was not a time for finger-pointing as he advised against “building a wall even on the high seas”. Urging fellow leaders to take operational decisions, he said later: “There are people at sea right now. We are in a situation where we don’t take decisions in the coming days the situation will escalate.” The situation echoes the plight of the Aquarius, a rescue boat of 630 migrants that eventually docked in Spain last week, after being turned away by Italy. Diplomats from France, Spain, Italy and Malta held intense talks about each country taking in people from Lifeline. Meanwhile Sánchez, called on “comrades” in other member states to help Spain, following a recent spike in arrivals. In its 10-point plan, Rome is seeking to break the link between the country that rescues migrants and the country obliged to process asylum claims. Under current rules, an EU country is responsible for processing the asylum claims of all new arrivals, which has put enormous pressure on Mediterranean states, especially Italy and Greece. The Italian plan called on every EU country to set a quota for economic migrants and said migrant centres were needed in other countries. Italy also backs the idea of offshore migrant camps in north Africa to process asylum claims of people rescued at sea. Although the idea remains sketchy and no African countries have agreed to host the centres, the idea generates far more consensus among EU leaders than how to manage people once they reach Europe. Merkel played down expectations for a breakthrough at Thursday’s summit, adding that countries have to see “how can we help each other without always having to wait for all 28, but by thinking what’s important to whom”. Instead of difficult overall deals among all member states, she said it was “also about bi- and trilateral agreements for mutual benefit”. Germany’s hardline interior minister, Horst Seehofer, has threatened to turn migrants away at the border, unless there is an EU-wide agreement by early July to better control secondary movements. Many believe that if Germany closes its border in a bid to stop the arrival of migrants from Italy, other countries would soon follow, leading to the collapse of the open-border Schengen zone. “If we don’t have a genuine solution on the migration issue, then Schengen is dead,” said a diplomatic source, who added: “I honestly think that this meeting is not the best way to tackle the divisions.” The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said there was a political crisis over migration and urged Europe to defend values of human rights. “Every time we have betrayed our values we have created the worst,” he said. Echoing Merkel, he also raised the prospect of some member states acting alone, if it proved impossible to find agreement between all 28. “It can be cooperation between the 28 or cooperation between some states who decide between themselves.” Reviving the core Europe idea is likely to prove controversial, especially with four central European countries that were not attending Sunday’s mini-summit. The original guest list was limited to eight countries, but the European commission later issued an open invitation, although 12 countries chose to stay away. But the symbolism of holding an EU summit in Brussels without all EU member states struck some observers as a bad idea. The European council president, Donald Tusk, refused to host the meeting, because he wants the EU to act as one bloc, leaving European commission president Jean-Claude Juncker to step in reluctantly as organiser. Arrival figures for refugees and migrants are currently 51% down on last year and 81% down on 2016."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/24/england-panama-world-cup-ratings","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-24T15:27:53Z","webTitle":"England 6-1 Panama: how the World Cup 2018 players rated in Nizhny","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/24/england-panama-world-cup-ratings","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/24/england-panama-world-cup-ratings","fields":{"headline":"England 6-1 Panama: how the World Cup 2018 players rated in Nizhny","bodyText":"England Jordan Pickford Remained focused despite having little to do in the stifling heat of Nizhny Novgorod.

Overall the winger justified Southgate’s faith in him with a spellbinding assist for Lingard’s goal. 7Substitutes: Jamie Vardy Barely touched the ball during the half-hour he was on the pitch. Unlikely to have played himself into the starting XI. 6 Danny Rose Gave away a needless corner from which Panama missed a great chance. 5 Panama Jamie Penedo Left exposed by a woeful defence and had little chance with any of England’s goals. 5 Michael Murillo Left Stones scandalously unmarked as Panama’s defence concentrated on wresting Kane and Maguire. Went downhill from there. 3 Fidel Escobar Gave away the first penalty by bundling over Lingard inside the box and redeemed himself only slightly with the odd decent challenge in second half. 3 Román Torres Laughable so-called leader, although there was presumably little amusement among the 5,000 Panama fans who travelled halfway round the world for this. 2 Gabriel Gómez The worst offender in a bloodthirsty pack. Lucky to get away with flailing arm in box in second minute and disgraceful thereafter. 3 Blas Pérez The 37-year-old striker got precious little service so ultimately it was hard to judge his performance. 5 Édgar Bárcenas Before it all fell apart for Panama, the 24-year-old’s curling shot after 16 minutes was a bright moment for Panama. 6 Armando Cooper Booked for a late and vicious challenge on Lingard and lucky not to see red for an elbow on Maguire. 4 Eric Davis Not the type of name one would expect for a Panamanian but ultimately very little to surprise in his play. As disorganised as the rest of the defence. 4 Aníbal Godoy Rugby-tackled Kane inside the box for the second penalty and redeemed slightly by his good interaction with José Luis Rodríguez. 4 José Luis Rodríguez Gave a decent account of himself in the second half but was mostly surrounded by the hopeless and hapless. 5 Substitutes: Ricardo Ávila Came off the bench and his pinpoint free-kick set up Baloy to score. 7 Felipe Baloy Finally gave the Panamanian fans inside Nizhny Novgorod – or wherever they were watching – something to cheer, sliding in for their first ever World Cup goal. 7"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"environment/2018/jun/24/frogs-and-dragon-flies-in-a-deadly-duel","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-24T16:11:05Z","webTitle":"Frogs and dragon flies in a deadly duel | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jun/24/frogs-and-dragon-flies-in-a-deadly-duel","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/jun/24/frogs-and-dragon-flies-in-a-deadly-duel","fields":{"headline":"Frogs and dragon flies in a deadly duel","bodyText":"Your report (21 June) urging gardeners to be frog friendly is, of course, to be welcomed.

This year not a single froglet will emerge from my pond, despite the protection given to the frog spawn during the late snow and frost. The entire population of tadpoles has been eaten by dragon fly larvae.

Mackintosh did not, after all, physically build it himself – his genius resides in the design and a faithful rebuild is no less a Mackintosh building than the original. Unrealised buildings by Mies van der Rohe and Frank Lloyd Wright have been constructed long after their deaths from original plans. The only difference is that Mackintosh’s art school had a previous existence. If there is an opportunity to return this marvellous building to three-dimensional life, so it can be physically experienced by future generations rather than only surviving as plans and photos, it should be taken. Ian Simmon Monkseaton, Tyne and Wear • I agree with Ian Jack (Brick by brick, Glasgow must recreate its lost masterpiece, 23 June). Glasgow without its art school would be like London without St Paul’s. In addition to the massive negative impact on students and Glaswegians, its absence would dismay the many visitors to the city who come to wonder at Mackintosh’s masterpiece. In the 1990s, Glasgow built the much-admired House for an Art Lover based on Mackintosh’s designs but never tackled in his lifetime. So there is a precedent and, if a new art school rose from the ashes in sympathy with the original specifications and put to the same use, it is highly unlikely to be dismissed as a fake “Mockintosh” replica. Mike Pender Cardiff • While staying in Glasgow for a family wedding last weekend, like Ian Jack I too had thought that rebuilding the School of Art to the original spec again was the best way forward for Glasgow until I spoke with a Glaswegian cab driver. “It’s a shame but look around you. How come they find millions for art so easily – every time – when there’s no money for addressing the increasing numbers of homeless people? Let’s build a cheaper school and help the more vulnerable people of Glasgow at the same time. A joint venture to celebrate an inclusive Glasgow.” I changed my mind. Emily Matheson West Wickham, Kent • Architect Alan Dunlop and others (Report, 19 June) say Mackintosh would have wanted a new school fit for the 21st century. But we have an example of this in the new modern art school building by a top architect opposite the Mackintosh: bland, boring and out of keeping with the character of Glasgow. If the Germans and Poles can reconstruct their destroyed iconic buildings, surely we can. The restoration of Windsor Castle after the 1992 fire cost £36m, mostly paid for indirectly by the public. Louis Hellman London• I disagree with Ian Jack’s opinion that Charles Rennie Mackintosh was influenced by the Viennese Secessionists. Indeed, Mackintosh’s influence was a combination of Japanese and Arts and Crafts styles, and in 1900 the Secessionists, aware of his pioneering and progressive style, invited him to design and exhibit an entire room at their Eighth exhibition. So if anything, Mackintosh influenced the Secessionists rather than the other way round. Dr Allan Dodds Nottingham • Ian Jack’s excellent article rightly calls for Mackintosh’s masterpiece to be rebuilt exactly as it was. The decision to rebuild needs to be taken now, even as the causes of the fire are investigated. It will, no doubt, take a decade or more and the cost will be great. How should it be funded? As Gavin Stamp argued four years ago, the School of Art (where he taught) has shown itself unworthy to be the custodian of this great building. A Mackintosh Foundation should be established to raise the funds needed – Mackintosh was an architect of global significance and the appeal for funds should be global. Public money should not be required. The foundation should then own and run the building as a national monument, a centre for architectural studies and a symbol of Glasgow’s determination to protect its remarkable artistic heritage.

Of course, there must be consequences where neglect or deliberate actions have caused harm, but to shift to a “learning culture” he must incentivise accountability among staff to foster a culture of openness and honesty. Lessons are only learned through honesty, transparency and an acceptance that accountability doesn’t necessarily lead to blame and punitive measures. Staff are the NHS’s biggest asset and by getting its workforce culture right, not only will Hunt improve patient safety and prevent future scandals such as the one at Gosport hospital, he will reduce the burden on staff that is making so many want to leave the NHS after so many years of service. Dennis Bacon Executive chairman, Pulse UK, Norwich• Safety is disaster-led. After the Herald of Free Enterprise ferry sank in 1987, killing 193, marine safety regulations were tightened. Shipping companies were made responsible for safety of life at sea, in addition to the duties of captain and crew. Safety improved. Working as a ship’s doctor from 2003-15, I witnessed a new development. A monthly prize was awarded to the crew member who reported the most significant safety concern leading to learning or a change of practice. A volte-face in the NHS would be to reward whistleblowers, especially those whose testament led to an increase in safety. We need to fundamentally change the current situation in which staff are still nervous about the personal consequences of whistleblowing, and are often unsupported or worse. How about an annual prize for the NHS organisation which has made the most safety improvements as a result of staff-reported concerns? Carrot and stick. Dr Ruth Taylor London • Bribing or gagging well-intentioned whistleblowers, who have the interests of the patients at heart, is no way to improve quality control in the NHS, a matter which in my opinion has never been adequately addressed. The main problem is that the whistleblower feels they have no one to turn to. The post of matron has largely been abolished, and the medical profession has become the servant of managers, who are lay people, rather than the other way around, a fact which is reflected in their respective salaries. Surely NHS staff should be given a statutory right to complain to management if they find it necessary, and have their complaint recorded and acted upon in a transparent manner, instead of having to endure the present culture of victimisation. I recall as a junior doctor, working at a hospital in the south of England, complaining that when I was on call for cardiac arrests – a very urgent matter requiring immediate attention, obviously – no on-site accommodation was provided for me. The outcome? I was hauled up before the hospital manager and senior surgeon and accused of being a communist. Presumably communists have higher standards of care and compassion. Dr Andrew Norman Poole, Dorset • In her article Call for action against senior officials over hospital deaths (22 June), Sarah Boseley refers to “life-shortening drugs” such as diamorphine. It is important to stress that although overdosage can be fatal, as long as they are given in appropriate dosage, carefully titrated against the patient’s need for pain control, these drugs do not shorten life. The common perception that they do can be very unfortunate if consequent reluctance to prescribe or accept them results in inadequate pain control in advancing but non-terminal cancer.

On Saturday, Sanders posted: “Last night I was told by the owner of Red Hen in Lexington [Virginia] to leave because I work for POTUS and I politely left. Her actions say far more about her than about me. I always do my best to treat people, including those I disagree with, respectfully and will continue to do so.” Walter Shaub, federal ethics chief under Barack Obama and briefly Donald Trump and now a fierce critic of the administration, responded: “Sanders used her official govt account to condemn a private business for personal reasons … she can lob attacks on her own time but not using her official position.” The controversy came at the end of a week of fierce debate over a Trump policy which mandated the separation of children from their parents when such families entered the US illegally. Between April and early June, according to federal statistics, more than 2,300 children were taken. On Wednesday, amid international condemnation and with even Republican supporters in Congress beginning to waver, Trump signed an executive order nominally – but not conclusively – stopping the practice. On Saturday, groups of Democrats visited federal facilities, seeking details about how the children will be reunited with their families. The Department of Homeland Security said it knew where all the children were and was working to reunite them. On Sunday, Trump returned to the attack on Twitter, advocating the end of due process. “We cannot allow all of these people to invade our ountry,” the president wrote. “When somebody comes in, we must immediately, with no Judges or Court Cases, bring them back from where they came. Our system is a mockery to good immigration policy and Law and Order.” Amid the controversy over immigration, and mixed messages from the president about congressional efforts at reform, there has been no White House press briefing since Monday. Then, Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary, addressed reporters on the separations policy. Nielsen and the policy adviser Stephen Miller both found themselves confronted by protesters in Mexican restaurants in Washington. The Red Hen seats 26 and serves “inspired Shenandoah cuisine” a three-hour drive from DC. Its owner told the Washington Post Sanders was served with a selection of cheeses before she decided, following a consultation with staff members, to ask her to leave the premises. “I was babbling a little,” Stephanie Wilkinson said, “but I got my point across in a polite and direct fashion. I explained that the restaurant has certain standards that I feel it has to uphold, such as honesty and compassion and cooperation. I said, ‘I’d like to ask you to leave.’” Sanders, Wilkinson said, replied: “That’s fine. I’ll go.” Others at her table followed. Wilkinson said: “They offered to pay. I said, ‘No. It’s on the house.’” The owner added: “I would have done the same thing again. We just felt there are moments in time when people need to live their convictions. This appeared to be one.” The story set off a Twitter battle between Trump supporters and opponents, many on both sides comparing it to a recent supreme court ruling that said the owner of a Colorado cake shop was right to refuse service to a gay couple, based on his religious beliefs. Sanders’ father, former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee, waded in, writing: “Bigotry. On the menu at Red Hen Restaurant in Lexington VA. Or you can ask for the ‘Hate Plate’. And appetizers are ‘small plates for small minds’.” Newt Gingrich, a former Republican House speaker who many blame for US politics’ descent into vitriol and schism in the 1990s, wrote: “The increasing personal nastiness toward people who work for President Trump reflects the left’s understanding that they are losing. Nastiness reflects desperation, not strength. They can’t win the argument so they use nastiness. Sad and dangerous.” Shaub launched a series of tweets of his own. “Sarah,” he began. “I know you don’t care even a tiny little bit about the ethics rules, but using your official account for this is a clear violation … It’s the same as if [a Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives] agent pulled out his badge when a restaurant tried to throw him/her out. “Sanders used her official gov[ernmen]t account to condemn a private business for personal reasons. Seeks to coerce business by using her office to get public to pressure it. Violates endorsements ban too.” The Red Hen found itself at the centre of online efforts to boost or damage its customer reviews, hoax booking calls and differing opinions locally. Amid a media scrum, Tom Lomax, a local business owner, brought flowers as a show of support. He called Wilkinson a “force of nature” and “one of the biggest drivers of the downtown” and told the Associated Press: “We support our own here, great little community we have.” Stephen Russek, a former restaurant owner, said: “You have your political opinions, you don’t throw somebody out of your restaurant. They ought to be shut down.” Shaub added: “There’s no ethics rule against Sarah Sanders fans being cartoonish hypocrites in defending merchants discriminating against gay people but howling when a merchant rejects a human rights violator based on her involvement in harming babies &amp; children.

The opposition will not always be this obliging and nobody, surely, can expect Harry Kane to keep scoring so prodigiously throughout the rest of the World Cup. Maybe England have peaked too soon. And no doubt the most overheard line over the coming days will be that, yes, it was only Panama. Stay calm, it was only Panama. All the same, it was difficult to come away from this freewheeling win for Gareth Southgate’s increasingly convincing side without the overwhelming feeling that it has been a long time since an England team have played this freely. It was their biggest World Cup victory and at half-time, no kidding, there were people in the press box flicking through the history books to find out how many more goals were needed to establish the biggest ever win in the history of this competition. England were 5-0 ahead at that stage courtesy of two penalties from Kane, a pair of headed goals from John Stones and a beauty from Jesse Lingard. Kane’s hat-trick followed in the 63rd minute and, after that, it came as a jolt that the only other goal was delivered by a Panamanian boot. Hungary’s 10-1 win against El Salvador in 1982 will have to be a target for another day. Thursday, perhaps, when Belgium are the opposition, to establish which team wins Group G. Already, it is mission accomplished as far as qualification is concerned and, on this evidence, it is no exaggeration to say England should not fear anybody in the knockout stages. Kane is now the leading scorer in the tournament, with five goals, and Gary Lineker is the only player, through all the ages, who has accumulated more World Cup goals for England. Yet the acclaim here should not just apply to the Tottenham striker when Stones has been so effective, when Kieran Trippier’s supply line has been so instrumental, and Lingard is emerging as a genuine category-A player. England had not scored five first-half goals in any game since doing just that against Luxembourg in 1999, and it is only the third time since 1950, out of 24 attempts, they have begun a major tournament by winning back-to-back matches, emulating the World Cups of 1982 and 2006. It is still only two games but something important is happening. England are becoming the team their supporters want them to be. And it is great fun. Panama’s ordeal did at least include the consolation of a 76th-minute goal and their supporters were still partying at the end. Ultimately, though, the imbalance of talent was far too great for a team fielding four players from Major League Soccer and others from the Romanian and Slovakian leagues. Panama had to resort to other measures. They argued with the officials. Their goalkeeper, Jaime Penedo, seemed to be threatening a one-man protest before Kane’s first penalty, and it was incredible, in particular, to see their tactics from England’s corners. Even by modern standards, has there ever been another set of players so dedicated to restricting the mobility of their opponents? Their approach led to Kane’s penalty, to make it 5-0, when Aníbal Godoy manhandled him to the floor. Yet that was the norm, rather than the exception, for every corner and an argument could be made that Panama also got their just deserts for the opening goal. For that one, Harry Maguire was brought to his knees twice because of Gabriel Gómez’s attempts to pin him down. Godoy was clinging to Kane like a mollusc on the side of a ship. Twice, the corner had to be delayed to sort out the chaos. Nobody, however, seemed to designate Stones as a potential danger. Trippier swung the ball over from the right and Stones powered in his header from eight yards. Even by that early stage, eight minutes in, it had become clear it was going to be harder to like this Panama team than many of us imagined. Indeed, England ought to have had a penalty inside 90 seconds after Gómez swung an elbow into Lingard’s jaw. Gómez, a repeat offender, went down clutching his own face and the Egyptian referee, Gehad Grisha, was taken in by the deception. Later, an elbow from Armando Cooper bloodied Maguire’s nose. Román Torres responded to Maguire’s complaints by flicking his opponent’s nose and pushing in his forehead in the manner of a rutting stag. Southgate had told his players not to react to any provocation and they did not let him down. Instead, this was a performance that brought to mind the old line from Frank Sinatra that the best revenge is massive success. Kane’s first penalty came from Fidel Escobar bundling over the energetic and elusive Lingard. Kane struck the ball high, to the goalkeeper’s right, in a style reminiscent of Alan Shearer. For good measure, he did the same for the fifth goal. Lingard’s was the pick of them all, exchanging passes with Raheem Sterling before running across the line of the penalty area, left to right, and curling a shot that went in off the underside of the crossbar. Yet the fourth goal was brilliantly worked, too. This time, Trippier played a free-kick short to Henderson. A first-time cross was headed down by Kane and Stones put in the rebound after Penedo had blocked Sterling’s close-range effort. The second half was an exercise in damage limitation for Panama and, to give them their due, Kane’s hat-trick goal was a fluke, Ruben Loftus-Cheek letting fly from 20 yards and the ball striking his teammate on the heel to loop in. England’s lingering imperfections were briefly exposed when Felipe Baloy, one of Panama’s substitutes, turned in a free-kick with an outstretched leg. Yet Southgate and his players can still enjoy the view from the top of Group G, with the same points and goal difference as Belgium but ahead on fair-play rules, and the manager was pumping his fists at the end, no matter that it was only a few days since he dislocated his shoulder. Nobody should get too carried away but, good heavens, it can be hard sometimes."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/jun/25/olympic-games-women-decathlon-heptathlon-ennis-hill-sean-ingle","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-25T10:00:00Z","webTitle":"Women’s decathlon: overdue game-changer or heptathlon killer? | Sean Ingle","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jun/25/olympic-games-women-decathlon-heptathlon-ennis-hill-sean-ingle","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jun/25/olympic-games-women-decathlon-heptathlon-ennis-hill-sean-ingle","fields":{"headline":"Women’s decathlon: overdue game-changer or heptathlon killer?","bodyText":"Ninety years ago this summer the Times’ man at the Amsterdam Olympics sent a startling dispatch from the athletics. “The final of the 800 metres race for girls rather tended to leave the impression that such things should not be,” he wrote, barely cloaking his prejudice in concern. “The half-dozen prostrate and obviously distressed forms lying on the side of the track may not warrant a complete condemnation of the girl athletic championships but it certainly suggests unpleasant possibilities.” Those “unpleasant possibilities” soon became depressing realities. The runners were merely tired after the race, won in a world record time. But the International Olympic Committee ruled that the 800m was far too tough for women – and promptly banned it from the Games for the next 32 years. For years afterwards the movement towards equality remained on the slow side of glacial. It took until 1984 before women were allowed to run in an Olympic marathon; another 16 years before women’s pole vault was introduced; and – don’t laugh – the women’s steeplechase was not included in the Games until 2008. Nowadays the men’s and women’s programmes are identical in every respect but one – women compete in heptathlon, over seven events, rather than decathlon, over 10. And that, for some, is the final frontier in the battle for equality in athletics. Next weekend that battle will become a lot spicier when the first USA Track and Field-approved women’s decathlon championship takes place in California. It is, says Becca Peter, the event’s athlete co-ordinator, a potential game changer because until now there has been little incentive for women to compete in decathlons or race directors to put them on. “I don’t want to bash the heptathlon, which is an amazing event,” she says. “But it is less demanding than the decathlon, which is widely seen as finding the world’s best all-round athlete. What kind of message does that send to women and girls? In effect, they are being told they can’t be the world’s greatest athlete, that they can’t do as many events as men. And that isn’t right.” It is a persuasive argument and it has the support of some on the IAAF women’s committee. Yet most heptathletes and coaches, publicly and privately, are adamant it would be a terrible idea. Partly they believe there is no great thirst for change, given that women already have the heptathlon. But they also fear there is a higher risk of injury with the women’s decathlon because it has a different order of field events on day one and day two to avoid scheduling conflicts when men’s and women’s decathlons take place simultaneously. That, says Toni Minichiello, the highly respected coach of the London 2012 heptathlon champion, Jessica Ennis-Hill, is a recipe for disaster. “Those events are in a certain order for a reason,” he says. “If the high jump is the ninth event rather than the fourth, as it is in the women’s decathlon, it risks greater injuries.” Minichiello believes Ennis-Hill, one of Britain’s most popular athletes, would have left combined events if the decathlon was introduced. And he insists athletics would be better served focusing on a new era of heptathletes. Another top coach, Les Gramantik, who trains the Olympic decathlon bronze medallist Damian Warner, is even more sceptical. “Reversing the order of the events for women is a terrible sequence considering the physical challenge of the events, where day one would be predominantly technical, followed by speed power on day two,” he warns. “Women have a great and exciting event called heptathlon, so leave it alone. I know I will not coach women for decathlon.” Meanwhile Harry Marra, the legendary coach of the decathlon world record holder, Ashton Eaton, and the heptathlon Olympic bronze medallist Brianne Theisen-Eaton, also urge caution. “Of course women can do 10 events,” he says. “But the heptathlon is a fine test standing alone. My gut tells me to leave it be unless heptathletes and their coaches are polled and wish otherwise. Some committee of so-called experts should not be in the business of making decisions they have little knowledge of.” Some of this antipathy comes from an understandable desire of heptathletes to hold on to what they have. There is room for only one combined event on the Olympic track and field programme. So why should they be like turkeys voting for Christmas? The American Kendall Williams is one of the few current heptathletes to have shown an interest in the decathlon but the thought of learning technical events, such as the pole vault and discus, gives many nightmares. Perhaps, though, their worries are overstated. After all, the current women’s decathlon world record holder, the Lithuanian Austra Skuiyte, also won heptathlon silver at the 2004 Olympics and bronze at London 2012. Peter, for her part, says she is sympathetic to any concerns and merely wishes to offer women more choice. “If there is ever going to be a switch to the women’s decathlon, you need at least eight years – or two Olympic cycles – to implement it as it is unfair to destroy the career of a current elite heptathlete,” she says. Such a bedding-in period would take us to the 2028 Olympics – as well as marking the 100-year anniversary of the IOC’s decision to ban the 800m because it was too strenuous for women. Supporters of the women’s decathlon believe it would be an ideal riposte to that heinous act. Others, though, still need convincing. • The picture caption on this article was amended on 4 July 2018.

The damage done will ricochet around the health service and could threaten more harm to patients, if the wrong lessons are learned. Callous “life shortening” that killed at least 456 people has all the hall-marks of routine extermination of the inconvenient. With NHS beds brimful of aged nuisances, here is the spectre of overworked, desensitised staff tempted to speed the end without consent of patient or next of kin. The tenacious Gosport relatives who soldiered on despite rejection from every tier of officialdom finally – three decades later – exposed the scandal. A full 29% of patients who died of a lethal morphine overdose in Daedalus ward – nicknamed “dead loss” – were suffering no pain. Some only came for a short rehabilitation, but got sudden death instead. Naturally, the NHS’s instinctive enemies suggest this horror is emblematic. Dominic Lawson, in the Sunday Times, sneers at the Guardian’s celebration of the NHS at 70, “in which various eminent folk explained why it is what makes Britain great”. Like others, he hints the service must be harbouring many other fatal events. But Ipsos Mori finds that 73% of patients say their treatment exceeded or was as good as their expectations. Terrible things may happen, but public affection is solidly based on good experience. One of those terrible things is the revelation that the syringe drivers – used for years in Gosport and elsewhere to administer constant sedation – were faulty. The Sunday Times has found that some were used until five years ago. Cheap and shoddy, a malfunction could deliver a 24-hour diamorphine dose in an hour, in one fatal shot. The outrage over Gosport may actually harm patients in pain. After the Harold Shipman murders, GPs feared easing the death of the terminally ill, as every ampoule of morphine was now rigidly accounted for. Will those in the greatest pain now find access to morphine curtailed? The “analgesic ladder” in the British National Formulary already has strict guidelines on morphine doses, but doctors may now fear the unclear distinction between pain relief and hastening death. “Please keep comfortable” is a good instruction for doctors. But the dread phrase used by Dr Jane Barton to sign the death warrant of those not in pain or close to death has become an awful euphemism for summary execution. Expect it to enter the lexicon of dark medical humour: watch out or I’ll “keep you comfortable”. The tragedy is that this scandal may increase the number of bad deaths. While good births get much attention, the good death eludes too many. Hospices and palliative-care professionals have been a blessing – but as a heavily Christianity-based culture, they have also obstructed the right to die: too often they claim all pain can be eased, when that’s not the case. I have seen how even the highest doses often don’t ease the worst agonies, but their testimony in parliament has successfully prevented right-to-die legislation. Needless to say, right-to-die opponents have been quick to use the Gosport scandal. “How many thousands could have their ‘lives shortened’ unlawfully when assisted suicide becomes legal?” asks one prominent Christian blogger. The difference between unwanted death and assisted suicide can be encapsulated in one word: choice. It’s the difference between a woman’s right to choose abortion, and the Chinese state dragging her off to abort a baby against her will under the one-child rule. The right to die is the last frontier in a long battle to take control of our own beings, our bodies, our life and death. The lesson of Gosport is that patronising, insensitive outsiders, whether doctors or legislators, do not have the right to make these decisions for us. Many, faced with terminal illness, choose to savour every last minute of life, even in pain. Others don’t. That choice is well-understood by the 82% who have for years strongly supported the right to die. Those who, mainly for religious reasons, claim it would be a slippery slope to Gosport-style dangers, deliberately ignore how a law would prevent another Gosport, with proper regulation bringing transparency to end-of-life treatment. Legislation advocated by the organisation Dignity in Dying would allow terminally ill patients in their final months, and mentally competent, to choose – with the oversight of two independent doctors and a high court judge – a quicker death. Personally, I would go further and legislate for a living will to end our lives if dementia takes hold, so our competent selves can act as custodian for our future incompetent selves: a guarantee to avoid humiliating mental collapse. The best answer to Gosport is legal clarity to protect vulnerable people and let the fully alert escape a lingering death. My mother, longing for death, asked her GP wryly: “Where’s Dr Shipman when you need him?” She might now say: “Take me to Gosport.” But that’s no way to go: there is a crystal-clear difference between an unwanted, premature end and choosing an easeful death. • Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"education/2018/jun/24/michael-banton-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-24T16:41:04Z","webTitle":"Michael Banton obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/jun/24/michael-banton-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2018/jun/24/michael-banton-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Michael Banton obituary","bodyText":"Michael Banton, who has died aged 91, was appointed the first professor of sociology at Bristol University in 1965, and headed the department until his retirement in 1992.

The unit moved in 1984 to become the Centre for Research in Ethnic Relations at Warwick University. In 1978, Michael served on the Royal Commission on Bermuda, looking into the civil disorder that followed the passing of death sentences in 1977 on the men who had assassinated the governor, Sir Richard Sharples. Michael was a member of the Royal Commission on Criminal Procedure from 1978 until 1981 and also joined the United Nations committee on the elimination of racial discrimination, serving as its chairman (1996-98) and rapporteur (1990-96 and 1998-2001). The publication of his books International Action Against Racial Discrimination in 1996 and The International Politics of Race in 2002 came out of this experience. Michael was born in Birmingham, son of Francis Banton, who worked for a cement company, and his wife, Kathleen (nee Parkes). He studied at the London School of Economics and in 1950 was appointed lecturer in social anthropology at the University of Edinburgh, later promoted to reader, before moving to Bristol. His methodology was focused on interactions between individuals and the choices they make, to include or exclude others, to maximise their social advantage. His book Racial and Ethnic Competition (1983) explores this theme. Michael and I knew each other for more than 40 years as colleagues at Bristol. At our last meeting, in 2017, he was as intellectually engaged as ever. His wife, Marianne (nee Jacobson), whom he married in 1952, died in 2007, and his son Nicholas in 1994.

The shell was fired by a Sudanese poacher trying to flee back over the border with contraband meat from the Kidepo Valley national park. Loware had been tracking the fugitive - one of a band of heavily armed raiders - from the early morning with the help of a local villager. As the two pursuers approached a gully, the poacher opened fire from behind a tree trunk that had been pushed down by an elephant. One shot passed through the chest of the villager into the body of the ranger, who was returning fire. The poacher escaped, leaving the villager dead and Loware with a bullet lodged under his skin. The bone was not fractured but the wound could have been fatal. By the time the ranger reached the nearest clinic, the bullet had moved so far from the entry point that nurses were unable to find it. The sergeant had to be driven several hours further to a hospital in Kitgum , where X-rays revealed the location – four inches down his back – allowing a surgeon to cut it out before it could claim a second life. This episode on 5 February was the latest in a series of deadly clashes between Ugandan rangers – who are dedicated to protect elephants, giraffes, zebras and buffalos – and heavily armed guerrilla-turned poachers who are desperate for food and money after deserting from the Sudanese People’s Liberation army. Five months on, Loware is sitting at a broken plastic table in an empty dining room in Apoca, the rangers camp in the centre of the vast expanse of savanna that makes up the Kidepo Valley national park . His wounds have healed, but he knows the risks have not gone away. The person who shot him is still at large. Countless other desperate Sudanese are taking their AK47s and Kalashnikovs on raids across the border, where they terrorise villagers, hunt antelopes, bucks, zebra, buffalos and other animals for meat, or kill elephants and ostriches on behalf of Chinese ivory and bone-marrow smugglers. His family have begged him to return home because they are worried about his safety but he tells them that being a ranger is the best way he can provide for his seven children, as well as contributing to the local economy and the world. “They should be happy that I survived,” he says. Loware’s profession is the most perilous form of environmental defence in the world. Close to a hundred rangers have been killed every year since 2010, according to Thin Green Line, an NGO that lobbies for greater protection for nature’s frontline protectors. In the past year, most of the deaths have been in east and central Africa. For Loware, the worst previous period was 2009-11, when he was caught up in two deadly operations. In the first, two Ugandan self-defence force soldiers were killed in a joint operation with rangers against buffalo poachers armed with AK47s. On another mission, he saw his commander killed in a gun battle with Sudanese poachers near the Kidepo river. “That was a terrible time,” he recalls. “I was traumatised. I thought of quitting.” This is a familiar refrain among rangers, who often suffer from mental as well as physical strains. Their burden is huge. As in the Republic of Congo, Tanzania, Rwanda and Kenya, rangers alone cannot save Africa’s wildlife, but they do slow the slaughter. Inside the park, many villagers have been persuaded to give up illegal arms. There have been numerous confiscations of skins and ivory. Many poachers have been arrested or killed. But the porous border with Sudan remains a problem. The key, Loware believes, is better frontier management and greater education for young Sudanese. Many poachers are teenagers who have spent their lives in war zones rather than schools. They have guns but no concept of conservation. “In the north these guys have no relationship with animals. They say, we are keeping these animals for what?” he explains. By contrast, Loware says he was raised to believe in wildlife protection as a necessity and an opportunity. Conservation is often portrayed as a foreign concept, but he says indigenous people in his region practiced sustainable culling of wild animals long before the creation of the Kidepo national park in 1954. During British rule, his uncle asked for the support of police to punish those who failed to follow the rules. This led to the establishment of “game guards”, the precursors of today’s rangers. That same uncle also used to proselytise in the village, telling his family and neighbours that if they did not care for giraffes, elephants and other animals, then their children might only know them from books. Several family members took up the cause. Loware joined the Uganda Wildlife Authority Rangers in 2000. The six months of training was gruelling. Of the 60 who were recruited alongside him, he was one of only 25 who graduated. Now a sergeant, his duties include ecological monitoring, fire management, radio operation and wildlife database updating. For him, fire prevention is the most important task, but it is usually only when there is a conflict with poachers that his increasingly militarised work makes the headlines. Despite high risks and low pay (£140 per month), he plans to continue and another generation of his family could follow him into the job. He tells his seven children about his work and the importance of conservation to Uganda and the world. He says the wildlife he protects brings academics and tourists, whose funds help to build schools and clinics. There are also jobs for researchers and hotel workers. The 3,000-strong Ugandan ranger forces is set to add another 500 to its ranks this month. The perils remain. Overall Loware says the situation is no better than when he started. But he no longer thinks of quitting as he did after the death of his commander. “As of now I am comfortable because - as they say - if you run you will never run from death,” he says. “Even a man who sits at home and doesn’t work as a ranger can die in an accident or be killed by raiders. So from that time until now I decided that for the love of conservation, for the love of the rest of my colleagues and for the love of the country, let us work.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/25/birmingham-and-hyndburn-ranked-as-uk-areas-with-worst-food-hygiene","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-24T23:01:44Z","webTitle":"Birmingham and Hyndburn ranked as UK areas with worst food hygiene","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/25/birmingham-and-hyndburn-ranked-as-uk-areas-with-worst-food-hygiene","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/25/birmingham-and-hyndburn-ranked-as-uk-areas-with-worst-food-hygiene","fields":{"headline":"Birmingham and Hyndburn ranked as UK areas with worst food hygiene","bodyText":"Birmingham city council and Hyndburn borough council have been ranked as the worst areas in the UK for poor standards of hygiene in their cafes and restaurants, for the second year running, a new analysis has revealed. Consumer group Which? said the enforcement regime was buckling under “huge strain”, with under-resourced local authorities struggling to cope with soaring complaints from the public – about dirty conditions and food poisoning, for example – and facing an increase in their workload because of Brexit. Using official data collected by the Food Standards Agency (FSA), Which? analysed and ranked 390 local authorities across the UK. The benchmarks it used were the percentage of food businesses deemed to be at “high and medium risk” that were compliant with food hygiene standards; the percentage of premises opened but not visited or rated for risk; and interventions needed that had actually been carried out. Birmingham had a poor record for carrying out inspections within 28 days of a food business opening, with 16% of the city’s more than 8,000 food businesses still to be rated. In addition, 43% of Birmingham’s high and medium-risk food businesses did not meet compliance standards. The Lancashire borough of Hyndburn, where Accrington is the largest town, was the second worst area in the UK for food hygiene in 2016–17. While 98% of its businesses had been rated for risk, just two in five of its medium and high-risk food businesses met food hygiene standards, compared with 98% in Harrogate, which is about an hour away in North Yorkshire. For a second year top of the table for food hygiene was the Erewash borough council in East Derbyshire. It carried out planned interventions on all failing premises, and an 97% of its medium and high-risk establishments proved compliant with hygiene standards. “When it comes to food, British consumers expect the very best standards for themselves and their families” said Alex Neill, managing director of home products and services at Which? “But our enforcement regime is under huge strain, just as Brexit threatens to add to the responsibilities of struggling local authorities. “Effective food enforcement must be a government priority, including robust checks on imports as well as cooperation with the EU and other countries on food risks.” The Birmingham city council said it inspected the second highest number of premises and closed more than any other English local authority. Mark Croxford, the head of environmental health, said: “The quality of food businesses in Birmingham is not a measure or reflection of the council’s performance. I am surprised and disappointed to see Which? have made the same mistake as they have done in previous years, in failing to engage with local authorities to produce a meaningful report.” Hyndburn claimed that 92.5% of its food businesses were now fully complaint and it had taken “significant strides to improve food hygiene”. Responsibility for enforcing food safety falls to environmental health teams within local authorities, overseen by the FSA and Food Standards Scotland."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/25/where-is-jeremy-corbyn-rose-tinted-vision-labour-past","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-25T05:00:54Z","webTitle":"Where’s Jeremy Corbyn?

Just over a week ago, I was among the 3,000 or so people who spent an overcast Saturday in north London, at the celebration of politics and music branded Labour Live. Whatever its detractors claimed, it was a well-intentioned, creative event – but the sparse crowd and rather wearied atmosphere highlighted issues far beyond the organisers’ control. Notwithstanding the passions that occasionally coursed around the site, the day reflected the inertia that has set in on both the right and left since last year’s election – and more specifically, Labour’s current lack of energy and big ideas, which was never more evident than when Corbyn took the main stage in the early evening and delivered his big speech. It was essentially an oration I have heard many times before, in 2015, 2016 and 2017. Over an uneven, often apparently improvised half-hour with no discernible beginning, middle or end, he tumbled through homelessness, the need to “take the commodity out of education”, the mounting mental health crisis, and more. Brexit got the briefest of mentions, 20 minutes in. The tenor often sounded more despairing than optimistic. Potentially powerful lines were often mangled by verbal tics (“as a society” is a phrase that urgently needs to go). There was a lack of any real story about the current condition of Britain with the kind of coherence and emotional lift that might speak to the people who are yet to be convinced. For sure, Labour has a set of entirely justified moral convictions. Thanks chiefly to the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, it has the beginnings of an across-the-piece economic plan, and some very interesting ideas about making the country more equal from the roots up. But what the party doesn’t yet possess is an account of the last few turbulent years of British history, and any human, emotional story about what the country might look like if it gets to implement its programme. So when its big figures get to their punchlines, there are often only empty bromides. “We want to live in a world where there is decency, and above all, hope,” said Corbyn – which was very nice, but floated off into the air as soon as he had said it. The usual questions remained unanswered: What is the United Kingdom? Why should it hold together? Where has it been, and where is it going? And as well as all the despair, where are the spots of hope that point to a different kind of country? Such, perhaps, are the perils of attempting to make political headway while maintaining a stubborn reticence about the biggest change the UK has faced since the second world war. Right now, politics begins and ends with Brexit: the current Labour habit of talking about the past, present and future as if leaving the EU is a tangential subplot simply doesn’t make sense. But that is what the leadership does, having concluded that, as the government tumbles into shambles after shambles, the best thing to do is sit the whole mess out and say as little as possible. It is some achievement that many leavers think Corbyn is a remainer, while remainers are split between those who think he is secretly one of them, and those who damn him as a hardcore Brexiteer. This in turn blurs into a wider sense of paralysis and confusion – not a good look for an opposition that may go into a general election much sooner than some people think. In some alternative universe, there might be a Labour party that began making the case for single-market membership in the summer of 2016, and whose leader was the star speaker at the weekend’s People’s Vote march. But as evidenced by those irate chants of “Where’s Jeremy Corbyn?”, he and his allies resolutely believe that talk of another referendum is for the birds, and we have to leave the European Union – albeit with a secure deal, a transition period, a customs union, and maintained protections for workers’ rights and the environment. Given where Labour stands in relation to many of its own voters, that is a reasonable position. Indeed, when anti-Brexit protesters at Labour Live unfurled their “stop backing Brexit” banner during Corbyn’s speech, he should have thought on his feet, and restated it. Instead he kept stumm and some of his media outriders then tried to paint the disrupters as craven lackeys of the establishment (something proved, apparently, by the fact they have an office in Millbank Tower). Once again, what we missed was a clear, confident, consistent Labour narrative. The cleverest radicals tend to present their ideas as matters of modesty and common sense, so as to accomplish one of politics’ most overlooked imperatives: the necessity of reassurance. Beyond Brexit, that also ought to apply to large swathes of Labour policy. Whatever the factional tensions, one point needs to be made again and again: that as well as being a newly revived movement, Labour is also a political force steeped in knowledge and experience, and is successfully running all of England’s big cities. Maybe Corbyn and McDonnell are wary of comparisons with soggy European social democracy, but if their ambitious plans for regional investment banks are similar to what exists in Germany, that point ought to be made every time the policy is mentioned. If Corbyn wants to create a school system that isn’t built around incessant testing and league tables, he might point out that some of the most successful European countries offer lessons in how to do it. There are big areas of policy – defence and foreign affairs, chiefly – that the left tends to ignore, but (and I’m being somewhat diplomatic here) which still sit between Labour and the voters it will need if it’s going to win. Perhaps most importantly, the party should stop framing its policies in terms of a return to the pre-Thatcher past – 1945 and all that – and start basing what it says in the future. It ought to be Tory free-marketry that feels like yesterday’s thing. If Labour does not yet have the collective capacity or inclination to do these things, the reason is not hard to identify. Beyond the union-funded Centre for Labour and Social Studies (aka Class), the Corbynites have no supportive thinktanks. The online noise surrounding their project tends to be about either the necessity of campaigning or factional battling, so questions of strategy and ideas tend to get lost. Put another way, the foundations of the new Labour party in Twitter and Facebook mean that many of its followers have become well-versed in the art of online shouting, but less used to discussing the challenges Labour faces. A little too much attention, perhaps, is paid to “melts”, centrist dads, and not enough to the difficult questions that political parties with their eyes on power always have to face. Six weeks before Labour Live I was in Walsall, one of those large post-industrial, leave-voting towns – see also such places as Nuneaton, Derby, Mansfield and Dudley – where Labour seems to be falling behind. I watched the Tories gain council seats, and even Labour voters talked about the party in puzzled, stand-offish terms. Opinion pollsters may or may not be centrist stooges, but it also might be worth bearing in mind that a recent YouGov survey suggested that between January and May this year, there was a seven-point swing from Labour to the Tories among working-class voters. It would be easy to frame such things in terms of the message not getting through. But in parts of the country a long way from north London, Labour’s predicament might come down to something much more fundamental: what is that message in the first place? • John Harris is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"music/2018/jun/24/my-bloody-valentine-review-02-academy-birmingham","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-24T12:27:27Z","webTitle":"My Bloody Valentine review – apocalyptic aural dust storms like nothing else in rock","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jun/24/my-bloody-valentine-review-02-academy-birmingham","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/jun/24/my-bloody-valentine-review-02-academy-birmingham","fields":{"headline":"My Bloody Valentine review – apocalyptic aural dust storms like nothing else in rock","bodyText":"Kevin Shields feels obliged to inform the audience that it’s five years since My Bloody Valentine last played live. At least, that seems to be what he says: it’s hard to tell. As ever at a My Bloody Valentine gig, the vocal mics are turned down, rendering every noise that comes out of Shields’ or co-vocalist Bilinda Butcher’s mouths a murmur so indistinct that at least one aggrieved punter yells out in protest, expressing the belief that they’re not turned on at all. And as ever at a My Bloody Valentine gig, your ears are either insulated by the foam plugs handed out as you arrive, or reeling from the after-effects of the last song. If it doesn’t sound as loud as the band’s comeback gig at London’s Roundhouse in 2008, it’s still conducted at such a volume that every time Shields or Butcher strums their guitar, your clothes shake, as if caught by a gust of wind. The five years that separate this show from their last constitute a mere long weekend off by the standards of a band who once left a 22-year-gap between albums, but a rustiness is still evident at this warm-up gig. Songs fall apart, shuddering to a halt, then start again. Handily for anyone who buys into the idea of Kevin Shields as alt-rock’s mad scientist, for ever locked in an endless sonic quest no one else fully understands, he spends the gig behaving like a man locked in an endless sonic quest no one else understands – constantly changing guitars and fiddling with his amplifier and myriad pedals and effects. Shaking his head, he puts his ear against a Marshall stack at the rear of the stage as he plays, which, given the volume, is hard to watch without involuntarily wincing and sucking air through your teeth. Winningly, his fiddling continues during the famous instrumental section in closer You Made Me Realise, 10 minutes of beatless, obliterating noise that, with earplugs in, sounds like a protracted roll of thunder and with earplugs out sounds like the end of the world. You look at him and think: what the hell are you doing? Fine tuning this? For all the mistakes, when My Bloody Valentine click into gear, they sound incredible. Talk of Shields’s perfectionist genius and the mystifying washes of sound that resulted from it tends to obscure that My Bloody Valentine are a band, rather than a solo project, a fact that’s underlined live. Both drummer Colm Ó Cíosóig and bassist Debbie Googe are remarkably distinctive musicians, the former rattling out fidgety snare rolls that sound both propulsive and on the brink of collapse, the latter lunging and clawing at her guitar. It’s 30 years since some of this music was released: umpteen bands have copied it, genres – shoegaze, chillwave – have formed in its wake, and yet listening to the tumultuous heave of sound that stands in for a hook on Nothing Much to Lose, you’re struck by the sense that virtually nothing of what My Bloody Valentine inspired sounds remotely like them. Perhaps that’s because there’s something genuinely mysterious about the music they make. Examining the stage during To Here Knows When, as arcs of guitar noise consume Butcher’s voice, you realise only Shields is playing: how is he doing that? During Wonder 2, all four band members play guitars, summoning up a kind of aural dust-storm that drowns out the rhythm track entirely. It’s both enthralling and an utterly bizarre, inexplicable way for rock music to sound: it’s also like absolutely nothing else."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2018/jun/25/pro-corbyn-group-to-launch-drive-peoples-vote-on-final-brexit-deal-labour","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-25T05:00:51Z","webTitle":"Pro-Corbyn group to launch drive for public vote on Brexit deal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jun/25/pro-corbyn-group-to-launch-drive-peoples-vote-on-final-brexit-deal-labour","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jun/25/pro-corbyn-group-to-launch-drive-peoples-vote-on-final-brexit-deal-labour","fields":{"headline":"Pro-Corbyn group to launch drive for public vote on Brexit deal","bodyText":"A pro-Corbyn group is to launch its own drive for a “people’s vote” on a final Brexit deal, with the aim of persuading leftwing Labour members concerned about backing a cross-party campaign. The grassroots Labour for a People’s Vote group, which is led by several former Momentum figures, as well as trade union leaders, has the backing of more than 60 constituency Labour parties (CLPs) to try to force a vote at this year’s party conference to change Jeremy Corbyn’s Brexit policy. The group will call for Labour to oppose the government’s final Brexit deal, which the party has said it would do if the deal with the EU did not meet six tests set by the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer. The group will then campaign for the party to go further and campaign for a public vote on the deal with an option to stay in the EU should voters reject the deal. Activists from 62 local Labour parties have pledged to raise the issue in a motion at the party’s conference this September, which the group said was a major shift among the Labour grassroots members, the majority of whom are Corbyn supporters. More than 100,000 people joined the people’s vote march through central London on Saturday, supporting the campaign fronted by Labour’s Chuka Umunna, the Conservatives’ Anna Soubry, the Greens’ Caroline Lucas and the Liberal Democrat leader, Vince Cable. Corbyn did not attend the march and Labour’s position on Brexit was subject tocritical chants from the crowd, who sang: “Where’s Jeremy Corbyn?” Labour activists involved in the parallel drive for a people’s vote on the final deal believe in the need for leftwingers to have their own campaign, which does not disparage Corbyn. “It is essential that there is clear red water between the mainstream centrist remain campaigns and any serious attempt to get Labour to strengthen its Brexit position,” a source close to the campaign said. “Labour members are overwhelmingly on the left, and will never be won over by centrist MPs or a cross-party alliance that includes Tories. Ultimately they have different aims. This is about making sure that a Corbyn government can succeed.” The group’s launch statement has been signed by the general secretary of the TSSA union, Manuel Cortes, the economist Ann Pettifor, the former Momentum steering group member Michael Chessum and the former CWU general secretary Billy Hayes. The statement says a Norway-style deal in which the UK becomes a member of the European Economic Area is “untenable” and instead argues for a full reversal, saying the effects of Brexit would make much worse the prospects that would face a socialist Labour government. “We are therefore coming together to urge the movement of which we are a part to oppose the Tories’ destructive Brexit and unite the country behind a radical and hopeful vision for the future,” it says. Paul Hilder, a Momentum member who ran to be Labour’s general secretary this year, said: “The overwhelming majority of Labour members are both supporters of Jeremy Corbyn and opponents of Tory Brexit, but until now, we have been shut out of the debate. This is too important to be left to a handful of anti-Corbyn centrists whose motives are in question and who cannot even win a vote in Westminster.” Pettifor, an advisor to the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said: “Only an alliance of a left-led Labour party with socialists and progressive partners across the continent can challenge the dominant Anglo-American economic model of globalisation that is causing such harm in Britain and across the world.” Cortes said the Conservatives were offering “a kamikaze Brexit”, adding that there was “nothing in Brexit for working people”. The CLPs that have submitted the motion for debate at conference include Corbyn’s Islington North CLP. Local member Valerie Bossman-Quarshie, who submitted the motion, said she had rejoined the party because of Corbyn, but urged him to back a second referendum. “As long as the Tories are in government this is the only way to stop their Brexit deal doing more harm to ordinary people’s lives,” she said. Momentum has thus far given its full backing to Corbyn’s Brexit policy but may be forced to hold its own vote on its position after a petition organised by an activist, Alena Ivanova. The petition has so far half the 4,000 signatures needed to trigger a poll of members on “whether to oppose Tory Brexit, and whether to campaign for Labour to hold a vote at its annual conference in September on giving the people the final say on the Brexit deal”. • This article was amended on 25 June 2018 because Chuka Umunna did not attend the march, as an earlier version suggested."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jul/03/matteo-salvini-backed-by-politician-with-links-to-mafia","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-07-03T11:30:49Z","webTitle":"Matteo Salvini backed by politician 'with links to mafia'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/03/matteo-salvini-backed-by-politician-with-links-to-mafia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jul/03/matteo-salvini-backed-by-politician-with-links-to-mafia","fields":{"headline":"Matteo Salvini backed by politician 'with links to mafia'","bodyText":"Matteo Salvini’s electoral victory in the southern region of Calabria during the Italian general election this year was supported by a former politician who law enforcement authorities have claimed has close ties to the ‘Ndrangheta, the criminal organisation that controls most of the cocaine trade in Europe. The far-right interior minister and head of the League party, who has emerged as a de facto prime minister, won his senate seat in the region with the backing of a former mayor of Reggio Calabria, Giuseppe Scopelliti, with whom Salvini had a political alliance and who was arrested weeks after the March poll for forging documents while he was mayor. In a previous mafia case in which he was not charged, Scopelliti was described in court documents as being “sponsored” by one of the ruling clans of the ‘Ndrangheta. Prosecutors also alleged in records seen by the Guardian that the most powerful criminal clans in the area played a “crucial role” in Scopelliti’s political career. There is no suggestions that Salvini has any direct ties to the criminal organisation. But the Guardian has examined Salvini’s ties to individuals who are alleged to have close links to the ‘Ndrangheta, because of the interior minister’s role overseeing law enforcement and domestic security. The claims come as Salvini attempted on Tuesday to demonstrate his anti-Mafia priorities by diving into a swimming pool at a Tuscan villa that was confiscated from a mobster. The minister then swam a lap in the pool. The villa was seized from a mafia boss in 2007 after 24 years of legal procedures and turned into a resort. Salvini has also engaged in a public dispute with one of Italy’s most outspoken anti-mafia campaigners, the writer Roberto Saviano, who is a Guardian contributor. Last week Salvini threatened to remove Saviano’s police protection, even though Saviano has been under threat from the Camorra since he published Gomorrah, his breakthrough book about the mafia in Naples, in 2006. Giovanni Tizian, a Calabrian journalist for L’Espresso who has lived under police protection since 2011 after being threatened by the ‘Ndrangheta, told the Guardian that Salvini’s electoral gains in Calabria – from having virtually no support five years ago to winning office – “relied on the support of men with a troubled past and a dark political history”. “The priority was getting as many votes as he could. In this sense, Scopelliti represented a fortune for Salvini. It didn’t matter that Scopelliti was [previously] elected with the support of the clans, as investigations have revealed. Scopelliti was popular and could count on thousands of supporters,” Tizian said. A spokeswoman for Salvini declined to comment. Scopelliti became an important person in Salvini’s political orbit last December, when – before his arrest a few months later – the former mayor declared at a political rally that he would support Salvini and that “side by side” he would build a future with the far-right leader. Even though he had not then been charged with any crimes, Scopelliti was already known for alleged ties to organised crime. Scopelliti’s house was raided by prosecutors in 2016 following an investigation that revealed the existence of a so-called cupola, a secret association of ‘Ndrangheta godfathers and politicians who made decisions in Calabria and helped influence people’s votes. According to investigators in the carabinieri, the military police who led the operation, Scopelliti’s own involvement in politics had been the result of “the decisions of the mafia’s business interests”. One month after Scopelliti announced his support, Salvini – a native of Milan – took advantage of a feature of Italy’s new electoral law and decided to run for parliament in Calabria, despite his northern roots. It was seen at the time as part of his strategy to try to make gains in southern Italy, despite the League’s long track record as a northern secessionist party. It was a bold move. In 2013, the year Salvini took control of the League, his party won just four votes in Rosarno, the town that is also a major stronghold of the ‘Ndrangheta. He had reason to be cautious. In 2017, 12 local governments in the region of Calabria were dissolved because of mafia infiltration. Shortly after he decided to run in Calabria, Salvini agreed an official alliance with Scopelliti’s political party, the Movimento Nazionale per la Sovranità. Against the odds, given his party’s history, Salvini was elected in Calabria in the 4 March election. He now officially serves as a senator representing Calabria, having won about 49,797 votes there. The Five Star Movement, the populist party, won the region overall as part of its sweep of southern Italy. On 17 March, Salvini attended a rally in Rosarno to celebrate the victory. According to La Repubblica, the rally in Rosarno was attended by key members of the ‘Ndrangheta’s clans, including members of the Bellocco clan, one of the most powerful mafia crime families in Calabria. One month later, Scopelliti was arrested and convicted for forging official documents while he was mayor. He is now serving a prison sentence of nearly five years. Scopelliti has denied having any connections to organised crime. There is no evidence that Salvini and Scopelliti had a close personal relationship. The League’s relationship with Scopelliti was reportedly managed by the party’s regional coordinator in Calabria, Domenico Furgiuele, whose father-in-law, a hotel developer, was previously convicted of mafia-related crimes. Furgiuele has also faced police scrutiny. In 2012, records show, he asked his father-in-law to reserve rooms in his hotel for two men who, it later emerged, had committed a mafia-related murder in Vibo Valentia. He was never charged with wrongdoing but was questioned by police, according to La Repubblica. “I had no idea they killed a man. I’m a victim of a misunderstanding. A man asked me a favour, if I had space in the hotel for two of his friends. I didn’t know them,” he told La Repubblica. When asked about links between the League and the ‘Ndrangheta, Salvini told reporters that he was only interested in the campaigns against the mafia. Since he became interior minister, Salvini has said fighting the mafia is one of his priorities. But he has also made two policy proposals that could benefit individuals involved in organised crime: eliminating a limit on all-cash transactions, which helps to curb money laundering and tax evasion, and a broad amnesty of individuals who are being investigated for tax fraud – under a certain limit – as part of a plan for “fiscal peace”. The Five Star movement quashed the plan."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/jun/25/mental-health-services-young-nhs-silent-catastrophe-survey-chronic-underfunding","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-24T23:01:45Z","webTitle":"Mental health services for the young is NHS's 'silent catastrophe'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/25/mental-health-services-young-nhs-silent-catastrophe-survey-chronic-underfunding","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/jun/25/mental-health-services-young-nhs-silent-catastrophe-survey-chronic-underfunding","fields":{"headline":"Mental health services for the young is NHS's 'silent catastrophe'","bodyText":"Failings in treatment of children and young people with mental health problems is a “silent catastrophe” within the NHS and is due to chronic underfunding and serious structural issues, a report by the Association of Child Psychotherapists (ACP) claims. The report, which exposes a “serious and worsening crisis” for the health service through a survey of those working in child and adolescent mental health services (Camhs), says trusts are being hollowed out and specialist services are disappearing owing to underfunding and the transformation and redesign of services in recent years. The results are rising levels of suicide, self-referral to A&amp;E departments and pressure on in-patient units, it says. The number of children and adolescents failing to receive the right treatment or “fully slipping through the cracks” is on the rise, the report says. But Camhs funding is only part of the problem, with specialist services moving “towards something of much less quality and rigour”, it adds. The survey of 416 frontline NHS child and adolescent child psychotherapists found the worst affected patients were those with the most severe and long-standing needs. Specialist services are disappearing, and senior clinical roles and disciplines are being dismantled, leading to pressure on lower-banded staff, the report says. Treatment is focused on symptoms rather than the whole child or young person in context, it continues. Children and young people are left to “get worse before being seen” and there is an “increasing mismatch between need and treatment offered”. Competitive tendering has led to “unrealistic and under-funded service models” and left services fragmented and staff isolated, it says. The failings have led to high staff turnover, poor morale and poor working conditions. One child psychotherapist, who wished to remain anonymous, said: “I am considering leaving the NHS as I am worried it is no longer safe to practise. “It is tragic to witness the demise of a once-flourishing and truly multi-disciplinary specialist Camhs. My skills are going to waste. “Once the service was taken over by a new trust, the service was redesigned and now does not meet the needs of a large section of the population who have significant mental health needs. There is no time for proper assessments and treatment. “Specialist treatment for the most vulnerable children offered by child psychotherapists and others survives despite, not because, of service design.” The ACP said it wanted to shift debate from recognition there was a crisis in Camhs to an understanding of the factors and forces ”behind our collective failure to respond to it”. This year, the NHs watchdog the Care Quality Commission rated 39% (26 services) of specialist Camhs as requiring improvement. Those surveyed by the ACP were asked whether they could see any evidence of the government’s claim of making “one of the biggest expansion of services in Europe” – 93 % of respondents said they saw no evidence of this. Dr Nick Waggett, the chief executive of the ACP, said the report showed the lack of funding, and the loss of clinical expertise and leadership in the recent redesigns of the service could lead to patients not being offered the effective and timely assessment and treatment they required. Dr Marc Bush, the head of policy at the charity YoungMinds, said: “Every day we get calls to our helpline from parents whose children have been waiting months for an appointment with Camhs, or who have been turned down because the thresholds for treatment are so high. The system is overstretched and disjointed, with a devastating impact on thousands of families across the country.” He added that there was a need for increased spending and greater recognition of specialist roles. The survey of frontline NHS Camhs staff suggests a deterioration of specialist services: • 61% of respondents said the main NHS service they work in was facing downsizing • 72% said the threshold for access to services has increased in the past five years • 33% described services as mostly inadequate or completely inadequate • 73% reported a down-banding (pdf) of specialist clinical posts • 64% reported negative changes in the number of practitioner posts • 62% in sessions per client • 65% in the frequency of sessions • 73% said they felt there had been a negative change in staff morale."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/25/mikel-john-obi-lionel-messi-nigeria-argentina-world-cup","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-25T09:02:51Z","webTitle":"Mikel aiming to turn tables 13 years after Messi took his Golden Ball","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/25/mikel-john-obi-lionel-messi-nigeria-argentina-world-cup","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/25/mikel-john-obi-lionel-messi-nigeria-argentina-world-cup","fields":{"headline":"Mikel aiming to turn tables 13 years after Messi took his Golden Ball","bodyText":"Mikel John Obi smiles. “Yeah, Messi stole the Golden Ball off me,” the Nigeria captain says, and he remembers how it happened as if it were yesterday. The story comes from the World Youth Championship of 2005, when Mikel drove Nigeria to the final, where they faced a Lionel Messi-inspired Argentina. “Before the game people said that I was going to win the Golden Ball for being the player of the tournament,” Mikel says. “But then Messi scored twice, both of them penalties, Argentina won 2-1 and I got the Silver Ball. Messi has kept on stealing awards from me!” Cue more laughter. The serious point is that Messi has been messing with Nigeria and Mikel for too long. Indeed, Argentina have held an Indian sign over Nigeria at World Cups going back to 1994, when the African nation first qualified. Nigeria are contesting their sixth World Cup and it is a remarkable detail that they have been drawn to face Argentina at the group stage in all but one of them. In 1994 they lost 2-1 to a pair of Claudio Caniggia goals in a game that saw the biggest bang come afterwards, when Diego Maradona failed a drugs test, was sent home and banned. He would never play for Argentina again. Nigeria suffered 1-0 defeats in 2002 and 2010, on the back of goals from Gabriel Batistuta and Gabriel Heinze respectively, and in 2014 they lost 3-2. Mikel played in that game, having missed 2010 through injury, and so did Messi, who scored twice. Messi had also played in 2010 and he was a star of the Argentina team that won gold at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, when they beat Nigeria in the final, with Ángel Di María scoring the only goal. Nigeria can point to the 1996 Atlanta Games, when they beat Argentina 3-2 in the final. That team were from the golden age of Nigerian football and featured Kanu, Jay-Jay Okocha and Sunday Oliseh, among others. Emmanuel Amunike scored a stoppage-time winner. The triumph is fondly remembered but, in terms of tournament successes against Argentina, it stands in glorious isolation. Mikel and his teammates are determined to break the World Cup jinx when they take on Argentina in Tuesday’s Group D finale in St Petersburg and it has the ingredients of the most decisive meeting between the countries yet. Nigeria know that after the 2-0 win over Iceland, another victory would ensure qualification to the last 16 while a draw would be enough as long as Iceland do not beat Croatia by a couple of goals. Even then Nigeria could go through on goals scored. For Argentina, the equation is simple. Only a win would keep their hopes alive. The subplots are numerous and mouthwatering and yet Messi, inevitably, feels like the central figure. His travails against Iceland and the horror-show loss to Croatia have been well-documented but Mikel knows better than to view him as anything other than the player he and his teammates must stop. Nigeria beat Argentina 4-2 in a Krasnodar friendly last November and they draw a measure of strength from the result. But it was significant that Mikel highlighted how Messi had not featured on that occasion. “A certain human being wasn’t playing,” Mikel says. “Actually, is he even a human being? Messi is Messi. He decides games and the last time we met he scored two against us at the Brazil World Cup. Without him, they are definitely less of a team. We can’t put all our attention on Messi but he is the man that we need to stop. Do we have to put somebody to mark him? Maybe yes, maybe no because when you do that you are playing with less balance.” Nigeria played with great balance and purpose against Iceland, when Ahmed Musa scored both of the goals, after the manager, Gernot Rohr, made a tactical change. He abandoned his usual 4-2-3-1 formation and went with 3-5-2. Mikel, who made his name as a defensive midfielder over 10 and a half seasons at Chelsea and plays for Tianjin Teda in China, has typically operated as a No 10 at international level. It was where he played in the opening group tie against Croatia, which Nigeria lost 2-0. “I was playing as a No 10 before I went to Chelsea but [José] Mourinho converted me to a holding player,” Mikel says. “I enjoy it. When I was at Chelsea and there was a national team break, I’d go there and I’d enjoy it. I’d have this one or two weeks of freedom – to express myself and play the way I want. But at Chelsea, I did a job.” Mikel did likewise against Iceland. Rohr started him in the central holding role, although he and the midfielders either side of him – Oghenekaro Etebo and the impressive Wilfred Ndidi – did get up and down the pitch. Rohr will weigh up whether to continue with the approach against Argentina. And so here Nigeria are once again, confronted by the opponent that has become their nemesis. “We knew we would get them,” Mikel says. “I said to a friend of mine: ‘Trust me, Argentina are going to be in the same group as us.’ It’s crazy. I don’t know why but it keeps happening.” Mikel and Nigeria crave a different ending."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/25/socceroos-time-of-transition-sees-baton-pass-from-cahill-to-arzani","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-24T18:00:37Z","webTitle":"Socceroos' time of transition sees baton pass from Cahill to Arzani | John Davidson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/25/socceroos-time-of-transition-sees-baton-pass-from-cahill-to-arzani","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/25/socceroos-time-of-transition-sees-baton-pass-from-cahill-to-arzani","fields":{"headline":"Socceroos' time of transition sees baton pass from Cahill to Arzani","bodyText":"“Bert draws a blank,” the Courier-Mail’s back page screamed after Australia’s 1-1 draw with Denmark. “Golden opportunity goes begging as Socceroos coach leaves our greatest goal-scorer sitting on the bench,” went the standfirst. But the Queensland tabloid wasn’t the only one unhappy as Tim Cahill received zero minutes in Australia’s two World Cup matches to date. The Daily Telegraph’s sports editor-at-large accused head coach Bert van Marwijk of disrespecting Cahill by leaving him out. Former Socceroos Robbie Slater and Mark Bosnich also chipped in. Slater, a Fox Sports football pundit, described it as “a national outrage,” while fellow commentator Bosnich tweeted that “questions must be asked of the manager as to why Tim Cahill was not used with 10-15 minutes to go”. The bleating and complaining about the non-use of Cahill in Australia has been immense. On the one hand, it’s completely expected. The striker is Australia’s greatest-ever goal-scorer with 50 goals in 106 matches. He’s saved the Socceroos’ bacon more times than Jesus performed miracles in Galilee – off the bench against Japan in the 2006 World Cup, scoring crucial goals to qualify Australia for tournaments in 2010, 2014 and 2018 and banging in one against Serbia eight years ago just to name a few. His place in Australian sporting history is already assured. On the other hand, the melodrama over Cahill’s absence is completely overblown. The forward is 38 years old, turning 39 in less than seven months. His best days are clearly behind him. He is five years older than skipper Mile Jedinak and six years older than Mark Milligan, the other two veterans of the squad. Unlike Jedinak and Milligan, Cahill has barely played club football in the past year. He has played 16 first-team games since October, for Melbourne City in the A-League and Millwall in the English Championship, and not started any of them. As a substitute his sum total of goals is zero. His total time on the pitch in the past season? A mere 157 minutes. That’s less than two full games. Warren Joyce didn’t rate him enough to give him regular game-time and neither did Cahill’s close friend and former teammate, Neil Harris. Why would Van Marwijk be any different? The speculation is that FFA pushed Van Marwijk to take the veteran to Russia for commercial reasons. True or not, Cahill does not suit the Dutch coach’s counter-attacking, defensive-minded game-plan. The quicker and more mobile Andrew Nabbout, who can press and harry defenders does, hence his starts against France and Denmark. To accuse Van Marwijk, a man who has coached at the elite level of European football for more than two decades, and who led the Netherlands to the 2010 World Cup final, of footballing ignorance is absurd. The 66-year-old knows what his team wants and needs, and won’t be swayed by hysteria or nostalgia. Cahill certainly does have some value as a leader, as a big-brother influence and as someone who can help advise and assist younger teammates. And on evidence in Russia he has done just that without complaint. Football is a young man’s game – you only need to look at the likes of Kylian Mbappé at this World Cup or Pelé, Michael Owen and Lionel Messi at previous tournaments – as evidence. And the youngest player amongst all 32 nations in Russia is Daniel Arzani. In just two matches this Khorramabad-born wing-wonder, an Iranian migrant who grew up in Sydney’s eastern suburbs, has delighted not only Australia’s footballing community but caught the eye of the world. Many are clamouring for the 19-year-old to receive more minutes and even start in the Socceroos’ must-win game against Peru in Sochi. Considering Arzani has played just 24 first-team games in his whole life, all in the A-League and only four times lasted the full 90 minutes, that may be a bridge too far. Still, his rise is nothing short of remarkable. Against Denmark he almost scored, set up two excellent chances for teammates and skinned Pione Sisto in just a 22-minute cameo. Already European clubs are lining up to lure Arzani overseas. PSV Eindhoven, Juventus and Bayer Leverkusen have all been linked with the forward. Arzani is under contract with Melbourne City, who are owned by Manchester City for another season. As a result, Manchester may do a similar deal with Arzani as they did with Aaron Mooy by loaning him out and then cashing in on the prodigious youngster. Whatever happens after the World Cup, the attacker’s future is exceedingly bright. Fast, skilful, confident but humble, some believe Arzani has potential to be better than former Australian golden boy Harry Kewell. Ironically, Cahill has been one of Arzani’s biggest fans. The 38-year-old took the playmaker under his wing in the past two seasons while at Melbourne City and has undertaken the same role in Russia. He also admits he has never had the natural abilities the 19-year-old possesses. Talking about his mentoring role with the current Socceroos squad last week, Cahill said: “I didn’t have [Arzani’s] explosive talent, but what I had was hard work. So how now do I fuse hard work and discipline into his life? I give him no choice.” Like it nor not, the transition is taking place from master to apprentice. Cahill may or may not see game-time against Peru. But the World Cup has shown that Arzani is the future of Australian football and potentially the one player than can decide the Socceroos’ on-field fortunes in Russia and beyond. The baton has been passed and everyone else needs to accept it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jun/23/nauru-asylum-seekers-flown-to-taiwan-for-medical-care-complain-of-language-barriers","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-23T04:30:27Z","webTitle":"Nauru asylum seekers flown to Taiwan for medical care complain of language barriers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jun/23/nauru-asylum-seekers-flown-to-taiwan-for-medical-care-complain-of-language-barriers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jun/23/nauru-asylum-seekers-flown-to-taiwan-for-medical-care-complain-of-language-barriers","fields":{"headline":"Nauru asylum seekers flown to Taiwan for medical care complain of language barriers","bodyText":"Asylum seekers flown from Nauru to Taiwan for medical treatment have complained to lawyers that language barriers meant they were unable to give informed consent even when the overall quality of care was good. Australia signed a memorandum of understanding with Taiwan in 2017 to provide medical treatment for asylum seekers detained on Nauru, in an effort to prevent people indefinitely detained on the island from applying for a medical transfer to Australia. The agreement was disclosed by a Taiwan representative in a letter to the Guardian last month, following a report about an Iranian woman and her son who were transferred to Taiwan so she could undertake life-saving heart surgery, and confirmed by the Australian government overnight. The woman, Fatemah, had told the Guardian her 17-year-old son also required medical treatment for severe mental illness caused by his time in detention but did not receive treatment before the pair were returned to Nauru. Taiwan authorities said he was not listed as a patient on the medical transfer form. Taiwan is also not a signatory to the 1951 Refugee Convention, meaning refugees cannot apply for asylum to prevent them from being returned to Nauru. The human rights lawyer George Newhouse, from the National Justice Project, said that while the Taiwan medical system was of world standard, language barriers between detainees and medical staff, which often required the use of two interpreters, meant some asylum seekers felt they had not been able to give informed consent. The federal court ruled this month that hospitals in Taiwan also did not have the expertise to perform an abortion on a woman held on Nauru who had undergone female genital mutilation, and ordered that she be brought to Australia for treatment at one of two specialist clinics at the Royal Women’s hospital in Melbourne or at Sydney’s Westmead hospital. “They are not equipped to deal with mental health issues, cases where female genital mutilation is involved, and the language difficulties make obtaining informed consent extremely difficult,” Newhouse told Guardian Australia. “Many asylum seekers complain that they didn’t understand the procedures that are to take place and are frightened of what might happen to them. There’s also no proper medical follow-up when they return to Manus and Nauru.” At least 330 refugees and asylum seekers, including 36 children, remain in detention on Nauru and have been told by the Australian government that they will not have any future opportunity of settling in Australia or New Zealand. Australia has previously allowed seriously ill detainees to be brought to the country for medical treatment, often after being forced to do so by a court order. Newhouse said the agreement with Taiwan aimed to circumvent that process. “The primary objective is to avoid bringing the asylum seekers to Australia at all costs, even if it results in harm to the individual,” he said. A spokeswoman for the department of home affairs said the agreement was part of the Turnbull government’s commitment that asylum seekers held in offshore detention would not gain entry to Australia. “The government has been clear that people subject to regional processing arrangements will not be settled in Australia,” she said. “Medical transfer is not a pathway to settlement in Australia.” The department said Taiwan had a global reputation for high quality medical care and was consistently ranked as having some of the best hospitals and medical technology in the world."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/live/2018/jun/23/germany-v-sweden-world-cup-2018-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-24T00:12:38Z","webTitle":"World Cup 2018: Germany 2-1 Sweden – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2018/jun/23/germany-v-sweden-world-cup-2018-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2018/jun/23/germany-v-sweden-world-cup-2018-live","fields":{"headline":"World Cup 2018: Germany 2-1 Sweden – as it happened","bodyText":"That’s all from me tonight. That was a cracking game. Germany flirted with disaster and then produced one of the all-time great moments to win the game thanks to Toni Kroos’s last-minute free-kick. The champions are still alive. Sweden will be kicking themselves, but it’s all to play for in Group F! Thanks for reading and emailing. Bye! Here’s David Hytner’s match report from Sochi. The situation in Group F is that no one has qualified yet. Mexico are top with six points. Germany and Sweden, level on three points, both have a goal difference of zero. South Korea, beaten in their first two games, could somehow sneak through if they beat Germany. Germany, Mexico and Sweden could also all end up on six points. “Incredible game that turned on two substitutions,” Oyvind Roed says. “Durmaz, who has anything but a cool head, in for Claeson and the very brave change from Löw of Brandt in for Hector. I can only applaud the Germans for their ambition with 10 men.” Jerome Boateng will be suspended for Germany’s game against South Korea. Probably for the best. There were some ugly scenes on the touchline at the end. Sweden’s manager, Janne Andersson, was particularly furious. It’s not clear what happened. For drama, that game will take some beating. The quality wasn’t as high as Spain v Portugal. The drama, though. “Horrendously unnecessary free kick to concede there,” Richard South says. “The lad has a fine beard and all, but it’s not been an impressive cameo appearance off the bench by a long shot.” Sweden players collapse to the floor. They can’t believe it. They were so close. Then they gave away a foolish free-kick in the 95th minute and Toni Kroos came up with a moment of incredible genius to rescue 10-man Germany, who were edging so close to their first first-round exit since 1938! Will that be a turning point for the holders? They were pretty poor for much of this game but now they know a win against South Korea on Wednesday will probably be enough for them to reach the second round. How far they’re going in this tournament remains to be seen. But hey, never write off the Germans. My word! 90 min+7: It’s still not over. Can Sweden equalise? Their fans are stunned. 90 min+6: I suppose that’s why they’re world champions. The free-kick was on the left of the Sweden area. It was surely too far wide for a shot. Think again. Kroos rolled the ball to Reus, who killed it dead. Kroos ran on to it and whipped a stupendous shot high into the far corner with his right foot! That is astonishing! What technique! What timing! Olsen was grasping at thin air and Germany have got themselves out of jail! THIS IS INCREDIBLE FROM TONI KROOS. 90 min+5: Werner charges past Durmaz, who brings him down on the edge of the area over on the left! Germany have one last chance! Kroos is standing over the ball! And... 90 min+3: Germany have two minutes. Remember, a draw doesn’t send them out, but it leaves them needing a favour from Mexico on Wednesday. 90 min+2: Werner wins another corner on the left. They take it short. Gundogan, on the edge of the area, rolls a pass to Brandt. The ball bounces and the winger, who hit the woodwork against Mexico, lets rip from 20 yards with his left foot! This one flies past Olsen - and hits the right post! Incredible! The ball bounces back to Werner, who’s offside as he turns it over. What drama! 90 min+1: Germany really need a goal. But they can’t leave themselves exposed at the back. Sweden, who haven’t beaten Germany since 1978, can put them out with a second goal. 90 min: Sweden make their third change, Isaac Thelin replacing Markus Berg, who takes a long time walking off. Eventually the free-kick can be taken. Olsen punches clear. There will be five added minutes. 89 min: A reminder that Germany have never failed to win their first two group games before. But they’re still plugging away, even though they’re down to 10 men, and they have a free-kick on the left after good play from Brandt. 88 min: Germany keep pressing, against all the odds. Kroos dribbles down the left and chips a cross into the middle. Gomez has the beating of his marker and he powers a header goalwards, only for Olsen to spring back and turn the ball over! What a save! 87 min: Germany make their final change, Julian Brandt replacing Jonas Hector. Ten-man Germany have two defenders on the pitch. 85 min: The ITV commentator has said that the referee was waiting for Berg to get back to his feet before showing Boateng a second yellow. Over to Roy Keane and Gary Neville for more... 83 min: From the resulting free-kick, Neuer has to punch behind under pressure. Germany deal with the resulting corner. It’s not clear how the referee reached the decision to show Boateng a second yellow but it’s hard to argue with him. It was a poor tackle from Boateng, who went through the back of Berg. The question is whether he was told to act by the VAR. 82 min: Boateng, already on a booking, chopped down Berg in the middle of Germany’s half. For a while it seems that nothing’s going to happen. Then the Polish referee suddenly decides to show Boateng a second yellow card! Germany are down to 10 men! 81 min: Kimmich pings a cross into the middle and Werner slashes over from 15 yards! What a chance. Germany are running out of time. 78 min: Sweden make their second change, John Guidetti replacing Ola Toivonen, the goalscorer. 77 min: This result will suit Sweden. It would leave them on four points, three ahead of Germany, and mean they would progress with a draw against Mexico, who are already through. 76 min: Larsson’s corner is headed away as far as Forsberg, who sees his volley from 20 yards saved by Neuer. 75 min: Durmaz makes his first contribution, winning a corner for Sweden. 74 min: Sweden make their first change, Jimmy Durmaz replacing Claesson. Here, given that Germany’s best method of attack has been Timo Werner running down the left in the second, you ... wonder ... if ... there ... might ... have ... been ... a ... place ... for ... Leroy ... Sane. 73 min: Your humble MBMer is not happy with THE LACK OF REPLAYS WHAT ARE THESE CLOWNS THINKING tonight. 72 min: Out of nothing, Werner suddenly breaks down the left. He reaches the byline and turns the ball into the middle. Olsen has to react smartly to prevent Granqvist turning the ball into his own goal! 71 min: Boateng’s booked for tripping Forsberg. 70 min: Sweden should think about making a change. They’re looking tired. 68 min: Boateng hoists a ball into the middle. Gomez prods over from close range. The flag’s up offside, although he might have been on. Gomez seemed to take his eye off the ball. 66 min: This is relentless. Kimmich whacks a cross into the middle. Gomez touches it on and Olsen parries it out. He’s fortunate the loose ball doesn’t come to a Germany attacker. 65 min: Kroos has another dig. A deflection takes his 25-yarder over for a corner. Sweden haven’t had an attack in the second half. 63 min: Kroos dummies on the edge of the area to create space for a shot. But his scuffed effort isn’t troubling anyone. 61 min: Germany carefully piece an attack together. Kimmich zaps a low ball into the middle and Reus tries to Kanu it in, only to miss the ball completely. Sweden survive. For how much longer? 59 min: This is being played like a knockout game. It’s end-to-end, with Germany playing with much more vim and intensity. They don’t have much control but there is a sense they have the quality to create and take a big chance. 56 min: Werner, who looks so much better on the left, runs at Sweden again and jabs a cross into the middle. Hector collects and shoots from 12 yards, but Olsen dives down to his left to save. 55 min: A lull. 52 min: This is frantic. Ekdal picks up a booking for scything down Muller. 51 min: Kroos whips the free-kick to the near post and Muller heads just wide. 49 min: Germany are up for this now! Kroos pops up on the edge of the area and sees his deflected shot spin just wide. Sweden are panicking. moments later Claesson has to cut out a cross that was destined for Gomez. Then Lindelof concedes a free-kick in a dangerous position on the right. They’re playing like world champions now. Werner runs at Sweden on the left and drives to the byline. He pulls a cross into the six-yard box. Gomez can’t make anything of it but it spins off him, allowing Reus to chargs in ahead of Augustinsson and knee the ball past Olsen! Germany have a lifeline! That didn’t take long! Germany are level! 47 min: Germany look like they’re playing 4-4-2. They are England. 46 min: Off we go again. If it stays like this, Mexico and Sweden will be through to the second round and Germany and South Korea will be out. Mario Gomez has replaced Julian Draxler, who is so disappointing, and joined Timo Werner up front. “What’s got into Die Mannschaft at this World Cup?” Joseph Lam says. “They’re uncharacteristically shaky at the back, today perhaps even more so than against Mexico. I get that today they may be missing the presence of the mighty Mats Hummels, but still, Boateng and Rudiger have been immense all season. And reports of a dressing room rift are distinctly un-German. Right now, teams are doing to Joshua Kimmich as Kimmich did to Marcelo in that Real-Bayern tie this season. Like Real, Germany might need a defensive blunder/goalkeeper howler to get back in this one. Mind you, we’ve seen plenty of those this World Cup so far...” Mario Gomez is coming on for Germany. Jerome Boateng has taken a pasting during the half-time analysis on ITV. “Boateng’s walking around like he’s playing Sunday football ,” Roy Keane spits. “He’s been a disgrace. Get him off.” Gary Neville chips in. “Roy is absolutely right, the centre-backs have been a joke. Boateng thinks he’s Beckenbauer. He thinks he’s a player. He’s played under Pep and thinks he’s a fantastic football player. He has been a joke in this first half. He has delusions of grandeur. He’s wandering forward, ambling in the game.” Germany are 45 minutes from first-round elimination from the World Cup for the first time since 1938. Sweden deservedly lead thanks to Ola Toivonen’s smart goal and the holders will be out if they can’t find an equaliser in the second half. That doesn’t look a likely prospect at the moment - Germany have been poor all over the pitch and Sweden have been comfortable since recovering from a nervous start. 45 min+2: A free-kick to Sweden on the right. Larsson whips it in and Berg glances a header towards the far corner, only for Neuer to turn it aside! What a huge moment that could turn out to be if Germany turn this around! 45 min: Boateng’s shot fizzes wide from 20 yards. There will be two added minutes. 44 min: Sweden break down the left, Forsberg leading the charge, Germany all over the place. Forsberg bends a splendid ball into the middle with the outside of his right foot. Toivonen can’t collect it but the ball runs through to Claesson on the right. He should shoot, but he tries to cut inside and loses the chance. What a let-off for Germany - but they were pierced with incredible ease yet again. 43 min: Kimmich crosses, Draxler pushes Lustig. The Germany players don’t look happy at all. 42 min: Reus hammers a cross into the area. It hits Werner, reminding us of his existence, and Sweden clear. “How will they blame Ozil for this?” Gene Salorio says. 39 min: Gundogan lets fly from 25 yards. The shot’s deflected and Olsen has to show magnificent reflexes to adjust his body and dive to his right to push the ball out! Muller hurtles on to the loose ball. Lustig turns the ball on to the forward and Olsen springs up to turn the ball wide for a corner! 38 min: “The first thing the winner of this World Cup should do is to change the manager in preparation of the next World Cup,” Gokul Kannan says. “Possibly a few players too. The stats cannot be more clear and obvious.” 36 min: Kimmich’s cross drifts out of play. Germany look stunned. The Swedish fans are bouncing. “A nationalmannschaffting,” Matt Dony parps. 35 min: If it stays like this, Germany are out of the World Cup. That goal hadn’t exactly been coming, but Sweden were growing in confidence and Germany’s attacking threat had rather fizzled out. They don’t look convincing at all. Can they shake their heads clear? This is a fine goal from the Sunderland legend. Germany lose possession again in midfield, Kroos the guilty party, and Sweden attack down the right. Claesson looks up and sees Toivonen in the middle. He picks him out with a lovely cross that cuts out Toivonen, who’s peeled between two Germany defenders. The striker takes the ball on his chest and then lobs it superbly over the onrushing Manuel Neuer with his right foot, perhaps via a slight touch off the covering Rudiger! That is a stunning, impudent finish and Germany are in major bother now! Toni Kroos covers his face with his hand. Manuel Neuer bellows at his team-mates. Can the world champions respond? Oh my! 31 min: Ilkay Gundogan replaces Sebastian Rudy, who remains topless. “It’s the referee’s decision whether or not to heed any VAR advice, and this ref doesn’t seem overly enamoured (going by his previous match too),” says Rob Marriott. “Everyone manning the VAR is also a referee, and almost all referees have spent their entire careers not penalising pulling/pushing in the box, so why are they going to change now? VAR is just making it more obvious that a blind eye is being turned.” 30 min: It seems that Germany are going to remove Rudy. Blood is still gushing from his nose. I had a nosebleed in the gym yesterday. That’s my Partridgean contribution. 29 min: Werner heads the corner away. Rudy still hasn’t returned. He’s still shirtless. Don’t they have another shirt for him? His previous one was covered in blood. 28 min: Sweden are enjoying a decent spell of possession. That might be because Rudy is yet to return. Augustinsson ambles down the right and crosses to the far post. Hector heads behind for a corner. “This Germany team’s performance and vibe is more that of a tranquilized snail than a dead frog’s,” Navid Samedi says. “At least frogs look graceful even in death, with their long limbs and shiny skins!” 26 min: Blood is streaming from Rudy’s nose. He’s led off the pitch and will presumably return with some heavy bandaging. He had slid in to tackle Toivonen, who inadvertently caught the Germany midfielder. 25 min: Rudy goes down clutching his head. He’ll need some treatment. He was caught accidentally by Toivonen’s boot. 24 min: A corner to Germany on the left, Kroos winning it. He’ll also take it. But Larsson heads it away. “I am always amazed by the number of infringements that would be a simple foul given if they happened in the centre circle or if the attacker had done the same to the defender,” Lee Calvert says. “The Boateng effort of Berg is a classic example of the genre. The law book is no different in the penalty area, but in practice it’s clear and obvious that it is.” 23 min: Germany have had most of the ball, but it’s 1-1 on clear chances. That has to be a worry for Germany – better teams will fancy themselves against this defence. 22 min: Reus sends a pass through to Muller, but Ekdal tracks the forward’s run and ushers the ball out of play. Fine covering. “On Sweden’s claim for a penalty I am confused,” Daniel Jeffreys says. “Is a penalty awarded for manhandling an opponent off the ball? Or for blowing gently into his ear as he prepares to shoot? In this World Cup it seems it can be both. Or neither. Does VAR stand for Very Annoyingly Random?” 20 min: “What is VAR good for?” says JR in Illinois. “Seriously.I’m sick of people saying how well it’s working. I’m not having it. That was a clear and obvious penalty. What determines when they consult VAR? I don’t know. Do you? Does anyone? Oh it’s so maddening.” 19 min: Rudy’s shot from 25 yards dribbles harmlessly wide. “VAR was meant to reduce feelings of anger and injustice, but by being available and these things STILL being missed makes it even worse,” Hugh Molloy says. “Why don’t we just give the referees a magic 8 ball and be done with it?” 18 min: Sweden hurl the ball into the Germany area. Lustig knocks it down to Berg, who sees his volley blocked by Boateng. 17 min: I’ve just seen another replay of Sweden’s penalty appeal. It was a clear shove from Boateng on Berg. It was a foul and it should have been a penalty and a booking for Boateng. 14 min: Sweden are still furious about not being given a penalty. Boateng’s intervention did knock Berg off balance. Still, at least they’ve discovered the vulnerability in Germany’s defence. It was so simple for them to get through. 12 min: A Germany attack breaks down and Sweden counter. Germany’s defence is so high and one pass is all it takes to send Berg speeding through on goal! The striker takes quite a heavy touch that allows Neuer to race from his line and close him down. As he prepares to shoot, there’s pressure from Boateng. Berg’s shot is blocked by Neuer and he claims that there’s a push from Boateng! The referee isn’t interested and there’s no VAR check. Germany got away with that. Boateng did seem to shove Berg in the back. 11 min: Kimmich is playing very high again, just as he did against Mexico. Sweden should look to target Germany’s right side on the break. 9 min: A German goal looks inevitable at the moment. Kimmich sends Reus scooting to the right byline and the winger’s cross, intended for Werner, is desperately turned behind by Lindelof. 8 min: Reus slips a pass through to Draxler on the left. He fizzes a low ball across the face of goal but no one’s there to apply the final touch and Sweden breathe another sigh of relief as the cross slithers past the far post. 6 min: I wouldn’t mind seeing a replay of Draxler’s chance. I think it was Augustinsson who made the block to deny the Germany forward. Life moves fast, though, and soon Sweden are tearing forward. Forsberg almost bustles into the area, but he’s muscled out by Muller and Kimmich. 5 min: Germany have Sweden pinned back. Kimmich knocks a long, raking pass to Hector, who lays the ball off to Reus. Sweden hack it clear. 3 min: Germany make a fast start, probing down the right. Kimmich gets in and the ball finds its way to Draxler, who’s denied from close range! Werner also can’t turn it in and Sweden somehow scramble the ball clear. Moments later Hector sees a shot blocked from the edge of the area. Germany really should be ahead. Peep! Sweden, in blue shirts and yellow shorts, get the game underway. They’re kicking from right to left in the first half and immediately launch the ball long. Germany are in white shirts and black shorts. They attack down the left and Muller sends a cross into the area. It evades everyone. “At least with Messi,you could explain away his ineffectiveness by not having the Barcelona players around him; but for Ozil his interest in his Arsenal team-mates always looked fairly lukewarm, so their replacement by better players ought to have had a more salutary effect,” Charles Antaki says. “Low must have suspected that Ozil was living some sort of Emirates flash-back, and decided on a merciful release.” We’ve had the anthems! It’s almost time for more football. Here come the teams! It’s a huge night for Germany. It’s a huge night for the World Cup. A Sweden win here and the holders are out in the first round for the first time since 1938! On ITV, Gary Neville is asked what it was like to play against Sweden: “Boring!” That’s the fear for Germany tonight - that the Swedes will do everything in their power to turn this into a tedious slog. An email! “I’m relieved to see some of Low’s changes but I thought the worst player on the pitch against Mexico was Muller,” Gina Maya says. “Am starting to see Muller as the equivalent of Matthaus-as-sweeper to the German teams of the 1990s. Undroppable, no matter how much he detracted from the team. Other thoughts: Ozil’s passing and touch make his exclusion troubling. Hope Goretzka and Brandt get their opportunities during this game (instead of Draxler and Muller) - they are way more effective, especially given the park-the-bus tactics I’m expecting from Sweden. Am quietly dreading this match, as a fan of Germany.” Pre-match reading Sebastian Rudy’s inclusion has caused something of a stir in Germany. Joachim Low’s stock is under threat. Even Phillip Lahm, the former Germany captain, has told German television that he’s surprised to see the 28-year-old Bayern Munich player in the side. A lot of fans would have preferred to see Leon Goretzka start. It’s also a slight surprise to see Timo Werner keep his place up front. The young RB Leipzig forward didn’t get much change out of the Mexico defence last Sunday and there was an expectation that he would be replaced by the burly Mario Gomez. Germany really miss Miroslav Klose, don’t they? It’s a huge call to drop Mesut Ozil. The Arsenal man was, of course, dire against Mexico, but he’s been such a big part of Joachim Low’s side for the best part of a decade. Now he steps out for a must-win game, which isn’t exactly the greatest show of faith from his manager. Still, it will look like the right decision if Marco Reus has a positive impact. The Dortmund forward is a cracking player and he could give Germany more incision and snap - but the worry is he’s a diminished force after suffering so many injuries. Mexico have beaten South Korea 2-1 in the other Group F game. That means Germany will be out if they lose tonight. A draw would also be damaging for Joachim Low’s side as it would leave them vulnerable to the possibility of being on the wrong end of a 1982-style Anschluss when Mexico and Sweden meet on Wednesday. Germany make four changes to the side that lost to Mexico. The injured Mats Hummels is replaced by Antonio Rudiger in central defence, Jonas Hector replaces Marvin Plattenhardt at left-back, Sebastian Rudy takes Sami Khedira’s spot in midfield and Mesut Ozil makes way for 2013’s Marco Reus. Sweden keep faith with much of the side that saw off South Korea. The only change is at the back, where Manchester United’s Victor Lindelof has recovered from illness in time to replace Pontus Jansson. Germany: Neuer; Kimmich, Rudiger, Boateng, Hector; Rudy, Kroos; Muller, Draxler, Reus; Werner. Sweden: Olsen; Lustig, Lindelof, Granqvist, Augustinsson; Claesson, Larsson, Ekdal, Forsberg; Berg, Toivonen. Referee: Szymon Marciniak (Poland). As reported by Bild an hour or so ago, Joachim Low has swung his big selection axe and made contact with Mesut Ozil and Sami Khedira. Both midfielders are left out of Germany’s starting 11. I’ll have the full teams in a minute. You have to go back to 1938 to find the last time Germany failed to make it past the first round of the World Cup. Not to worry, though, because 80 years of hurt might be about to come to an end! Wait, that’s the wrong way round. This isn’t Opposite Land. Oh no. This is going even worse than Germany’s opening game at Russia 2018. There we go, back on track. Which, by happy coincidence, is where Joachim Low’s side hope to find themselves after meeting Sweden in Sochi this evening. For now, though, the world champions are in unfamiliar, uncertain territory, even if their fate remains in their hands. Just like France in 2002, Italy in 2010 and Spain in 2014, the holders are in trouble and the mood in the camp is glum. Mario Basler, the former Bayern Munich midfielder, says Mesut Ozil has the “body language of a dead frog”, a row’s erupted over Ozil and Ilkay Gundogan meeting Recep Erdogan, the president of Turkey, before the tournament and there’s talk of a split between a “Bling-Bling gang” (Ozil, Sami Khedira, Jerome Boateng and Julian Draxler) and the Bavarians (Manuel Neuer, Mats Hummels, Thomas Müller and Toni Kroos). The potential for further chaos is clear - and we haven’t even mentioned Low’s tactics against Mexico. Suffice to say, Germany’s first defeat in an opening game since 1982 was a shambles. Germany were wide open to the Mexican counterattack throughout, vulnerable to speed and predictable up front. “Our cover was often not good and we were left many times with Jerome and myself at the back,” Hummels said. “Mexico obviously deserved to win it. If seven of eight players are attacking then it’s clear our attacking power is greater. But that’s something that I have often talked about internally. It doesn’t always bear fruit. A wake-up call is too late. We now must win two games, otherwise that is that with the World Cup.” Time to wake up, then - and Low is likely to make changes here. This will surely be a different Germany. Yet don’t count out the Swedes. They might no longer have Lion Man up front, but they beat Italy to make it this far and have the upper hand after Andreas Granqvist’s penalty helped them see off South Korea in their opening game. Sweden have Emil Forsberg, who needs no introduction to German fans, and plenty of height and organisation. A draw would suit them just fine. Janne Andersson’s side are bound to set out to frustrate. Can Germany handle the pressure? Well, history suggests they can. You’d be mad to write them off. After all, wouldn’t it be typical if they go on to win every game 1-0 from here and defend their trophy? Perhaps that horror show against Mexico will jolt them into life. Or maybe it was a sign of things to come; the beginning of the end. A night of intrigue awaits. Kick-off: 7pm BST, 9pm in Sochi."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"media/2018/jun/22/netflix-chief-of-communications-leaving-after-reports-of-using-n-word","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-23T14:11:58Z","webTitle":"Netflix boss apologises to staff after executive sacked over N-word","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/jun/22/netflix-chief-of-communications-leaving-after-reports-of-using-n-word","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2018/jun/22/netflix-chief-of-communications-leaving-after-reports-of-using-n-word","fields":{"headline":"Netflix boss apologises to staff after executive sacked over N-word","bodyText":"The head of Netflix has told his staff he needs to “set a better example” after sacking the company’s head of communications for twice using the N-word during work meetings. Reed Hastings, the video streaming company’s founder, told staff in a memo he had decided to “let go” of Jonathan Friedland for using the racial slur in a “descriptive” sense. Friedland, a former journalist who joined Netflix in 2011, first used the word several months ago during a discussion about offensive words in comedy, and again a few days later during a conversation with two black colleagues. Hastings, who became a billionaire after starting Netflix as a mail-order DVD rental company in 1997, said in the lengthy memo, published by the Hollywood Reporter, that he heard about the second incident last week. “I should have done more to use [the first incident] as a learning moment for everyone at Netflix about how painful and ugly that word is, and that it should not be used,” Hastings wrote. “I realise that my privilege has made me intellectualise or otherwise minimise race issues like this. I need to set a better example by learning and listening more so I can be the leader we need.” Friedland tweeted an apology: “Leaders have to be beyond reproach in the example we set and unfortunately I fell short of that standard when I was insensitive in speaking to my team about words that offend in comedy. I feel awful about the distress this lapse caused to people at a company I love and where I want everyone to feel included and appreciated.” Friedland spent 20 years as a foreign correspondent before joining the Walt Disney Company. During his seven years at Netflix, it has become a dominant force online, valued at £106bn, with 125 million subscribers worldwide. The memo from Hastings said Friedland had “contributed greatly in many areas”, but showed “unacceptably low racial awareness and sensitivity”. “Several people afterwards told him how inappropriate and hurtful his use of the N-word was, and Jonathan apologised to those that had been in the meeting. We hoped this was an awful anomaly never to be repeated.” Of the second incident, Hastings wrote: “Jonathan said the N-word again to two of our black employees in HR who were trying to help him deal with the original offence. The second incident confirmed a deep lack of understanding, and convinced me to let Jonathan go now.” Hastings said global debate and the word’s use in film and music had created some confusion about whether using it could ever be acceptable. “For non-black people, the word should not be spoken as there is almost no context in which it is appropriate or constructive (even when singing a song or reading a script),” Hastings wrote. “There is not a way to neutralise the emotion and history behind the word in any context. The use of the phrase ‘N-word’ was created as a euphemism, and the norm, with the intention of providing an acceptable replacement and moving people away from using the specific word. When a person violates this norm, it creates resentment, intense frustration, and great offence for many.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/23/tortillas-that-taste-like-glory-the-secret-of-mexicos-world-cup-diet","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-23T09:55:56Z","webTitle":"'Tortillas that taste like glory' – the secret of Mexico's World Cup diet","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/23/tortillas-that-taste-like-glory-the-secret-of-mexicos-world-cup-diet","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/23/tortillas-that-taste-like-glory-the-secret-of-mexicos-world-cup-diet","fields":{"headline":"'Tortillas that taste like glory' – the secret of Mexico's World Cup diet","bodyText":"While every player at the World Cup will be taking great care over their diet and nutrition during the tournament, the Mexican squad have an extra incentive to be careful - to avoid domestic meat contaminated with growth hormones. The squad has bought two tons of food along with them to Russia, but none of the meat will be coming from Mexico itself. Mexico has a history of producing meat contaminated with Clenbuterol, used to promote muscle growth in livestock, but also banned as a performance-enhancing substance in athletes. Since arriving in Europe for the World Cup red meat has been finally back on the menu for the players. “Players ask for their quesadillas and their tacos and that really helps psychologically, because you bring them closest to home” said squad nutritionist Beatriz Boullosa, who rejoined the Mexican backroom staff in 2015. She was previously part of the staff that helped Mexico win the under-17 world title in 2011, and also worked for the Olympic team that won the gold medal in 2012. “We brought a lot of food and we also brought a chef to make every dish as the player likes it, we are making corn tortillas that taste like glory.” Every member of the squad has a different diet plan, “not just based on his position”, Boullosa said, “but also based on his physique and his performance in training and in games. It’s not the same for someone who played 90 minutes, to someone who stayed on the bench, we take every variable into account to make sure every player gets what they need”. The plan obviously worked for Mexico’s opening match, where their high-tempo game overwhelmed defending champions Germany. When used for performance enhancement Clenbuterol increases lean muscle mass and reduces body fat. Agriculturally, although outlawed in most countries, it can be used on cattle, lamb, poultry and swine. The World Anti-Doping Agency has, in the past, issued specific warnings about the problem with agricultural usage in both China and Mexico. In 2011, five players from Mexico’s squad tested positive for clenbuterol, among them Guillermo Ochoa, the starting goalkeeper in this World Cup. The country’s federation ruled the positive tests were caused by contaminated meat. More recently, Mexican boxer Canelo Álvarez tested positive for the same forcing the postponement of his rematch with Gennady Golovkin. Having gone without while in Mexico, the squad were allowed to start eating red meat once they arrived in Denmark for a pre-World Cup friendly. “Players are carnivorous by nature and they are happy to get the red meat back on their diet, and in nutrition terms it was also important” Boullosa said. One vital ingredient for their diet has come from Mexico, however – hot sauces. “We made a spicy chili-peanut sauce that is delicious, and we also have traditional salsas some of the super spicy and some mild ones”, added Boullosa. “We also brought cans of beans and corn. We are super loaded.” Still, while the backroom staff take every care over the preparation, it’s not always the case that players will listen. Before their departure from Mexico some of the squad made headlines after being seen out late partying for Javier Hernández’s 30th birthday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"culture/2018/jun/24/dark-mofo-v-hobarts-mayor-we-are-all-allowed-to-dream-ron","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-24T02:52:30Z","webTitle":"Dark Mofo v Hobart's mayor: 'We're all allowed to dream, Ron'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/jun/24/dark-mofo-v-hobarts-mayor-we-are-all-allowed-to-dream-ron","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2018/jun/24/dark-mofo-v-hobarts-mayor-we-are-all-allowed-to-dream-ron","fields":{"headline":"Dark Mofo v Hobart's mayor: 'We're all allowed to dream, Ron'","bodyText":"The preacher on the milk crate outside a Hobart bank is talking about David Walsh’s inverted crosses, and saying the end is nigh. The preacher is easy to ignore, even if the crosses aren’t. They are everywhere: lining the waterfront, in laneways, in shopfronts, even at the gym. In a citywide initiative to “paint the town red”, the glowing red lights of the Dark Mofo festival have crept up the hills and into the suburbs. They’re in the windows of houses and they light up a towering crane in the city centre. It gets dark at 5pm and, when that happens, the streets are bathed in an eerie red glow. It can feel like you’re trapped in a confessional booth (or perhaps in Madonna’s Like a Prayer video). From the hills you can see the massive light beams of the work Spectra. Anyone who comes down to Dark Park or the Winter Feast returns home smelling of wood fire that has a chemical taint. You carry the festival with you – in the smell on your clothes and hair, even when you’re not there. You can’t escape Dark Mofo, even if you would want to. Apart from Edinburgh’s, few festivals transform an entire city the way Dark Mofo changes Hobart. The transformation from a town where no one came to play (particularly not in winter) to the hottest festival ticket in Australia is not without its growing pains. The growth has been so massive, and has happened so quickly, that, according to the lord mayor, Ron Christie, some locals feel both left behind and not consulted. There is also the fear that the character of the city is transforming to something unfamiliar and strange. This year, the conversation and unease about the rapid pace of change is being transmuted through concern about the upside-down crosses. This past week 17,000 people signed a petition that went to Hobart city council, protesting against the use of the cross as a design motif. While the petition originated in Brisbane, and was no doubt signed by many people not in Hobart, Christie is taking their concerns seriously. On Friday he threatened to take away council funding (to the tune of $150,000 a year) from Dark Mofo, to which the festival’s creative director, Leigh Carmichael, replied: “It’s deeply concerning when community leaders attempt to censor art with cheap threats to cut funds. We can assure our Dark Mofo audiences that we will not accept any festival funding if there are artistic limitations attached.” Walsh said: “If we acquiesce to curatorial influence and become tame, the festival will die in three years, so the money will be irrelevant.” Many others on the council and in Hobart’s business community are furious at Christie’s comments. The festival is a cash cow that brings in $50m a year and causes a huge rush on hotel rooms and restaurant bookings at a time when the Tasmanian capital usually hibernates. Michael Bailey, the head of the Tasmanian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, told the ABC on Friday: “I think the lord mayor is very much out of step and out of touch with the community, and I suspect that there will be a significant backlash … “It wasn’t that long ago Tasmania was known as being the backend of Australia, essentially inhabited by inbred people. Now we are the flavour of not just the country but the world.” But Christie told Guardian Australia that this year the festival had overstepped the mark. “For the first three years [of Dark Mofo] the theme was to activate winter and it was family-friendly. Now people are contacting me saying, ‘Which way is it going?’ “I react because I get complaints from the community. There are 116 nationalities in this city and, if it was another form of religion he [Walsh] was depicting, we’d get a lot of more complaints.” Part of the mayor’s concern is the festival’s rapid growth. “Our creative arts strategy is to promote cultural excellence in the city and you have to control it. This event is moving at a very rapid pace and that’s what Mr Walsh wants. He wants a reaction and he does it well.” Carmichael told Guardian Australia the festival’s growth is organic. “The attitude I’ve taken with Dark Mofo is to run with it while it’s hot – and it keeps growing each year. Most years at the end of each festival, I’ve said, ‘We don’t have to get bigger, it’s just about right,’ but we just continue to grow.” This is “partly because David allows us to grow in terms of funding it. Artists didn’t used to come to Tasmania – now we get more opportunities to book artists like Laurie Anderson. We don’t have many restrictions that large organisations have. They have boards, sponsors and governments to appease – we are agile.” Yet the council is still important to the festival, from a planning and permit perspective. Burying the performance artist Mike Parr under the road, for example, wouldn’t have happened without council approval. And it is hard to imagine any other council in Australia agreeing to such a move. With Dark Mofo now in its sixth year, the mayor acknowledges the positives: “Seven years ago I sat down on the waterfront and talked to the seagulls. Now down there at night, there’s people everywhere. It generates $50m into the economy. “But we have to ask, have they pushed this boundary? And we have to ask, what is their agenda?’” Christie is particularly concerned by Carmichael’s plan for next year. “Leigh came out yesterday [in the Hobart Mercury] to say we want to turn it into a dark city next year and he also has plans to build a sky tower in the city. He’s talking to a developer. That won’t happen. Dream on, Leigh.” (To which Carmichael responded via the Guardian: “We’re all allowed to dream, Ron.”) As for changes to the city’s identity, that is much harder shift to pin down. Matt Fishburn, the managing director of consultancy group The20, has been running a project with the state government to “find Tasmania’s story”. “We’ve been interviewing a random sample of Tasmanians [one-on-one for about an hour] across the state to unearth it,” he said. Mona and Dark Mofo have played a part in some Tasmanians having more confidence to take creative risks and be more entrepreneurial, Fishburn said. “There’s a ‘have a go’ attitude but things have changed and are continuing to change in Tasmania and there’s tension in that,” he said. “I see Dark Mofo as an example of that tension. The festival is ultimately so different from what people have experienced in Hobart and Tasmania.” It’s this singularity that is perhaps the secret to Dark Mofo’s success. This article was amended on 2 July, 2018, to clarify that the preacher was taking issue with the artistic merit of David Walsh’s inverted crosses rather than ascribing any satanic symbolism."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"technology/2018/jun/26/tech-government-contracts-worker-revolt-microsoft-amazon-google","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-26T07:01:26Z","webTitle":"When should a tech company refuse to build tools for the government?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jun/26/tech-government-contracts-worker-revolt-microsoft-amazon-google","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/jun/26/tech-government-contracts-worker-revolt-microsoft-amazon-google","fields":{"headline":"When should a tech company refuse to build tools for the government?","bodyText":"During the second world war, IBM supplied the Nazis with technology used to help transport millions of people to their deaths in the concentration camps. The American technology company leased punch-card machines through a German subsidiary for the purpose of tabulating a population census, which allowed the Nazis to identify and track the movements of Jews all the way to the gas chambers. In 1937, Hitler awarded a medal to the company’s CEO, Thomas Watson, in recognition of his services to the Third Reich. This shameful episode in IBM’s history highlights an uncomfortable predicament for companies pursuing lucrative government contracts, and one that’s recently reared its head for Google, Microsoft and Amazon: should they be held accountable for how their customers deploy their technologies? The question has come to the fore for Microsoft, after it was revealed that the company’s Azure cloud computing arm was working with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice). The relationship was announced in January, when Microsoft said it was “proud to support” Ice’s work with secure cloud services and facial recognition and identification. However, it came under scrutiny this month as the ugly results of Trump’s zero tolerance border policy, which saw thousands of children separated from their parents and detained in cages, unfolded. For Microsoft’s executives, the deal marks an important expansion into a lucrative government market. Employees saw it differently, and hundreds signed an open letter to Microsoft’s CEO, Satya Nadella, demanding the company end its $19.4m contract with Ice and create a policy not to work with clients who violate international human rights law. “We believe that Microsoft must take an ethical stand, and put children and families above profits,” they wrote. “As the people who build the technologies that Microsoft profits from, we refuse to be complicit.” It’s easy to think of “the cloud” as a neutral bank of computers to which Ice has bought off-the-shelf access in the same way any business can buy cloud storage, laptops, smartphones or accounting software. We don’t blame Apple if an Ice agent is tipped off about an undocumented worker via a call to his iPhone, so what’s the big deal with Microsoft selling cloud services to the agency? “The Microsoft cloud that the government uses looks really different from the cloud from [consumer service] BlueHost,” said Lilly Irani, an assistant professor of communication and science studies at UC San Diego, told the Guardian. Serving the specific needs of a client like Ice, including supporting facial recognition and real-time translation of voice audio, would require a highly customised infrastructure with state-of-the-art data processing abilities, she explained. This means Microsoft engineers dedicating their time to build and maintain tools that help catch and deport immigrants. Even if there were no customisation, Microsoft is complicit, argues Nicholas Evans, an assistant philosophy professor at UMass Lowell, who has studied the complicity of psychologists in torture programmes. “By choosing to take Ice’s business they are saying ‘we think Ice isn’t objectionable enough that we won’t do business with them’,” he said. “This tacit endorsement is problematic for Microsoft.” This is the latest in a series of employee revolts within Silicon Valley. In April, Gizmodo revealed that Google had partnered with the US Department of Defense (DoD) to help the agency develop artificial intelligence for military drone surveillance through a pilot project for the Pentagon’s Project Maven, which seeks to identify objects in drone footage. Staff who had joined a company famed for its search engine and advertising business were horrified to find themselves providing services to the DoD. It prompted a huge internal backlash and dozens of employees resigned. The worker action was effective: Google announced it would not renew its Project Maven contract. Amazon also came under fire for selling a facial surveillance tool “Rekognition”, which can identify, track and analyze people in real time, to various law enforcement agencies. According to Amazon’s marketing material the software can recognise “persons of interest” from a police body-cam video stream. “Technology companies should not knowingly provide dangerous surveillance services to government,” said Matt Cagle from the ACLU, which first highlighted the problems with Amazon’s facial recognition technology. “The marketing materials for [Rekognition] would make George Orwell blush.” “It’s disingenuous for these companies to abdicate the responsibility for harmful use of their products,” he added. As with Google and Microsoft, the backlash triggered workers to write a letter to Amazon’s CEO, Jeff Bezos, obtained by Gizmodo, stating: “Our company should not be in the surveillance business; we should not be in the policing business; we should not be in the business of supporting those who monitor and oppress marginalized populations.” The backlash marks something of a turning point for Silicon Valley’s tech workers, who have long been lambasted for their lack of empathy for those living outside of their gilded bubble. “It’s taken a bit of effort to get them thinking about the impact of their work and be more aligned with the working-class and immigrant populations as opposed to their executives and bosses,” said Ares Geovanos from the Tech Workers Coalition, which advocates for worker rights. As we saw with Google, collective worker action can be particularly effective in companies whose bottom lines rely on their ability to retain highly skilled computer scientists. “Those engineers collectively have more power than individual consumers to push their companies to be responsible corporate citizens,” said Evans. This article was amended on 26 June. An earlier version of this article stated that the medal Thomas Watson received from Hitler in 1937 was related to the services IBM provided through the leasing of punchcard machines. The medal was awarded to Watson for his role as president of the International Chamber of Commerce. Watson sent the medal back in 1940.

Derek Whyteside, 42, died hours after being attacked in Telford, Shropshire, on Monday. A 16-year-old boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, has since appeared in Kidderminster magistrates court charged with his murder. “Derek was a nice guy, he was loveable and could always see the best in people and if he considered you a friend he would strive never to let you down,” his relatives said in a statement released by West Mercia police. “He would always be there for you and was very proud of his extended family. He was a fab dad to his partner’s children, very protective, cheeky and loving and always meant well. He was Michelle’s world and was so good to her. He was a great brother, too. We can’t understand why anyone would do this.” Whyteside’s partner, Michelle Beddall, alleged on Facebook that he had been hit on the head with a cricket bat. Hours earlier, she had sought help in tracing a group of people she said had stolen bikes outside her house. The investigation is being led by Det Insp Mark Bellamy. He said: “Our thoughts are with the family at this time and we offer them our deepest sympathy, we continue to have specially trained officers offering them support and will continue to do so throughout our investigation. “The local community will play a significant role in our enquiries and, while I am grateful for the people who have already come forward and spoken to us, this is now a murder investigation and it is vitally important anyone who has any information and has not yet spoken to us gets in contact.” The 16-year-old appeared before magistrates on Thursday.

Suddenly, in the last minute, Xherdan Shaqiri was racing away, Serbs in pursuit but unable to catch him before he slipped the ball under Vladimir Stojkovic. It was the goal that defeated Serbia and put Switzerland in a strong position to progress to the next round, but it was also much more than that. As he turned and screamed, he took his shirt off, flexed his muscles and performed a double-eagle celebration, a recreation of the Albanian flag. Alongside him, Granit Xhaka did the same – for the second time. Xhaka had scored the equaliser, thumping in from 20 yards, now Shaqiri had the winner. Two Kosovans, two goalscorers, in a stadium where Russian and Serbian fans had come together, supporting a team that Shaqiri and Xhaka do not see as simple opponents. Shaqiri had the Kosovan flag stitched to his boot. Xhaka’s father was imprisoned and beaten in the former Yugoslavia for campaigning in favour of Kosovan independence and his brother Taulant plays for Albania. Together with Valon Behrami, they had been whistled by a crowd that chanted “Serbia-Russia! Serbia-Russia!” A banner declared the two countries “brothers”. They had enjoyed the first half of this game, in which Serbia looked far superior, but had watched as they were hauled back early in the second, and beaten at the death. There could be few complaints either: in the final, frantic 30 minutes, Switzerland, emboldened by their changes and led by Shaqiri, had gone for them. It had not seemed likely since the moment Dusan Tadic cut back on the right and curled in a lovely cross for Aleksander Mitrovic to head past Yann Sommer from seven yards. The game was only five minutes old when the goal was scored, but it hadn’t been Serbia’s first opportunity – from virtually the same spot, Mitrovic had drawn a sharp save from the goalkeeper a minute before, this time supplied by Sergej Milinkovic-Savic – and it wouldn’t be the last either. The same three men were at the heart of everything Serbia did, Tadic, Mitrovc and Milinkovic-Savic combining superbly at a time when all Switzerland could aspire to was resistance. For the Swiss, every ball in was a drama, and there were many of them early on. Mitrovic controlled one on the chest and sent an overhead kick sailing just past the bar. Slowly, though, this became a game, Shaqiri increasingly involved. Blerim Dzemaili couldn’t quite guide Steven Zuber’s pass then bafflingly chose to cross when he should have shot. At the other end, Tadic, Mitrovic and Milinkovic-Savic threatened still and they might have doubled the lead when Dusko Tosic dived through the air, barely four yards out but failed to reach a corner, and Nemanja Matic couldn’t force it in at the far post. Next, Tadic struck a lovely shot on the bounce that flew just over. Switzerland equalised soon after the break, Shaqiri’s blocked shot running to Xhaka who thumped it first time from 20 yards, bending the ball hard into the net. His hands forming an eagle amidst the noise, and the game turned frantic. Tadic delivered a cross from which Mitrovic, hauled to the floor, appealed for a penalty and then sent the ball fizzing across the six-yard box. The best opportunity, though, came for the substitute Mario Gavranovic at the other end who hit the side-netting having been played through by Shaqiri.

All the fears I had about being in nature hit me in the face. It’s a very real fear for black people, especially those from urban communities, that bad things happen to black people in the woods, like lynching. It’s something that you see again and again when you look at the history of the civil rights movement and slavery: black people going into the woods and not coming back. My friend had grown up hiking. I talked to her about my fears and she respected my apprehension. I said to myself: “You’ve got to do this now or it will never happen.” I grew up in kind of a rough neighborhood on the south side of Chicago, so my mother kept us in a lot. Our house was across the street from a public park but it was rife with gang violence so we never went there. I always knew about hiking and camping from commercials and magazines. But the people doing it didn’t look like me. They were white, athletic and attractive. I’d never, ever seen anybody of color doing it, let alone a black male; I associated the outdoors with whiteness. Nobody around me even thought about it. My mother grew up in the backwoods down south, but she never encouraged us to have a connection with nature. My friend and I headed to Starved Rock state park, two hours south of Chicago. We had to drive through this very wooded area and I remember thinking: “I hope nothing happens. I hope I don’t have to get out of the car.” When we started the hike, I had to let go of a lot of what I was feeling. An hour into it, we stopped to take in this view and I was amazed by everything I was experiencing. I loved not hearing the commotion of the city. No cars, no yelling, no arguments on the corner. Just the water, the birds and the wind. It was like a reset button. I remember thinking, “Why haven’t I been doing this all along? Everybody should be doing this. There’s nobody that shouldn’t be hiking!” It was overwhelming to realize that something I’ve always believed isn’t for me actually is. I had spent so much time being nervous about it when it was what I needed. I now go seven to eight times a month. Five days a week I work in sales, spending my time in ginormous condo buildings and busy infrastructure. As soon as I hop in the car to get out of town, the weight of the week lifts. I take my six-year-old daughter so that she knows earlier than I did that this is something beneficial. I let her lead the way on our path and allow her to make decisions for what she’s doing in nature. My mom’s proud of me but I’m still working on getting her out for a hike. Follow Aaron at @MidwestColorCamp Marjorie Leach-Parker, 68, Virginia Beach, Virginia I grew up in a small town in North Carolina where most of the white people were farm owners and the black people were hired hands. My family farmed and as a child, I spent a lot of time topping tobacco and picking cucumbers, peppers and squash. We’d go out fishing and hang out on the rivers as a family but we were never encouraged to go far from the house. The feeling was that if you went out into the woods by yourself – and you’re black – if no one’s around, you might not end up coming back. The world has changed but that thought pattern is still there. Today, I’m the first African American chapter chair for the Sierra Club in the state of Virginia. It started because a friend took me to a local meeting and I walked in and there were all these old white people. I said, “OK, there has to be some other representation here.” Some people might have walked away but I think my background makes me a little different. Thirty-nine years ago I became a software developer when there were no black people, let alone women, in that industry, so I’ve always had to go a step above. Back then, all the guys smoked in the office and I didn’t, so I went home and practiced how to do it without coughing. But even now in my position as chair, I will still only go on hikes when I’m with a group of people I know. I live within walking distance of a nature trail and I would never go there by myself. It’s not the younger generation but the older generation that you see that look at you like you have no business there. Like you don’t belong. It’s like: “Get out. Get away.” Even though it’s public land, some people are like, “I’m white and therefore I have more rights and I’m better than you.” And some black people still think, “I’m black and if I’m out there, I’m supposed to be cleaning up or waiting on you.” Sometimes when I introduce myself to groups across the state, I have to take a deep breath because I’ll think: “Are these people going to respect me?” What I love about hiking and the outdoors is breathing that clean air and seeing the greenery around me and not hearing cars. Fresh air really energizes me. Part of that is probably because I was born and raised in the country. I don’t even want to think about my three-year-old great-grandson growing up in a world where he doesn’t know what a real river or real group of trees look like. I hate to think of him never ever seeing a live rabbit or squirrel or deer. I spend a lot of time talking to people about the future and keeping the planet livable. Within the Sierra Club, everyone is seriously nice, but understanding things from a different perspective is missing sometimes. I mean, why would a guy living in a $500,000 house know what it feels like to live in a place that you rent for $500 a month and the environmental issues that go with that? That people are just dumping trash in your neighborhood? A lot of older white people don’t know how to communicate with a black person of the street and the same the other way around. The older generation needs to be more embracing and think about how other people feel. Tiffany Tharpe, 26, Los Angeles My first trip to a national park was life-changing. It was four years ago and I went with some friends to Yosemite. I was getting over a breakup at the time. While there, I met Shelton Johnson, a black park ranger and writer. We got into a discussion about how there aren’t a lot of African American families visiting national parks. It made me sad because as a kid I would have loved to have seen Yosemite. That first trip, I pushed myself and my friends to do a strenuous hike; I wasn’t expecting us to complete it but we did and when we got to the top, standing above a waterfall, just looking out on the valley, it made the whole breakup seem so small in comparison to everything that’s out there to explore. After Trump became president, I became a little nervous about traveling in the US. Racism became more overt. Just after the inauguration I went with a couple of friends to western Arizona. On the way, we passed lots of gun stores, some with Confederate flags, and I felt very uncomfortable. When we got there I mostly felt OK because I was with friends who blended in, but there was this one old man who stared at me from the other side of the street. He was eating an ice cream and wearing a Make America Great Again hat. I felt challenged and stared back until he looked away. My boyfriend and I have been together for two and a half years. This January, to celebrate our anniversary, we went on our first official road trip as a couple. He’s white and I’m black, and when we’re hiking in the LA area, I don’t even think about that. But this trip we were heading to Death Valley national park, in a relatively conservative area. On the trails we received nothing but stares. People just wouldn’t stop. They weren’t mean or evil but at some point I said to my boyfriend: “I don’t want to hold your hand any more.” I felt bad because he was being affectionate and wanted to hug and kiss my cheek but I was like: “No, not here.” I didn’t want to make anyone else uncomfortable, even though I was. I feel like it’s important for black girls to hike. When I was young I would have loved to have had someone encouraging me to get outside. To not be afraid. I’ve decided to apply for a master’s degree in parks and recreation management, and a friend and I set up a hiking group for women of color in LA called Black Girls Trekkin’. I want to be a model to other young girls.

But the quality and scope of the London fire brigade (LFB)’s training – outsourced since 2012 to a private contractor, Babcock International – is now under scrutiny amid claims that senior firefighters were ill-prepared for what confronted them during last year’s blaze, which claimed 72 lives. Guidelines for when incident commanders at major fires should switch from ordering residents in burning high-rises to stay put in their flats to evacuating them were issued to all fire authorities by the government in 2014. They were direct in response to recommendations by the coroner who led the inquest into the 2009 fire at Lakanal House, Southwark, in which six people died. The stay-put policy is standard for all fire brigades when dealing with high-rise blazes. It is based on the premise that high-rise buildings can be expected to contain a fire in the apartment where it started, a principle known as compartmentation. In her recent report into the Grenfell fire, chartered fire engineer Dr Barbara Lane questioned why the stay-put advice was maintained until 2:47am, given that compartmentation had begun to fail by 1:15am. The fire was first reported at 11.54pm. The inquiry heard that the decision to withdraw the advice to stay put was taken in the control room by a commander watching the fire on Sky TV. An incident commander at the scene reached the same conclusion at around the same time. In their submission to the inquiry, lawyers representing survivors and residents have said they want the inquiry to investigate “the failure to appreciate the futility of firefighting within the early window of opportunity for evacuation” and “the real-time appreciation by firefighters of various ranks (and staff in the control room) that stay-put advice was untenable”. They suggest the training given to fire officers at the scene and in the control room may have been flawed: “The repeated view of firefighters was that this was a fire beyond their experience; but it is also clear that it was a fire beyond their training or indeed LFB’s strategic contemplation.” After the Lakanal House tragedy, the coroner who conducted the inquest wrote to the Department of Communities and Local Government calling for a review to “provide consolidated national guidance in high-rise firefighting”. In response, in February 2014 the government published a generic risk assessment which said fire authorities should draw up “an operational evacuation plan … in the event that the stay-put policy becomes untenable”, and that “it should be noted that not all high-rise residential buildings are designed or have been maintained to have a ‘stay-put’ policy in place”. It said incident commanders must be trained to “understand when a partial or full evacuation strategy might become necessary in a residential building where a ‘stay-put’ policy is normally in place”. The coroner also wrote to the LFB recommending that incident commanders should be trained to identify seven key issues, including the need “to analyse a situation, and to recognise and react quickly to changing circumstances” and to anticipate “that a fire might behave in a manner inconsistent with the compartmentation principle”. According to the November 2013 minutes of the strategy committee of the London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority, outside contractor Babcock “confirmed that all seven issues are covered in the existing suite of command training albeit there may be opportunities to emphasise the Lakanal event during some inputs”. But lawyers for the Grenfell victims appear dubious about the quality of the revised training. “No one from the LFB commissioner down appears to have trained or planned for this type of fire,” their submission contends. “This strongly suggests that Babcock did not properly place the issue on the training curriculum, but we are yet to see the training materials.” Lawyers for the Fire Brigades Union have said the inquiry needs to consider whether firefighters were given adequate training and procedures for tackling cladding fires. “We submit on the evidence so far that there were no such procedures, nor had firefighters received any such training,” they told the inquiry. A decision to privatise the LFB’s firefighting was controversial when it was first put forward in 2011 under then Mayor of London, Boris Johnson. A report by the FBU, GMB and Unison warned that the plans “would compromise safety”. Matt Wrack, FBU general secretary, said: “It seems to us that this is not just an issue for the London Fire Brigade but for the fire service across the UK – and indeed for central government who should be overseeing these things.” A spokesman for Babcock referred questions to the LFB, which declined to comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2018/jun/22/bucking-dance-when-the-beat-drops-film-atlanta","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-22T21:06:36Z","webTitle":"'It's the thrusting of the pelvis': inside the kinetic dance style known as bucking","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/jun/22/bucking-dance-when-the-beat-drops-film-atlanta","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/jun/22/bucking-dance-when-the-beat-drops-film-atlanta","fields":{"headline":"'It's the thrusting of the pelvis': inside the kinetic dance style known as bucking","bodyText":"When the Beat Drops, a new documentary directed by Jamal Sims, chronicles a close-knit circle of black gay men in Atlanta who lead double lives. By day, they are mild-mannered hospital workers, teachers and corporate employees. By night, they rock a furiously energetic, hyper-athletic style of dancing known as “bucking”. It’s a style of dancing that’s both hidden and mainstream – simultaneously a part of everything from underground clubs to Beyoncé videos and dance routines, including her recent Coachella extravaganza. (Sims, a noted choreographer, has worked with Beyoncé, Madonna and many other stars.) “It’s still very underground,” Sims says of bucking. “Although Beyoncé did it, and artists are doing it, people don’t know what it is, exactly.” When the Beat Drops is the latest in a long line of dance films depicting the underground, from Paris is Burning’s view of voguing in New York to Rize’s dynamic portrayal of crumping in Los Angeles. “I was inspired by Rize in particular because I’m from Los Angeles, and the Dave LaChapelle movie really did inspire me,” says Sims. Bucking, also known as “j-setting”, was originally invented in the 1970s by the Jackson State J-Settes, the dance team for the marching band at Jackson State University, a historically black university in Mississippi. “A woman named Shirley Middleton really created the style,” says Sims. “She was a Jackson State University J-Sette. She was the one who put down her baton and started bucking on the field.” Bucking is an incredibly intense, high-energy dance form, and just watching it on the screen can make your heart rate skyrocket: it looks like the ab workout to end all ab workouts. “Bucking is really from the pelvis,” Sims explains. “It’s the thrusting of the pelvis … the girls, the drill teams, whenever they start to thrust their pelvises forward, that is the basis of bucking. They’ve incorporated jazz or hip-hop, and their hips thrust forward, even if they are standing in place, gyrating.” The style was originally invented by women, but bucking was soon adopted by gay men in the south, who took what they saw on the college sports field and moved it to the club, dancing to house music and hip-hop. Sims first discovered the phenomenon in 1996 on a visit to Atlanta. “I went to Traxx – that was the big club in Atlanta,” he says. “I was dancing on the dancefloor, and saw these guys come in and they started battling. As a professional choreographer and dancer, I couldn’t believe I didn’t know that this style existed. I thought I pretty much knew what was going on. I decided then that I wanted to know more.” When the Beat Drops tells the story of bucking through the personal stories of Atlanta dancers and leaders with names like Flash, Napoleon and Anthony, also known as Big Tony. Perhaps the biggest revelation in the movie – which received its California premiere this week at the Frameline film festival in San Francisco – is that the men involved in “bucking” are a real, organic community. You can’t tell from the aggressive, take-no-prisoners way they battle on the dancefloor. “These guys are like brothers to me,” says Anthony in the film. “We have our fights like anybody else, we go through breakups … we are there for each other, God knows we love each other.” On the dancefloor, though, where bucking teams battle, it’s all about ruthless competition. When the Beat Drops climaxes with a breathless tournament in Atlanta. The teams are incredibly disciplined – they practice for several hours a day. Each team sports its own uniforms and distinct styles. “You could almost tell which team it was even if their faces were covered, just by the way they danced,” says Sims. “Some of them are acrobats – they’re extremely acrobatic, even though a lot of them have never trained. They were self-taught. I connected with that; I was a self-taught dancer. I never had a dance class prior to working professionally. When you learn something yourself, sometimes it’s really raw, and the technique might be really challenged or not correct, but for you it works. These guys are doing backflips and tucks and splits and things. That’s just them teaching themselves.” At any given time, if the music changes, the captain of the team will instantly switch to a new routine. “They will have over a hundred routines in their head of any routine they can do,” marvels Sims. “The guys are trained to know what they are about to do. It’s really intense. You have to remember all these bits of choreography; it’s not just like you go to the club … For a dancer, we rehearse one week for one number. Can you imagine having a hundred routines in your head that you choose from?” At the end of the day, despite the waves of mainstream interest, bucking still flies below the radar. “I still feel it’s very underground,” Sims says. Even when you go to New York City, it doesn’t exist in the clubs. That’s because it’s really a southern thing.” Frameline, the San Francisco International LGBTQ Film Festival, continues until Sunday"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/24/malaysia-top-political-cartoonist-zunar-will-miss-pm-najib-razak","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-24T05:00:23Z","webTitle":"Malaysia’s top cartoonist says he’ll miss PM who tried to jail him for 43 years","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/24/malaysia-top-political-cartoonist-zunar-will-miss-pm-najib-razak","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/24/malaysia-top-political-cartoonist-zunar-will-miss-pm-najib-razak","fields":{"headline":"Malaysia’s top cartoonist says he’ll miss PM who tried to jail him for 43 years","bodyText":"Few celebrated the fall of the Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak in last month’s election quite like Zulkiflee Anwar Ulhaque. The country’s most controversial political cartoonist, known as Zunar, had spent the past nine years subject to endless arrests and raids, had nine books banned, was charged under six different laws and still faces nine charges of sedition – carrying a sentence of 43 years in jail – simply for using his pen to critique Najib and his wife, Rosmah Mansor. Even so, one month after the election victory for the opposition, Zunar admits he has a twinge of nostalgia. Sure, he is free to travel abroad for the first time in two years and the police are no longer haunting his doorstep, but for a political cartoonist, Najib, mired in corruption scandals and murder allegations, and Rosmah, despised for her ostentatious shopping habits, had been “a total gift”. “Rosmah in particular was a godsend. I miss her, I really do,” says Zunar. “Now they have changed the government it is a challenge for me. What am I going to draw?” For decades, defying a system of repressive sedition laws and state-controlled newspapers, Zunar has used his hard-hitting cartoons to draw attention to the hypocrisy, financial scandals and cover-ups in Malaysian politics that mainstream media kept under wraps. In turn, since 2009, the Najib government used every tool of the state to go after him, also targeting those who printed and bought his work. “I always refused to back down,” says Zunar. “In one interrogation by the police I told them, ‘You can ban my books, you can ban my cartoons but you can’t ban my mind. I will keep drawing until the last drop of my ink runs out, you can’t stop me.’ So they tried different strategies after that.” The police raided his publishers and three different printers – threatening to take away their licences if they continued – confiscated thousands of his books, banned all of his cartoons from being sold in shops, shut down his exhibitions and when, in 2013, he took to selling his works online instead, they arrested his website manager, demanding details of everyone who had bought the works. In 2015, after a cartoon criticising the judiciary, Zunar was arrested again before being charged with sedition. Now with a new government, led by 92-year-old Mahathir Mohamad, pledging a new era of freedom of expression, Zunar is cautiously optimistic. But while his travel ban was dropped the day after the opposition won the election, he is still waiting to hear whether the new attorney general will continue with the August case for his sedition charges. “Until they announce the abolition of the printing and press act, the fake news act and the sedition act, then there is no guarantee the new government won’t use those laws again in the future,” he says. “I will still be pushing for reform. It’s not enough to chop some heads, they need to change the entire system.” Zunar’s troubles began when Najib was made deputy prime minister in 2004. He used cartoons to take on Najib’s alleged corruption and whispered role in the murder of a Mongolian translator, Altantuya Shaariibuu. Najib denied having met the translator, saying he “had nothing to do with the case” and learned of her death only several days afterwards. In response, Zunar depicted Altantuya carrying out her own death – shooting herself twice in the head then blowing up her own body with explosives. After the cartoons were published, officials raided Zunar’s office and confiscated 500 cartoons. They took him in for questioning under the notorious printing and press act – long used to suppress criticism of the government – and banned his book. It was the start of a tango between Zunar and the authorities. Over the nine years of Najib’s tenure as prime minister, Zunar had nine of his books banned, and a letter from the chief of Malaysian police to the immigration authorities in 2015 saw him put on the travel-ban list for two years. Zunar admits he was scared by the threats of decades in prison but “if cartoonists don’t use their talents to wake up the people and open minds about what’s happening, then they are not fulfilling their duty”. He was only 18 when he had his first work banned, a cartoon for his school magazine that critiqued a teacher, but the person Zunar loved to draw most was Najib’s wife, Rosmah. His caustic depiction of her, with huge hair and laden down with luxury goods, became a source of national glee for Malaysians who had grown angry at her for flaunting her expensive lifestyle when many people were struggling to make ends meet. “I couldn’t have survived as a political cartoonist if I depended on Najib alone. Rosmah gave so much material. Forget Najib, she was the most powerful person in Malaysia,” he says. He often depicted her as Malaysia’s answer to Imelda Marcos – the shoe-loving wife of the former Philippines president, Ferdinand Marcos – seeing her as the puppetmaster of Najib, who did her bidding as she sat concealed behind his office chair. Zunar thinks she was behind the instructions to come down hard on him. After he started drawing Rosmah, cartoonists at state-controlled newspapers were given explicit instructions that they were not allowed to depict her in their work. “I always said that in Malaysia there are two individuals you cannot draw in cartoons: one is Rosmah and the other is the Prophet Muhammad,” says Zunar. He now has plans for a new book of works devoted entirely to Rosmah and is contemplating Rosmah, I Miss You as the title."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/24/world-cup-brings-joy-to-fans-brings-misery-to-online-gamblers","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-24T05:00:17Z","webTitle":"As the World Cup brings joy to fans, it brings misery to online gamblers | Kevin McKenna","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/24/world-cup-brings-joy-to-fans-brings-misery-to-online-gamblers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/24/world-cup-brings-joy-to-fans-brings-misery-to-online-gamblers","fields":{"headline":"As the World Cup brings joy to fans, it brings misery to online gamblers","bodyText":"After a while, you find yourself getting accustomed to the absurd chauvinism of English commentators at World Cups. The BBC and ITV seem to vie with each other every four years to provide the most asinine and uninformed coverage of this global extravaganza. There are 32 nations competing at Russia 2018, many with curious and uplifting stories to tell about their paths to the final stages of this tournament. Each of them brings travelling circuses of their supporters, who convey the impression that they are delighted simply to be competing here. Over the course of more than four weeks, they provide a rich source of stories and anecdotes. They have overcome social challenges and survived wars and bring with them their traditions and folk tales. But you won’t find any of their stories on the BBC or ITV, which specialise in bringing us a Brexit view of the World Cup. Our national broadcasters have spent tens of millions of pounds to bring this massive event to our television screens, much of it being trousered by an assortment of semi-literate and ill-informed former pros who simply want to talk about the darts competition at the England training camp. No matter how dramatic and skilful any of these games have been, the half-time analysis must always include a lengthy and meaningless update from England’s training camp. As each World Cup gets bigger and increasingly more colourful and vibrant, BBC and ITV are impervious to it. They manage to achieve something that must take a lot of effort: to ensure that they contribute little to our broader understanding of this global, cultural event. After the first two weeks though, your senses gradually adjust to this daily intake of mince and you are softly anaesthetised by the time the tournament reaches the business end and the stars start to come out to play. When the final comes along, you are even making jolly little spread bets with your chums, predicting the earliest mention of 1966 and how many risible connections Clive Tyldesley can make to England. “And look, there’s Gabriel Jesus. His grandfather once worked on a merchant ship that berthed at Hull who finished 18th in the Championship last season.” And you sometimes reproach yourself for having got so exercised about it all in the first place. The commentators are merely a mild irritant, like a bad end-of-the-pier act at Blackpool during childhood holidays: we’d be a little lost without them. The endless adverts for online gambling products that have wrapped themselves around ITV’s coverage are much more than an irritant. They grow up alongside the football coverage, choking it like weeds. We are never free of them and we know that several thousand poor families are imperilled by them. These are the ones whose lives have been disfigured by problem gambling, the hidden scourge that you can’t identify until it has already hollowed out the person that you love. There are now dozens of online gambling firms spending fortunes in an obscene and frenzied race to get at their chief prey: working-class men on low wages who love football. Even more insidious than big cockney Ray Winstone telling us slyly to “have a bang on that” is the message that comes at the end of the endless procession of gambling adverts beseeching punters to “please gamble responsibly”. It’s nothing more than a cruel joke that subliminally says: “Please gamble…” They know that their target audience is sitting at home with a few beers or in a pub and at their most vulnerable. Smartphone technology means they can be caught in the midst of those moments of euphoria when their side scores. These firms knowingly feed addiction or create new generations of addicts. Last week, the Gambling Commission fined 32Red £2m after it missed more than 20 incidents indicating one customer was a problem gambler. These included an occasion when the punter immediately restaked his seven-figure winnings. The sums involved suggest that this was either a money-laundering operation or a high-roller addict. There was nothing to suggest that further down the financial scale this occurs much more often but escapes scrutiny because of the smaller sums. The football authorities that reach out to these firms for sponsorship and the clubs who allow them to desecrate the club colours with their garish logos are just as culpable in spreading this disease as the gambling conglomerates. They should be ashamed. They are knowingly giving licence to these companies to continue the process of destroying the lives of generations of their most loyal supporters. Adverts for alcohol and cigarettes have long been banned in sport but gambling is allowed to thrive despite being just as toxic as the other two. A little progress was made in the fight against the exploitative practices of the gambling industry when Westminster announced a cap on the maximum stake in fixed odds betting terminals of £2. The Scottish government, while backing the measure, has not yet used its devolved powers to control the number of machines in new betting shops. Holyrood last year moved to curb the number of new betting shops opening in empty shop spaces in the middle of disadvantaged town centres. The gambling industry always finds a way, though, usually with the connivance of football clubs that pretend to be socially concerned: Glasgow, the city most affected by the evil of fixed odds betting terminals, is also home to Scotland’s two biggest football clubs. Celtic and Rangers are both sponsored by major betting firms. • Kevin McKenna is an Observer columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"society/2018/jun/23/slow-booze-summer-millennials-low-alcohol-drinks","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-23T16:02:56Z","webTitle":"Millennials make it a slow booze summer in the UK ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/23/slow-booze-summer-millennials-low-alcohol-drinks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/jun/23/slow-booze-summer-millennials-low-alcohol-drinks","fields":{"headline":"Millennials make it a slow booze summer in the UK ","bodyText":"It’s summer, the World Cup is on, and there’s a heatwave on the way.

Producers are responding to consumer demand for products that fit changing lifestyle habits – we know that overall alcohol consumption is decreasing, particularly among young people – with innovative new products that are lower in alcohol.” Last week drinks giant Diageo launched the UK’s first ever “branded” ready-mixed gin and tonic, made with Gordon’s gin but less than 0.5% alcohol, to tap into burgeoning demand for an “adult” drink that is low in alcohol. A 250ml glass contains just a fifth of a unit of alcohol. In the middle of a controversial government review of how low- and no-alcohol drinks should be labelled, it is also the first in its portfolio to be described as “ultra-low alcohol”. Staff at Diageo’s research laboratory in Essex spent two years developing the drink after research suggested there was not enough choice for drinkers seeking to reduce their alcoholic intake, and that soft drink alternatives were too sweet and sickly. Drinking rates among British adults have plunged to their lowest in 18 years. A recent Office for National Statistics survey found the proportion who drank alcohol at least once a week declined from 64.2% to 56.9% last year. The trend is particularly prevalent among young people: more than a quarter of 16-to-24-year-olds do not drink. And the latest findings from Mintel’s Alcoholic Drinks Review show that 27% of Britons say they are drinking more low- or no-alcohol drinks compared to a few years ago. This rises to 42% of consumers aged 18-24 and 45% of consumers aged 25-34. A sizeable 61% of Britons believe getting drunk is “uncool”, declining to 41% of 18-24s and 47% of those aged 25-34. Supermarkets report rising sales. Asda wine buyer April Rogers said: “The low- and no-alcohol market continues to grow, with everything from sparkling, red and white wines, [to] beer increasing in popularity.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/22/hernan-dario-gomez-panama-you-need-the-pressure-the-fear-the-ball","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-22T18:02:00Z","webTitle":"Hernán Darío Gómez: ‘You need the pressure, the fear, the players – the ball‘ | Sid Lowe","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/22/hernan-dario-gomez-panama-you-need-the-pressure-the-fear-the-ball","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/22/hernan-dario-gomez-panama-you-need-the-pressure-the-fear-the-ball","fields":{"headline":"Hernán Darío Gómez: ‘You need the pressure, fear, players – the ball‘","bodyText":"“And when we got home, they destroyed us.” Hernán Darío Gómez is talking about the aftermath of the 1998 World Cup when Colombia were knocked out by David Beckham’s free-kick in Lens. But it is not really about that; it is about everything: a recurring theme in conversation with the Panama manager covering a professional career that goes back 43 years, 37 as a coach. Pressure, demands, fear, suffering. “It’s frightening,” he says. And the 62-year-old says that when he is not talking about the truly terrifying, genuinely tragic moments through which he has lived. Gómez was Colombia’s assistant when Andrés Escobar was shot dead after his own goal at the 1994 World Cup. During qualification for this tournament the Panama midfielder Amílcar Henríquez was gunned down outside his home. And when he was Ecuador coach, Gómez himself was shot after he did not name a politician’s son in the under‑20s. Smashed in the nose with the butt of a gun during an argument, he lay bleeding as three bullets were fired: the first went through his sleeve, the second ricocheted off the floor, the third hit his thigh. But that was that and this, for now, is just football. Only it is never just football. “Oh, it goes way beyond that,” he says. The question, then, is why? Why do it? Why are you still here? Why not walk away? When Escobar was killed, he says, he asked himself the same. But, he adds, “you think that a lot”. And that day in May 2001 when he was shot he intended to walk away. But, encouraged by his mother after leaving hospital, he did return. Six months later Ecuador qualified for their first World Cup, which is part of the answer. “It’s a passion,” he says. “I don’t know if you get used to it too: maybe you need the pressure, the fear, the pitch, the players – the ball.” He glances down. “My soulmate,” he says. Cradled under his arm is a ball. It is not a prop for the photo, more a comfort blanket. He runs his hands over it. “Balls are spectacular: the feel. I always have one with me: during team talks, walking round the hotel, in the corridor at home. There’s footage where everyone’s celebrating qualification and, unconsciously, I’m there with the ball. I’ve got a room full. Every competition, I try to take a ball.” The collection does not include the ball with which Panama began their historic qualification campaign – Gómez gave it to the Panamanian boxer Roberto “Stone Hands” Duran to look after for good luck and has not yet fulfilled his promise to collect it when they got there – but there are hundreds more. This summer he will add a fifth World Cup ball. Assistant to Francisco “Pancho” Maturana in 1990 and 1994, Gómez was Colombia coach in 1998, Ecuador’s in 2002, Panama’s now. Three decades, three countries. Only one other coach, Henri Michel, has taken three nations to the tournament. “But that’s not the record,” Gómez says. “The record’s taking two who have never been.” Do you feel special? “No, I feel proud.” Born in Medellín, Gómez is the son of a prestigious architect who was a severe disciplinarian whose punishments involved beatings with a belt. Nicknamed “Bolillo”, after he once turned up at training head shaved, leaving him looking like a billiard ball, Hernán was a small, underachieving defensive midfielder who later admitted drinking and sneaking women into the team hotel, before sustaining a knee injury that ended his career. Once an ex-player – although he protests “ex-player doesn’t exist; you die as a footballer” – he managed Guatemala, Ecuador and Colombia twice. The second time, in 2011, he had to resign after hitting a woman outside a Bogotá bar. “I’m ashamed,” he said. He arrived in Panama in 2014 just after they had missed the World Cup because of a last‑minute goal from the US. This time they qualified with a late goal which knocked the US out. Gómez calls 2014 “a tragedy” and says “the players had that ghost.” But, he adds: “It’s not football that does that to you, it’s you, your life. How well did you work? Behave? How loyal were you to the sport? How professional? You pay for bad behaviour; football makes you. And when you behave well, football pays you back. To be a footballer you have to be a professional.” “‘He’s a character,” says one member of the backroom staff, as Gómez talks to players in the team hotel. “What kind of coach am I? It’s also: ‘What kind of person am I?’ And what kind of people are they?” Gómez says. “I’m not one for books or conferences. The main thing isn’t the pitch. In countries like Ecuador, Panama, it’s how you live, the personalities. There are tactical coaches, teachers, but a high percentage is leadership: charisma, intuition, group management. My attitude is: all on the bed or all on the floor, unity and equality. This is the self-esteem of a country. The ‘silver’ comes from clubs, the glory comes from the national team. “I have football in my blood, the football I played. But players have changed,” Gómez adds. “Before they read Condorito [a Chilean comic book] or Playboy; now they read judicial texts. They don’t ‘receive’ information so easily, so passively. You have to give them more. Before, it was ‘you play as a No 10, you 7, you 6, you 8, you 5’” Now they play England. “I remember England in 1966 with Bobby Charlton, Bobby Moore. Gary Lineker in 1986. And Beckham in 1998 and that little striker – Owen! After 1994 the whole country [Colombia] hated us: everywhere we went they abused us. Pancho went to Atlético and I took a declining generation to France, lost to that Beckham free-kick and they destroyed us. You’ll see that again if Colombia don’t finish in the top five. “England always arrived with great names. But this team is even better, in my opinion. Obviously Kane stands out but I see homogeneity, a perfect team. Physically they’re perfect. People talk about ‘modern football’ but ‘modern football’ was played by Germany, by Holland in 1974. What’s changed? Look at England: a young, ordered team in the best physical condition. Slim! And that’s the thing. Neymar’s an example: his physique, the agility. That’s modern football. Diet, conditioning. England look great: so, so slim, stripped down.” Panama look different – and in the final week of dawn training sessions before heading to Russia, that was Gómez’s concern, along with emotional management. This is unlike anything his players have ever experienced and it has been a long journey. “They could write a book,” he says. “When you get there you can grow, but you can shrink too. A World Cup is the greatest party. You see the most beautiful woman and you can dance with her. Your legs tremble.” Gómez says there are four possible results for Panama: win, draw, lose, get hammered. “Belgium are here,” he says, holding his hand up. “England here,” he adds, hand the same height. He drops it a little. “And Tunisia here.” His hand drops further. “And this is us.” “I’m the poor man but, if we’re going to play, let’s play. But let’s compete. Think of Colombia in 1994: everyone said we’d win the World Cup because we’d beaten Argentina 5-0 and what did we do? We pushed high, went to play, and ciao. It’s easy to think ‘that’s it, we qualified, relax’ but I can’t settle for that. No, no, no. I want to depart with dignity. Without going through, we can still leave as winners. By playing well, doing good things, having an idea, showing this team has something. “This has united the country a lot but you know how the world is: lose and this will turn to misery. They’re waiting for us. You suffer. I’m very scared that a team that’s brought a country together, the source of everybody’s happiness, ‘the dream of a nation’...” Gómez says, adopting an affected cinematic voice for the final line. ....is some responsibility? “Yes,” he says. Do you suffer? “Yes. A lot. It’s scary. If we lose some will think all that’s destroyed because we didn’t beat England or Belgium. They’re two candidates to win the World Cup!” If you were going there with them, or with Brazil or Germany, you’d be going to win it? “For sure,” Gómez says. “Look at the Germany coach or Brazil’s, or Mourinho or the managers you always hear about. See if they could come and qualify Panama. But now we have to go again. Others went and never returned – El Salvador for example. We have to work, improve. If not, what’s the point? Go to the World Cup and then just fold your arms?” And yet, even if they never go back, this is huge and it matters. “Ah no, of course: it’s historic,” Gómez says. “No one can ever take that away.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/22/england-harry-maguire-antidote-panama-power","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-22T21:30:38Z","webTitle":"England’s Harry Maguire offers perfect antidote to Panama power | Daniel Taylor","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/22/england-harry-maguire-antidote-panama-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/22/england-harry-maguire-antidote-panama-power","fields":{"headline":"England’s Harry Maguire offers perfect antidote to Panama power","bodyText":"It was getting towards the end of the questions when a hand went up at the back and it became clear one of Harry Maguire’s teammates had snuck into the press conference room to ask, one Yorkshireman to the other, something out of left-field. “It’s Jamie Vardy here from Vardy News,” he wanted to know, holding up his clenched fist as a pretend microphone. “Just how big is the diameter of your head?” The press conference ended there and then but Maguire – or “Slabhead” as Vardy has rather unflatteringly christened him at Leicester City – was smiling as he left and, if nothing else, it left the impression that England have a happy camp. Banter, leg-pulling, mickey‑taking – call it what you will – there has been plenty of it here. And it can be pretty merciless, to say the least. Not that Maguire – 6ft 4in, Sheffield-raised and as broad as the man on the door of your local Wetherspoons – gives the impression he needs much looking after when he starts telling the stories of his rucks with Gary Madine, the most physical opponent he reckons he ever faced in the lower leagues, and the trips to Carlisle and Yeovil, to name but two, where the idea of playing in a World Cup would have seemed fanciful, at best. One theory about Sunday’s game against Panama is they will try to rough up Gareth Southgate’s players. As such, Maguire must be a reassuring presence, with the kind of broken nose that offers a few clues about his trade as a centre-half who has played his way up from the lower divisions, via Sheffield United and Hull City (plus Wigan Athletic on loan). Maguire is a “big lad who can handle himself in a battle”, to use his own description, and hopes to put that to use in Nizhny Novgorod on Sunday. For starters, England spent part of Friday’s training session practising how to deal with Panama’s long throw-ins and making sure they will be better prepared for that tactic than Roy Hodgson’s side were against Iceland in Euro 2016. Plus Maguire showed with the key header before Harry Kane’s stoppage-time winner against Tunisia that a defender his size can be useful in the opposition area. “It’s a big weapon,” he says. “If you look at the goals scored so far in this tournament, it is incredible: over 50% have been from set plays. It’s been a big part of the tournament.” Ultimately, though, Maguire, 25, is in the team because Southgate wants his centre-halves to play out from the back and he has shown himself to be highly competent with the ball at his feet. Maguire has been selected despite Gary Cahill’s improved form at the end of the season and, as Southgate noted after the Tunisia victory, the Leicester defender has fitted in seamlessly bearing in mind he is the only outfield player in the team who is not playing in the Champions League or top-of-the-table encounters. “It’s all new to me, like Gareth Southgate said,” Maguire agrees. “I’ve never played the top‑pressure games – the cup finals, the Champions League nights – but Gareth has shown great faith and trust in me, which I’m really thankful for. “To be part of the starting XI was a really proud moment. It was a great experience. For me, it was a high-pressure game and I can take great belief from that. I will definitely keep my shirt and get it framed when I get home. It will be going up on my wall somewhere in the house.” Maguire has become the first Leicester player to appear in a World Cup for England since Gordon Banks in 1966. The game on Sunday will provide his seventh cap and his impressions of the tournament so far are that England are entitled to think positively. “I haven’t seen a team create as many clear-cut chances as we created in that [Tunisia] game,” he says. “We’ve set ourselves up now in the group to go on [to qualify] and really kick on.” In the process, Southgate appears to have settled on a defence made up exclusively of Yorkshiremen, with Kyle Walker on the right of the three‑man line, John Stones operating centrally and Maguire to the left. Plus, of course, back-up options in the form of Danny Rose, from Doncaster, and Fabian Delph, born in Bradford. “There are quite a lot of Yorkshire lads in the squad and – maybe it’s just a coincidence – they tend to be defenders or defensive midfielders,” is Maguire’s take. “It must be something about the culture of the area.” He appears to have forgotten someone, albeit a player who operates a lot higher up the pitch. But then a hand goes up at the back and it is time for Vardy News, in another Sheffield accent, to go live."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"business/2018/jun/22/bourbon-levis-prices-rise-eu-enforces-tariffs-us","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-22T16:02:34Z","webTitle":"Trump threatens car tariffs after EU sets up £2.5bn of levies on US","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/22/bourbon-levis-prices-rise-eu-enforces-tariffs-us","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jun/22/bourbon-levis-prices-rise-eu-enforces-tariffs-us","fields":{"headline":"Trump threatens car tariffs after EU sets up £2.5bn of levies on US","bodyText":"Donald Trump has threatened to widen the mounting trade dispute between US and the EU by imposing tariffs on European cars, after Brussels made good on its threat of retaliatory levies on American products including bourbon whiskey, Levi’s jeans and Harley-Davidson motorbikes. Raising the stakes in the tit-for-tat exchange of import tariffs threatening to spark a global trade war, the US president tweeted in response to the EU tariffs which came into effect late on Thursday: “If these Tariffs and Barriers are not soon broken down and removed, we will be placing a 20% Tariff on all of their cars coming into the U.S. Build them here!” Trump’s new threat comes after the EU imposed tariffs on a range of US consumer goods in response to steel and aluminium tariffs from the White House, which could increase the cost of consumer goods by £200m per year in the UK alone. Should Trump carry through the levy, it would have damaging consequences for jobs and economic growth on both sides of the Atlantic. Leaders from American and European car manufacturers have previously said such measures would lead to net job losses in the US. The US is the biggest market for EU car exports, accounting for 25% of the €48bn (£42bn) total in 2016, when Germany accounted for just over half of all EU car exports and the UK had the second biggest share, at 13%. Shares in US and European carmakers fell, including Ford, General Motors, Fiat, BMW and Daimler. The US opened a new front in the trade war on Friday, telling the World Trade Organisation that appeals rulings in trade disputes could be vetoed if they took longer than the allowed 90 days. The statement by the US ambassador, Dennis Shea, threatened to erode a key element of trade enforcement at the 23-year-old WTO: binding dispute settlement, which is widely seen as a major bulwark against protectionism. The tariffs from Brussels imposed on consumer goods – designed to target producers in Republican states where Trump draws much of his support – were introduced from 11pm (BST) on Thursday on US goods worth up to €2.8bn (£2.5bn). The White House had refused to exempt its traditional allies from worldwide tariffs on steel and aluminium, which Trump argues are necessary to protect US jobs and industry. The president is also threatening China with tariffs worth up to $200bn over alleged “unfair” trading practices. The EU trade commissioner, Cecilia Malmström, said this week the 28-nation bloc was left with no other choice but to impose tariffs of its own after the “unilateral and unjustified decision of the US”. Brussels drew up the list of products in March when Trump first floated the idea of 25% tariffs on steel and 10% on aluminium. Although American goods already in the UK will not increase in price, shipments leaving the US for Europe from Friday onwards will be charged the tariffs. Customs agents across the EU internal market of 500 million people will impose the duty, hiking prices on US-made products in supermarkets and across factory floors. The EU tax on imported goods in the UK will be collected by HM Revenue &amp; Customs, with some of those duties staying within the country, but the cost for importers, such as wholesale firms and supermarkets, will rise and is likely to be passed on to consumers. Richard Lim, the chief executive of the consultancy Retail Economics, estimated the tariffs could add £200m to the cost of consumer goods in Britain. In 2017, consumers in the UK spent about £406bn on retail purchases. “Though the immediate effects on UK retailers might look relatively modest, it is worth paying close attention to this dispute because it’s future course is unpredictable, fast moving and could quickly escalate to engulf other, seemingly unrelated areas of trade,” he said. Most economists say the consequence of higher international import tariffs will drive up costs for consumers, offsetting much of the benefit of protecting domestic industries for the country imposing them. Analysts at the Oxford Economics consultancy said the consequences for the European economy could be contained in the short term, as the affected imports only account for about 1% of all goods coming into the EU from the US, although it warned tariffs on cars would have a greater negative impact. The EU will impose an additional €3.6bn of tariffs if the dispute is still active in three years’ time. European consumers would be able to find alternatives, said the European commission vice-president for trade, Jyrki Katainen. “If we chose products like Harley-Davidson, peanut butter and bourbon, it’s because there are alternatives on the market. We don’t want to do anything that would harm consumers,” he said. “What’s more, these products will have a strong symbolic political impact.” What US products will be hit by the tariffs? Motorcycles (eg Harley-Davidson) Peanut butter Orange juice Cranberries Kidney beans Sweetcorn Rice Jeans (eg Levi’s) Cigars, cigarettes and tobacco Bourbon whiskey Makeup (eg MAC, Estée Lauder, Clinique) Grilling appliances Yachts (eg Sea Ray cruisers) Playing cards Bed linen Knives and forks Sinks"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/24/european-leaders-urged-to-guarantee-safe-ports-for-migrants","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-24T11:20:01Z","webTitle":"European leaders urged to guarantee safe ports for migrants","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/24/european-leaders-urged-to-guarantee-safe-ports-for-migrants","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/24/european-leaders-urged-to-guarantee-safe-ports-for-migrants","fields":{"headline":"European leaders urged to guarantee safe ports for migrants","bodyText":"Charities operating search-and-rescue missions in the Mediterranean have called on European leaders to urgently guarantee safe ports for migrants and refugees, warning the political standoff is already costing lives. As EU leaders met on Sunday for an emergency summit on migration, a week after 630 people rescued by the Aquarius ship arrived in Spain having been turned away by Italy and Malta, the fate of another vessel remained in limbo. The German NGO Mission Lifeline said its ship, carrying 234 people, was adrift in international waters after Italy refused it entry and Maltese authorities told the vessel to head back to Italy. Some of the charities accused the Italian interior minister, Matteo Salvini, of placing political concerns before lives. A spokesman for the German NGO Sea-Watch said: “It’s absolutely unacceptable that policy is being made at the expense of people in maritime distress.” As well as the 234 people onboard the Lifeline, he said, more than 100 had been rescued off southern Italy on Saturday by the container ship Alexander Maersk. “At the same time, people are drowning in the central Mediterranean Sea,” he said. “The UN refugee agency has put out numbers, with more than 200 people drowned just in the last five days. That’s a direct effect of the policy of crackdown on sea rescue. “We expect a fast solution for the people on the Lifeline and on the Alexander Maersk, because it’s unacceptable for people to be held hostage as a political statement.” A spokesman for Mission Lifeline said it did not know what would happen to those onboard its vessel, or what Italy’s stance could mean for the future. Òscar Camps, the founder of the Spanish charity Proactiva Open Arms, whose ship was impounded by Italian authorities in March, said the number of people drowning in the Mediterranean had risen by 20% since Salvini’s decision to turn away the Aquarius. “It’s not our job to say whether these people are legal or illegal,” he said. “We’re talking about people’s lives and our job is to act. “The only thing that’s illegal at sea are Mr Salvini’s decisions. There are some red lines that shouldn’t be crossed. If they’re crossed, then this could turn into a serious diplomatic situation.” Camps said it would not be practical for ships to ferry rescued migrants and refugees to Spanish ports, even if the new government in Madrid agreed to take in more, as it had with the Aquarius. “That’s not a good idea technically,” he said. “We can’t spend days making for Spain with people onboard in terrible conditions. It uses a lot of fuel.” Rescue ships needed to be allowed into the nearest port, he said, especially if they were carrying injured people who needed medical treatment. “We can’t hang around waiting for ages for them to assign us a port,” Camps said. “We need to act to minimise the loss of life. That’s what any sensible person would do.” SOS Méditerranée, which operates the Aquarius with Médecins Sans Frontières, described the international standoff over its ship as a “wakeup call” and demanded action when EU leaders meet again on Thursday and Friday. “People rescued at sea must be brought to a port of safety where their basic needs are ensured, including specific medical needs, and where they can seek the appropriate protection they are entitled to under both international and national law,” it said in a statement. “Protection from any forms of further abuse, exploitation and trafficking must especially be guaranteed. As the EU will be looking towards new instruments during next week’s EU council, the objective of preserving and protecting lives of people in distress must be discussed, before any other policy consideration.” Last week, Elhadj As Sy, the secretary general of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, said Europe’s treatment of the Aquarius constituted a betrayal of its basic values. MSF, meanwhile, said the episode showed European migration and asylum policies had failed and the EU had lost it its humanity."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2018/jun/22/choreographer-gillian-lynne-west-end-theatre-renamed-lloyd-webber-cats","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-22T15:52:13Z","webTitle":"Choreographer Gillian Lynne has West End theatre named after her","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/jun/22/choreographer-gillian-lynne-west-end-theatre-renamed-lloyd-webber-cats","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/jun/22/choreographer-gillian-lynne-west-end-theatre-renamed-lloyd-webber-cats","fields":{"headline":"Choreographer Gillian Lynne has West End theatre named after her","bodyText":"Carried to the stage on a golden throne and surrounded by dancers from the musical Cats, the choreographer Dame Gillian Lynne has become the first woman to have a theatre named after her in the West End. Lynne, 92, is arguably the leading and most transformative theatre choreographer of her generation. Her shows on stage include Cats and The Phantom of the Opera. On Friday Andrew Lloyd Webber gave her the keys to his New London theatre. He said he was annoyed he had not thought of renaming it after her ages ago. “I saw Gillian at the beginning of the year. She was quite low in spirits and I just thought: it’s so obvious. I mean this is the theatre that started the careers of hundreds, thousands, of people.” Lloyd Webber was with fellow West End impresario Cameron Mackintosh for the naming event. “She was pivotal in our careers,” said Mackintosh. “The success of Cats changed all our lives. For this to happen in Gillian’s lifetime is marvellous and is a brilliant idea of Andrew’s. “Most theatre names are either variations of the royal family or are named after writers so it is wonderful to have the theatre named after someone whose work is so legendary and has been such a great influence.” Lynne started her dancing career as a classical ballerina, joining the Sadler’s Wells Ballet during the second world war and becoming a star of the company as it became the Royal Ballet in 1946. She went on to become a prolific director and choreographer for theatre, film (Yentl) and television (The Muppet Show). But it was Cats, Lloyd Webber’s improbable adaptation of TS Eliot’s Old Possum’s Book of Practical Cats, produced by Mackintosh, that was pivotal. “It was the moment when people said the British can actually sing, dance and act at the same time,” said Lloyd Webber. “Up to that time we were never considered capable of putting a musical on like that.” The show opened in 1981 starring Elaine Paige, a late replacement for Judi Dench who snapped an achilles tendon in rehearsals, with Brian Blessed, Paul Nicholas and Bonnie Langford. It ran in London for 21 years and 18 on Broadway. Lloyd Webber said its success encouraged more young people to want to enter the business . The New London theatre was called the Mogul music hall when it opened in 1847. From 1919 to 1965 it was the Winter Garden theatre, becoming the New London after renovation in 1973. Along with Cats, its successful shows include Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat and War Horse. Its less successful show have included a four-and-a-half-hour musical adaptation of Gone With the Wind and a short running Holocaust musical called Imagine This, set in the Warsaw ghetto. With its department store escalators and many original features the Gillian Lynne theatre still has an appealing 1970s feel to it. It is currently the home of Lloyd Webber’s School of Rock the Musical."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/live/2018/jun/23/world-cup-2018-day-10-buildup-with-belgium-and-germany-in-action-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-23T11:12:15Z","webTitle":"Day 10 buildup with Belgium and Germany in action: World Cup 2018 – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2018/jun/23/world-cup-2018-day-10-buildup-with-belgium-and-germany-in-action-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2018/jun/23/world-cup-2018-day-10-buildup-with-belgium-and-germany-in-action-live","fields":{"headline":"Day 10 buildup with Belgium and Germany in action: World Cup 2018 – as it happened","bodyText":"Right...that’s all from today’s blog but now the real fun is about to begin with some actual football rather than Saturday Kitchen and all that jazz.

During a discussion on their 21st century podcast, which on this occasion has not been hosted by Alan Davies and two blokes from Yorkshire, Keano told Mark Pougatch about the 2002 World Cup, claiming he let Big Mick off lightly. Asked if he could have rebuilt his relationship with the Republic of Ireland manager and gone to the tournament after falling out over claims the midfielder faked an injury, Keane said: I think if there was an apology possibly, yeah. Possibly. Listen, as I said it’s alright me sitting here, listen if you spoke to Mick or somebody or the staff, they might have a different side to it. I know it takes two to tango, but that’s what happened. And once I’d left the hotel, the team left early the next morning, the damage was done. And listen, if there was an apology [that] came my way, there was a mishap or whatever, yeah I think things could have been different. But once I landed back in Ireland, the damage was done. I couldn’t go back in to work with a manager who probably felt that about me. So as I said the damage was done yet strangely enough no-one ever made these accusations against me when I was playing and we were winning matches and we were qualifying, so I found the timing really strange, particularly in front of the staff and the group of players. So as I mentioned earlier, the bibs and the balls and the cones that weren’t there, that was all taken care of, that had settled down and by the end of the week we were kind of laughing and joking about that anyway, as you do, you have to move on, I get that. But to be accused of missing a game because of an injury that I was accused of having, believe it or not I actually let people off lightly, there could have been a lot more trouble, shall we say. Some people have inexplicably questioned why Russia are so good at the World Cup. Their doc has quashed rumours that they might be doping. Andrew Benton has a different scoreline in mind, which is controversial... His repost: “Belgium 2:2 Tunisia more like! “ As we all watch Saturday Kitchen, it is only right that a bit of food preparation is discussed. Here’s what the Mexicans are and, more important, are not eating to avoid doping. I am here! I really am. Scott is off for his much-needed rest ahead of the excitement of Belgium 4-0 Tunisia. And with that, I’m going to pass this blog - and indeed your good self, dear reader - into the loving arms of Will Unwin. Hopefully we’ll see each other again in a couple of hours on the MBM of the big Belgium-Tunisia clash, as another exciting day of hot World Cup action begins. Remember, it only happens once every four years, so savour every last drop! When the fun stops, etc. But if you do fancy lumping on, here’s how the bookies see the World Cup right now. How about that Croatian midfield, huh. 9-2: Brazil, Spain 7-1: France 8-1: Germany, Belgium 10-1: England 12-1: Croatia 16-1: Portugal 20-1: Argentina 25-1: Uruguay 40-1: Russia 50-1: Bar Three Lions Pride: Against Panama tomorrow, an England LGBT supporters association will unfurl a banner that has already made a positive impact in Russia. Shaun Walker in Moscow tells the story. Australia winger Robbie Kruse has been taking flak for his performances from clowns on social media, to the extent that his team-mates are now appealing for the abuse to stop. Kruse and his family have also received threats of violence, which have led to his parents shutting down their Facebook account. “For his own people, for Australians, to be slagging off - it’s not okay,” says Mathew Leckie. “He is, I guess, shocked. It’s just disappointing - not just for him, but for all players. We’re representing Australia. And the people back home that are saying bad things, it’s understandable that they might like some players more than other players. But it doesn’t give anyone the right to abuse a player.” Defender Aziz Behich added: “It’s people that just sit behind a computer that probably have never kicked a ball before. The people that criticise, I don’t think they actually watch the game and how hard he works. What he has been through in his career with injuries and setbacks, a lot of players would have crumbled a long time ago. So it shows just the character he has got. He is a champion and we will be behind him.” Mo Salah has been named as an honorary citizen of Chechnya. Egypt have been based in the republic, and leader Ramzan Kadyrov presented the winger with a badge and a decree at a farewell banquet last night, saying: “Mohamed Salah is an honorary citizen of the Chechen Republic. Yes, that’s right! Tonight I signed a decree conferring this high award on the great footballer and member of the Egypt and Liverpool teams.” More Guardian excellence! Sid Lowe has been talking to Hernán Darío Gómez, the Panama coach. Make another cup of tea, and sit down again, because this is quite a story. Gómez is a man who’s been through the mill all right. “Gómez was Colombia’s assistant when Andrés Escobar was shot dead after his own goal at the 1994 World Cup. During qualification for this tournament the Panama midfielder Amílcar Henríquez was gunned down outside his home. And when he was Ecuador coach, Gómez himself was shot after he did not name a politician’s son in the under‑20s.” Egypt goalkeeper Essam El-Hadary could become the oldest player to compete at a World Cup finals if he plays against Saudi Arabia on Monday. El-Hadary didn’t feature in Egypt’s first two games, but there’s a chance of a sentimental recall, given both teams have already been knocked out and the game in Volgograd will be a dead rubber. El-Hadary will be 45 years, five months and 12 days old on Monday. If he plays, he’ll beat the record of Colombia’s Faryd Mondragon, who came on as a substitute for the last five minutes of a group game against Japan in 2014, aged 43 years and three days. Whether coach Hector Cuper takes that opportunity is another matter, and there have been reports of a row, but it’s all been denied by the Egyptian FA: “El-Hadary supported and praised his teammates. He may be angry for not participating but nothing out of line happened.” (For the record, Roger Milla - you were thinking about Roger Milla, weren’t you - was a sprightly 42 years and 39 days old when he scored for Cameroon in the Oleg Salenko match against Russia at USA 94.) This is also marvellous: Barney Ronay has been watching RT’s coverage of the World Cup, so you don’t have to. The jewel in their coverage being “the great José, trying hard to seem welcoming and nice but still looking like he would beat you into submission with an ivory shoehorn if he could only be bothered – now please leave his penthouse shark aquarium.” Anyone remember Spangles Roy Hodgson? The former England boss has been talking to the Daily Mail, and singing the praises of Ruben Loftus-Cheek, who he reckons has “more strings to his bow” than - a touch random, this - 2002 and 2006 World Cup nearly man Michael Ballack. “I’d say he goes by people more than Ballack did. I think he’s got Ballack’s power and his pace and his strength. But he’s maybe got more strings to his bow than even Ballack had. That’s a bold thing to say, I know, but he’s so good at going past people. He’s got that deceptive turn of pace. In that way he’s a bit like Jack Wilshere really.” A magnificent piece here from our man Simon Burnton. It’s look back at how England prepared for World Cups in the past. Make a cup of tea, sit down, and enjoy every word. This tale, from 1958, particularly caught the eye: The Tottenham manager, Bill Nicholson, had scouted England’s next opponents, Brazil, and under his instruction the second string imitated the Brazilians in a practice match, with Peter Broadbent taking his impersonation of Didi so far he spoke in broken English and cried “caramba!” in particularly heated moments. Spain scraped their way past Iran last Wednesday. It would have been interesting to hear 2010 winner Carles Puyol’s take on La Furia Roja’s performance. But sadly his punditry gig degenerated into farce, according to the BBC. Booked to appear on Iranian state broadcaster IRIB, he wasn’t allowed into their Tehran studio on account of his long hair, which was deemed inappropriate. The spring-curled Puyol played 100 times for Spain, winning two international tournaments, while turning out for one of the biggest clubs in the world for the best part of 15 years; should his look have surprised IRIB this much? The talent booker has questions to answer here. As World Cup controversies go, England’s scrapofpapergate isn’t exactly Bobby Moore and the bracelet in Bogota, is it. Jamie Vardy is also of the opinion that it’s a transient confection, like confetti on the wind. “All that is saying is telling our next opponents we’ve got 23 players in the squad and letting them know their names again,” he reasons. “We find out the team on the morning of the game or the night before and until the gaffer names the team that’s the way it is.” Good news for England ahead of their big game against Panama in Nizhny Novgorod tomorrow lunchtime. Dele Alli is back in training. He’d suffered a minor thigh strain against Tunisia. Whether the 22-year-old Spurs midfielder will be risked this weekend is another matter, not least because Ruben Loftus-Cheek impressed during his brief cameo upon replacing Alli on Monday night, so he might have been benched anyway. But it’s always nice to have options, isn’t it. Some of you might not fancy whistling showtunes all day. If you need to kill an earworm, Max Rushden and Barry Glendenning should be able to help you out, for the latest World Cup Football Daily is pure audio bliss. Contains Brazil, Nigeria and Switzerland, double-headed eagle celebrations, a fine for Mexico, Swedish iPhone notifications and the best club name in the world. Still over seven hours until South Korea take on Mexico. “You quoted the greatest musical (I say with no apologies) ever and now I’ve an earworm and El Tri plays today and where are my tap shoes,” begins Sam ‘Gene Kelly is my #10’ Lopez, before breaking into song. “Neymar supposes his toeses are roses/ but Neymar supposes erroneously! / For Neymar he knowses Coutinho’s are roses like Neymar supposes his toeses to be!” Sports satire, if it had been produced by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. This is what the kids want. Last night’s stramash between Switzerland and Serbia had a fairly entertaining climax. A fine breakaway goal by Xherdan Shaqiri settled it in the last knockings. Shaqiri was more than happy to cop a booking for his celebration, whipping his shirt off in glee. He’s not exactly fat, as folk keep insisting, is he? He also did this: Aleksandar Mitrovic had earlier asked: “If he loves Kosovo so much and decides to flaunt the flag, why did he refuse a chance to play for their team?” But it is possible to feel an affinity to more than one nation state.

BREAKING NEWS: the David Penney who reckons Mexico are gonna do Brazil (see earlier) is not the David Penney. Oxford United and Swansea City fans, stand down. Barney Ronay has watched the World Cup on RT, so you don’t have to. The verdict? “Mourinho’s punditry on RT in Russia is brilliant. And it’s not that it’s ‘good TV’ (Whatever that is) but it’s interesting, not so different, and tells you a bit about being in Russia. Plus it has both The Schmeichel Show and The Collymore Show.” “Morning Jonathan,” hi Ning-Ning Li, “I’m an Englander in China at the moment (not that Alastair Chivers’ girlfriend) and to my luck fell upon these live feeds which I’ve read alongside watching the games. They’ve been really entertaining (as well as a narration I understand). Your mini World-Cup website has turned into my morning check-in, catching up with the results and drama from the games that are aired at 2am over here, like a mini-world-cup-Christmas. And loving the player-by-player guide, as someone who loves football but is no expert it’s very interesting to learn more about the teams, and so easily! As I’m not well versed in all football technicalities, I feel like ‘STOP BEING EFFING DRAMATIC’ to some players is all I can contribute confidently. This tournament has been filled with surprises, here’s to many more. Thanks to you and your team.” Kind words, Ning-Ning, thank you. And if you don’t know about the player guide referenced above, here it is. I’m responsible for the Australian entries, so hopefully nobody picks up any errors. Pjotr van Rooijen is bypassing the professional punditry he earlier decried for his say on the shemozzle that is Argentina. “Against Iceland, Messi had 11 shots on goal, whereas against Croatia he barely touched the ball,” he emails. “I’m fairly certain it was Sampaoli’s idea to relieve Messi of pressure and to let the others play, and his pre-match statements seem to back that up. It failed miserably of course, and led to a complete humiliation against Croatia. What’s disconcerting is that a manager would do a complete 180 like that during a crucial World Cup game, and that’s why I have a feeling there’s more to it. Messi didn’t look right, even during the anthems, and he seemed almost paralysed throughout the game, like Ronaldo in the ‘98 final. Whether it’s the pressure or something else, something is very wrong in the Argentina camp.” Gonna miss Peru. “Mexico are great because it’s a team of little guys which forces technicality over physicality,” emails David Penney. “I think they could embarrass Brazil in the next round, who just look really awful. I thought the Fred-era was bad but this is pretty rubbish.” That’s not former Oxford United and Swansea City’s David Penney is it? Have you ever wanted to put together your all-time German XI? I know I have. And my life was made immeasurably easier by this nifty little extension: If you don’t know your Breitner’s from your Beckenbauer’s, fear not because Andreas Brehme is on hand to give you a helpful nudge. After their incredible victory Mexico are daring to dream. El Tri will be expected to confirm passage to the round of 16 against South Korea in Rostov. Looking ahead to today’s fixtures then, with plenty of focus on Germany’s salvage job against Sweden. Die Mannschaft underwhelmed against Mexico and cannot afford another slip-up. But all is not well in the camp of the defending champions. Oh, and any England fanst getting antsy (geddit!?) about the Panama match needn’t worry. The result has already been foretold by a colony of clairvoyant formicidae in Barnsley. Alongside Stones in the centre of defence is the colossal Harry Maguire (AKA Slabhead), the kind of man any side would want in their line-up against the power and aggression of Panama. John Stones may not be a mainstay for Manchester City but he is becoming integral to Southgate’s plans for England. How about some England analysis? Although they don’t play their second match until tomorrow there’s plenty of talking points coming out of Gareth Southgate’s camp. Not least the starting XI for the clash with Panama. “We obviously have competition for places, strength in depth, players that came off the bench and had an impact on the game the other day,” Southgate said. “I have to balance all those things out when I make a decision on the team. But to play with the freedom, the energy and the pace that we did [against Tunisia] was as good as anything I have seen in the tournament up to this point. The team performed as well as I can remember us playing with the ball in the first hour of the game. I don’t see us making too many changes to what we did.” The Museum of the Russian Academy of Arts in Saint Petersburg is hosting an art project by the Italian artist Fabrizio Birimbelli entitled Like the Gods. The project presents a series of more than 40 portraits of world football stars and coaches in historical uniforms. This is fun. My personal highlight is George Best in the background of Paul Pogba’s portrait. Earlier on, when I said we’d hear more about the Swiss double-eagle celebration, well, here’s some more. It remains to be seen if the gestures crop up on Fifa’s disciplinary radar. “Paulo Dybala hit upon the truth in an interview earlier in the year: Messi is simply too good. Dybala said he found him almost impossible to play with because the temptation is always simply to give him the ball. At club levels players adapt; at national level, where there is less time and a greater range of talent in the squad, it is far more difficult. Everything goes through him and that makes Argentina predictable and susceptible to being frustrated by sides that pack the centre.” “There is no sign the that Argentinian Football Association can steer the path to a brighter future. For the past four years it has talked of rebuilding, restructuring and reforming but all it has managed to do is repeat, relive and reinforce the worst traits and attitudes. Perhaps most damagingly, it opened bids for a youth training project and chose one that was not even part of the bidding contest. Until 15 years ago the country had boasted, for the better part of a century, some of the best and most progressive child and adolescent development traditions in world football. That has been obliterated.” “Maradona cried. If the spirit of Argentinian machismo weeps, it’s fair game for everyone else, and so Argentinian journalists let it pour through their news and analysis immediately after match.” There is a surfeit of Argentinian pain on which to riff. Nigeria’s win sets up a showdown with Argentina. The two meet in the final round of Group D matches and the two-time World Cup winners requiring a win to be in with a chance of progressing to the knockout stage. Even then, an Iceland upset over Croatia could still put a spanner in the works. The other match from yesterday that we haven’t touched on saw Nigeria take a giant step towards the knockout phase with a 2-0 win over Iceland. It was a major improvement on Super Eagles’ first display and one worthy of the much-hyped kit. “Oil rig in Texas here,” emails Steven Winder, “so the matches start right after I finish a 12 hour tour. In any case, I can appreciate Pjotr van Rooijen’s complaint about punditry this year, but he should really appreciate that he doesn’t have Alexi Lalas giving his “in depth analysis”, such as, “Mexico needs to punch Germany on the nose!” In fairness, you could describe what they did in that fashion, but I doubt he knew what he meant going in. I don’t speak Spanish, but I’ve switched entirely over to the Telemundo broadcast for respite.” In the Venn diagram of today’s themes, this is a bullseye. Naturally, much of the focus has been on Neymar (and not just for his pot noodle perm). Coach Tite is unperturbed though, confident his star man will find form the more minutes he gets under his belt. Elsewhere in Switzerland’s Group E, Brazil made very heavy weather of Costa Rica. Two late goals earned the three points but after two matches doubts remain over the Selecao’s form and they could well be on course for a round of 16 meeting with (insert dramatic ‘duh duh duhhhhhh’ music) Germany. The odds on that combination before the start of the tournament must have been at least 7-1. Like many of you it seems, Pjotr van Rooijen is unimpressed with the state of World Cup punditry on UK TV. “Phil Neville has appropriated the term ‘in and around the box’ and now just uses ‘in and around’ for everything,” he laments. “During the Germany – Mexico game he was saying ‘in and around the ball’ and ‘in and around Kroos,’ and that just doesn’t really work does it? You can be in the box, but can you be ‘in’ the ball? Can you be ‘in’ Kroos? I suppose you can, but not during a football match. In terms of punditry and co commentators, this might be the worst World Cup ever.” Before we forget VAR entirely, if VAR analysis is your thing, keep up to date with its progress here: Like Yury Gazinsky, Alastair Chivers is in early with the first email of the day. “Bloody hell mate,” he begins, “how are you up so early for the build up? My girlfriend has just left for China :( so that’s why I’m watching all the highlights at the moment. The Guardian better be getting you the best breakfast donuts or something!” First of all, sorry about the absence of your girlfriend, although - on the bright side - it’s not the worst couple of weeks to be home alone. As for the donuts, it’s mid-afternoon here in Australia where The Guardian also has a presence. So, as much as I’d like to claim hardship, I deserve no pity. I may well do later this week though with the crucial Australia vs. Peru clash kicking off at midnight Down Under. Serbia were also denied a penalty despite the Swiss executing a two-man tackle that would not have been out of place in a rugby league international. Presumably the VAR operators were binge watching Peaky Blinders or something. Switzerland’s win arrived dripping in intrigue thanks to the Kosovar heritage of goalscorers Xherdan Shaqiri and Granit Xhaka, controversy foreseen by Nick Ames. Xhaka and Shakiri celebrated by making provocative double-eagle gestures, of which more will be heard, I’m sure. Ok, back to the football, yesterday’s action was surprisingly eventful. In particular Switzerland’s victory over Serbia that sees them take a big step towards qualifying out of Group E and puts Brazil at risk of finishing second in the group or even failing to reach the knockout stages at all. Sticking with fashion, because I know that’s why you tuned in, I’m sure it escaped the attention of nobody that Neymar sported his second striking haircut of Russia 2018 in yesterday’s late show against Costa Rica. I can only hope the Selecao superstar intends to manipulate his mane on a match-by-match basis throughout the tournament - and that Brazil make it all the way to the final. Imagine the possibilities... Speaking of Sampaoli, remember when the debate used to be suit or tracksuit? At this world cup it seems to have become suit with shirt or suit with t-shirt. Anyone who thinks the latter is a good look is dead to me. Hello everybody and welcome to the start of day 10 of Russia 2018, a day of reckoning for pre-tournament favourites Germany. Incredibly, by the close of business the reigning champions’ World Cup defence could be kaput. As well as Germany vs. Sweden we have South Korea vs. Mexico, and Belgium vs. Tunisia to look forward to. There’s also the wins for Brazil, Switzerland and Nigeria to look back on from yesterday. In and around that feast of football we’ll check in with some of the incredible content pulsing through the only World Cup microsite you could ever need, and hopefully spin some gold of our own right here.

To ease us all in gently how about settling back and indulging in the latest World Cup Football Daily?

Do you thank the driver? The question of public transport protocol has become an unlikely meme on social media, alongside claims that it is the ultimate test of character – with those who give voice to their gratitude hailed as “the best of humanity”. According to KnowYourMeme.com, the meme originated on Reddit two weeks ago, when a user elevated “people who say thanks to the bus driver” to pharaoh status. From Reddit, the meme – reminiscent of so-called “wholesome memes”, a knowing attempt to make the internet a kinder place – spread to other platforms and was applied to various established formats, such as Exploding Brain. “People who don’t say thanks to the bus driver” were also condemned. The popular Instagram account Brown Cardigan, followed by nearly 400,000 people, embraced the cause with characteristic near-deranged fervour, collating the best – and increasingly aggressive – expressions of “unrelenting gratitude” under the hashtag: #justthankingbusdriverthings. Brown Cardigan concluded its frenzy with an apparent screenshot of a fabricated story in The Australian newspaper headlined: “Bus drivers around the country recieving [sic] wave of praise”. “WOW. Huge. Memes that change lives and empower everyday heroes. Our job here is done,” read the caption beneath the story, which reported “a whole new sense of job satisfaction” and even an uptick in career change inquiries. Brown Cardigan’s self-appointment as a “conductor of goodwill” may have been facetious, but the meme nevertheless sparked an earnest debate about passenger etiquette. At the time of writing, a BuzzFeed poll had found that more than 15,300 people said they thanked the driver – 82% of respondents – while just 8% admitted to alighting in silence. Just over 1,000 (6%) said they opted to “give the driver the nod”, while 4% claimed – one would assume, falsely – to say: “Thanks for getting me to my stop while working under such brutal conditions.” But debate elsewhere on the internet flagged the possibility that the weight of the implicit expectation to thank your bus driver could vary by region. In Australia, where Brown Cardigan is based, a loud “CHEERS DRIVER” or exaggerated nod of thanks is de rigueur on alighting the bus, in the smaller cities of Brisbane and Perth in particular, but not infrequently in Sydney. Roy Molloy, an Australian musician, tweeted that he had “never been so serious in [his] entire life” as he was about the importance of thanking the bus driver. His tweet caught the attention of Gladiator actor and lively tweeter Russell Crowe, who agreed, adding: “It’s simple common courtesy.” But discussion in New Urbanist Memes for Transit-Oriented Teens – a Facebook group of nearly 100,000 mostly millennials interested in urbanist issues – suggested that view was by no means the case elsewhere in the world. Londoners in particular were singled out for scrutiny. One member described thanking the bus driver as “Irish culture”. “I used to thank bus drivers when I lived in a city where that was a thing people did,” wrote one commenter. “For now, I live in a city that mercifully rejects small talk and the forced emotional labor of giving and accepting thanks (New York) – so I no longer do.” Several respondents distinguished between the relative convenience of expressing their thanks while exiting from the front door, and the potentially unseemly volume necessary to be heard from the back. A minority were unapologetically ungrateful. One woman wrote: “I don’t talk to strangers so I don’t thank my bus driver.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/23/drc-jean-pierre-bemba-expected-home-within-weeks-kabila","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-23T08:00:06Z","webTitle":"DRC set for turmoil as Jean-Pierre Bemba expected home within weeks","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/23/drc-jean-pierre-bemba-expected-home-within-weeks-kabila","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/23/drc-jean-pierre-bemba-expected-home-within-weeks-kabila","fields":{"headline":"DRC set for turmoil as Jean-Pierre Bemba expected home within weeks","bodyText":"Jean-Pierre Bemba, the Congolese opposition leader whose war crimes convictions at the international criminal court (ICC) were quashed, is expected to return to the Democratic Republic of the Congo within weeks, risking an intense new phase of political manoeuvring and instability in the vast and impoverished central African state. Bemba, a former rebel leader and vice president, left the country in 2007 and spent the last 10 years in prison in The Hague before his surprise acquittal on appeal. The 55-year-old is free in Belgium pending a hearing on a separate conviction for attempting to influence witnesses, but will travel to his homeland to attend a party congress to select a candidate for a presidential election due in December, a party spokesman said on Friday. Joseph Kabila, whose second term expired in 2016, has repeatedly postponed the poll. He is barred from a third term by the constitution and his close associates have repeatedly denied that he hopes to find a way to stand again. Bemba has a powerful support base in the DRC and experts describe his return as “a huge wildcard”. “On his own, as an opposition leader, he could do extremely well,” said Stephanie Wolters, an analyst based in South Africa. “He is seen as a victim of Joseph Kabila’s politics and of international politics. If the opposition unite it would be very hard to see a Kabila victory that was anything but stolen.” The opposition in the DRC is fragmented, with neither of the two current main leaders – Félix Tshisekedi and Moïse Katumbi – committing to a formal coalition backing a single candidate. Bemba unsuccessfully opposed Kabila in elections in 2006. After his militia clashed violently with government forces in 2007, he was forced out of the DRC and arrested in Belgium. Judges at the ICC initially found Bemba guilty on five counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by his private army during a five-month rampage in the neighbouring Central African Republic in 2002. Bemba had sent his militia, the MLC – a rebel force that he later transformed into a political organisation – into the Congo’s northern neighbour to quash a coup against the then president, Ange-Félix Patassé. The 18-year sentence was the longest ever to be handed down by the court. “Many people in the DRC have always seen his indictment for crimes in the CAR as politicised. He is the only politician of national stature to be sent to The Hague and is a lot more credible as an opposition leader than Katumbi or Tshisekedi,” said Wolters. The attitude of regional powers will be key in coming months, with western powers seemingly without significant influence on Kabila, who succeeded his assassinated father, Laurent, in 2001. The US said on Thursday it had imposed visa bans on several unidentified senior officials in the DRC for corruption tied to the country’s electoral process to send a “strong signal” about the need for a peaceful transfer of power. The move comes after the US Treasury sanctioned the Israeli billionaire Dan Gertler on15 June, saying he had amassed a fortune through corrupt mining and oil deals in the DRC using his close friendship with Kabila. Sasha Lezhnev, deputy policy director at the nonprofit rights group Enough Project, called Thursday’s visa ban an important step “to dissuade Kabila from putting his name on the ballot and help ensure a credible election”. “Several senior Congolese officials involved in corruption travel frequently to the US, so the visa ban is an important step,” said Lezhnev. “They or the businesses they partner with also use US banks to process corrupt commercial deals, so the US and EU should enact stronger sanctions on their corporate networks to target their assets.” Corruption costs the DRC at least $15bn each year, or about three times its annual budget, according to Kabila’s anti-graft adviser. “It’s an open secret that corruption exists and it is seriously eating away at institutions,” Emmanuel Luzolo Bambi told the UN’s news website Okapi.

New voices please","bodyText":"Comedy controller Shane Allen caused traditionalist nostrils to quiver with mild outrage last week when he announced the BBC’s new slate of sitcoms and sketch shows, some of which have been written by men, some by women and some by people who are not white. “We get excited by the stories that haven’t been told and the voices we haven’t yet heard, which is why you’ll see more and more diversity of all kinds of output over the next few years as we break new ground,” he said. It seems impossible to have a conversation about the future of comedy without bringing up 50-year-old sketch series Monty Python’s Flying Circus, so someone did and Allen replied, continuing his emphasis on insisting that new voices be heard. “If you’re going to assemble a team now, it’s not going to be six Oxbridge white blokes. It’s going to be a diverse range of people who reflect the modern world.” Naturally, this kicking, or nudging, of the sacred cow (parrot?) became the focus of all subsequent discussion. John Cleese took umbrage, saying Python were “diverse for their time” and calling Allen “head of social engineering”. Don’t mention the comedy war. Perhaps I read a different account of Allen’s announcement and that he actually revealed that not only had he commissioned a comedy drama about a nine-year-old girl with learning disabilities, but he would also therefore as a direct result be scrubbing all mention of Monty Python from BBC history and ban it from ever being discussed again. Monty Python exists. It’s already there. The diversity police aren’t coming to take it away. They didn’t even take overtly racist 1970s sitcoms such as Till Death Us Do Part and Love Thy Neighbour, which you can still buy on DVD, so I think Hell’s Grannies and silly walks are safe for now. As Allen said, it’s about finding stories that haven’t been told before and I find it odd that people find that threatening rather than exciting. Some of the standup sets that have been truly incendiary over the last few years – Tig Notaro discussing her breast cancer, Hannibal Buress reminding the world that Bill Cosby was a rapist, and more recently, Cameron Esposito’s excellent Rape Jokes, which has been called “the first great standup set of the #MeToo era” – would not have existed 50 years ago. That’s a thrilling advertisement for change. Because qualities such as vitality and originality not only drive comedy forward, but are responsible for groundbreaking performers coming to the fore. Like, say, the cast of Monty Python. Why on earth should Catherine Zeta-Jones eat humble pie? Catherine Zeta-Jones has had enough of pussyfooting around the important stuff. “One thing I’m not is humble any more,” the Welsh actor, Hollywood superstar and humility opponent told the Mirror. “I’m sick of being humble. I really am. ‘So sorry I’m rich, so sorry I’m married to a movie star, so sorry I’m not so bad looking.’ ” It’s an unusually forthright sentiment for a woman, when they are usually supposed to pretend that they haven’t noticed how successful they are, as if it happened by accident. It’s also off-brand for an actor, because very famous ones are often a heady brew of rampant ego and more rampant insecurity, who tend to wrap this emotional confusion in a bow of practised humility. Award ceremony speeches are long testaments of gratitude, to those who made it possible, to luck, to opportunity, to anything but tenacity and graft. While many trade on likability and relatability, Zeta-Jones is being boldly, shamelessly unrelatable to almost every other person on the planet, most of whom are not rich, married to a movie star or as drop-dead gorgeous. “I come from a working-class family in Wales and I worked to get to where I am,” she said, justifying the fact that she’s pretty pleased with where she’s ended up and doesn’t feel bad about saying so. This is the same reason I have a soft spot for the current era of Madonna, not her strongest musically, but the most unabashedly fun (and for her determination to reclaim the b-word). For further listening, see Unapologetic Bitch and Bitch I’m Madonna. Oh don’t snigger at non-Tory boy Alfie Deyes Those looking for a new comedy experience would do well to check in on YouTuber Alfie Deyes, whose week has been most amusing, although perhaps not for him. After uploading a 36-minute video, in which he challenged himself to live on £1 for 24 hours, for the #content, Deyes faced a backlash from some fans who found the sentiment of “living on £1 for the day” to be a little insensitive to the many people who have to do that for the #everydaylife. Eventually, he deleted the video, posting an apology in which he seemed upset by some of the more pointed criticism he had received. “The amount of tweets yesterday calling me a Tory… I feel like I just have to say in this video right now, that is for sure not the case,” he declared. Denying that one is a Tory then became a meme of its own, although it’s given me the unusual experience of feeling sorry for a vlogger who is surely entitled to say he’s not a Tory if he wants to. Perhaps he might want to read the sole book on the shelf in the background of that clip, Brutal Simplicity of Thought (I’m saying nothing), by Maurice Saatchi, former chairman of the Conservative party. • Rebecca Nicholson is an Observer columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jun/22/did-melanias-jacket-hide-message-and-do-u-really-care","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-22T15:48:33Z","webTitle":"Did Melania's jacket hide a message?

And do u really care?","bodyText":"“Whaaaaa!?” was the collective reaction to photos of the first lady, Melania Trump, visiting an immigrant child detention centre in Texas on Thursday wearing an oversize army coat from Zara on which the following words were scrawled: “I REALLY DON’T CARE, DO U?” And just like that, the Trump presidency found a new motto, taking over from the campaign’s Make America Great Again mantra. “It’s a jacket, there was no hidden message,” the first lady’s communications director, Stephanie Grisham, said. “I hope the media isn’t going to choose to focus on her wardrobe.” That hope has proved to be in vain because, for once, it looked like a White House communications director spoke the plain truth: the message was certainly not hidden, it was literally written across the first lady’s back. And she chose to sport this message to visit unaccompanied migrant children, some of whom had been separated from their parents due to a widely criticised policy from the Trump administration. The first lady herself had appeared to criticise the policy when she put out a statement earlier this week that she “hates to see children separated from their families”. At the time, this was seen as a condemnation of her husband’s policy, but perhaps she meant that she literally hates to see those children. I don’t really care, do u? As the media went into meltdown over what is already known as jacketgate, Grisham huffily tweeted a further comment: “Today’s visit w the children affected @flotus greatly. If media would spend their time &amp; energy on her actions &amp; efforts to help kids – rather than speculate &amp; focus on her wardrobe – we could get so much accomplished on behalf of children. #SheCares #ItsJustAJacket.” But is it just a jacket? This is not the first time an outfit of Melania’s has prompted fevered interpretation. There was the Gucci pussy-bow blouse she wore after the infamous pussygate tapes were released, in which her husband was recorded bragging that he likes to grab women by the aforementioned anatomical part. Then there was the white trouser suit, an outfit associated with female empowerment, she wore for her first public appearance after the allegations emerged about her husband’s affair with the porn star Stormy Daniels. But it’s never clear if the first lady understands the irony of her clothes or whether we are imposing irony on her. Is she spinning us or are we spinning ourselves? “There is the fashion rule: once is a fluke; twice is a coincidence; but three times? That’s a trend. At this point, I don’t think there’s any way all this is an accident,” says Vanessa Friedman, the fashion director of the New York Times. The jacket is also different from her previous fashion faux pas in that, as well as featuring actual words, it’s not like anything the extremely fashion-conscious and high-spending Melania would normally wear. When she wore ridiculously high heels in April to visit victims of Hurricane Harvey in Texas, the look was absurd, but of a piece with her usual wardrobe. Does she keep this $39 Zara slogan jacket in her closet next to her $50,000 floral Dolce and Gabbana coat? And why did she need a coat in DC in June – temperature on Thursday: 23C (74F) – anyway? “We know she does buy her own clothes and has final say over them, even if a stylist selects them. She has agency over her appearances. She made the decision to put that jacket on,” says Friedman. Despite the first lady’s office insisting there was no message, the president swiftly contradicted that and tweeted on Thursday night that the jacket “refers to the Fake News Media. Melania has learned how dishonest they, and she truly no longer cares!” Others suggested she is showing, despite her statement earlier this week, that she is on the same side as the president. The tenaciously optimistic few who still see her as a rebel within the administration have suggested the message is actually directed at her husband. Whoever the petulant message was aimed at, Melania used a trip to meet incarcerated children to send it, which is not something Eleanor Roosevelt, Jackie Kennedy or any first lady in history before her ever did. Another possibility is that this was yet another example of the Trump administration distracting from something by causing chaos elsewhere. And there is plenty they might want to distract people from, including the ongoing Russia probe and the president’s plans to target welfare programmes which serve more than 42 million Americans. Friedman says: “I think in this case she is just as smart as we give her credit for. What the jacket reflects, in a more general sense, is that when it comes to some of the conventions of her role, Mrs Trump is as willing to break the rules as her husband.” Part of the reason Melania’s clothes are so excitedly decoded is because she herself hardly speaks. She had taken her coat off by the time she walked into the New Hope Children’s Centre in McAllen, Texas, but it was impossible to tell from anything she said during her visit what she thinks of the political situation. When an employee of the facility told her the average length of stay for unaccompanied children aged 12-17 is 42-45 days, she replied: “That’s great!” Her advice to one group of unaccompanied children, many of whom are around the same age as her son Barron, was: “Be kind and nice to each other, OK?” And to another group of child detainees, she had a simple message: “Good luck!”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/jun/27/joe-jackson-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-27T16:44:13Z","webTitle":"Joe Jackson obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jun/27/joe-jackson-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/jun/27/joe-jackson-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Joe Jackson obituary","bodyText":"Had it not been for Joseph Jackson, who has died aged 89, the world would almost certainly never have experienced the pop music phenomena of the Jackson 5 and Michael Jackson, nor seen the success of La Toya Jackson and Janet Jackson. As the father of this remarkable brood of talented children, Joe raised them and guided their careers with unbending single-mindedness. Though he achieved extraordinary results, the process was often painful and controversial. In 1993 Michael told Oprah Winfrey that he had been physically and emotionally abused by his father, and would literally be sick at the sight of him. Michael had sacked Joe as his manager in 1979, and the other Jackson brothers followed suit in 1983. Janet recalled that she had once tried to call Joe “dad”, but was instructed always to address him as “Joseph”. Appearing on Piers Morgan’s CNN talk show in 2013, Joe argued that “my kids was brought up in a way so they respect people, and they never was on drugs. They never went to jail, wasn’t in no gangs or nothing. They were brought up professionally.” Born in Fountain Hill, Arkansas, Joe was the eldest of five children of Samuel Jackson, a teacher, and his wife, Crystal (nee King). Evidently Joe learned the idea of strict parenting from his own parents. As Joe’s future wife, Katherine, wrote in her memoir, My Family, the Jacksons (1990): “Judging by the times that I heard Sam and Crystal Jackson utter the words ‘I love you’ – zero – Joe didn’t hear them often, if ever, when he was growing up.” Joe later described his childhood as “lonely”. His parents split up when he was 12, and Joe moved to Oakland, California, with his father, while his mother went to live in East Chicago, Indiana. At 18 he moved to East Chicago and began to show promise as a boxer. He was already married, but began an affair with 17-year-old Katherine Scruse. He swiftly had his first marriage annulled and married Katherine in November 1949. The couple moved into a two-bedroom house in Gary, Indiana, and when their first child, Maureen (known as Rebbie), was born in May 1950, Joe abandoned boxing for the security of a full-time job as a crane operator at US Steel. Joe also harboured ambitions as a musician, and during the 50s he and his brother Luther played guitar in a blues band, the Falcons, which never took off commercially and eventually split up. Meanwhile, by 1957 Joe and Katherine had four sons, Jackie, Tito, Jermaine and Marlon, as well as another daughter, La Toya. Michael arrived in 1958 and Randy in 1961, with Janet, the youngest, born in 1966. It was when he heard Tito playing the guitar that Joe became aware of the family’s latent musical talent. In 1963, Tito, Jermaine and Jackie formed a group, the Jackson Brothers, with their father as their manager. Joe purchased microphones and amplifiers so they could rehearse at home. They were joined by Ronnie Rancifer on keyboards and Johnny Jackson (no relation) on drums, and Joe put the group out on a gruelling schedule of talent shows, mostly playing covers of Motown hits. With the addition of Marlon and Michael, the group became the Jackson 5. After winning talent competitions at such prestigious venues as the Regal theatre, Chicago, and the Apollo theatre, Harlem, New York, they released a couple of singles on Steeltown Records before signing to Motown Records in March 1969. Their first four singles for the label topped the Billboard Hot 100, and they scored seven top 10 singles in a two-year period. With the group becoming Motown’s top priority and enjoying international chart success, Joe moved the family to a mansion in Encino, California. In 1971 Michael launched his solo career, and the following year had his first chart-topping hit with Ben. Jermaine also branched out into solo work. But the stellar chart performance of the Jackson 5 was beginning to tail off, and Joe became dissatisfied with Motown’s efforts on behalf of his boys, as well as with the label’s poor royalty rate. Having masterminded a nightclub act in Las Vegas involving all the Jackson siblings, he negotiated a new and vastly more lucrative deal for the Jackson 5 with Epic Records in 1975, though Jermaine chose to remain at Motown. He was replaced in the group – now called the Jacksons, since Motown owned the Jackson 5 name – by Randy. After a sluggish start, the Jacksons enjoyed a string of hit albums on Epic, including Destiny (1978) and Triumph (1980), but they were eclipsed by Michael’s solo success. In 1982 he released Thriller, which would become the biggest-selling album in pop history, and after the Jacksons’ Victory album and tour in 1984, announced he was leaving. 2300 Jackson Street (1989), released by the remaining quartet, was the end of the band, apart from a couple of reunion shows in 2001 and the shambolic Unity tour in 2012. No longer involved in managing his sons, Joe put his skills to work on behalf of his daughters, Rebbie, La Toya and Janet, but all of them dispensed with his services in due course. Janet, who parted company with Joe after her album Dream Street (1984), said: “I just wanted to get out of the house, get out from under my father, which was one of the most difficult things that I had to do.” Joe’s public image became tarnished by revelations about the way he had treated his children, although Jermaine, Tito, Marlon and Jackie insisted he had not been abusive. In her autobiography Growing Up in the Jackson Family (1991), La Toya accused Joe of child abuse, though she was later reconciled with him. In 2003, Joe told the documentary maker Louis Theroux that he used to hit Michael when he was a child (“I whipped him with a switch and a belt”), but claimed that this was different from “beating” him. “I never beat him,” he said. “You beat someone with a stick.” He repeated it to Oprah Winfrey in 2010, but said: “No, I don’t regret it.” Joe’s infidelities during his marriage also became public knowledge. In 1974 he had a daughter, Joh’Vonnie, with Cheryl Terrell, with whom he conducted a 25-year affair. However, despite stories that he was estranged from Katherine and that she had filed for divorce, the couple continued to maintain publicly that their marriage remained intact. When Michael died in 2009, his will named his mother as guardian of his three children, and he left nothing to Joe. However, in an eloquent speech to the Oxford Union in 2001 to launch his Heal the Kids charity, Michael had described how he had been able to forgive his father. Noting that Joe had endured a hard upbringing during the Depression and had then struggled to support his own large family, he said: “I have begun to see that even my father’s harshness was a kind of love, an imperfect love, to be sure, but love nonetheless. He pushed me because he loved me. Because he wanted no man ever to look down at his offspring. And now with time, rather than bitterness, I feel blessing. In the place of anger, I have found absolution. And in the place of revenge, I have found reconciliation. And my initial fury has slowly given way to forgiveness.” In 2014, Joe accepted on Michael’s behalf a posthumous Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame award. At the same ceremony, Joe received a Lifetime Achievement award. He is survived by Katherine and their children Rebbie, Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, La Toya, Marlon, Randy and Janet; and by Joh’Vonnie. • Joseph Walter Jackson, businessman, born 26 July 1928; died 27 June 2018"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2018/jun/22/from-face-masks-to-tooth-whitener-ingenious-ways-to-use-up-the-strawberry-surplus","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-22T14:01:52Z","webTitle":"From face masks to ​tooth whitener: ingenious ways to use up ​the strawberry surplus","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2018/jun/22/from-face-masks-to-tooth-whitener-ingenious-ways-to-use-up-the-strawberry-surplus","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2018/jun/22/from-face-masks-to-tooth-whitener-ingenious-ways-to-use-up-the-strawberry-surplus","fields":{"headline":"From face masks to ​tooth whitener: ingenious ways to use up ​the strawberry surplus","bodyText":"The recent bout of hot weather following an icy spring has led to a glut of strawberries in the UK that are much sweeter and juicier than usual. They are also being sold off cheaply by the country’s biggest retailers – Aldi is flogging 400g punnets for £1.39, while Tesco is selling two for £3. Stocking up on bargains is tempting, but knowing what to do with all that surplus fruit when you’ve had enough strawberries and cream can be tricky. Here are four ways to make this year’s crop of strawberries go further: Strawberry butter One way to preserve berries is to turn them into a delicious spread for croissants, muffins and fresh bread. Chop 100g of strawberries into small pieces and mash. In a separate bowl, blend 110g of soft butter and 4tbs sugar. Mix together and store in the fridge in a sealed jar or container. Tooth whitener Using a food which is rich in both sugar and acid as alternative dental care may sound counterintuitive, but when used sporadically, strawberries can work as a natural tooth whitener. The malic acid in the fruit can apparently both soften and dissolve stains. Mush up a strawberry and mix it with a spoonful of bicarbonate of soda in a small bowl – then brush on to teeth. Just remember that you will need to brush with regular toothpaste afterwards. Strawberry salsa It may sound like an odd combination, but strawberries have been used to switch up savoury dishes by cooks for years, from Yotam Ottolenghi’s strawberry ketchup to Jamie Oliver’s strawberry balsamic risotto. A great barbecue sauce is a sweet strawberry salsa dip. Hull and dice a punnet of strawberries and finely chop a jalapeño with the stem and seeds removed. Mix in with half a diced red onion, a handful of coriander, two tablespoons of lime juice and a pinch of salt and black pepper. Strawberry face mask The vitamin C in strawberries is said to revitalise and fight oily skin, plus the acidity targets excess sebum (it has even been suggested that it can lighten acne scars). Make a simple, natural face mask by smashing ⅔ of a punnet of strawberries into a pulp, then mix with two spoons of honey and three dollops of natural yoghurt until it forms a smooth paste. Massage into your face (avoiding the eyes and mouth) and leave for five minutes before washing off."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/23/kashmir-on-edge-after-local-government-falls-amid-militant-clashes","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-23T06:00:03Z","webTitle":"Kashmir on edge after local government falls amid militant clashes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/23/kashmir-on-edge-after-local-government-falls-amid-militant-clashes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/23/kashmir-on-edge-after-local-government-falls-amid-militant-clashes","fields":{"headline":"Kashmir on edge after local government falls amid militant clashes","bodyText":"The disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir is on edge after clashes between militants and security forces, and the collapse of the local government over disagreements that include how to tackle the resurgent fighting in the state. A month-long unilateral ceasefire declared by the Indian government for Ramadan expired a week ago. Recent events, including the first official acknowledgement that Islamic State-inspired fighters may be operating in Kashmir, have raised fears of another violent summer ahead for the troubled region. In the latest incident on Friday, security forces fought a nearly seven-hour gun battle with militants in the southern district of Anantnag. Four rebels, a police officer and a civilian were killed in the shooting, police said. It is the third clash between Indian authorities and militants since the end of Ramadan, during which security forces had suspended their operations as part of a new push to initiate dialogue with separatists, whose goals include independence or merger with Pakistan. Police chief Shesh Paul Vaid identified the slain fighters as members of a local unit that claims to be affiliated with Isis. This is the first time the police have acknowledged the presence of Isis-inspired or affiliated fighters in Kashmir. The Isis-affiliated “news service” Amaq issued a statement on Friday claiming the fighters were members of its group, but analysts have raised doubts about what contact, if any, the terrorist group has with the militant group, which calls itself Islamic State Jammu and Kashmir (ISJK). The restarting of security operations after Ramadan and the decision of authorities to acknowledge the existence of ISJK come during a period of political instability in Kashmir after the collapse of the state government this week. The Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata party (BJP), which is part of the national government, announced on Tuesday that it was pulling out of a governing coalition with the local Jammu and Kashmir Peoples Democratic party, known by the initials PDP. Ram Madhav, the BJP official who brokered the alliance in 2015, said it was no longer tenable “keeping in mind the largest interest of India’s integrity and to bring the deteriorating situation in the state under control”. The intensity of fighting in Kashmir has steadily grown in the past three years with the emergence of a new generation of anti-India militants. The BJP has traditionally favoured taking a hard line against Kashmiri separatism, a stance that put pressure on its alliance with the PDP, which is considered more sympathetic to the cause. How to tackle the militancy was thought to be a deep fault line in the relationship. “We have always said muscular [security] policy will not work in Jammu and Kashmir,” the PDP leader, Mehbooba Mufti, said on Tuesday after the collapse of the government. “We cannot treat Jammu and Kashmir as an enemy territory.” Additional checkpoints have sprung up in restive parts of Kashmir since the collapse of the government. Control of the state has temporarily passed to its governor, NN Vohra, until a new government can be formed. Vaid said he expected security operations would “intensify” in coming days and that the job of police would become “much easier” under Vohra’s rule. Kashmir, a former princely state (semi-sovereign territory) under the Raj, has been divided since 1947 between sections controlled by Pakistan, India and China. Pakistan and India both claim the entire region as their own. A United Nations resolution issued in 1948 demands that India allow Kashmiris a plebiscite to decide whether they remain part of the Indian union or become independent, but no such vote has ever been organised by Delhi. An armed rebellion broke out in 1989 against Indian rule and has raged at varying levels of intensity in the years since. The fighting is thought to have killed at least 40,000 people in the past three decades, according to Indian government estimates."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/jun/23/anna-mackmin-devoured-hippy-commune","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-23T10:00:03Z","webTitle":"Anna Mackmin: 'I knew far too many children who were having sex with adults'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jun/23/anna-mackmin-devoured-hippy-commune","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/jun/23/anna-mackmin-devoured-hippy-commune","fields":{"headline":"Anna Mackmin: 'I knew far too many children who were having sex with adults'","bodyText":"There is something so vivid and truthful about Nearly Thirteen, the 12-year-old heroine of Anna Mackmin’s debut novel Devoured, that I spend the opening half of our interview asking which bits were drawn from Mackmin’s stranger-than-fiction childhood and which were cooked up in her imagination. Like her narrator, Mackmin grew up in a kind of commune in 1970s Norfolk. Both Mackmin and Nearly Thirteen had a poet father, a younger sister and an agoraphobic mother who drove a white Saab. Both were precocious, home-educated and excellent cooks. And both endured the spectre of abuse as they came of age in a rackety era of bohemian self-discovery. So the passage in Devoured in which Mummy runs out of Swallow’s Farm and bares her breasts in protest at a crop-spraying plane must, I assume, be true. “I made that up,” laughs Mackmin in triumph when we meet near her London home. “There are profound resonances with mine and my sister’s childhood, and massive acres of made-up stuff. I’d never written anything before and it was a visceral pleasure to invent stuff.” At this stage Mackmin is best known as a theatre director, acclaimed for productions of Tom Stoppard’s The Real Thing, Brian Friel’s Dancing at Lughnasa and a version of Arthur Miller’s The Crucible, as well as new plays by the likes of Amelia Bullmore and Charlotte Jones. Bullmore’s Di and Viv and Rose tackles themes of women and work, and it was when Mackmin became a mother six years ago in her mid-40s that she turned to writing. “I stopped work thinking, ‘Great, now I’m going to be a mum’, and I woke up the next morning thinking ‘Urrrgh, I am my work,’” she says. “This bomb had exploded in my heart – who was I if I wasn’t working?” Writing, she says, “was the rope that I threw myself – clambering up this slippery wet rope out of the horror of it all”. Mackmin had been “pretending” she was going to turn her “crazy childhood” into a novel for years and now, having a wakeful child, she began writing in three-hour nocturnal bursts. “I know this sounds very unlikely and pretentious but I really didn’t imagine a single other person reading this book,” she says. “I just knew I had to keep doing something in all those awake hours that was properly me.” It is Mackmin’s fourth creative career, and all have been self-taught except her first, acting, for which she studied at the Royal Central School of Speech and Drama. She and her sister Scarlett, a choreographer to whom Mackmin remains very close, then became clothes designers, successfully teaching themselves to make wraparound clothes that fitted both their contrasting body shapes. Mackmin believes everyone is creative, but her fending-for-herself childhood bequeathed her a bewildering array of practical skills. “I can sew, I can make my own clothes, I can make my own shoes, I can build a bonfire from nothing, I can drive a tractor. Rabbit skinning? Boom! Job done. Disgusting but I can do it,” she laughs. She took the same approach to writing as directing. Mackmin says she always knew she wanted to direct a new play if she read it and could visualise exactly how she would do it. She pictured Devoured this way too. Throughout the novel, the narrator, Nearly Thirteen, looks down upon herself, as if she’s directing herself. Speech appears before the speaker is identified, and sentences are staccato short. This style is as experimental as Mackmin’s childhood, and she isn’t sure whether to attribute it to a lack of formal education or her dyslexia. “There was an urgency of breath and rhythm in using short sentences. When I read it out to myself, I felt, ‘That’s. What. I. Thought. Like’ as a child.” Its originality ensured it was rejected by dozens of cautious publishers until it reached Henry Layte, the Norfolk-based publisher and bookseller who discovered and co-published Eimear McBride’s A Girl Is a Half-Formed Thing. “He gave one absolutely brilliant editorial note,” says Mackmin, suggesting “one big tweak. I will be grateful forever. He’s my kind of person. He’s funny and he’s direct to the point of almost rudeness which gives me enormous pleasure.” By coincidence, Layte lives a mile from where Mackmin grew up and loves cooking as much as she does. Devoured is rare among novels for being studded with recipes for everything from homemade glue to “chocolate idiot biscuits”. “They are all very good recipes,” says Mackmin – all from her childhood. Just as in Devoured, Mackmin’s father and mother and assorted friends were too busy making poetry or pots to cook for their children. “I could cook a six-course meal easily by the age of 10,” she says. “We didn’t know that we were running the house but we wanted to eat. Why would you not, if the ingredients are in the fridge and you’re starving and everybody else is too drunk or stoned?” Of all Devoured’s excoriating comic portrayals of wayward hippies, Nearly Thirteen’s Mummy – a matriarch who challenges norms of work, motherhood and marriage – is the most nuanced. One day, Nearly Thirteen hears a noise coming out of her bedroom like a lorry reversing. “Eurngh eurngh eurngh”; Mummy is sleeping with other residents of Swallow’s Farm. Mummy is “a literary creation” says Mackmin, but her own mother, who recently died after developing Alzheimer’s, “inspired it, utterly and totally”. Two weeks before her mother died, Mackmin had a conversation with her in hospital. “I told her: ‘I’ve written a book, you are in it, it would’ve never happened without you, and I am so very grateful.’ She gave me one of those laser looks right to the back of my head, nodded, and turned away to carry on looking at an old bloke covered in trifle.” Could she have published Devoured if her mum was still alive? “I don’t know. Fortunately for us all, life doesn’t work like that. The origami shape of life allows things to be folded round a corner that you’re not quite sure about and then – ‘Oh look, I’ve made a swan.’” Devoured portrays a time when a generation of parents were preoccupied with their own liberation at the expense of providing children with the space or safety to be children. It is a funny book but an angry one too. “Yes, I have been angry but I’m not blameful,” says Mackmin. “I don’t blame my mum. My mum and indeed my dad were victims of that moment in history, of supposedly women’s emancipation and the psychotherapeutic generation – ‘oh me, me, me’ – putting themselves at the centre. Despite this ideology, they were still dragging behind them an idea of women where their bodies and sexuality were really the only thing that had any currency – and that’s what I was interested in.” Without giving too much away, one hippy befriends Nearly Thirteen in a way that today would be called grooming. I’m surprised when Mackmin says it’s not. “He’s doing what those adult children were doing – working out who he is by saying what he thinks in the moment. All of them are feeling themselves – feelings, feelings, feelings are everything. ‘I feel this and therefore I am,’ rather than ‘I feel this and therefore I’m going to think about it, and the cake I make out of the mix of those two will lead me forward.’” Did she experience abuse in her childhood? Mackmin speaks carefully. “I was around a reckless level of lack of care from the ‘adults’ to the children. I knew of too many children who were having sexual encounters with adults, far too many, and yes, it impacted upon me.” Mackmin believes she was saved from trauma by work, not therapy – and perhaps laughter too. She has poured all her good jokes, and knowledge of theatrical comedy, into Devoured. “Laughter is breath, it alters your being, and it allows you to move on, and keep living. I hope people find it funny but I hope they see that’s the point – it’s laughter as its most important function. It’s not just ‘ha ha ha, crazy hippies’, it’s ‘laugh or you’re going to end up full of bitterness and blame and picking the spot of your childhood forever.’”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/blog/2018/jun/23/bad-hype-jose-mourinho-rt-russian-tv","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-23T06:30:02Z","webTitle":"Schmeichel and Stan put a special gloss on RT's World Cup coverage","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/jun/23/bad-hype-jose-mourinho-rt-russian-tv","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2018/jun/23/bad-hype-jose-mourinho-rt-russian-tv","fields":{"headline":"Schmeichel and Stan put a special gloss on RT's World Cup coverage","bodyText":"Two things in Russia are fairly constant. First, there is the scale. In St Petersburg I stayed in an average chain-style hotel that was like a ziggurat for alien giants, its footprint spread over roughly 4% of the world’s crust, spooling down into sub floors and bunkers and swimming lagoons, upper floors dusted with rock deposits from the rings of Saturn. Everything is massive. It’s also, and this is crucial, very far away. History suggests being the biggest country on the planet has never been a straightforward affair. There is no easy mechanism for governing and unifying a nation that reaches from the Black Sea to the steppe, a space so large the German commanders at Stalingrad advised their men not to look at it, afraid of its weirdly melancholic effects, the sense of staring into some endless scrolling abyss. Talking of which, on Russian TV this week was Peter Schmeichel, a man who also spends a lot of time staring, hypnotised, at some haunting spectacle just out of sight, tribute no doubt to the space and light of the Russian sky, that endless distance, and the difficulty of reading an autocue to camera. Yes, I watched the World Cup on RT so you don’t have to. Or at least that is how I thought this was going to pan out. In practice it was not quite like that. It turns out the real genius of RT, the Kremlin’s state-funded English language station, is its unexpected tone and texture. It’s actually good! It’s fun! Or at least, it’s not un-good, not un-fun. And not, in the end, unfamiliar either. The Schmeichel show, along with the Stan Collymore show and the astonishingly visceral punditry of José Mourinho are the chief pegs of RT’s World Cup programming. At first glance it’s a deliciously glossy product. Even RT’s World Cup intro film is a thing of luminous beauty, cut with mind-numbing shots of Russian ballerinas curling themselves into swan’s neck shapes and doing beautifully rippling slow‑motion keep-ups. All of which is only slightly spoiled by a sudden shot of that familiar silvery power-bouffant, the triumphant sneer of the great José, trying hard to seem welcoming and nice but still looking like he would beat you into submission with an ivory shoehorn if he could only be bothered – now please leave his penthouse shark aquarium. The latest Schmeichel show opens with a similarly gorgeous shot of our host, windswept on a rooftop in Moscow in a luminous blue jacket and open neck shirt. Before long we cut to a bewilderingly long interview with Johannes Holzmüller of Fifa’s VAR department. Holzmüller talks about four pillars of intervention and, defining the parameters of the attacking phase, while the camera pans back to Pete in advancing stages of tedium, a journey in a few short cuts from initial beaming interest, to twitchiness, to a final state of haggard seat-slumping agony. Later, buried weirdly behind the VAR man, Schmeichel interviews the real, actual Gianni Infantino and to his credit guns for Fifa’s president over the workings of VAR. Not that he gets far. Infantino has an indolent glaze of power about him these days. He shrugs and says those who doubt VAR only do so because they are bitter about losing a match, which is a very Fifa way of looking at things. Bad news is simply fake news. Nothing is true. The other big ticket show is of course Collymore. I like Collymore as a broadcaster. He does his research, is properly informed, and makes an agreeable contrast with the appallingly shoddy prep of some famous former pro pundits. The show is good too, the best bit an adoring interview with Xavi, during which Collymore gazes at the master of the ball with a broad, sensual smile, like a starving man peering down at a bowl of fresh custard. Quite what it all means is another question. The standard liberal-style take on RT is that it uses straight programming and familiar faces to conceal its more pointed messages. So while Stan is bringing us a film about the Street Child World Cup the on-screen text says TRUMP ADMITS CRIMEA TO BE RUSSIAN. As Schmeichel is speaking in a slow, placatory tone from his rooftop, looking like the notorious playboy president of a central European republic explaining by video message why he’s stolen the central bank funds, the scroll reads US ANNOUNCES WITHDRAWAL FROM UN HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL. Does any of this matter? Again, it is perhaps an issue of scale, and of difference. Television has been a key tool of government since perestroika. Television helped Boris Yeltsin into office. A televised war transformed Vladimir Putin into an all-round man of destiny. Putin says he wants to wrest the global voice of news from its dominant “Anglo-Saxon” tone. And yes RT is clearly a mouthpiece for approved facts and state influence, there to punt a worldview across the satellite space. But do you trust Fox News? Is the BBC really representing the views of people in Rostov or Iran? As for Collymore, the usual objection is that for all his no doubt well-founded complaints about institutional racism he works for a state broadcaster in an oppressive regime. And yet, once again: scale. Russia will end up wherever it’s heading from a significantly different base-point. And Collymore is still the only prominent black person I’ve seen on television since I have been here. The hope with events like this is that the sheer force of human variety, the presence of the world in the flesh can offer something else, an unplanned transformative energy. For now we have set of surfaces that are compelling, colourful, distantly glossy; it is as Pete would say “really, really cool”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"environment/2018/jul/04/country-diary-silver-studded-blue-butterfly-shropshire","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-07-04T04:30:18Z","webTitle":"Country diary: last outpost of the silver-studded blue butterfly","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jul/04/country-diary-silver-studded-blue-butterfly-shropshire","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/jul/04/country-diary-silver-studded-blue-butterfly-shropshire","fields":{"headline":"Country diary: last outpost of the silver-studded blue butterfly","bodyText":"“Silver-studded,” said the man hunched over his phone, pointing at a patch of red fescue grass. “Clouds of ’em.” Without looking up, he waved his arm over the common of Prees Heath. A stiff breeze ruffled the grass and carried the drone from surrounding trunk roads as sunlight flashed through scudding clouds. The day was as blue and silver-studded as the butterflies. Plebejus argus, the silver-studded blue butterfly, has its last outpost in the English Midlands here. Plebejus suggests commoner and argus is perhaps keeping watch, but like the dwellers of many heathland commons, life for the butterflies here hung by a thread. Because of callous exploitation by collectors in the past, this location was long kept secret but conservation work to restore the heathland has helped the butterflies, and now there are waymarkers pointing them out. But first, as if needing to be conjured by the mysterious man with the phone, they had to appear. Suddenly, one – like a scrap of sky, not of blue pigment but a refraction from wing scales, a trick of the light – flew a hand’s width above the grass; then three; then a dozen together, all flying low, as if held by some gravitational pull to a patch only a few metres square. The reason for this turned out to be female; she was dark, hindwings suffused blue, with coppery marks at the edge and perched on a grass stem. The males skittered around briefly, then settled on surrounding stems, heads down, wings open, prepared for take-off. They were brilliantly azure and bordered black and white above, and pale with light and dark spots below. They got their common name from silvery dots on the hindwings. The markings of these particular butterflies are very similar to those of P argus masseyi, a form of silver-studded blue once also found in parts of northern England but now extinct there, which made the Prees Heath survivors even more extraordinary. Regal commoners of fescue, bird’s-foot trefoil and rosebay willowherb during summer flying time, these butterflies, nurtured by ants and now protected, are dwellers of the heather, heathen souls of the heath; “clouds of ’em”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/jun/22/alison-wilding-review-sculpture-de-la-warr-pavilion-bexhill-on-sea","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-22T14:14:10Z","webTitle":"Alison Wilding review – pure sculpture from an artist whose time has come","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jun/22/alison-wilding-review-sculpture-de-la-warr-pavilion-bexhill-on-sea","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/jun/22/alison-wilding-review-sculpture-de-la-warr-pavilion-bexhill-on-sea","fields":{"headline":"Alison Wilding review – pure sculpture from an artist whose time has come","bodyText":"Red Skies, which Alison Wilding created in 1992, is a hollow metal column split down its centre to let you peer inside. Within its dark interior floats a brass globe covered in enigmatic bumps and markings, like a magician’s occult signs. Around that hangs a red acrylic sleeve that transfigures the world framed by the narrow opening. Right now, installed in a long white gallery with a glass wall facing Bexhill beach, it frames the blue sea and sky. When you look through it they are set on fire. Wilding is an alchemist whose art is full of romance and mystery and sudden transformations. She is also, her mini-retrospective at the De La Warr Pavilion makes plain, an artist of nature. Her abstract forms may not at first glance appear to have any connection with the natural world. A black fibreglass balloon nestling inside a ring of galvanised steel? Then you see the title: Cuckoo I. The menace begins to make sense. This bulging black cuckoo’s egg promises death. It contains a murderous embryo. Jagged, tooth-like cuts in the metal “nest” add to the sense of impending violence. “How do you know but ev’ry Bird that cuts the airy way,” asked Willam Blake in The Marriage of Heaven and Hell, “Is an immense world of delight, clos’d by your senses five?” Wilding lets us see into the secret microcosms that Blake thought live in every creature, every flower. Drowned (1993), for instance, is a subtle terror. This piece is an almost 2 metre-tall metal cone divided to reveal a murky green interior. As your mind enters that inner world of thickened water you seem to pierce the perceptions of someone going down for the last time, seeing the light fade in the suffocating green. Artists have been portraying horses for millennia but Wilding’s 1983 work Dark Horse takes you under the skin, into an equine dreamscape. A black cloth laid out on the ground suggests a flayed horse’s skin. On its head is laid a white stone that resembles an animal skull painted by Miró. It is primeval, prehistoric, a sculpture as mythic as a chalk horse on a hillside. Wilding can take you to the dark side of the moon with just a bit of moulded rubber. Carpet 2 is a black mat of silicone whose surface is a landscape of craters and mountains. Two alien horns rise out of this lunar desert. It is an eerie vision of extraterrestrial beauty that seems to have seeped out of the floor. All this poetry comes at a price – at least in terms of the instant impact and sensation that makes artists into media stars. Wilding’s art repels the casual glance. Coming into her exhibition I was disappointed. It all seemed so tongue-tied. And yet each work reveals nuance and depth that holds and fascinates. This is intimate, rewarding stuff that stands as a silent rebuke to everything noisy, glib and shallow. “Stuff” is the right word. In the end Alison Wilding is a manipulator of stuff. Her career spans the age in which Britain discovered (a long time after it was invented) the “readymade”. Wilding has a more sophisticated relationship with materials. She uses every industrial medium imaginable from silicone rubber to polystyrene, juxtaposed with stone, silk and wax, yet nothing here is a readymade. Everything is shaped. In other words Wilding is a sculptor. In the 90s that made her seem out of time. Now that the era of instant art has passed, and everyone wants authenticity, her time has surely come. For this is the real thing, an artistic vision translated into magical arrays of sensual colour, shape and texture. Pure sculpture. On the flat roof of this modernist pavilion lies a twisted array of metal. At first it looks chaotic. Then its tangle of wire coheres into a vision of waves rolling, peaking, breaking. Black and white buoys bob at the end of curving cables. Wilding has made a model of wave motion that is both art and science. To look from the real sea to her sculpture is to wonder at the power of abstraction. Alison Wilding is at De La Warr Pavillion, Bexhill-on-Sea, from 23 June until 16 September."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/2018/jun/22/joe-schmidt-ireland-tactics-australia-final-test-series","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-22T12:04:58Z","webTitle":"Schmidt defends Ireland’s aerial tactics with Australia series still up in the air","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jun/22/joe-schmidt-ireland-tactics-australia-final-test-series","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jun/22/joe-schmidt-ireland-tactics-australia-final-test-series","fields":{"headline":"Schmidt defends Ireland’s aerial tactics with Australia series still up in the air","bodyText":"Australia expect the series against Ireland, which is locked at 1-1 going into the final Test at a sell-out Allianz Stadium in Sydney, to be decided in the air. The Wallabies won the first match after their full-back Israel Folau dominated the aerial battle in Brisbane but Ireland devised a way of reducing his effectiveness in Melbourne last week, although Australia felt it was not by means entirely within the laws. “We have been looking at a few different things for sure,” the Australia head coach, Michael Cheika, said in the lead-up to Saturday’s match. “We can counter their blocking and everything like that with better kicks and a few different things they are not ready for. “Everything will be on the line. We will be less conservative than we were in the first two matches. It is a grand final and you can’t win it without scoring tries and playing footy. Ireland did well last week to stop us doing that and we are intent on opening up this week.” The Ireland head coach, Joe Schmidt, who has made five changes for an encounter he believes will require the performance of the season from his players, said there was nothing illegal about the way Ireland managed to get bodies close to Folau in Melbourne to cramp the player before he jumped to contest for the ball. “Guys have every right to come back directly onside and we just worked a bit harder getting back,” Schmidt said. “You know when Israel wins the ball you have to get someone in behind it. Australia will have the same urgency: it is part of the intensity of a Test match.” Ireland are looking to consolidate their position at No 2 in the world rankings having lost only one match in the past 15 months. Schmidt has made two changes to his front row and has had to make adjustments for injuries with the flanker Dan Leavy, the centre Garry Ringrose and the wing Andrew Conway all ruled out. Peter O’Mahony switches to openside flanker which could leave Ireland exposed for pace in the battle of the breakdown, although Cheika has shifted David Pocock from blindside to No 8 to accommodate Lukhan Tui. “We have a chance to create history,” the Ireland centre Robbie Henshaw said. “They will come out firing after last week and we have to match that. We have to show the world why we are second in the rankings.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"society/2018/jul/09/nhs-bme-staff-discrimination","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-07-09T09:25:34Z","webTitle":"The NHS relies on its BME staff – so why do they still face discrimination? | Kailash Chand","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jul/09/nhs-bme-staff-discrimination","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/jul/09/nhs-bme-staff-discrimination","fields":{"headline":"The NHS relies on its BME staff – so why do they still face discrimination?","bodyText":"The NHS depends on black and minority ethnic staff to provide high quality, reliable and safe care to patients – and has done since its inception in 1948. They enrich the NHS with their skills, enthusiasm and diverse perspectives. On the health service’s 70th birthday, it’s important to celebrate the contribution of BME staff – but also to recognise the racism and discrimination they continue to face. The creation of the NHS coincided with the beginning of a wave of immigration from the Commonwealth and colonies. The British Nationality Act of 1948 affirmed unrestricted movement within the Commonwealth. When, in 1962, Enoch Powell, then Conservative health minister, launched the Hospital Plan – which envisaged massive NHS expansion – skilled staff were in short supply. Between 1960 and 1963, Powell sent emissaries to Commonwealth countries to recruit medical staff. He may have famously spoken out against immigrants, but he was the one who brought in scores of doctors from the Indian subcontinent. Thousands emigrated from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka during the 1950s, 60s and 70s, recruited by a health service afflicted by an acute shortage of medical staff. Many settled here permanently, despite intending to return home, because the value of their contribution was recognised. I came to the UK in 1978, having trained in India. I experienced discrimination after I arrived: I would often compete for jobs with UK graduates who had less experience, but I would still lose out to them. This situation lasted until 1988, when I started my own practice. I am one of the lucky ones. I went on to have a successful and rewarding 30-year career as a GP and became chair of Tameside and Glossop primary care trust. I also played an active role in the British Medical Association and am its honorary vice president, chair of Healthwatch Tameside and chair of the equality and diversity shadow board for Greater Manchester. One of the proudest moments of my life was being awarded an OBE in 2010 for services to the NHS. However, many BME communities’ experiences of the health service are quite different to mine, and to those of the white British population. The NHS is the largest employer of BME staff in the UK: more than 200,000 health service staff (around a third of doctors and a fifth of nurses and midwives) are from BME backgrounds and a third of NHS doctors trained overseas. Even now, with Brexit looming and amid increasingly difficult working conditions, the Department of Health and Social Care is recruiting all grades and specialties of doctors and nurses from outside the EU. But how are BME staff in the NHS treated? Black and other minority ethnic staff are less likely to be promoted, or made executive directors or board members. A 2014 study, The Snowy White Peaks of the NHS, examined BME progression in the health service in London and exposed the lack of representation of BME staff in the upper echelons of the NHS. This was reflected nationally across other NHS bodies. Furthermore, significantly greater numbers of NHS staff from BME backgrounds experience discrimination and bullying in the workplace than their white colleagues – and they are more likely than white colleagues to be disciplined over comparable issues. A survey of every NHS trust and primary care trust in England proves that BME workers are disproportionately involved in disciplinary procedures, grievances, bullying and harassment cases and capability reviews. As we celebrate the 70th anniversary of the NHS, we need to pledge that all arms of the service, and other medical bodies, take a hard look in the mirror and reflect on how transparency, fairness, and equality should frame its future.

In any country where parliamentary democracy functions properly, members of parliament and leaders of political parties are not put in prison for their policies. No matter how critical they are of the government, no matter how effectively they work to oppose government, elected people are not arrested for their political views. But I was arrested 20 months ago when I was a member of parliament and co-chair of the HDP - the People’s Democratic party, and third largest in the Turkish parliament – which represents the will of 6 million voters. It was a year after my arrest before I was finally seen by a judge. According to the indictments served on me, I am charged with criminal offences carrying a combined sentence of 183 years. Before becoming a parliamentarian, I visited county prisons as a human rights advocate to report violations of prisoners’ rights. However, seeing the prison walls as a lawyer and being held as a political hostage behind them is a very different experience. Over the last 20 months I have never lost my faith in democratic opposition in Turkey. Nelson Mandela wrote in his autobiography about what it meant to be a political prisoner: “The prison itself is a great education for the need for patience and perseverance. Above all, it is a test of faith/stability for people.“ Now I’m going through the training and stability test just like tens of thousands of others now in Turkey’s prisons, just for exercising the right to express an opinion and to organise. I am now standing as one of six candidates for the Turkish presidency in tomorrow’s elections, conducting my campaign directly from my prison cell. That decision stems from the belief that the fight against the authoritarian regime operated by the president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, is the only way to restore peace and democracy in Turkey. I am of course aware of the limits of delivering messages to the outside through lawyers, the only means available to me. Yet, despite these limits, and a government that controls 90% of the mainstream media, the people, especially young people and women, are campaigning energetically on my behalf. Almost all the candidates running against Erdoğan have carried out impressive campaigns. And despite their ideological differences, they are motivated by three important truths. First is the belief that Turkey is too big to be managed by one man, especially given its surviving culture of democracy. We have all clearly seen the price of Erdoğan’s monopolisation of power over the last three years. Not only are we embroiled in persistent struggles with the west, we are dealing with multiple domestic political and economic crises. Second, all those standing against Erdoğan believe the president lacks the courage to compete on equal terms with me, and all have condemned my imprisonment. Third, and most important, they detect that the people of Turkey now have a significant desire for change. Whichever party they may be from, the collective unhappiness of voters – impossible to measure with opinion polling, but encountered only in authoritarian regimes – is deeply felt. The government of Erdoğan’s AKP party has masterfully deceived nationalist and conservative voters by blaming the west for all kinds of negative developments. The indifference shown by many Turkish people to Erdoğan’s election campaign is the clearest evidence of the winds of change. I believe that people’s understanding about who is really to blame for Turkey’s woes will be reflected in the result tomorrow. Let’s not forget, authoritarian regimes eventually collapse. Sometimes it happens quickly; other regimes take longer to dislodge. • Selahattin Demirtaş is the presidential candidate for the People’s Democratic party (HDP) in tomorrow’s Turkish presidential elections"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/22/mexico-elections-fake-transgender-candidates-disqualified","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-22T18:54:53Z","webTitle":"Mexico: 15 fake transgender candidates disqualified from election","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/22/mexico-elections-fake-transgender-candidates-disqualified","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/22/mexico-elections-fake-transgender-candidates-disqualified","fields":{"headline":"Mexico: 15 fake transgender candidates disqualified from election","bodyText":"Mexico’s electoral tribunal has disqualified 15 male candidates who pretended to be transgender to get around gender parity rules in the southern state of Oaxaca. The indigenous Zapotec community of the isthmus of Tehuantepec has long recognized a third gender of transgender people known as muxes – who are born with male bodies, but identify as neither male or female. Electoral rules in Oaxaca allow muxes to occupy candidacies designated for women. On Friday, the tribunal – the final referee in political and electoral matters – ruled that the disqualified candidates were not known to be muxes before the candidate registration period. Two others candidates who had been disqualified by state electoral officials on similar grounds were ruled eligible, however, as they had consistently identified as transgender. The tribunal ordered the candidacies vacated by the disqualified candidates be filled by women. The ruling proved thorny for the tribunal, which said in a statement: “The manifestation of belonging to a gender is sufficient to justify the self-registration of a person.” But the tribunal added: “Electoral authorities must take care with the possible misuse of self-registration, to not permit … the transgender identity be utilized in a deceptive way to comply with the constitutional principle of equity.” Mexico holds elections on 1 July, when the country elects a new president, renews both houses of Congress and elects hundreds of state and municipal officials. “Not a single spot designated for men was filled by a transgender person. However, 19 places designated for women … were filled by men who say they’re transgender,” said Anabel López Sánchez, director of the Women’s Citizenship Collective in Oaxaca, which denounced the phoney candidates in May. Mexico has gradually introduced gender parity rules over the past two decades. Previous rules mandated a 60-40 gender split in nominations, while a constitutional reform in 2013 required a 50-50 balance in all congressional candidacies. But candidates have attempted to get round the law from the start.

In June last year, a London court declared him bankrupt, because of his failure to pay a debt, understood to be about £3.3m, owed to the private banking firm Arbuthnot Latham. Becker was and remains furious, insisting that he has not been given enough time to sell some assets to repay the bank. The case was “a gravy train for the suits”, he said. “I will be coming after the people who forced this process through.” Then, this month, in a head-scratching twist, Becker claimed diplomatic immunity from his debts. If there was widespread surprise in 2013 when he was named as Novak Djokovic’s new coach, this was nothing compared to the shock that accompanied his new gig: Becker had been made the Central African Republic’s attaché for sports, culture and humanitarian affairs to the European Union, the high court of justice in London was told. Becker, who has homes in Switzerland and London to name but two, has never been to the CAR, which is among the poorest nations, and would not be paid for his role. But, under article 31 of the 1961 Vienna convention on diplomatic relations, Becker’s lawyer argued that he could not be pursued for further payments. The British government would have to request that his immunity was lifted and only the CAR president, Faustin-Archange Touadéra, could grant it. Of course, the saga didn’t end there. Last week, officials from the CAR claimed they had no record of Becker’s new job. A photograph of his passport was circulated but this showed his position as “financial charge de mission” and not as a sports and cultural attaché. Moreover, the passport was a “clumsy fake”, according to Charles Armel Doubane, the CAR’s foreign minister. The serial numbers indicated it came from a batch of stolen passports. Doubane’s confusion seemed pretty damning: for any diplomatic passport to be valid it needs to be stamped and signed by him. And the turmoil continued. Last Wednesday, in central London, a viewing was held for an auction of some of his most prized possessions. The sale, a timed online auction that reaches its climax at 1pm on Thursday, is not at Becker’s instigation; all proceeds go to his creditors. His whole playing career, which exploded when he won Wimbledon in 1985, unseeded and aged 17, can be traced through the 81 lots. Back then, Wimbledon champions were given miniature trophies to keep and there are three of these in the sale. There’s also a scale replica of the Davis Cup he won with the West German team in 1988 and a full-size replica of the US Open trophy made by Tiffany and Co that he lifted in 1989, after beating Ivan Lendl in the final. This item has the highest bid of £15,100. Terry Madden, director of Wyles Hardy, which is overseeing the sale, expects some lots to go for significantly more, perhaps even six figures. “You always look at, do they have comparables in the marketplace?” he says. “And in doing my research, I haven’t found any. And the provenance is proven, so I really wouldn’t like to put a final figure on it. I’m hoping I’m pleasantly surprised.” When Madden met Becker, did he have the sense that he was finding it hard to part with the effects, which also include watches, a pair of tennis shoes and a signed photograph from the president of Germany after Becker won Olympic gold? “Emotionally?” he replies. “Yes, I would have thought it was a fairly emotional situation for him.” But then, in some ways, it has been a turbulent couple of decades for Becker. He retired from tennis in 1999, at 31, having won six grand-slam titles and earned about £19m in prize money. Even without adjustment for inflation, he still features in the all-time top 10 for money made playing the sport. In “retirement”, he has also had success, most prominently as an eccentric commentator and pundit for the BBC’s tennis coverage, which the channel has confirmed he will be doing again this year. His three-year stint as Djokovic’s coach saw the Serb play the best tennis of his career and win six major titles. Last summer, he was made head of men’s tennis for the German tennis federation. It is his off-court travails and high-rolling extravagance, though, which has made him a figure of tabloid intrigue. In May, in Bild newspaper, it was announced he was separating from his wife Lilly, the end of a 13-year relationship. The split is said to be amicable – “he is a loving father and husband with whom it is never boring,” Lilly said recently – but it came after a sustained period of financial disarray. Last year, a former business partner, Hans-Dieter Cleven, claimed that Becker owed him more than £30m. That case was rejected by a Swiss court. His divorce from his first wife, Barbara Feltus, is estimated to have cost him more than £15m, as well as their home in Miami. Becker also had to pay £2.4m after he fathered a daughter, Anna, who is now 18, following a notorious tryst with a waitress, Angela Ermakova, on the staircase in the London outpost of the restaurant Nobu in 1999. Though, to clarify: “There was no broom cupboard,” he told Piers Morgan on ITV’s Lifestories in 2009. There is a sense of sad desperation about Becker’s attempt to claim diplomatic immunity. Not least because the CAR, which has recently endured a civil war and famine, is such a mess. By some measures, it is the world’s unhealthiest country, as well as one of the worst places to be a child. There is also substantial legal doubt that he would be protected by his diplomatic status anyway. The first mention of any connection between Becker and the CAR came in April; this means, therefore, he is looking to secure retroactive protection, which there is no guarantee he will be given. And why would the CAR risk any kind of diplomatic incident with the UK just to protect Becker? Right now, Becker’s public pronouncements, made through social media, mainly relate to his concern that Germany might not make it past the group stages of the World Cup. These may, however, soon be the least of his worries. Perhaps Becker can take solace from Rocky Balboa again. “[Life is about] how much you can take and keep moving forward,” Stallone goes on to say. “That’s how winning is done!”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jun/25/i-still-feel-mutilated-victims-of-disgraced-gynaecologist-emil-gayed-speak-out","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-24T18:00:37Z","webTitle":"'I still feel mutilated': victims of disgraced gynaecologist Emil Gayed speak out","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jun/25/i-still-feel-mutilated-victims-of-disgraced-gynaecologist-emil-gayed-speak-out","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jun/25/i-still-feel-mutilated-victims-of-disgraced-gynaecologist-emil-gayed-speak-out","fields":{"headline":"'I still feel mutilated': victims of disgraced gynaecologist Emil Gayed speak out","bodyText":"Rhiannon Tull knew one thing when she was pregnant with her first child. She did not want her gynaecologist to be Dr Emil Shawky Gayed. Gayed (pictured below) had a reputation in the regional town of Taree on the mid-north coast of New South Wales, where he worked as a visiting medical officer, consulting in his private rooms as an obstetrician and gynaecologist, and scheduling women in for surgery at the Manning Rural Referral public hospital. “I know nurses who work at the hospital and they told me, ‘Do not see Gayed,’” Tull said. “I was told he’s OK if you deliver naturally, but not if you need to have surgery. I was told people come back with infections and complications and heaps of bad things happen. From then on I thought, ‘I do not want to encounter that man, ever.’” But Tull wasn’t so lucky when she was pregnant with her second child three years ago. She was 27 and again needed an emergency caesarean section. Gayed was the obstetrician on duty. Rhiannon Tull nearly died on the operating table “I was petrified,” Tull recalls, her eyes tearing up. “I tried to calm myself down and to tell myself, ‘No, it will be OK.’ But it wasn’t OK.” Tull nearly died on the operating table. But Gayed never told her that, or why she lost so much blood and needed a transfusion. He didn’t visit her in the days after her surgery to debrief her. Tull found out she nearly died only when she was out for dinner months later with a friend, who is a nurse at the hospital, to ask for her advice about further surgery she needed to repair a tear in her abdominal wall. The response letter Rhiannon Tull received from Gayed’s office after the complaint she sent last year “I told her I was scared of the surgery, because I felt like I was dying on the table during my caesarean. And she said, ‘Well that’s because you nearly did die. It was really close.’” Tull was sick and exhausted for weeks after the C-section. Her baby’s head was so bruised as a result of forceps Gayed initially used to try to deliver him that his liver began to shut down trying to break down the blood, and he needed to stay in hospital for more than a week. Later, Tull would see that her medical notes contained glaring errors and inaccuracies. She is still too scared to have the surgery she needs to repair her abdominal wall. “I know for a fact that so many nurses have complained about him numerous times,” Tull said. “I want to know how he wasn’t taken off the medical register a long time ago.” The Health Care Complaints Commission and dozens of other women who allege they were harmed by Gayed are asking the same question. The HCCC began investigating Gayed only in 2015, which resulted in him being banned in June from practising medicine for three years. But Guardian Australia has revealed that Gayed – who has been contacted multiple times for comment – was making serious medical errors as far back as 15 years ago. On Thursday the HCCC announced it had begun a second investigation, this time also examining the hospital management and staff who may have known about Gayed and the horrific infections, injuries and trauma he was leaving in his wake, but failed to report him. The stories of his failures are graphic and distressing. There are consistencies in the cases – many women have said their medical notes went missing or what was recorded did not match their experience. Other women had surgeries performed on them that they later found out were unnecessary, such as hysterectomies, fallopian tube removal and the removal of uterine tissue. They would wake up from surgery in agony and suddenly in menopause, their reproductive organs missing. Manning Rural Referral hospital in Taree All the women who spoke to Guardian Australia remain traumatised. Many said they were in excruciating pain for weeks after their surgeries, but that Gayed would send junior staff to debrief them during their recovery to avoid facing questions. Tragically, one woman died after he failed to tell her she had hyperplasia, a condition of the uterus that can indicate cancer. He also failed to refer her to a cancer specialist. He then performed an ablation procedure on her – the surgical destruction of the lining of the uterus – which goes against all medical advice because it can disguise cancer in women with hyperplasia and trigger further cancer growth. By the time the woman came in to the hospital emergency department in February with heavy vaginal bleeding, five years had passed and her cancer was advanced. The doctors could not save her. The hospital immediately audited Gayed’s other patients going back a decade and identified nine other women he had treated with ablation despite the presence of hyperplasia. They are in the process of having biopsies to find out if they have cancer. The hospital also realised Gayed was performing ablation at a staggering rate – almost 60% more frequently than his peers. One of the women who was called back for a review is 78 years old and said she now knows she should never have had ablation, given she had hyperplasia and was going through menopause. Vicki Cheadle in Taree Vicki Cheadle was one of Gayed’s ablation patients a decade ago. After the surgery, she said she was in agony and felt extremely ill. What she did not discover until eight months later was that her uterus was filling with putrid and infected blood, because Gayed had sealed her cervix shut. She needed emergency surgery to treat the infection that had subsequently developed in her uterus, and in the process lost one of her fallopian tubes. “The days following the procedure to clear out my infection, I had to visit the surgeon who did the surgery for a follow-up visit,” Cheadle said. “At his clinic, he told me all that he had found wrong in what Gayed had previously done to me, and at length he told me what he would’ve done to treat me if I had been a patient of his instead. He told me flat out that Emil Gayed had botched my procedure, and that basically I would have died if I had been made to wait any longer for surgery to fix it.” Cheadle immediately sought legal advice. She asked the surgeon who treated her infection to support her case with a statement, and to her shock, he told her he would not. “He threatened me, and told me he would make sure no doctor in Taree would treat my sons or myself if I took legal action against Gayed,” she said. “That he would get on the stand and lie, because I was lucky any doctor operated on me and that I should respect Gayed’s training and experience.” Word that she was considering legal action also got back to her GP, who advised her not to proceed. Cheadle said she felt patronised, dismissed and scared. She had no idea so many other women had been affected until she read Guardian Australia’s stories. She still suffers crippling reactive arthritis triggered by the infection, and is now furious his colleagues did not report him and feels compelled to speak out. “I still have issues because of that butcher,” she said. Lyndsay Heaton also described Gayed as a “butcher”. Her case is tragic and helped set off the first investigation into Gayed by the HCCC. But she is angry that complaints were not made earlier or that, if they were, they did not result in Gayed being barred from medicine for life. In the first HCCC investigation, Heaton is described simply as “patient B” to protect her identity. But she said the case notes from the hearing before the NSW civil tribunal did not do her story justice, and that she now wanted to make her story public. Lyndsay Heaton in Forster When Heaton was diagnosed with a vaginal polyp in July 2015, Gayed told her it would need to be surgically removed. He said that while he was removing it, he could perform endometrial ablation, which is often performed on women suffering heavy bleeding, but Gayed also performed it on patients with endometriosis, a crippling condition where the lining of the uterus grows in other places, such as the fallopian tubes and pelvis. Gayed told Heaton ablation would result in lighter periods and protect her against pregnancy. She and her partner had six children between them and did not want any more, and Gayed made the procedure sound quick and easy, so she agreed. She had the surgery on 11 November and it seemed everything had gone well. But by Christmas, Heaton’s breasts and stomach had swollen. Her partner asked if she was pregnant, but she knew that was not possible because they had been unable to have sex while she recovered from the surgery. By January it was clear something was wrong. She went to her GP, who confirmed she was pregnant. The next day, she felt her baby move for the first time. “I’d had four kids, so I knew what pregnancy felt like and I knew I must be at 16-odd weeks once I felt the baby move,” she said. “I realised that meant I had to have been pregnant at the time of my surgery.” A pregnancy is something surgeons ordinarily look for before performing an ablation or would detect during the procedure. She rang Gayed, and he told her “not to jump the gun”, she recalled. She made an appointment to see him a couple of days later at his private clinic, where he performed an ultrasound. “The ultrasound just absolutely wrecked me, because I could hear my baby’s heartbeat,” Heaton said. “It was just so, so hard. I was crying so hard. Gayed explained with the endometrial ablation they put 100 volts of electricity through your uterus. That’s what kills the lining and he said that because of that the foetus had likely been affected and that the baby wouldn’t be normal.” He also told her that because of the ablation there was a chance she had a condition where the placenta attached to the uterus, and that if it tore away, she could bleed to death. He told her she needed an abortion, a procedure Heaton said she did not agree with and would never normally want. “But he said I was 19.6 weeks pregnant and we had to act quickly because legally you can only terminate up to 20 weeks, so there wasn’t really time to stop and think.” That afternoon, Gayed sent her to the hospital for a full ultrasound, and she and her partner decided to go ahead with the abortion because of the risk to her and her baby’s life. Heaton went back to Gayed’s private rooms after the hospital ultrasound, and his secretary was already on the phone calling abortion clinics. “This was a Friday, and they had an abortion booked in for me in Sydney on the Monday,” she said. They were told the procedure would cost $2,400, which they could not afford. Gayed wrote Heaton and her partner a cheque. “He said it wasn’t an admission of liability but a gesture of good faith. I was absolutely numb at the time, everything was happening around me. And then he told me that I’d actually have to give birth to the baby during the abortion. I couldn’t cope with that. Gayed said to me, ‘Well how did you think an abortion happens?’ I ended up absolutely hysterical, to the point that he prescribed me Valium that night so I could sleep.” Top: A cheque made out to Lyndsay Heaton’s partner for the payment of expenses from Gayed’s clinic. Bottom: A cheque from Gayed’s clinic to Femme Medical Heaton and her partner went to Sydney and, because the abortion was complicated, had to stay two nights. Heaton found the experience traumatic and still struggles to cope. She tried to get on with her life, but then she got a call from the Manning hospital’s head of obstetrics, Dr Nigel Roberts. In 2015 Roberts had been alerted by the HCCC that it was investigating a complaint against Gayed. Roberts called the complainant into the hospital to interview her and find out more about what had happened. She had nearly died after a procedure Gayed had performed. During the interview, she mentioned Heaton, who is her friend, and asked Roberts if it sounded right to him that Gayed had paid for the abortion. Roberts immediately asked to speak to Heaton and during their conversation Heaton realised Gayed had never told the hospital that he had failed to detect her pregnancy or that he had sent her for an abortion. He had assured Heaton he would tell the hospital to investigate her case to examine how the pregnancy was missed. Under NSW law, it is mandatory for doctors to immediately report such a catastrophic mistake so that it can be reviewed. “I was really angry,” Heaton said. “Until that point I thought everything had happened the way it was supposed to, and then to find out he hadn’t even reported it ... absolutely nobody knew.” Roberts acted swiftly. By this point, it was February 2016 and he called Gayed in for a meeting. Gayed was told he was under investigation and that he could not contact any of the patients who formed part of the inquiry. He was barred from performing most surgeries, and resigned from the hospital. Gayed walked out of the meeting and immediately tried calling Heaton. She let the call go to her voicemail. He left a message trying to explain himself, saying the reason he had not reported her case to the hospital was because he was waiting for her six-week post-abortion consultation. Gayed was again ordered by the authorities not to contact Heaton. Instead, he had the secretary at his private clinic, where he was still working, call Heaton at her workplace. The secretary asked Heaton if she would still be attending her post-operative check-up. Again, Heaton asked not to be contacted. A text message to Lyndsay Heaton from Gayed Gayed persisted and began texting her. He told Heaton the reason he had not detected her pregnancy before operating on her was because she had a bicornuate uterus, a condition where the uterus is shaped like a heart. But a specialist at the John Hunter hospital in Newcastle later rejected this, saying her uterus was normal. Roberts agreed, saying that if Heaton really did have a bicornuate uterus, it would have been detected when she had her first child 24 years earlier. Then the letters came. Gayed began writing to Heaton, asking that receipts from her trip to Sydney for the abortion be sent to him. His clinic sent her a stamped envelope and told her to “honour the agreement”. Heaton ignored the letters, instead sending her receipts to the hospital and investigators. But she is angry that her case and seven others that made up the original HCCC investigation led to only a three-year ban on Gayed. While the clinical director of the Manning, Osama Ali, has vowed never to let Gayed work in the Hunter New England region again and has alerted all hospitals where he was known to work, there is nothing to stop him from re-registering and practising elsewhere once his ban is up. Even after he had left the Manning, he continued to work at his private clinics while the investigation was under way. He then closed them down and handed in his registration in April 2016, well before he was found guilty of misconduct and penalised with the ban in June this year. The clinical director of the Manning Rural Referral hospital, Dr Osama Ali Gayed did not defend himself from the HCCC’s case against him. But he continues to deflect the blame and insists his behaviour was above board. Ali, who confronted Gayed with the accusations, said Gayed had insisted he was not at fault. Ali describes what Gayed did to Heaton as “almost criminal”. It is Ali, with his gentle manner and clinical expertise, who has been put in charge of rebuilding the hospital’s reputation and contacting all the women Gayed is believed to have harmed. It’s a task he concedes has been distressing, and he wants to help the affected women as swiftly as he can. Meanwhile, Gayed has begun accusing the hospital of running a campaign to destroy his character. Documents obtained by Guardian Australia show Gayed obtained his bachelor of medicine at Ain Shams University in Egypt. He became a fellow of the Australian College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists in 1993. He was first registered as an obstetrician and gynaecologist in 1994, and worked at the Manning for about two decades, as well as at the Mayo private hospital, a private clinic in Taree, and at private clinics in Dee Why and Mona Vale in Sydney. The chief executive of the Hunter New England health district, Michael DiRienzo, said the hospital now relied less on visiting medical officers such as Gayed, who often saw public patients for appointments in their own clinics and then used the hospitals for major procedures and surgery. An obstetrics clinic has been opened at the hospital so that doctors can see patients “in-house” and this ensures the hospital has copies of all medical records. This had also helped increase transparency, DiRienzo said. But many of Gayed’s former patients are struggling to get their medical records, now that he has left town. He is believed to be living in Sydney but no longer answers his mobile phone, and has closed his private practices. It makes it difficult for women who suspect they have been harmed to have their cases properly reviewed. “I personally have been involved in this process and I can tell you it’s a really, really hard part of the conversation when you talk to those women, and I really feel for them,” DiRienzo said. “I’m really sorry they’re in this position but the message is if they are concerned about treatment they had at hospital and want to be assessed, even if they don’t have all of their records, we will assess them.” Many of Gayed’s victims were young when they met him and felt intimidated when they tried to speak up. Christy Smith was 20 when, in July 2002, he stitched up tears in her vagina after childbirth. When she went for a routine pap smear to a doctor a few months later, Smith mentioned to her that she had not been able to have sex since giving birth. “When she checked me out, she was horrified,” Smith said. “She said Gayed had stitched my vagina almost shut. She couldn’t even give me a pap smear ... she was really disgusted, and she even drew a picture of it for me, of how it looked. She said I needed to go see a gynaecologist and get it fixed. I still feel mutilated.” She saw a specialist in Newcastle to get surgery to repair it. Christy Smith in her home in Kendall But the specialist Smith went to for her next pregnancy – the same one who told Cheadle he would not support her legal case – said she was overreacting when she told him what had happened with Gayed previously. He did not accept that Gayed had done something wrong. “I felt put down and basically didn’t feel there was anyone I could trust with what had happened to me in Taree,” Smith said. Another woman, Talia Sly, had a similar experience when she tried to speak to the same senior surgeon. She was 37 weeks pregnant in 2010 and extremely ill with pre-eclampsia, a pregnancy complication causing high blood pressure, vomiting, nausea and pain. She went into hospital and Gayed was on duty. Sly said the nurses told her she needed to be induced and have her baby as soon as possible, but Gayed overruled them. Eventually, after a few days in hospital, she began to pass out and could barely speak. The nurses rushed to Gayed, and she remembers him “storming in” to induce her. “I was 19 years old,” she said. “He didn’t say a word to me when he came in. I was so scared.” After giving her drugs to induce labour, Gayed left and the nurses took over. She was in labour for more than 24 hours and they again grew worried when her contractions stopped. They called Gayed. “My baby was delivered in two minutes,” Sly said. He gave her an episiotomy almost immediately, a procedure where the opening of the vagina is cut and made larger. “I lost a lot of blood immediately and needed a blood transfusion,” she said. “He stitched me up and left.” Gayed’s medical practice in Taree When Sly became pregnant again two years later, she didn’t want Gayed to touch her but the other two obstetricians in town had waiting lists that were months long. At 34 weeks, she went to hospital again suffering the effects of pre-eclampsia, and being a public patient, had no choice but to see Gayed. He prescribed her a medication and sent her home. She and her mother went to a pharmacy in Forster that afternoon to fill the script and the pharmacist was “outraged”, Sly said. “She said, ‘Who the hell prescribed these? This will cause serious harm to an unborn child.’ She was so outraged that she tried to call Gayed. He told the pharmacist it was one of his medical students that wrote the script. But that’s not true, because I was there when he wrote it.” Sly’s mother was so concerned about her daughter’s treatment that she called another senior obstetrician and gynaecologist in Taree that evening. He told her to bring Sly to the emergency department at 8am the next day. On examining her, he told her she needed an emergency caesarean. Sly and her mother asked him to do it because they wanted to avoid Gayed, but he told them: “It’s all politics around here, we don’t take each other’s patients.” He then went and spoke to Gayed and told him to perform the C-section. “Dr Gayed walked into my room and threw down the papers in his hand and said he was doing the caesarean ‘right now’,” Sly said. “He gave me the filthiest look. When he walked out of the room, he said to my mum and mother-in-law who were waiting outside, ‘Does she always get what she wants?’” After her son was born, Gayed came back into the room to circumcise him even though Sly had not asked for the procedure. Sly refused to allow him to do it. Sly was diagnosed with tears in her abdomen after her C-section. Her recovery was slow and traumatic but she said she felt it was partly her fault because she was so young. “I always just thought Gayed just really didn’t like me, I thought it was me, that I really didn’t know how to do this pregnancy thing right,” she said. “That’s a reason I didn’t complain.” Jade Howard hopes Gayed “never touches another women, ever again”. She was almost 40 weeks pregnant when her water broke and she realised it had a dark green substance in it, which is meconium, the first faeces of a newborn infant. It is a potentially dangerous condition, because the baby can inhale the fluid and become very ill. A previous ultrasound had also found the umbilical cord was wrapped around the baby’s neck, and doctors hoped the baby might flip and get untangled from it. It was a complicated pregnancy. Jade Howard at her home in Cundletown When Howard was rushed to hospital at 6am, Gayed did not seem concerned by the meconium waters despite the nurses frequently raising the topic with him. Six hours later, he told the nurses to induce Howard to bring on the contractions, and he then went home. The next morning, when he returned to work, the baby still had not arrived, and he decided to do a C-section. “After he was born, I noticed my baby was breathing weird and I asked the midwife ‘Is this normal?’” Howard said. “They rushed him into the special care nursery where I later found out he’d developed pneumonia. He’d inhaled the meconium, and he needed a gastric tube and IV lines, and he was so, so swollen.” While her baby was being treated, Howard began to feel sick and was in severe pain. She had developed a post-operative infection and took weeks to recover. Many women have similar stories of infections following surgery, and of having severe pain ignored. More than 20 of them have contacted Guardian Australia. Some said they had heard rumours about Gayed over the years, while others said they had thought they were the only one to have suffered harm. All were shocked that he had only been barred from practising for three years after the HCCC’s first investigation. But with a fresh investigation under way, and more patients wanting to tell their story, it seems likely that the three-year ban might be increased. The director of Catherine Henry lawyers in Newcastle said that in her years of representing patients she had seen firsthand how difficult it could be to get a doctor deregistered for life. There had to be a pattern of deliberate harm proven, she said, as opposed to a clinical error that could be explained by complications or a difference in approach between surgeons. While she said there were similarities among Gayed’s patients in Taree, his negligence ranged from performing unnecessary surgeries, to failing to leaving women with serious infections, to failing to keep good medical records. Victoria Street in Taree Several women told Guardian Australia that when they approached a major law firm in the region, Stacks Lawyers, they were turned away. The managing director of the firm told Guardian Australia: “As a general rule we do not accept instructions against local professionals because it could lead to a conflict of interest because a lawyer in the firm might have had past dealings with that local professional.” With senior hospital staff telling them they had overreacted, the local law firm unable to take their cases on, and their bodies in physical and psychological pain, many of the women focused instead on recovering from their treatment. Now that Gayed has been exposed, they have begun to talk to their families and to each other. And when they do, they often find that there are others who have a story about Gayed. The case raises serious questions about the accountability of senior doctors and points to a culture of doctors protecting their own. Surgery involves a team. When things go wrong, anaesthetists, general surgeons, nurses and assistants are present. While even the most minor of procedures carry complication risks, and even experienced surgeons make mistakes, Gayed’s errors were egregious and frequent. His negligence was either noticed and not reported, or if they were reported, did not make it up the chain of command. The HCCC, Ali and DiRienzo are now grappling with the aftermath as those who worked most closely with Gayed face questions. “If an investigation also identifies other persons or practitioners with potential knowledge, information or involvement, the commission has powers to receive information from them, and other practitioners can also be formally added to the investigation,” a HCCC spokesman said. “If evidence of possible criminal activity by a health practitioner is revealed through a commission assessment or investigation process, the commission refers all relevant information to NSW Police and NSW Police will provide back to the commission material relevant to its investigation.” The reputation of the Manning’s obstetrics and gynaecology department is bruised. And Taree, a sleepy coastal town, is reeling. While Guardian Australia was in the town, women who once thought they were alone in their trauma called and emailed, wanting to share their stories. Guardian Australia has made multiple attempts to contact Gayed about the new allegations made against him. Gayed, meanwhile, has not returned Guardian Australia’s calls. Do you know more?

But for the drinkers who just happened to be in the Philharmonic Dining Rooms in Liverpool, seeing Sir Paul McCartney perform was probably the best gig of their lives. There was amazement, dancing and more than a few tears when one of Liverpool’s most celebrated sons returned for his appearance on The Late Late Show’s Carpool Karaoke with James Corden on Tuesday. McCartney performed a piano rendition of When I’m Sixty-Four as he revisited his childhood home, showing Corden the back room where he wrote songs with fellow Beatle John Lennon. Walking upstairs in the small terrace, he showed off his old “acoustic chamber” – the toilet where he would sit, strum and sing for hours. Describing how he and Lennon had played She Loves You to his father, McCartney recalls him asking if they could change the refrain to “yes, yes, yes” because there were already too many Americanisms in common use. “We did not heed his advice. Had we have done, who knows what could have happened,” he said. Tweeting a link to the episode, Corden wrote: “Ok, so here it is. Quite possibly the best #CarpoolKaraoke we’ve done so far. I hope you like it. I’ll never ever forget it. Take a breath and jump in.” The pair started the show singing the Beatles hit Drive My Car, while cruising through the city, replacing the song’s “beep beeps” with honks of the horn. On Penny Lane, they popped into a barber shop – which had a picture on the wall of a much younger McCartney getting his hair cut – much to the delight of the hairdresser. Corden became emotional as the pair sang Let It Be in the car. “I can remember my granddad, who’s a musician, and my dad sitting me down and saying, ‘We’re going to play you the best song you’ve ever heard’. And I remember them playing me that. If my granddad was here right now, he’d get an absolute kick out of this,” Corden said. “That’s the power of music,” McCartney replied. McCartney harmonised with Corden singing Blackbird and his new single Come On to Me from the album Egypt Station. But the 18-time Grammy award winner saved the best performance until last, when he appeared from behind a curtain in the Liverpool Philharmonic Dining Rooms, or “the Phil”, where he had played and occasionally drunk as a young man. Within seconds, the small crowd was on its feet, and more poured through the door as word spread, as he performed A Hard Day’s Night, Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da, Love Me Do, Back in the USSR and Hey Jude. The star said the journey back to his childhood home had made him reflect on the trajectory of his life. “The distance from here to where we went, and where we are now is phenomenal.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2018/jun/24/small-businesses-buy-health-insurance-groups","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-24T11:00:25Z","webTitle":"Is buying healthcare in groups the best option for small US businesses?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/24/small-businesses-buy-health-insurance-groups","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jun/24/small-businesses-buy-health-insurance-groups","fields":{"headline":"Is buying healthcare in groups the best option for small US businesses?","bodyText":"The number of small businesses offering employees group healthcare fell to a historic low last year. If you’re running a small business, that’s probably no surprise: healthcare is a significant cost and it’s a struggle to provide affordable health insurance for your employees. But there may be another, potentially better option for controlling these costs. After months of deliberations, the Department of Labor this week issued its final rules that now allow small businesses to band together in order to purchase their healthcare insurance as a larger buying group – or association. The requirements for forming an association are loosely defined and could include businesses in similar geographic areas, industries or trades. The idea is that once an association grows to include more than 100 employees, the companies that belong to it can purchase their health insurance without being subject to the more onerous requirements of the Affordable Care Act and can therefore exclude certain benefits which could result in lower premiums. “Many of our laws, particularly Obamacare, make healthcare coverage more expensive for small businesses than large companies,” the labor secretary, Alexander Acosta, said in this CNN report. “Association Healthcare Plans are about more choice, more access and more coverage.” There are some protections for employees. For example, though rates could be based on an employee’s gender, age and the industry of the employer, premiums would not be allowed to reflect an employee’s health status and an employee could not be excluded from a plan because of any prior condition. Most of the regulations would be subject to state oversight too. Critics say that association health plans will erode the base of healthier customers who purchase their individual policies on the healthcare exchanges and therefore cause an increase in premiums for less healthy people. Others believe that the ruling will potentially cause a rise in fraudulent plans that could potentially pay out less than customers expect. But these concerns are not deterring some associations from moving forward with their own plans. Mary Beth Sewald, the CEO of Las Vegas’s chamber of commerce, says that many of her members are eager to bring back the plans, which were a popular benefit that covered more than 20,000 members in her group for more than 30 years before the introduction of the Affordable Care Act. “I’ve had members actively pursue me, asking: ‘When can you bring this back?’” she told the Las Vegas Review-Journal. “I think this is going to have an extraordinary impact. It was one of the most valued benefits of chamber membership.” So will this new rule be a silver bullet for controlling your company’s healthcare costs? Depending on the age and health histories of your employees it could be a legitimate option. But before you go off to join an association or form your own, you may want to tread carefully: this recent decision is not law. It’s only a rule based on an executive order from the president – and, as we’ve learned, it’s very easy for the next president to quickly change those rules.

A veteran of classy and competitive sprints, he somehow gets in here on a mark half a stone below the one from which he was fourth in the Stewards’ Cup last summer, beaten just a length. He also failed by just a length in a Group One over this course and distance a couple of years ago and, going even further back, broke his maiden here. This looks like the plan, after he reappeared with a promising effort over too short a distance at Chester last month. From stall 29, he would at least have the option of coming to the stands’ rail if Paul Hanagan fancied going there. A similar manoeuvre proved helpful to Ostilio in the Britannia on Thursday. 2.30 Chesham Stakes Mark Johnston has his usual strong team of two-year-olds and was given extra reason for faith in them as a group when Next Edition won the Albany on Friday. His Natalie’s Joy looks like another one to stick with, given the manner of her six-length debut success at Goodwood in a time that was 0.07sec outside the juvenile course record. She could also have run in the Albany but the trainer presumably feels she will be suited by an extra furlong on this fast ground. 3.05 Hardwicke Stakes Five runners is a thoroughly disappointing turnout for what is usually one of the strongest Group Two races of the year. Even so, it could be competitive, as both Idaho and Barsanti are suited by a fast surface and the latter is said to be a stronger horse this year. But it looks significant that Coolmore has let Ryan Moore off Idaho and Cliffs Of Moher to ride the progressive Crystal Ocean for Sir Michael Stoute and the favourite looks like justifying his status. 3.40 Windsor Castle Stakes Thursday’s win for Shang Shang Shang seems like a pointer to the chance here of his stablemate Moonlight Romance, who followed him home at Keeneland and then won handily on her second start. Her trainer, Wesley Ward, has won this race twice before and has a fine record generally in five-furlong juvenile races at Royal Ascot. 4.20 Diamond Jubilee Stakes It’s been a few years since the most recent Australian winner at Royal Ascot but Redkirk Warrior looks the business. Unlike most raiders from the southern hemisphere, he has already won at the track, when he was a 10-furlong horse with William Haggas four years ago. He has thrived as a sprinter and holds Merchant Navy on their Flemington form in March, his most recent outing. 5.35 Queen Alexandra Stakes When a fine second in this race a year ago, Thomas Hobson was running for the second time in five days, having won a handicap on the Tuesday of that Royal meeting. This time, he comes straight to this race, having had a good break since running sixth in the Melbourne Cup, and it is not easy to see what can hope to beat him from this ragbag of ploddy opposition."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"education/2018/jun/26/refugees-lose-friends-money-home-only-knowledge-lasts-universities-courses","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-26T06:00:27Z","webTitle":"Refugees lose friends, money, home – ‘only knowledge lasts’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/jun/26/refugees-lose-friends-money-home-only-knowledge-lasts-universities-courses","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2018/jun/26/refugees-lose-friends-money-home-only-knowledge-lasts-universities-courses","fields":{"headline":"Refugees lose friends, money, home – ‘only knowledge lasts’","bodyText":"When volunteers at the Calais “Jungle” camp in Northern France asked Omer AKA Dream, how they could help refugees like him, he was clear. “We need a library,” he told them. “Bring books.” It was while working in the new Jungle Books Library that Dream, 32, from Sudan, came across two academics from the University of East London, Corinne Squire and Aura Lounasmaa. The women were travelling to France every couple of weeks as volunteers with other students and academics to deliver a short, accredited, undergraduate course on life stories for inhabitants of the camp. Dream signed up. By day, he studied social and philosophical texts, poetry, and autobiographies by Nelson Mandela, and Malala Yousafzai, as well as writing his own poetry. By night, he risked his life attempting to get to England. Before fleeing militias in Sudan in fear of his life, Dream worked in events management. He travelled overland to Libya, then to Italy on a boat that was robbed, misdirected and robbed again by bandits. He arrived in Calais with almost nothing. “I wrote my poems on a phone given to me by a volunteer,” he says. Two years on he has successfully claimed asylum in Britain and has recently graduated from UEL’s 10-month foundation OLive-UP programme, part of its Open Learning Initiative designed to help refugees and asylum seekers prepare for British higher education. There he again met Lounasmaa, a lecturer in UEL’s school of social sciences, who was leading the course. In September he will return to the university to begin a BA in international relations. Under OLive, which is part funded by European money through Erasmus, and run in partnership with the Central European University in Budapest, the University of Vienna and the European Network Against Racism, UEL provides seminars and workshops on English language, academic writing and research, computer skills and migration issues for around 40 refugees and asylum seekers. Some travel to London from as far as Cardiff and Newcastle. Rebecca Murray, director of Article 26, a charity promoting access to higher education for those fleeing persecution, says more and more institutions are offering help for refugees and asylum seekers: “Universities cite public good and also say they come across individuals who are talented, determined and committed to their studies, and that can be a force of nature.” Birkbeck provides fee waivers and extra financial support for 20 asylum seekers not eligible for student finance, and workshops advising on skills needed at higher education level. The University of Warwick is one of a number of Universities of Sanctuary welcoming students seeking asylum, and offers up to four undergraduate scholarships for asylum seeker students not eligible for student loans, while the University of Nottingham offers £1,000 a year to refugees eligible for loans, in recognition of the extra challenges they face. Despite the financial support, it can still be difficult for refugees to study, particularly when rules around immigration status are constantly changing. At UEL, students on the foundation course can get a fee waiver, but must pay their own maintenance – particularly tough for those whose immigration status prevents them from working. Then there’s Brexit. UEL has European funding in place until November but, in applying for funding for its 2019 OLive programmes, it has had to agree to a cut in its share and to take on any risks arising from Brexit. “That makes it difficult for students but it also makes it difficult for institutions,” says Lounasmaa. Nevertheless, OLive-UP will expand next year, with three places for refugees and asylum seekers on UEL’s education foundation course, as well as the existing three in social sciences. Meanwhile, Dream is looking forward finally to becoming an undergraduate. He says his priority is to finish his BA. After that? “The sky is the limit for studying,” he says. You can lose money, friends, a home, he adds: “Only knowledge lasts.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/jun/24/trump-trade-war-no-panic-things-get-out-of-hand","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-24T06:00:19Z","webTitle":"There’s no panic yet: but Trump’s trade war could get out of hand","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/24/trump-trade-war-no-panic-things-get-out-of-hand","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jun/24/trump-trade-war-no-panic-things-get-out-of-hand","fields":{"headline":"There’s no panic yet: but Trump’s trade war could get out of hand","bodyText":"It’s a skirmish, no more than that. The trade tariffs going up around the world might be adding millions to the cost of importing goods, but it’s not a war and it won’t mean the end of global growth. Or at least that seems to be the general view. The International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), and the majority of investment banks and thinktanks do worry about the latest round of niggly tit-for-tat tariff battles. They have condemned them, and some – including the IMF’s boss, Christine Lagarde – have rounded on the main protagonist: President Donald Trump. But have they begun to panic? Not yet. The European Union’s retaliation against steel and aluminium tariffs imposed by Trump were announced last week and amounted to $3.4bn on US products including bourbon, peanut butter and orange juice. It’s virtually the same targets the EU picked in 2002 when George W Bush thought it might profit him to slap steel and aluminium tariffs on European suppliers. The sum of money involved is small and, compared to the trillions of dollars traded each year, almost a rounding error. But in 2002 it worked and Bush backed down. It was humiliating, yet not as bad as angering dozens of Republican senators from swing states that rely on donations from bourbon makers and the votes of peanut farmers. Worse, Bush’s brother Jeb, then governor of Florida, was feeling the squeeze from EU tariffs on oranges. However, Trump’s target is not only Europe: it’s China as well. And in two weeks, the US will start taxing $34bn of Chinese goods. Beijing has vowed to immediately retaliate with its own tariffs on American soybeans and other farm products. An escalation of tariffs between the world’s two largest economies should not be downplayed. A civilised argument with the EU is one thing: a determined effort to punish China for a long list of trade-related misdemeanours is another. The battle seemingly has no end and the fallout might not just cost consumers money: it might also destabilise decades-old global trading arrangements. Trump’s comment that he wanted to banish the sight of Mercedes cars in New York followed his administration opening a trade investigation into vehicle imports, which he tweeted on Friday would result in 20% tariff on cars unless action was taken by the EU. “Build them here,” he told carmakers, even though many do boast large or expanding plants in the US. A 20% tariff, up from 2.5%, on the cost of a foreign car could lower eurozone GDP by 0.3% at least, says Bank of America Merrill Lynch. It would take a 7.5% appreciation in the value of the dollar, and a concomitant rise in the purchasing power of prospective American customers, to offset such an increase. “If the US raised tariffs to European cars to 25% and 10% on all other products, 0.7% of euro area GDP could be at risk,” the bank said last week. To protect eurozone exporters from any losses, the dollar would need to rise to parity with the euro (something that Trump might perhaps even like, as a symbol of macho success). So tariffs such as those in prospect would hurt the car industry – and none more so than the UK’s: Jaguar Land Rover is a huge exporter to the States. In April, Lagarde warned of “darker clouds looming” for the global economy amid simmering trade tensions. She warned governments around the world to steer clear of protectionism or face negative consequences. Yet her call to “resolve disagreements without using exceptional measures” looks like being ignored by a White House packed with evangelists who see protectionism as a source of hard power. Airbus move should sound alarm bells on Brexit A visit to the impressive Airbus factory in Broughton is an insight into state-of-the-art manufacturing and what it means to a workforce, a region and a country. Its 6,000 employees have well-paid, highly skilled jobs that bring vital income to the north Wales economy and the site is a flagship for a British manufacturing industry that, while much smaller than it was at its 20th century peak, sustains world-class pockets of production such as Broughton. Airbus’s UK operations as a whole bring tax revenue of £1.7bn a year to the country. So the public and politicians should sit up in alarm when Airbus, a Franco-German business, says that it could ditch UK wing-making plans over concerns that European Union regulations will no longer apply from March 2019 and amid uncertainty over customs procedures. Instead, it would opt to transfer production to North America, China or elsewhere in the EU. Airbus’s Hamburg hub, for instance, would love to get the wing-making work that could be made available by a hard Brexit. There is a solution to this: secure access to the single market and stay in a customs union. It would be very unwise to count on calling Airbus’s bluff. Airbus does not draw up long-term investment plans on the side of a bus. These are serious calculations that, once enacted, could result in Britain losing one of its greatest manufacturing assets. Thanks to Broughton and a sister facility in Filton, Bristol, the UK can count airplane wings as among its few world-leading exports. This ranks Broughton alongside Rolls-Royce for aircraft engines, GlaxoSmithKline for pharmaceuticals and Unilever for food. If prime minister Theresa May does not act in the best interests of the country’s economy and thousands of Airbus workers, that list will diminish rapidly. The empire strikes back against Star Wars? The most surprising aspect of the lacklustre box-office performance of Solo: A Star Wars Story is the one thing that should have mattered to audiences: it is not a terrible film. Nonetheless, its US takings of nearly $200m paled in comparison with recent Star Wars films and its foreign box office takings, of around $150m, is an awful number that includes scathing indifference (a mere $16m in takings at time of writing) from the all-important Chinese audience. A costly production that involved extensive reshoots after its original directors quit following “creative differences” with producers, it is supposedly expected to lose $50m, in a rare reversal for Disney, owner of Lucasfilm and the Star Wars universe. Disney therefore did the right thing last week in reportedly deciding to cancel all spin-off or “anthology” projects related to the franchise – and stick instead to producing its main Star Wars trilogies. If box office success is an alchemical thing – a mix of talent, good timing and hoping that a marketing blitz drags people away from Netflix – then failure can be equally puzzling. But the media group has apparently got a hunch that it has saturated the global blockbuster market, which it dominates anyway, with one too many lightsabers. Solo came out just six months after The Last Jedi, an official entry in the Star Wars canon (as the second film in a third official trilogy) that was lucky to accrue more than $1.3bn in ticket sales after dividing opinion among Star Wars devotees. It shows that Disney is reverting to a proven formula that it had discarded in the case of Solo. Part of Disney’s enormous success at the box office in recent times is down to limiting its annual output to a handful of big-hitting projects - such as Black Panther and the forthcoming Mary Poppins sequel – with obvious globe-straddling appeal. The decision to cancel further Solo-style projects is proof that less is more if you want to succeed in Hollywood now."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/jun/22/sam-burgess-england-rugby-league-denver","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-22T21:00:38Z","webTitle":"Sam Burgess urges England to showcase rugby league in Denver","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jun/22/sam-burgess-england-rugby-league-denver","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jun/22/sam-burgess-england-rugby-league-denver","fields":{"headline":"Sam Burgess urges England to showcase rugby league in Denver","bodyText":"Sam Burgess urged his England teammates to “do the sport justice” when they face New Zealand on Saturday in a Denver showcase for international rugby league. Burgess and several NRL-based teammates took a public stance to support the game going ahead after Australian clubs raised concerns over player welfare and the match being played at high altitude. With a World Cup in the US seven years away, Burgess says the players must ensure the game delivers on all levels. “I think it’s been worth making a stand for looking back, but we’ll see for real after the game,” Burgess said. “The result is the most important thing for us but putting on a good game and showcasing what we believe to be the greatest sport in the world on American soil is another challenge. There will always be people who doubt what we’re trying to do but it’s been a success so far.” A deal has been agreed in principle for England and the Kiwis to return to the US in 2019 and 2020 depending on the success of this weekend. With a crowd of more than 20,000 expected to watch the game at Mile High Stadium, Burgess said he has seen a lot of interest from the Denver public. “Walking around the streets of Denver, people are talking about it,” said Burgess, who has been heavily involved in promotion of the game. “I guess the big test will be the fans who come through the door. Denver is a huge sporting city and there seems to be a buzz about it in town – hopefully we do the sport justice.” The game is England’s first since defeat in the World Cup final last year, and with a three-Test series against New Zealand to come on home soil this year Burgess says this weekend is key to ensure Wayne Bennett’s side continue to develop as a group. “It’s a chance to have another week together in camp and, in the long run, that helps,” Burgess said. “We want to be competing at the very top of world rugby and for that to happen we need to be playing together as often as possible.” England v New Zealand (9pm BST) Ratchford; McGillvary, Makinson, Percival, Hall; Lomax, Widdop; S Burgess, Roby, Graham, Whitehead, Bateman, O’Loughlin.

Ellis the hero for Castleford Jamie Ellis slotted over a last-minute drop goal to give a patched-up Castleford a dramatic 19-18 victory over top-four rivals Wigan on Friday night. The Tigers have managed to keep pace with Wigan despite their injury crisis and they moved to within a point of the Warriors after edging a thrilling Super League clash at the Mend-A-Hose Jungle. Wigan, who were also depleted by injuries as well as England call-ups, took a 12-4 lead into half-time thanks to tries from Sam Tomkins and Liam Marshall either side of a Quentin Laulu-Togaga’e effort. But Castleford came storming back and were on course for a memorable win after Michael Shenton and Matt Cook went over. Cook went from hero to villain when he was sin-binned and Tom Davies scored in the next set but Ellis made sure his yellow card was not too costly to send Castleford five points clear of fifth-placed Hull."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/jun/22/xx","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-22T17:13:57Z","webTitle":"The French GP is back: ‘We love F1 here, its return is good for everybody’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jun/22/xx","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jun/22/xx","fields":{"headline":"The French GP is back: ‘We love F1 here, its return is good for everybody’","bodyText":"There will doubtless be no shortage of intensity at the sharp end of the French Grand Prix but away from a tight title fight, for many in France it will be an unashamedly emotional affair. For Jacques Laffite, the race’s return to the Formula One calendar after a 10-year absence and at the Paul Ricard circuit has special resonance. A pleasure amplified by the joie de vivre the former F1 driver derives from Lewis Hamilton’s performances. France hosted the first grand prix in 1906 and had held 86 further meetings by its last race in 2008 at Magny-Cours. Unsurprisingly a decade on there is a celebratory air at Paul Ricard, which hosted the race 14 times between 1971 and 1990. Laffite knows it well, as the charismatic 74-year-old raced at the track in his heyday when driving for Ligier, taking six wins. In the 70s and early 80s, Laffite and France were synonymous. His French team, running in the country’s traditional blue colour, also sported that most Gallic of cigarette sponsors, Gitanes. Laffite retired in 1986 when Alain Prost was in his pomp, having already taken two of his four titles, and the French Grand Prix was a meeting whose future never looked in doubt. Laffite was an F1 commentator for France’s TF1 when the race was last hosted and he believes its resurrection is of real importance. “The people have missed it,” he says. “We have been waiting for 10 years, the French Grand Prix was one of the best in the world for a long time. We love F1 here, its return is good for everybody, especially for France and especially at Paul Ricard.” He took his and Ligier’s first GP win at the 1976 Swedish Grand Prix and stresses how important it was for him to be racing for a French team. At the next round, his home race in Dijon, he and the team realised they had made their mark. “There were so many people that turned up they did not have enough tickets to sell,” he says. “It is stressful but I love it, to race in my country. It felt like a real home race, especially with Ligier, and Gitanes in a French blue car. It was fun to see all these people supporting us.” He rates one of his best performances at home as his run at Ricard in 1980. He had claimed pole with a superb lap but, although leading for much of the race, could manage only third after his tyres went off. He is still fond of the circuit, which is using its classic configuration this weekend, and pleased it is hosting the return for the French GP. Perhaps most intriguingly he is looking forward to how Hamilton takes to the challenge. “He is my favourite driver,” he says. “Hamilton is more of a fighter than Sebastian Vettel. When you need it he is able to do something incredible with the car. Vettel is really competitive but is not taking as many risks compared to Hamilton. Hamilton is able to just do things better than Vettel.” It is Vettel, however, who leads Hamilton by one point after a 15-point swing in the Ferrari driver’s favour at the previous grand prix in Canada but the world champion topped the timesheets in both practice sessions on Friday. Hamilton was 0.704sec quicker than Red Bull’s Daniel Ricciardo in second practice, while Vettel was only fifth fastest. The session included a 10-minute red flag period, caused when Sergio Pérez’s Force India lost a wheel at 150mph on the Mistral straight. Mercedes have fitted an upgraded, new specification engine and will expect to match and even better the step forward Ferrari made with their upgrade in Montreal. For McLaren the pressure to perform has proved testing already in France, especially for the racing director, Éric Boullier, who faced stern questions about his future with the team. Hoping to fight for podiums this season, the car has not been the step forward that was expected. Fernando Alonso’s fifth in Australia has been their best result. Boullier had to defend himself after reports of deep unrest in the team and that McLaren had given out 25p chocolate bars as a bonus to staff, one of whom reportedly described the atmosphere as “toxic” and that Boullier and other management figures were seen as “untouchable”. Boullier dismissed the affair as “chocolate-gate”, perpetrated by employees he described as merely “a couple of people who are grumpy”. He also insisted he would not be leaving. “We are all responsible for the car performance. No, I will not resign,” he said. “I’m in my 20th year in racing, I’ve won races and championships with every team I’ve managed before, including Formula One, so this is some record you cannot take away from me.” However while Boullier eventually tired of discussion of the topic he did throw doubt on McLaren’s expectations. The team had switched to Honda engines in 2015 in the belief they needed a works partnership to win. They dropped the manufacturer for Renault after three woeful seasons but Boullier suggested the former relationship was required to challenge at the top. “Red Bull is the proof that you can win races as a customer,” he said. “I think winning a championship is another level, you need to have a works team status.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/22/romelu-lukaku-belgium-golden-boot-roberto-martinez","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-22T16:26:24Z","webTitle":"Romelu Lukaku working on helping Belgium to win rather than Golden Boot","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/22/romelu-lukaku-belgium-golden-boot-roberto-martinez","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/22/romelu-lukaku-belgium-golden-boot-roberto-martinez","fields":{"headline":"Romelu Lukaku working on helping Belgium to win rather than Golden Boot","bodyText":"Roberto Martínez believes that Romelu Lukaku is not focused on winning the Golden Boot at the World Cup finals, with the Belgium manager claiming that team success, rather than individual awards, is driving his players on in Russia. Lukaku has two goals to his name from the 3-0 victory over Panama in their opening Group G fixture, and the Manchester United striker will hope to add to that tally against Tunisia in Moscow, where Belgium can take a significant step towards the last 16 with another win on Saturday. Martínez made it clear that he wants Lukaku to concentrate on scoring, saying that the centre-forward he knows well from their time together at Everton “becomes a bit diluted in terms of his performance” when he strays into other areas. Yet from Martínez’s perspective, Lukaku’s desire to score has to be with a view to helping the team as opposed to any personal ambitions. “He will tell you, he’s not here to be the top goalscorer in the World Cup,” Martínez said. “He’s here to try to help the team to win and to fulfil his role. His role is someone who can score goals. I know Rom well. The reason we spent the biggest amount of money for Everton was because we saw the outstanding quality of his finishing, not because he was the finished article, not because he was a player who could give you something other than scoring goals. “I think his role now with the national team has become that. I think before there was a bit of confusion. When you ask him to do too many things he’s not good at, he becomes a bit diluted in terms of his performance. “I think Rom knows now what his role is, like I hope every other player does on the pitch, because that’s the only way we can become a team. I wouldn’t expect any player to work towards an individual award in this tournament. I think the players know exactly what they have to do in order to try to help the team become a winning team, and that’s the focus.” Although Lukaku got his World Cup off to a fine start against Panama, he was a peripheral figure in the opening 45 minutes as Belgium failed to break down their opponents. Lukaku touched the ball only seven times during that period, prompting Eden Hazard, the Belgium captain, to tell him to stop “hiding” during the interval. Hazard later told reporters that he felt as though Belgium were playing with “a man missing” because Lukaku was so anonymous. Lukaku, in fairness, is determined to make his mark in Russia. This is his second World Cup finals and the 25-year-old has said that he intends to savour the occasion following the disappointment of 2014, when he scored only once and Belgium were eliminated in the quarter-finals. “I’m going to remember to have fun this time,” Lukaku said in a fascinating and wide-ranging interview on the Players’ Tribune website. The former Chelsea forward will lead the line for Belgium against Tunisia in what is expected to be an unchanged team. Martínez revealed that Thomas Vermaelen, who has been recovering from a hamstring problem, and Vincent Kompany, who suffered a groin injury against Portugal this month, are back in training with the rest of squad but not considered match-fit for the Tunisia game. Whether Martínez would be willing to consider Kompany for the England match, which takes place in Kaliningrad on Thursday, is unclear. Belgium’s manager is reluctant to look too far ahead, although he did acknowledge the danger that England pose on set pieces when it was put to him that Tunisia appeared to be vulnerable in that area, following the two goals that Harry Kane scored against them on Monday. “I think England are very strong in deadball situations, they had up to six bodies in the box and they have got fantastic movement and fantastic delivery,” Martínez said. “I think Tunisia just got a little bit caught in that aspect, but I don’t see that as a real weakness.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/24/bavarian-border-briodge-angela-merkel-fight-for-survival-freilassing","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-24T06:59:19Z","webTitle":"Bavarian border bridge is key to Merkel’s fight for survival","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/24/bavarian-border-briodge-angela-merkel-fight-for-survival-freilassing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/24/bavarian-border-briodge-angela-merkel-fight-for-survival-freilassing","fields":{"headline":"Bavarian border bridge is key to Merkel’s fight for survival","bodyText":"On the A8 motorway between Salzburg and Munich, a policeman signals to a black BMW with Bulgarian number plates to pull over, and the driver parks and opens the boot. Five police officers, one armed with an assault rifle, ask him to remove its contents, and two female passengers dressed in leggings and flip-flops duly unload the bulging plastic bags inside and watch with increasing irritation as the police rifle through their contents. After about 10 minutes, having checked the Bulgarians’ documents, the police wave them on. This is the Schwarzbach crossing between Austria and Germany, which the German federal police have been controlling since the late summer of 2015 when tens of thousands of refugees poured over the border. Pictures of the town’s bridge crammed with some of the thousands who arrived each day became one of the dramatic illustrations of the refugee crisis then playing out in Europe. Set up as a temporary border point near the town of Freilassing in Bavaria, the German government now has to reapply to the European commission every six months for the special permission required for it to continue to operate. Freilassing is no longer a hub for refugees. Standing amid the bucolic surroundings of wooden farmhouses with overflowing flower boxes and solar-panelled roofs, Martin Zartner, a police spokesman, says the flow “has reduced to just a handful a day”. The town’s rather nondescript bridge is once again an unspectacular crossing over the river Saalach on which spot checks are only occasionally carried out. But it has become a potent focal point in the very public war being waged in Berlin between Angela Merkel and her interior minister Horst Seehofer, which could yet bring down the German government – ending both politicians’ careers – and drastically shake up Europe’s migration policy at the same time. “We are fully aware of the tense political situation and the brutal eye which is being cast on the border controls,” one official who declined to be named, told the Observer. “This is after all about the future of Germany and the future of Europe.” Seehofer, until recently prime minister of Bavaria and head of its ruling party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), sister party to Merkel’s Christian Democrats, wants to turn back from Germany’s borders any asylum seekers who have already registered in other EU countries. Merkel has firmly rejected his proposal, saying it is illegal under European law and that she fears the domino effect that turning asylum seekers back could have on the rest of the EU. As she fights for her political survival after almost 13 years in power, Merkel is scrambling to forge bilateral agreements with nine other EU leaders she is due to meet today before a crucial EU council summit this week. Her aim is to reach a deal palatable to both her and Seehofer. But that will be no easy task. Sitting in the local headquarters of the anti-immigrant Alternative für Deutschland, where the windows are decorated with fairy lights in the party’s red and blue colours, Karl Halbritter is proudly dressed in traditional lederhosen shorts, an embroidered shirt and hiking boots and is rubbing his hands with glee. A candidate for the AfD in state elections in October at which he hopes to enter the district assembly, Halbritter points to a campaign poster: “The AfD makes good on what the CSU promises.” The CSU was considered the outright ruler of Bavaria for decades, until the AfD stole thousands of voters from it at the federal election last autumn, entering the Bundestag for the first time and denting both the CSU’s pride and power. It is now threatening to do more damage to the CSU power base in October’s poll. He calls the border restrictions that Seehofer is demanding, which would require thousands of extra police and a costly technical upgrade, a “placebo, pure entertainment”, which would be impossible to enforce. “Any human trafficker with half a brain is not going to use the controlled border crossings, but take the neighbouring uncontrolled B-roads instead, or tell the people he is smuggling to get out of the car in Austria and cross the bridge at a time when everyone knows it’s not being controlled, and he’ll simply meet them on the other side,” he says. If the AfD had its way, he says, it would simply close the EU’s entire outer border, instead of trying to police Germany’s 3,700km frontier. The mayor of Freilassing for the past 19 years, Josef Flatscher of the CSU, is nostalgic about the days when Bavaria last had a border with Austria, before the introduction of Schengen and the free movement of people and goods. “I grew up with the border and remember as a 10-year-old smuggling butter from Austria in the mid-1960s,” he says. He rejoiced when the borders disappeared, but says he can’t help but see their reintroduction three years ago as a necessity. “You’ll find few sensible people who don’t share that view,” he insists. “Of course it’s annoying for local people who like to pop over to Austria to the heuriger [wine taverns] or whose businesses benefit from Austrians coming to drink their coffee or buy groceries – all of which are cheaper here – but they will gladly alter their behaviour if it means they feel safer and don’t have the impression that Germany is a cash cow that has to feed the world.” At the time of the refugee crisis Flatscher wrote to Merkel accusing her of having little regard for the impact her insistence on keeping Germany’s borders open had on the 17,000 citizens of Freilassing, many of whom took on the burden of coping with the 160,000 refugees who arrived in the town over six months. His anger is by no means gone. “Merkel never once came here or got in touch to explain how she expected us to manage – we felt very much left in the lurch, and we still do,” he says. There is also bitterness at how Freilassing is being used to fuel the far-right cause. “We’ve seen anti-immigrant demonstrations organised here where all the participants came from outside. The people of Freilassing played no role,” says Rainer Zehentner, a reporter at the local paper, the Südostbayerische Rundschau. He resents the fear that he says has been fomented by both the AfD and CSU as well as newspapers like the tabloid Bild, which recently got a new, hardline editor. “Hardly a day goes by when it doesn’t have a headline like “I’m a murderer and I want asylum in Germany”, so from the first feelings of humanity we had towards the refugees, people have been re-educated if you like, to believe they are all terrorists, murderers and rapists.” Back at the border, two Macedonian-Germans who have been stopped by the police on their way back to Stuttgart show their irritation. “The police were friendly enough and tried to be as speedy as possible, even if they annoyed me by telling me to put out my cigarette,” says the driver, Alexander, a security guard, sipping from a can of Red Bull close to the end of an 18-hour trip. “But if this is what it takes to protect Germany, then so be it.” Tina and Matthias Gabert, a medical receptionist and heating engineer from nearby Arzberg who have just pulled into a motorway service station just beyond the border crossing, say they switched to voting AfD at the last election “out of revenge” towards the CSU for its failure to control the borders. They would like to show their allegiance to the party once again “but the fact is we don’t feel safe,” they say. “Our girls are being grabbed from behind by refugees at the local swimming pool. It’s not surprising we like the border controls really. We can deal with the inconvenience.” Additional reporting by Janek Schmidt Angela Merkel has sought to downplay expectations for today’s emergency meeting on migration. The informal “mini-summit” for EU leaders in Brussels is being seen as a lifeline for the chancellor, amid a bitter dispute over refugee policy between her CDU party and its conservative sister party in Bavaria, the CSU. But after a row with Italy about the point of the meeting, Merkel said it was a “consultation” and would yield “no concluding statement”. Italy’s prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, agreed to go to Brussels only after Merkel abandoned a set of pre-written conclusions. A pre-cooked summit communique that emerged last week angered Rome: Conte said it neglected the “emergency” of migrant arrivals in Italy. Around 41,000 migrants travelled across the Mediterranean in the first six months of 2018. The arrival figures are 51% down on last year and 81% down on 2016. Hungary’s Viktor Orbán said he and leaders of three other central European states would boycott the meeting, although none had been expected to attend."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/jul/02/books-tennis-andre-agassi-arthur-ashe-roger-federer-philip-roth-john-updike","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-07-02T05:29:00Z","webTitle":"The best tennis books: Benjamin Markovits serves up his favourites","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jul/02/books-tennis-andre-agassi-arthur-ashe-roger-federer-philip-roth-john-updike","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/jul/02/books-tennis-andre-agassi-arthur-ashe-roger-federer-philip-roth-john-updike","fields":{"headline":"The best tennis books: Benjamin Markovits serves up his favourites","bodyText":"The trouble with tennis is that it’s such a fair fight – an even fight, too, so when you lose, you really lose. Footballers, basketballers, anybody on a team can blame their teammates. Golfers compete against the field – losers have a lot of company. But every tennis player who loses does so in a 50-50 encounter – which is probably why so many of the greats have cultivated a personality that shows they don’t care. Jim Courier, towards the end of his career, read books during changeovers. Björn Borg’s hipness, John McEnroe’s brattiness, Andre Agassi’s image-consciousness, even Roger Federer’s grace, his air of being untouched by it all, of superiority, all seem like responses to the basic problem: how do you lose and cope? Agassi’s memoir, Open, is worth reading on this question. Written with the help of Pulitzer-winner JR Moehringer, it’s a smart, vivid and sometimes sentimental account of his life and career. Like most sporting memoirs, it mixes mantra-style philosophy with a kind of accountant’s fixation on small technical moments and details. “I hate tennis,” he confesses at the start, but the book complicates that picture. Like anything you do for a living that you do well, tennis at some point will absorb most of your thoughts and feelings, and the battles you fight in the game will stand for larger battles. He complains about the “non-place we exist as athletes” – the changing rooms and practice courts and hotels where he spends his professional days. Everywhere that is Not Home. David Foster Wallace talks about the same thing from the other side of the camera in one of my favourite of his essays on tennis, String Theory – about the almost impossible to comprehend excellence of the 79th-ranked Michael Joyce. The players “all have the unhappy self-enclosed look of people who spend huge amounts of time on planes and waiting around in hotel lobbies, the look of people who have to create an envelope of privacy around them with just their expressions”. Part of the problem of being an athlete is that you invest too much in what happens on the court, the two-hour island on occasional days towards which all of your life is directed. (I know this from my own brief and rather miserable career as a mediocre professional basketball player. Like a trumpeter’s cheeks, you sag when not in use.) John McPhee describes that island brilliantly in Levels of the Game, his blow-by-blow account of a single match, the 1968 US Open semi-final between Arthur Ashe and Clark Graebner. It belongs to the best kind of ultra-realism, where the minute attention to surface detail is deepened by backstory and broadened by context. It’s the string on which he beads together essays about race, class, parenthood and the will to win. Tennis, for novelists, is like a fun objective correlative. It can stand for love or ambition or even the boredom of summer afternoons. Philip Roth’s first alter ego Neil Klugman’s first date began when he picked up Brenda Patimkin from her tennis match at her country club in Goodbye, Columbus. But probably my favourite example of the tennis-flavoured novel is John Updike’s Couples, about a bunch of upper middle-class thirtysomething small-towners who hang out and play games and sleep with each other. “Two summers ago, the Ongs built their tennis court and they saw more of Georgene; and when, a summer ago, Piet’s dreams without his volition began to transpose themselves into reality, and unbeknownst to himself he had turned from Angela and become an open question, it was Georgene, in a passing touch at a party, in the apparently unplanned sharing of a car to and from tennis, who attempted an answer, who was there.” Later, when their affair has ended, Pete has to face her across the net in mixed doubles: “gripping his handle so hard it sweated”, he has to “bite down on a shout for mercy”. I’m not a good player. Geoff Dyer once described my game as “so inelegant and ineffective” that he worried it might be “infectious”. Fact checkers from Harpers, where he published the line, got in touch with me to establish the evidence base. I was happy to corroborate. I used to get beaten regularly by William Skidelsky, whose memoir Federer and Me ends this list. We used to argue about Federer but the book is a moving reminder that for lots of us fandom has an intensity as profound as playing – that watching sports is like reading a novel, an experience that doesn’t entirely belong to the writer or the athlete. Books and ballgames made up my childhood and I haven’t outgrown them yet. • A Weekend in New York by Benjamin Markovits is published by Faber."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/grogonomics/2018/jun/24/the-time-is-ripe-for-a-more-activist-approach-to-industrial-relations","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-23T22:00:09Z","webTitle":"The time is ripe for a more activist approach to industrial relations | Greg Jericho","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2018/jun/24/the-time-is-ripe-for-a-more-activist-approach-to-industrial-relations","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/grogonomics/2018/jun/24/the-time-is-ripe-for-a-more-activist-approach-to-industrial-relations","fields":{"headline":"The time is ripe for a more activist approach to industrial relations","bodyText":"It is becoming harder to deny that without changes to our industrial relations system, low wage growth will remain locked in. After the fight over tax, this should be the main focus of the next election campaign given even the head of the Reserve Bank, Philip Lowe, concedes the evidence is “pretty compelling” that changes in industrial relations designed to bring greater flexibility and less centralisation have contributed to our current state of record low wages growth. This week, Lowe noted, while in Portugal at a forum for central bankers, that “the relationship between wages and unemployment looks to have changed” – historically the current level of unemployment should see us having wage growth about 3.7% instead of the current rate of 2.1%. It has now been more than five years since private sector wages in Australia grew on average by more than 3%. And this is not good for the economy. Lowe noted with concern that “a 2% wage norm has become the standard in Australia” despite the fact “we’re getting reasonable labour productivity growth”. As a result, he has been “talking publicly quite a lot about trying to lift wage norms back to where they start with a three rather than a two”. But the one crucial thing about wage rises is that businesses will always resist giving them even if they know they are in the interests of the economy. Lowe might be pushing for higher wages, but he is not meeting with much success because, he notes, business owners “agree in principle that the country would be better off having wage growth of a three-point-something than a two-point-something, but not in their business!” Businesses resist not because of low productivity growth – but because they claim to be worried about international competition and also because “the changes in the industrial relations landscape” have ensured they are able to resist even when there is low unemployment. Lowe referenced a paper delivered at the forum on productivity, wage growth and unions, of which he said “the evidence is pretty compelling – changes in industrial relations arrangements in Germany have affected wage and employment outcomes and the Australian experience is very similar to the German one. It’s hard to escape the conclusion that changes in industrial relations has changed the inflation process.” Less bargaining power means less ability to get better wage rises. The paper Lowe referenced found that over the past 20 years productivity grew by similar amounts in France and Germany, but unlike in France, in Germany – with its much more decentralised industrial relations system – “wages largely stagnated (until 2008) and inequality increased (until 2010)”. Germany did see lower unemployment than France and yet from 1995 to 2007 the German “real median wage barely showed any improvements”. It’s a situation that resonates very much with what Australia is experiencing. The bad news is that Lowe thinks the current situation of low wages growth is likely to stay in place for some time. He noted that “the inflation rate has been below the mid-point of our target for some years and it’s going to stay that way. I think wage growth has repeatedly surprised on the downside. The current rate of wage growth isn’t consistent with us achieving our inflation target on a sustained basis.” We have a situation where the power in industrial relations has been skewed for 20 to 30 years towards employers and is now coupled with greater globalisation, where, as Lowe notes, there are “increased perceptions of competition.” He notes how business services, which in the past were assumed necessary to be done in Australia, are now “now supplied in Manila or in Chengdu or Bangalore”. Added into the mix is the fact that the changed industrial relations landscape has led to an increase in flexibility at a time when older workers are staying in the labour force longer than in the past because of the ability to work part-time and because “our bodies are lasting longer as we’re working in services and not manufacturing”. It makes for a pretty potent recipe that is a killer for wages growth. The old rules of seeking to improve productivity to improve wages growth – one of the main justifications by the government for its company tax policy – is no longer holding up. Lowe at no stage bemoaned our productivity growth but he did worry that his pleading for higher wages growth was largely going unheeded by businesses. And that is a pretty startling admission, given his argument that higher wages growth would be better for our economy. It means the head of our central bank is on record as saying businesses are resisting doing something that would benefit our economy. At such a point, surely we need to realise that a hands-off industrial relations system is not in the best interest of households, let alone the economy. It is clear that maintaining the status quo – or advocating even more flexibility, as was suggested by Queensland Liberal party senator Amanda Stoker in her maiden speech this week – will not see wages growth improve. The time is ripe for a more activist approach to industrial relations, and a big fight on the issue at the next election.

Jiangxi province issued guidelines last week stipulating that women more than 14 weeks pregnant must have signed approval from three medical professionals confirming an abortion is medically necessary before any procedure. The measures are meant to help prevent sex-selective abortions, which are illegal in China. The sex of a child is often discernible after 14 weeks. “Your womb is being monitored,” said one comment on the Weibo microblogging website. “What is the purpose and basis of this policy? The reproductive rights of women in this country seem to be a joke,” said another. One user wrote simply, “The Handmaid’s Tale,” referring to the TV series set in a dystopian future where women’s reproductive functions are tightly controlled by the state. Jiangxi’s guidelines come as Chinese officials look for ways to deal with the country’s ageing population and low fertility rates, the result of decades of restricting family size, known as the one-child policy. Loosened restrictions over recent years to allow all parents to have two children has so far failed to resolve China’s demographic problems, which threatens economic growth. The government is considering scrapping limits altogether. Some worry China’s family planning apparatus will turn its heavy-handed approach to restricting women’s choices. “People are worried that the government will go from lifting restrictions, to encouraging reproduction, to imposing restrictions on abortion and restricting people’s own decisions,” said Lu Pin, founder of Feminist Voices, a blog on gender issues. Lu added that many Chinese women, who had chosen not to have a second child despite the new policies, were fearful that strict social policies will be introduced. “There are plenty of signs that show their worries are not unfounded,” she said. China’s family planning policies have long encouraged the use of abortions, along with contraceptives and sterilisation, as a way to restrict population growth. Since 1971, when the country first introduced limits, doctors have performed 336m abortions, according to government data released in 2013. In the past, other provinces have implemented similar rules to crack down on aborting female foetuses, a practice that has left China with a massive gender imbalance of 30 million more men than women. In 2004, Guizhou was the first province to enact such a ban. Other Chinese provinces such as Jiangsu, Hunan, Qinghai, Anhui, Henan, and the city of Shanghai have followed suit with varying restrictions on abortions after 14 weeks. More provinces are likely to follow Jiangxi’s lead, according to Cai Yong, an associate professor of sociology at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. “In a top-down system, and at a time of tight central control, it is hard for me to imagine this act is a spontaneous one... It definitely signals a major policy change. Still, Yong doubted whether China would go as far as barring abortions to encourage women to have more children. “Certainly China is capable and has a history of doing that kind of thing but whether it will go all the way to ban abortion … I think that’s a little too far.” Additional reporting by Wang Xueying"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jul/13/david-dungay-jr-dies-in-custody-and-his-family-are-changed-forever-photo-essay","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-07-13T00:36:05Z","webTitle":"David Dungay Jr dies in custody, and his family are changed forever – photo essay","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jul/13/david-dungay-jr-dies-in-custody-and-his-family-are-changed-forever-photo-essay","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jul/13/david-dungay-jr-dies-in-custody-and-his-family-are-changed-forever-photo-essay","fields":{"headline":"David Dungay Jr dies in custody, and his family are changed forever – photo essay","bodyText":"Four days after Christmas 2015, Leetona Dungay’s son David Dungay Jr died in Sydney’s Long Bay jail. Prison officers stormed his cell after he refused to stop eating a packet of biscuits. He was restrained and administered a sedative, midazolam, and died. Clockwise from top: a photo of the Dungay children – David is second from the right; Leetona Dungay’s lounge room; David’s bedroom which is now filled with memories of his life; a railway bridge that crosses the Macleay River in Kempsey Leetona is a Dunghutti woman from Kempsey, just off the Macleay River on the mid-north coast of New South Wales. She has four children. David was her youngest boy. Clockwise from the top: a photo of David Dungay Jr in his football clothes; a mural painted by the Dungay family on a property they used to live in at Burnt Bridge; a house in Kempsey that David grew up in When David was six he was diagnosed with type two insulin-dependent diabetes. Almost all cases of type two diabetes occur in adults over 40, and managing it is no easy task. So when David was diagnosed his health became Leetona’s full-time job. “I was going to write a book on it. Because no one knew how to respond and bring up your child on diabetes and how to treat it,” Leetona says. “I was his nurse and his diabetes educator.” Ernie Dungay David’s big brother, Ernie, and his eldest sister, Christine, still live in Kempsey, within walking distance of their mum. David followed in Ernie’s footsteps and took up football at a young age. He had natural talent, Ernie says. It was in his blood. Everyone who knew David remembers his skill on the field. Ernie dressed David in his own football guernsey when they buried him. Christine Dungay David was three weeks away from release after serving almost eight years for assault, aggravated attempted sexual intercourse and party to robbery. His big sister Christine, now with six children of her own, didn’t see David while he was incarcerated. Her job is to keep everybody else going. Cynthia is the youngest of the Dungay siblings. She moved from Kempsey so she could visit David when he was shifted from Kempsey correctional centre, first to Junee, and then to Long Bay in Sydney. Cynthia spent hours on the bus with her three kids so she could visit her brother every two weeks. “I still remember the day the police came to the house to inform us,” says Paul Silva, David’s nephew. “I haven’t been the same since; my family haven’t been the same since.” The day after David died, Leetona and her family gathered at home to figure out what came next. David Dungay’s niece, Christine, and his nephew Paul Silva The last two and a half years have been filled with rallies in support of David and protests against other deaths in custody. The family marched outside Long Bay the year he died, and they march through Kempsey every year, ending with a family barbecue on the Macleay River. Christine Dungay and her partner, Raymond Quinlan, the morning of a protest in Kempsey on 9 June “No family should have to go through all of this: the trauma, the pain, the heartache, to gather like this as a community or a family. We should gather like this at Christmas time, not to protest a death of a person that was locked up in custody,” Silva says. Left to right: Leetona Dungay and David’s nephew Paul Silva at a protest in Kempsey “When we do get justice, it might make us feel a bit better, but we’ll still go to sleep knowing we lost an uncle or brother.” Left to right: Thelma Kelly attends the protests in support of the Dungay family; a smoke ceremony is performed during a protest on 9 June “It feels good,” Silva says. “We are not doing the march for ourselves. We are doing it for David and other deaths in custody because it really needs to stop.” When Leetona returns to Kempsey after a rally or visiting the coroner’s court, she always goes to see David at the cemetery: “Every time I get back from Sydney I come to the grave.” On 16 July the coronial inquest into David’s death begins in Sydney after almost three years of waiting. Leetona hopes the inquest will shed light on how and why he died.

The Labor frontbencher has taken the opportunity of delivering the Gough Whitlam address on Friday night to articulate his own broad-ranging vision for Labor in 2018, noting the ALP can’t expect to “slide into government off the back of our opponent’s failures” and saying it is not good enough to say to voters “elect us because the other mob are useless”. The speech, was circulated before its delivery, and contained no direct criticism of Bill Shorten, or of the party’s current policy agenda. But it said Labor “must be determined to avoid allowing tactics to marginalise strategy” and that the party must “stick to our values and craft responses to the real challenges that affect Australians in their daily lives”. Albanese said Labor must always be optimistic, and outline “a vision of progress”. He emphatically endorsed the Hawke-Keating reforms of floating the dollar, reducing tariffs “and opening the Australian economy to the world” as the bedrock of 27 years of uninterrupted economic growth. The frontbencher said those reforms – now criticised by some in the left and the labour movement – delivered continuing benefits to working Australians, including the creation of Medicare, compulsory superannuation, the expansion of university education and the doubling of year 12 completion rates. “Our national challenge is to continue to drive sustained economic growth.” Albanese said Labor had to recognise that it could not stop change, whether it was demographic, technological, or societal, and it could only manage change in the national interest. He said the objective had to be bringing “the community on the journey, rather than pander[ing] to fear of change”. He also noted that many national policy challenges – climate change, education and infrastructure – “would be best solved by bipartisanship” rather than rolling tit-for-tat, but in calling for more constructive engagement, he noted the Turnbull government “can barely achieve bipartisanship within their own Coalition and are not capable of the magnanimous generosity that bipartisanship requires”. He said successful Labor governments had always collaborated with the business sector, civil society and the trade union movement. Albanese said Labor must always “cherish” its historical links with unions, but he warned the party also had to understand that Whitlam’s reforms allowed generations of Australians from working class backgrounds to attend university, “work in the professions and non-unionised industries, or start their own business”. “We cannot afford to ignore this demographic,” he said, noting that many people were no longer union members. With the union movement in a full throated campaign to change the rules, in part directed at shaping policy outcomes at the ALP national conference in December, Albanese noted: “This is not 1950, when most Australians were members of trade unions.” In a provocation to Shorten’s right faction, Albanese backed party reform – saying grass roots members must be given more direct say in elections for public office and internal positions, and “maintain our internal processes that emphasise policy making from the bottom up”. He noted that the successful push to legalise marriage equality came from the community “and made its way up through the party and ultimately through parliament and into law”. Albanese also put a toe in the water before a debate about refugee policy expected at the national conference, noting “you can protect our borders without losing our national soul”. “No mainstream politician believes in open borders, but a policy that uses its prolonged treatment of detained people as an ongoing deterrent to others has a deep flaw at its heart.” He ended his contribution by declaring Labor was “not a grab bag of ugly neo-cons, weak liberals and agrarian socialists fighting like cats in a bag. “We are not a single issue party that puts abstract policy ahead of the working lives of people. We are not bitter, frightened xenophobes. “As Gough Whitlam understood, if changing lives for the better is your ambition, Labor remains the only game in town, the party of mainstream Australia, the party of courage and ambition for our nation, the party of the fair go.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/22/knights-of-anguish-argentinian-media-react-to-world-cup-humbling","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-22T07:00:21Z","webTitle":"‘Knights of anguish’ – Argentinian media react to World Cup humbling","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/22/knights-of-anguish-argentinian-media-react-to-world-cup-humbling","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/22/knights-of-anguish-argentinian-media-react-to-world-cup-humbling","fields":{"headline":"‘Knights of anguish’ – Argentinian media react to World Cup humbling","bodyText":"It never looked certain for Argentina. There were always questions left to answer but obscured by the euphoria, anxiety and demands of their country, something felt off. Drawing with Iceland, a moral loss, showed the team’s unease, but pundits pardoned a team that faced a fully parked bus. Croatia would be the real test. The quiet might of their midfield, featuring Real Madrid’s conductor and lead architect, Luka Modric, promised a game of back and forths where Argentina would prosper by taking advantage of gaps. Argentinian media listened to Modric who, outlining his tactics, said Croatia would cut off Javier Mascherano and added one sharp line: “Messi can’t do it all.” Did Sampaoli listen? The pressure of two World Cups sitting in their trophy case, the dreams of 40m Argentinian fans, the spectre of Diego Maradona’s past brilliance and his physical presence in the box seats, proved too much in a 3-0 defeat. La Albiceleste crumbled in a match that featured 33 fouls and seven yellow cards. Maradona cried. If the spirit of Argentinian machismo weeps, it’s fair game for everyone else, and so Argentinian journalists let it pour through their news and analysis immediately after match. Diario Olé quickly led its site with a pun full of pain: “Knights of Anguish”, a pun on the Chelsea goalkeeper Willy Caballero’s surname. Inside was a full analysis of the match, prefaced with a paragraph of stark lines, the worst fears of Argentinian hopefuls: “Argentina lost hard … and is at the brink of elimination from the World Cup.” The writer, Diego Macias, continued serving hard truths fans would have declared impossible before the match: “We can play worse than we did against Croatia. We can suffer one of the biggest howlers of World Cup history. We can see the best player have the worst game of his career.” Olé highlighted this line at the end of the graph, in their signature bright green: Caballeros de una angustia que duele en el alma de tantos argentinos que se vinieron hasta la otra parte del mundo con la ilusión de al menos pelearla. That is: “They’re the knights of the anguish that pains the soul of so many Argentinians that traveled across the world with the dream of at least fighting for the cup.” Its competitor, El Gráfico, lauded for its 99-year history and cherished tradition and for 139 covers featuring Maradona, but known for not having adjusted well to the digital age, had not updated its site, with Peru’s elimination still leading up to an hour after the final whistle. But Olé could only be outdone by one: the television tabloid channel Crónica TV (watch live at your own risk), notorious for its alarmist red band covers, accompanied by a further alarming trumpet fanfare (lower the volume before clicking on that). In Buenos Aires, at a fan gathering, it brought its microphones, looking to get a rise from the distraught. They dubbed them “the faces of pain”. Not a second had passed before they asked a man: “Who was the least worst on the field?” Mascherano took the wooden spoon. “Is Messi better on the PlayStation than in real life?” the presenter asked another. Only one newspaper was able to keep it together. Immediately after the match, La Nación, Argentina’s leading centre-right daily known for its affinity with the Argentinian military, went with a sober 150-word match report, leaving the “bronca” (anger) of 40m Argentinians out of it and sticking to the facts … the headline: “Argentina embarrassed against Croatia as their World Cup future is in check.” It pointed to Sampaoli’s tactical substitutions “showing no difference” in team play, and to the squad looking “totally confused” towards the end of the match. It only had enough editorialising in it to describe Caballero’s blunder as “gross”. Is that debatable? The article extended the criticism with the obvious irony of the situation, pointing to the fact that while Argentina looked like they had come together as a team, Caballero’s failure “who Sampaoli had highlighted as being good with the ball at his feet – condemned the game”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jun/24/my-son-is-going-to-be-left-behind-brisbane-mothers-countdown-to-deportation","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-24T01:37:21Z","webTitle":"'My son is going to be left behind': Brisbane mother's countdown to deportation","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jun/24/my-son-is-going-to-be-left-behind-brisbane-mothers-countdown-to-deportation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jun/24/my-son-is-going-to-be-left-behind-brisbane-mothers-countdown-to-deportation","fields":{"headline":"'My son is going to be left behind': Brisbane mother's countdown to deportation","bodyText":"Bernadette Romulo still wakes her son Giro early, because that’s what they’ve always done. She drives the children to school. At night they pray. Romulo knows that, in three weeks, the daily routine will come to an end. Recently, she lost an appeal against an Australian government decision to deport her. Soon she will be sent back to the Philippines and Giro, eight, must stay behind in Brisbane. Until then, the routine is everything: full of small moments to savour, a distraction. Just another day. “I’m still trying my best,” Romulo told Guardian Australia on Friday. “We still have to do the everyday routine, Giro still needs to go to school. I just need to do what I have to do, what has to be done every day. “We’ve been in this situation for the last couple of months, in the morning during the day he’s fine and going to school. At night time, when he realises that July 11 is going to be the last day, he can get really sad. He cries when I’m not around. I don’t know if he wants to be brave in front of me. He’s a very brave boy.” Romulo has lived in Brisbane for more than a decade, and has been on bridging visas for the past five months. Her complex status in the country is the result of two relationship breakdowns. She came to Australia in 2006 with her then husband, who was on a 457 visa, and two infant daughters. After their relationship ended, Romulo had Giro with a Filipino-Australian man. She left him in 2012. Romulo’s visa remained linked to her former husband. In December last year, she was denied permanent residency, a decision that inched the family towards the day they would be separated. Romulo must take her daughters, 13 and 12, back to the country they left as infants. Giro must stay in Australia because of custody arrangements with his father. “It’s very complicated, but it’s just a fact there’s a child involved here,” Romulo said. “We don’t know when we’ll see him again. In the future I’m going to try to come back here, but I just don’t know what’s going to happen. “It’s the emotion of being heartbroken because my son is going to be left behind. I’ll be fine, but I have to have my son, I have to take my son with us, he’s my son. I’ve been the primary carer since he was born. “The government is saying ‘OK, go home, go back to where you came from’. My son is going to remember that for the rest of his life.” Last week, the family was given a date: 11 July. They have to produce plane tickets to prove they are leaving on 5 July. Romulo said she cried and shook for about two hours after receiving the deadline. She has started selling her possessions. The federal government has said the case was “comprehensively assessed” and that child custody matters were “beyond the scope” of the home affairs department, which makes immigration decisions. Romulo’s case was placed earlier this year on the desk of the assistant home affairs minister, Alex Hawke, who said at the time he intervened only “in a relatively small number of cases which present unique and exceptional circumstances”. A Change.org petition calling for the government to stop Romulo’s deportation has more than 37,000 signatures. “I don’t know where to start,” Romulo says. “It’s painful every minute. “Every day I remind him of what’s going to happen, I’m preparing him. I always tell him, always pray at night, always remember everything that I tell you, be kind to people, spread love to everyone. “And then I always tell him ... I don’t want him to be angry about what happened. He is angry and he wakes up in the morning and he’s angry. He’s a child, he doesn’t really understand things at the moment. I help him, I say keep praying and I will be there always.” Since ending her relationship with Giro’s father, Romulo says she has worked hard to provide for her three children as a single mother. Her work as an aged care nurse often requires early starts. And so the family still wakes up at 4.30am every day. “I managed to give my children a comfortable life, I worked hard for them just to keep this family together,” she says. “It’s torture, it’s torture for me, even if they’re not physically torturing us, it’s torture. But as a mother you have to do your best. So that’s your only choice, to be strong for your kids.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/21/argentina-messi-shambles-croatia-world-cup","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-21T21:52:36Z","webTitle":"Shambolic, frenzied, anarchic – and Argentina crisis has Messi at its heart","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/21/argentina-messi-shambles-croatia-world-cup","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/21/argentina-messi-shambles-croatia-world-cup","fields":{"headline":"Shambolic, frenzied, anarchic – and Argentina crisis has Messi at its heart","bodyText":"It was in 1913 that Racing became the first non-Anglo side to win the Argentinian league title. For much of the century that has followed, Argentinian football has defined itself in opposition to the English, distancing itself from its British heritage. And yet, under pressure, in their frenzied desperation on Thursday, Argentina resembled nobody so much as England. This was shambolic. Too many players tried to do too much themselves. There was altogether too much running, too much frenzy, too many fouls conceded as they desperately tried to regain possession, too little thought. By the end, as Ivan Rakitic casually rolled in a sarcastic third for Croatia, Argentina were gone, any semblance of defensive structure blown to the winds. Had this been the final group game, the loss of discipline might have been explicable. But it was not. A 1-0 defeat Argentina could, plausibly, have got away with. Even 2-0 was just about rescuable. But now they are looking at probably having to put at least three past Nigeria in their final game, while hoping the other result goes their way. Perhaps Lionel Messi has one last miracle in him, but this would be his greatest yet. Messi himself was barely involved. He touched the ball only 49 times, and only six times in the final quarter hour. When his country looked to him, he simply wasn’t there. It’s ludicrous, of course, that one player should be under such pressure, that everything should be about him, particularly when it was his display in Ecuador that got Argentina to Russia, particularly in a nation with such a proud football history as Argentina, with so many other great talents in their squad, but it’s increasingly coming to seem that the Messi dependence that has benighted Argentina for so long can be solved in only one way. Paulo Dybala hit upon the truth in an interview earlier in the year: Messi is simply too good. Dybala said he found him almost impossible to play with because the temptation is always simply to give him the ball. At club levels players adapt; at national level, where there is less time and a greater range of talent in the squad, it is far more difficult. Everything goes through him and that makes Argentina predictable and susceptible to being frustrated by sides that pack the centre. Jorge Sampaoli had spoken before the tournament of the 2‑3‑3-2 he intended to use, playing Messi behind a centre-forward but with another playmaker in midfield. That – essentially a 4-4-1-1 with a midfield diamond but very attacking full‑backs – was seen only briefly in the Iceland game, after Éver Banega had replaced Lucas Biglia. In the four days since, it disappeared altogether. Messi had told Sampaoli at an asado (barbecue) in March that he felt a 3-4-3, such as he played in for Luis Enrique at Barcelona at the end of 2016-17, didn’t work for him because it naturally drew defenders into the inside-right zone he likes to attack. Sampaoli had agreed but against Croatia he returned to that original plan. In the first half, Messi was proved right. But at least then there was a structure. By the end, there was nothing: just players, a pitch that had become a theatre of torment, and an opposition who, also rather less than the sum of their parts, couldn’t believe their luck. Hindsight offers hints of the devastation to come. At the anthems, Messi, staring at the ground, kept rubbing his face with his hand. He had not attended a Father’s Day asado at the team camp, staying in his room, fretting. He may still be around in Qatar in four years but he will turn 35 in June 2022. He will not be the same player. If he does, implausibly, achieve success there, it will not be as the greatest player in the world putting the final seal on his legacy but as some gnarled veteran completing one last job and achieving at the very end some redemption for an international career that has been an enormous disappointment. It’s an appealing narrative but not the one he or Argentina wanted. Just before the second half began, Sampaoli took his place on the bench and looked almost ill, his face grey and sheened with sweat. The sense then was that he knew his side were on the brink. By the end, his jacket was off and he was reduced to waving his heavily tattooed arms in a vague lifting gesture, helpless to check the anarchy unfolding in front of him. For the defensive collapse, Messi is not at fault. Sampaoli will be held responsible and, assuming the Argentinian Football Association can find the money to pay his compensation, he will almost certainly be dismissed. But the blame goes far deeper and begins far earlier. Sampaoli was the third coach Argentina had used in qualifying. His football, predicated on a high line and a ferocious press, was not a natural fit for Argentina’s fleet of lumbering defenders and he never had the time to find a solution. But ripping up the blueprint he had unveiled only a couple of weeks ago after one game smacked of panic. He is not the first Argentina coach to be chewed up by the chaos that surrounds the job, and he will not be the last. But he may be the last to lead Messi at a World Cup, and that is the great sadness of their defeat. Messi remains at the absolute summit of the pantheon but he deserved a better farewell from the World Cup than this strange homage to Argentinian football’s English roots."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"education/2018/jun/21/families-white-working-class-children-economic-burden-lack-drive-of-migrants","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-22T06:36:17Z","webTitle":"Ofsted chief: families of white working-class children 'lack drive' of migrants","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/jun/21/families-white-working-class-children-economic-burden-lack-drive-of-migrants","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2018/jun/21/families-white-working-class-children-economic-burden-lack-drive-of-migrants","fields":{"headline":"Ofsted chief: families of white working-class children 'lack drive' of migrants","bodyText":"White working-class children have fallen behind because their families can “lack the aspiration and drive seen in many migrant communities,” according to Amanda Spielman, the chief inspector of schools in England. Spielman’s comments came as she sought to defend the Ofsted schools inspectorate against evidence showing it gives harsher judgments to schools in deprived areas with a high proportion of children from white, working-class backgrounds. “We can’t pretend that Ofsted judgments are not lower in certain areas – many of them with a high proportion of white working-class children. But that shouldn’t surprise us,” Spielman told an audience at Wellington College in Berkshire. “Over the past few years, there has been a long overdue debate about white working-class communities in England, and why they have fallen behind. “We are having to grapple with the unhappy fact that many local working-class communities have felt the full brunt of economic dislocation in recent years, and, perhaps as a result, can lack the aspiration and drive seen in many migrant communities.” Figures supplied by Ofsted earlier this month showed that schools with a high proportion of white working-class pupils in the most deprived parts of the country were far more likely to be judged as inadequate or requiring improvement, than those in other parts of England. Nearly half of secondary schools with many pupils from white working-class backgrounds eligible for free school meals were given Ofsted’s lowest two ratings by inspectors, while only 4% received an “outstanding” grade. In contrast, secondary schools with similar levels of disadvantaged pupils from ethnic minorities had fewer than one in five rated inadequate or requiring improvement, while 29% were rated as outstanding by Ofsted. Spielman said that Ofsted was not “biased against certain schools” and that she admired the teachers who worked in them. “What our inspection outcomes do is to act as a call for action in these areas – a call for the right kind of support and intervention. Part of the reason there is this welcome debate about neglected communities, Brexit and Trump aside, is because organisations like Ofsted have highlighted how national policies can fail to reach these communities,” she said. Michael Wilshaw, Spielman’s predecessor as head of Ofsted, also weighed in with comments blaming parents in white working-class communities. “The reason why London schools are doing so well, apart from good headteachers and good teachers, is because a lot of the immigrant families care about education, they value education, they support their children,” Wilshaw said. “I’m working in parts of England with white British populations where the parents don’t care. Less than 50% turn up to parents evening. Now that’s outrageous.” Wilshaw, a former headteacher in east London, described England’s education as “mediocre” and unable to match countries such as South Korea and Poland. “We’re mediocre because we’re not doing enough about the long tail of underachievement, which is one of the worst in the OECD [Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development], made up mainly of poor children, mainly made up of white British children from low-income backgrounds,” Wilshaw said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/jun/21/england-scent-whitewash-jason-roy-australia","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-21T20:38:32Z","webTitle":"England scent whitewash after Jason Roy hammers Australia again","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jun/21/england-scent-whitewash-jason-roy-australia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jun/21/england-scent-whitewash-jason-roy-australia","fields":{"headline":"England scent whitewash after Jason Roy hammers Australia again","bodyText":"And so the mayhem continues. Jason Roy and Jonny Bairstow relentlessly turned the screw on a sunlit evening at Chester-le Street that made the floodlights redundant – they had been switched on between the innings even though there was almost four hours of daylight remaining. However, there was no obvious daylight for this forlorn Australia side, whose solitary success on this tour has been their impeccable behaviour. Even in this climate that is unlikely to satisfy the hard-baked Aussies back home, if they bother to acknowledge the existence of this expedition, which has one more 50-over match, at Old Trafford on Sunday, and one Twenty20 to run. England won by six wickets with more than five overs to spare while completing their second highest successful run-chase in ODI cricket. Three years ago they knocked off 350 against New Zealand at Trent Bridge; here it felt as if they could have chased more than that if necessary. The openers added 174 inside 24 overs, which settled the outcome even though England had a minor hiccup or two after their departure. This time Roy, who would register his sixth ODI century from 81 balls, set the pace, with Bairstow happy to be the admirer at the other end. Neither man could possibly have timed a cricket ball better than in the past fortnight. Moreover, Roy has looked more secure and more orthodox in his approach than ever before without diminishing his rate of progress. He has been waiting for the ball, no matter how rapidly it has been propelled in his direction, until it is under his nose and then, usually with a straight bat, dispatching it effortlessly to the boundary. On surfaces as true as this one or at Trent Bridge the margin of error for callow bowlers has been minuscule. Bairstow has been equally intimidating. If anything he has been playing a riskier game but his eye is so sharp that the bowlers have also been in torment when he is on strike. Once the openers had departed Ashton Agar, one Australian who will end this tour in credit, managed to dismiss Joe Root and Eoin Morgan relatively cheaply but then Jos Buttler decided to finish it all off with a flurry. Alex Hales, meanwhile, the assassin of Trent Bridge, was content to play an uncharacteristically sedate innings at the other end, just what was required. The fact that Australia, by scoring 310 for eight, had posted the highest ever score in an ODI on this ground soon seemed an irrelevance. The game is evolving so rapidly and Bairstow and Roy are in such fine form that even at the halfway stage there was the assumption the total was insufficient. Upon winning the toss Tim Paine immediately informed the world “We’re gonna have a bat today,” the subtext being that he must wish that he had made the same decision at Trent Bridge, which would have spared his side such humiliation. Australia shuffled their pack by bringing in Nathan Lyon and Alex Carey and recalling Michael Neser in place of a shell-shocked Andrew Tye and D’Arcy Short as well as the injured Glenn Maxwell. This meant that Aaron Finch was restored to his rightful position at the top of the order. He was prepared to play second fiddle to Travis Head as Australia assembled a century opening partnership by the 19th over. There was not much in the pitch for the bowlers and bowling from the Finkle End meant running into a strong breeze. By modern standards both sides were cagey in that first innings. Australia’s batsmen, conscious to avoid another humiliation, shunned too many extravagances in pursuit of a respectable total while England, contrary to the modern ethos, were hellbent on containment rather than the pursuit of wickets. Root, introduced for the ninth over of the innings, bowled 10 without interruption and his low slung off-breaks yielded only 44 runs. Adil Rashid broke the partnership with arguably the worst ball of the day, a long hop which Head (63) hit straight into the hands of David Willey on the midwicket boundary. Shaun Marsh, also in the form of his life, added 124 alongside Finch while Morgan juggled his spinners to the extent that they bowled 27 overs between them. Yet the innings never quite caught fire. Finch, who hit a 105-ball century, and Marcus Stoinis, were both dismissed by Mark Wood, who delivered an excellent second spell as did Willey, who snatched three wickets in one over as fresh batsmen started swishing. Rashid’s last over went for 25 thanks to some crisp hitting from Marsh but then Australia’s second centurion was caught on the boundary off Willey with the routine brilliance of the modern outfielder. Roy caught the ball and, recognising that his momentum was carrying him over the rope, threw the perfect pass to Craig Overton about 15 yards away before his own feet landed beyond the boundary. This may have been the highlight of Overton’s ODI debut. He was the most expensive of England’s attack without bowling dreadfully, which can happen all too easily in the modern game. Just ask the chastened Australia bowlers, any of them."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/24/rosario-dawson-on-getting-weird-for-ugly-animals-im-not-afraid-to-get-my-jazz-hands-on","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-23T23:36:58Z","webTitle":"Rosario Dawson on getting weird for ugly animals: 'I’m not afraid to get my jazz hands on'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/24/rosario-dawson-on-getting-weird-for-ugly-animals-im-not-afraid-to-get-my-jazz-hands-on","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/24/rosario-dawson-on-getting-weird-for-ugly-animals-im-not-afraid-to-get-my-jazz-hands-on","fields":{"headline":"Rosario Dawson on getting weird for ugly animals: 'I’m not afraid to get my jazz hands on'","bodyText":"There’s nothing like an endangered species listing to engender a sense of urgency. That was the case for US actor Rosario Dawson and a host of Australian celebrities who have lent their talents to the Wilderness Society’s #saveugly campaign to draw attention to Australia’s less charismatic animals under threat. “Our star turtle, our Mary river turtle, was on the brink of becoming endangered and she became endangered while we were shooting,” says Dawson, speaking from Los Angeles as the campaign launched last week. The #saveugly video is charming and funny, with Dawson dancing around dressed as the Ethmia clytodoxa moth. The turtle is voiced by Cate Blanchett and the ghost shark by Joel Edgerton. But the campaign message is important: all wildlife has a role to play in a balanced ecosystem. “We can just focus on the things that are comfortable or the things that are easy or the things that get the most attention,” says Dawson. “The ugly truth is that if we ignore any of the different parts of this whole system, it’s all going to collapse.” The actor is known for her activism as much as her roles in films such as Sin City, Seven Pounds and Men in Black II, and TV shows such as Luke Cage and Jane the Virgin. She has been involved in conservation, LGBTQ and domestic violence campaigns, and in 2016 she was arrested for taking part in pro-democracy demonstrations in Washington DC. Activism has been part of her life since she was young. She grew up on New York’s lower east side in the 80s, at a time when AIDS, the crack and heroin epidemic and the homelessness crisis were all hitting hard. “It’s the intersectionality between all of these issues that has always been really apparent to me.” And she doesn’t hold back on the child detentions happening on the US/Mexican border. “It’s horrifying,” she says. “I think that we’re seeing a strategy to really divide people and keep people in a consistent space of despair and reaction mode.” Yet despite the countless issues demanding attention, Dawson is hopeful that campaigns like this can have a wider impact thanks to technology. “Something like this going viral can really spread this message to a lot of people who might not be interested in the [Wilderness Society] especially because there is so much going on.” She has always tried to blend creativity with her activism. “I’m not afraid to get my jazz hands on and be like, hey, look at this, this is important, just as much as the next film I have coming out. They all need to be amplified, all these different parts. They are all stories that are important to me as a storyteller.” And it helps to keep it light. “So many of the organisers and activists that I grew up with, they really suffered so much by martyring themselves for these different causes and not putting in any breaks, not having enough access to healing and humour and the life vitality that you need to do this work.” Younger actor activists like Yara Shahidi, who campaigns on US voter turnout program Eighteen x 18, have the right idea, says Dawson. “It’s really refreshing to see this new young generation that’s coming up that’s really active and very serious about making an impact.” Dawson demurs when asked about her on-screen future with Luke Cage, the Netflix Marvel TV franchise that she has been part of in various incarnations for the past few years. Earlier this year she hinted that she might be finishing up, causing a ripple of concern among fans. “I don’t know,” she says now. “I’ve been on five different shows so you never know what will happen down the road.” For now, she hopes to encourage more people to get engaged. She was disheartened by the low turnout at the recent Californian primary elections, with only 35% turning out to vote: “People are marching and tweeting and posting and they are doing all this different stuff but they also really need to vote.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/22/how-russia-2018-inspiring-women-attend-football-games","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-22T11:14:41Z","webTitle":"How Russia 2018 is inspiring more women to go to football games","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/22/how-russia-2018-inspiring-women-attend-football-games","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/22/how-russia-2018-inspiring-women-attend-football-games","fields":{"headline":"How Russia 2018 is inspiring more women to go to football games","bodyText":"In the shadow of The Motherland Calls, the world’s tallest sculpture of a woman, Anna, 28, was having a stroll in Volgograd before the World Cup game between England and Tunisia. Anna had never attended a league football game in Russia, but said she loved the sport and planned to go to a number of games in her home city with her mother and sister. “We do not attend football games in the league, as the environment at the games can be unpleasant. However, we are going to the game tonight because we want to experience the great atmosphere that comes with the World Cup. I think that the tournament will inspire many women to attend more matches here in Russia,” she said. Another fan, Elena, had travelled from Taganrog in south-west Russia with her family to watch the match. “My children like playing football and I often go and watch. Lots of Russian women really like to play and watch the sport and I think that the World Cup will encourage more women to get involved. International fans help to create a different and more positive atmosphere.” Anna and Elena are two of the many Russian women who will be going to World Cup games in spite of the culture of hooliganism and stereotypes that have led to a predominately male attendance at football matches in Russia. Hooliganism among Russian football fans, previously an internal problem within the country, came to international attention at the European Championship game between England and Russia in Marseille in 2016. However, it has so far been kept at bay during this year’s World Cup. The women’s activist Alena Popova said: “Football continues to be a predominantly men’s sport in Russia. Men with their friends gather in stadiums, before that usually drinking alcohol, and often ending up in fights. This is not the best atmosphere for women. “The World Cup games are calmer than the national championship, so we can see more women in the stadiums than usual. Everyone discusses football here. The problem has not been a question of who is interested in the sport, but about who attends the games.” In recent months the scandal surrounding accusations of sexual harassment made against the MP Leonid Slutsky prompted a wider debate about the treatment and perception of women in Russian society, and activists hope that the World Cup might encourage a more inclusive environment for female fans who want to attend games in host cities. It is not only Russian women who have come out in force to support their national team. Women-only groups have travelled from Europe, Africa and South America, too. Laura, 58, travelled with her friend Luisa, 64, from Uruguay to watch their national team face Russia in Rostov, said: “We use a WhatsApp group to keep in touch with other Uruguayan fans and to meet them for a beer in the evening, but we have been mainly travelling through Russia alone. We have both felt really safe travelling, whether it is on the train or by plane.” Jo, 38, who travelled from Ipswich with her mother, Diane, 68, encouraged other groups of female fans to go to Russia. “Everyone so far has been so helpful and kind,” she said. “It’s really important that groups of women come here as much as groups of lads. We arrived on a chartered flight with England fans and I have to admit it was predominately male, and we should change that.” Samé, 21, had travelled from Tunis with two friends to support the national team during a break from exams: “We have come to support our country,” she said. “We want to wear the flag and to show that women also support football and our national team. Tunisia are not often in the World Cup so we want to come to this match. We have felt very welcome here.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/05/too-much-emphasis-on-the-samurai-spirit","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-05T16:18:37Z","webTitle":"Too much emphasis on the samurai spirit | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/05/too-much-emphasis-on-the-samurai-spirit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/05/too-much-emphasis-on-the-samurai-spirit","fields":{"headline":"Too much emphasis on the samurai spirit","bodyText":"I am puzzled and surprised by the sudden leap of argument and odd cultural stereotypes mentioned in the case study on Japan (What is depression and why is it rising?, The briefing, 4 June).

Of the 76 British institutions ranked this year, 41 have improved their position, with less than half as many falling as last year. But there’s one university in particular which has much to celebrate. The UK has a new leader for the first time since we began compiling standalone rankings in 2010: the University of Oxford has overtaken its perennial rival, the University of Cambridge. Oxford’s rise is primarily due to improved research performance: the global heavyweight produces more academic papers than Cambridge, and also receives a higher number of citations on those papers. Most importantly, as far as our ranking is concerned, Oxford’s research impact is higher when adjusted for the number of staff members, showing it uses them effectively. Oxford – renowned for its tutorial system – also has the smallest class sizes in the UK. This is a particular advantage in the current UK context, given the increasing teaching pressures at our institutions: of our 76 ranked universities, 70 have seen their scores for staff-to-student ratio drop. This is worrying for students because it means that an already beleaguered academic workforce is being stretched thinner and thinner, and universities aren’t investing in their staff.You might wonder whether there’s any Brexit effect to be seen, but the time lag in some of the data means we won’t understand how Brexit has affected the reputational and research performance of UK institutions until the 2024 edition of the rankings. But there’s evidence to suggest that Brexit is negatively impacting international student recruitment. Of the UK’s 76 ranked universities, 53 saw their international student ratio drop – an even bigger fall than last year. This isn’t just about declining inbound mobility, however. The UK’s proportion of international students has remained essentially stable, with approximately 30% of British university enrolments attributable to foreign students both this year and last. It’s also about more aggressive internationalisation strategies elsewhere. Other nations have set ambitious export targets, which are beginning to bear fruit. Russia’s ministry of education is aiming to triple international enrolments between now and 2025. The impact is clear: 70% of Russia’s ranked universities are rising in our internationalisation measures. Its flagship university, Lomonosov Moscow, is continuing to make headway within the top 100. But for the moment, more international students go to the US than anywhere else, and with some good reason. All of the world’s top four institutions – MIT, Stanford, Harvard and Caltech, respectively – are American, and MIT has now stayed at the top for seven years: a record-breaking run. The overall US system is also looking healthier than last year, too, with two more universities among the world’s top 100 than last year (now 33), and more universities rising than falling. However, like UK universities, institutions in the US are also seeing a continued erosion of their international student base. This presents a particular problem for private universities reliant on the tuition revenue generated by international students. Meanwhile, Asia’s top universities have consolidated their status among the world’s best again. China has achieved its first top-20 institution since our inaugural standalone rankings in 2010, with Tsinghua University now 17th, while Japan’s University of Tokyo has made headway towards the top 20 (23rd). Much of China’s improvement is due to heavy investment in research output: Tsinghua, for example, produced more research papers in the last five years than both Oxford and Cambridge. However, Oxford and Cambridge still receive significantly more citations on fewer papers, as do UCL and Imperial College London (both among the global top 10 overall). Tsinghua ranks 7th globally on raw paper count, but 28th globally when citations – which represent research impact – are examined. So while Tsinghua and its continent-leading peers are trying their best to catch up, they can’t yet match the capacity for impactful, innovative research present at UK universities.

Stuffed courgettes, with their thinner skins and creamy flesh, are a far more attractive prospect, however, and popular throughout southern Europe and the Middle East. The classic Provençal version, stuffed with sunshine itself* is one of my favourites: a simple accompaniment to grilled fish or meat, they make a very satisfying meal in their own right, and the recipe is easily adapted to other Mediterranean veg such as peppers, aubergines – or even our very own marrow, should you be a fan. (*not really – that would burn your tongue) The courgettes Many recipes call specifically for the round variety, which can be hard to track down in the UK. They’re an easier shape for stuffing, but if you’ve got a glut of long courgettes, they’ll work just as well – after all, if they’re good enough for Michel Roux Jr, who waxes lyrical about his mother-in-law’s extra-large courgettes (“gorged with sun, they really taste like no other”), then they’ll probably do for the rest of us. Fortunately, the middle doesn’t go to waste: every recipe I try incorporates it into the stuffing. You can leave a lid on round courgettes, if you like – they look rather sweet in Bruno Loubet’s recipe from his book Mange Tout – but it will prevent what’s inside from crisping up in the oven, so I prefer to use them in the stuffing as well. Prep work Having scooped out the middle, some recipes, including Roux’s and Richard Olney’s, then move immediately on to the stuffing process, but many choose to pre-cook them – Loubet shallow fries them until golden, Jacques Médecin, the notorious former mayor of Nice and author of the surprisingly palatable Cuisine Niçoise, blanches them in boiling water, as does long-term Provence resident Patricia Wells, while celebrated cook Lulu Peyraud of Domaine Tempier near Marseilles chooses to deep-fry hers in olive oil instead. Olney, who collaborated with Peyraud on a book of her recipes, Lulu’s Provençal Table, writes: “I asked her if that was not unusual. She answered: ‘That’s the way my mother always did it, so that’s the way I do it.’” While anything fried in olive oil is inevitably delicious, the process does make the courgettes rather soft and greasy, while those put in the oven raw take so long to cook that the stuffing dries out. Best, I think, to parboil them: it’s easier than shallow-frying them, although there’s no need to do so for as long as Médecin recommends: Wells’ five minutes proves quite sufficient. The stuffing Peyraud is also a controversialist when it comes to filling her courgettes: “I know that most people add chopped meats to the stuffing, but I don’t think meat makes any sense in stuffed vegetables.” I’m inclined to agree: Roux’s minced pork and sausagemeat mixture is very popular with testers, but doesn’t deliver the sunny southern flavours I’m after. That said, Wells’ courgettes, stuffed with a mixture of fresh goat’s cheese and sauteed courgette flesh, seem to lack something – a stuffing needs carbohydrate in some form to be truly satisfying, I think. There are many options; breadcrumbs are popular, either soaked in milk or water, and Loubet uses couscous, but our favourite is Médecin’s rice, which keeps its shape better in the oven, giving the finished dish a more interesting, and less stodgy, texture. Undercooking the rice itself will help with this – Médecin’s is rather soft after 20 minutes’ hard boiling and then 45 minutes in the oven – and doing so with other ingredients, including stock, will give it a flavour boost, as well as saving on the washing-up. I also don’t think the filling needs the eggs that he, Peyraud and Roux put in; it makes the mix too wet. However, like Olney, I will be adding diced tomatoes, which will help to lubricate proceedings. The ubiquitous onion is a must, as is a generous helping of garlic, though for a less Mediterranean vibe, Roux’s carrots and leeks are also rather nice. Whatever you use, make sure you fry them first to reduce the water content, or you’ll end up with soggy rice. A good handful of salty cheese such as parmesan, pecorino or a hard goat’s variety will add enough richness to render Médecin’s petit salé cured pork unnecessary, although if you happen to have some to hand, it is a pleasant addition, as, I suspect, would be anchovies. Herbs and spices Be liberal with the herbs here; both courgettes and rice can take it. Médecin uses basil, which I don’t think really stands up to prolonged baking; Peyraud and Olney go for parsley; but my favourite is Roux’s mint, which supplies a lovely fresh flavour. For a typically French touch, you might also add a pinch of curry powder, as in Wells’ recipe – it’s a, perhaps surprisingly, popular ingredient across the Channel. The baking Pre-cooking the courgettes allows a briefer, hotter bake, which will give the vegetables a better flavour, as well as crisping the breadcrumbs we all so enjoy in Médecin and Peyraud’s recipes. Make sure the courgettes are tender before taking them out of the oven; some of the recipes I try drastically underestimate the cooking time in a home oven. If you use meat, deglazing the roasting tin with white wine and stock, as Roux suggests, to make a sauce, is a nice idea, but there’s not much point with a vegetable and rice mixture. A dollop of aïoli, however, would make a very apt accompaniment. Perfect Provençal stuffed courgettes Prep 15 min Cook 1 hr 30 min Serves 4 as a side, 2 as a main 4 medium round courgettes or 2 large long ones 2 tbsp olive oil, plus a little extra 1 onion, peeled and finely chopped 2 medium, ripe tomatoes 4 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed 80g long-grain rice 150ml vegetable (or chicken) stock 1 large bunch fresh mint 50g finely grated parmesan Salt and black pepper 2 tbsp dry breadcrumbs Basil, to garnish Heat the oven to 180C/350F/gas 4. Cut the tops off the round courgettes, if using, and scoop out the flesh with a grapefruit spoon or melon baller, taking care to leave sturdy walls around the outside; if you’ve got long courgettes, cut them in half lengthways and scoop out the flesh in the same way. In either case, roughly chop the flesh, along with the lids of the round kind. Bring a large pan of salted water to a simmer, add the courgettes and blanch for five minutes. In the meantime, prepare a sink full of iced water and, once the courgettes are done, scoop them out of the pan and into the sink to cool down (this will help keep them nice and green). Heat the oil in a wide pan over a medium-low heat, add the onion, and cook until soft and golden. Meanwhile, cut the tomatoes in half, scoop out and discard the watery seeds, then finely chop the flesh. Add to the pan with the courgette flesh and garlic, cook until soft, then stir in the rice, add the stock, bring to a simmer and cook for about 12 minutes, until most of the liquid has evaporated. Meanwhile, pick and roughly chop the mint leaves. Stir the parmesan and mint into the stuffing mix and season to taste. Put the hollowed-out courgettes on a greased baking sheet and divide the filling between them, packing it in well, then cover with foil and bake for 20 minutes. Toss the breadcrumbs in a splash of olive oil, season, sprinkle on top of the courgettes, and bake for a further 15 minutes. Tear a few basil leaves over the top before serving. • What are your favourite recipes for stuffed vegetables – and, indeed, for a glut of courgettes?

Is it too upsetting for them? Or perhaps it’s not upsetting enough, occurring with such regularity that they become inured to the cruelty of the world and assume it’s a regular thing to lose a loved one at a pop concert, or 80 neighbours in a fire? Teachers and experts – one from a grammar school in south-east England – have made the case against these memorials. Everyone wants to insulate children from horror to a degree, and there would be the distasteful tang of the tragedy vulture around a head who held a minute’s silence for every untimely death that came to their attention. It would be bizarre for a school that was in the sightline of Grenfell Tower to not commemorate it formally. Three counties away, the kids might be unaware of the tragedy, and it might feel crass to draw them into it. Although you could argue that is what national solidarity is, marking events that aren’t necessarily on your doorstep. Certain ideas around schooling have accompanied the evolution of a neurotic risk culture in parenting. One is that children can be held in a bell jar of innocence, untouched by the dishevelled culture that surrounds them, and this is what responsible parents do (irresponsible ones let their offspring roam across the news, like urchins playing on a bomb site). Another is that school represents and can control a child’s experience of the world, and that whatever is going wrong, teachers should be able to fix. A third is that talking about world events is politicising childhood, and politics pollutes. But not talking about events is political, too. A lot of this stuff is control masquerading as protectiveness, a timeless debate between authoritarianism and openness. I went to Paris with my daughter shortly after a terrorist attack there, and a woman from Conservative Home said to me in a green room before we were both due to appear on a TV progranme that she would never subject a child of hers to such a mini-break because she wouldn’t want them confronted by the police presence. I replied that my daughter was quite intelligent, and I could probably explain that to her. Openness has opinions of its own, it’s not just the thing we do because we can’t be bothered to protect."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/jun/07/the-cures-robert-smith-i-was-very-optimistic-when-i-was-young-now-im-the-opposite","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-07T12:00:41Z","webTitle":"The Cure's Robert Smith: 'I was very optimistic when I was young – now I'm the opposite'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jun/07/the-cures-robert-smith-i-was-very-optimistic-when-i-was-young-now-im-the-opposite","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/jun/07/the-cures-robert-smith-i-was-very-optimistic-when-i-was-young-now-im-the-opposite","fields":{"headline":"The Cure's Robert Smith: 'I was very optimistic when I was young – now I'm the opposite'","bodyText":"The first thing Robert Smith does is apologise for the makeup. He hasn’t worn it since his last concert with the Cure, in December 2016, but he has a photoshoot today at the Royal Festival Hall and thinks his features are too indistinct without it. To be honest, I would be disappointed if he wasn’t wearing it, along with his regulation baggy black clothes and silver jewellery. Since 1983, the sooty eyeliner, blood-smear lipstick and cobwebbed forest of hair have made him a human logo, transmuted, through the work of people such as Tim Burton and Neil Gaiman, into visual shorthand for the morbidly romantic. He looks like the Cure sound. Even without the warpaint, Smith finds it hard to blend in. In 1989, at the height of his fame, he moved to the quiet south-coast village where he still lives with his wife, Mary, and gamely attended a meeting in the village hall. “It was pretty chaotic,” he sighs. “I was asked to leave, for no reason other than I wasn’t welcome. I thought, ‘I’ve made a terrible mistake.’” He clasps his hands over his face, just like he does in photographs. For someone who once sang “It doesn’t matter if we all die”, Smith has an endearing relish for the bathetic comedy of life. Like the time, during the first Gulf war, when he held a press conference to explain that the Cure’s 1979 debut single Killing an Arab was a reference to L’Etranger and not, as some US radio DJs thought, an Islamophobic anthem. “It was totally surreal, explaining Camus to a sea of utterly bemused faces.” Or the time that he interviewed David Bowie for Xfm and arrived so drunk that he proceeded to talk over his hero for two hours. “I think my opening gambit was, ‘We can both agree you’ve never done anything good since 1982,’” he says, wincing. For all his easy, blokeish charm, Smith means as much to millions of people as Bowie meant to him. This year, the Cure are marking the 40th anniversary of their first concert under that name (they started in 1976 as Malice) with a flurry of activity. Smith has been rummaging through boxes for a documentary directed by regular collaborator Tim Pope. “I knew a few people wanted to – what’s a nice way of saying exploit? – celebrate the 40th anniversary with projects,” he says. “I said no, but I knew that they would probably go ahead anyway unless I made it very obvious that we were doing something.” The Cure may even make their first album since 2008, but we will get to that. First up, Smith is curating the Meltdown festival at London’s Southbank Centre: a walloping 90 artists over 10 days. Smith will close the event under the name Cureation 25 – which promises a lineup of previous bandmates and more – shortly before the Cure headline a sold-out Hyde Park. “Meltdown’s going to be doom and gloom and Hyde Park’s going to be hands in the air,” he says. He sent a handwritten letter to each name on his wishlist and almost all of them said yes. It’s striking that everyone on the lineup, from the Manic Street Preachers to Mogwai, Nine Inch Nails to the Twilight Sad, has been influenced by the Cure in one way or another. Does Smith only like bands who like the Cure? “I think you’d be hard-pressed to find many artists who don’t like the Cure,” he says. “I think people admire us, even if they don’t particularly get the music. It sounds very conceited, but it’s not about me, it’s about the band. We’ve stayed true to ourselves. If you’re in a band, you realise how hard that is. I think people admire our tenacity.” The Cure’s position is certainly enviable: loved with cult-like fervour yet mainstream enough to be covered by Adele (Lovesong) and featured in Ant-Man (Plainsong). There’s even a Reese Witherspoon romcom named after their 1987 hit Just Like Heaven, not that Smith has seen it. They are the only band, Smith notes, who are routinely perceived as both suicidal and whimsical. And they have maintained their integrity. Currently without a record label, manager or publicist, they tour (often) or record (not so much) only when Smith feels like it. It’s not true that he’s the only Cure member who matters (if bassist Simon Gallup left, then “it wouldn’t be called the Cure”), but he has always been in the driving seat. When was the last time he did something he didn’t want to do? He points at my Dictaphone and laughs. “Sitting here.” The Cure tore through the 80s the way the Beatles rushed through the 60s, or Bowie the 70s: wildly prolific, constantly changing. “It is weird looking back,” Smith says. “Everything was done at an incredibly fast pace. Life was whizzing by.” For a 19-year-old neophyte from the suburban West Sussex no-man’s land of Crawley, Smith seemed uncannily self-assured. “Where did that grotesque confidence come from?” he says drily. “Probably punk. Most of the punk bands were fucking awful. I thought we were all right and we were getting better. A lot of it was bluff and bluster at that age.” Within a couple of years, the punk boy wonders had evolved into avatars of doom: 1981’s Faith sounded like inching through a chilly fog. “I thought, ‘How much bleaker can we get? Either we make very, very tiny noises at the end of a concrete bunker and I whisper over them, or we do something different.’” Hence 1982’s Pornography, a churning inferno of rage, nausea and despair. “There was a lot of tension in our personal lives,” he says. “The music’s always reflected, to a very large degree, how I am mentally.” The strain of playing emotionally crushing songs every night, in various states of narcotic disrepair, broke the band. Smith joined Siouxsie and the Banshees and planned to use the Cure as a vehicle for “sort of stupid” pop songs such as The Lovecats – until the stupid songs became hits. “I suddenly thought, ‘Well, actually, this is more attractive than slogging my way round the world with the Banshees!’ So I was never quite comfortable with my reasons.” Then again, he says, a cynical careerist would not have followed up with the queasy psychedelic splurge of The Top. Drummer Andy Anderson, he says, “used to make a huge pot of magic mushroom tea at the start of every day and it just went on from there”. Only with 1985’s The Head on the Door did Smith decide to get “professional”, rearranging the studio for each song and pinning guidelines to the wall. “For the first time we were creating sounds as well as songs,” he says. The instructions for the desolate Sinking, for example, were: “We must cry by 6pm tonight.” The Cure became so big internationally that promoters began calling them the Pink Floyd of the 80s. Smith considered 1989’s exquisitely morose Disintegration his masterpiece; the record label thought it was commercial suicide – it sold 3m copies. Whether in or out of the charts, the Cure occupied a bubble of their own, regularly anointing a symbolic nemesis. “It was generally Duran Duran,” Smith says, “which is really sad because they loved us and they used to come to our shows. But they represented everything we hated: the whole glamorous 80s, consumer bullshit; this horrorshow that we were up against.” Smith also had a long-running feud with Morrissey (“I never really understood it”), in which he has proven to be on the right side of history. The hothouse of success drove Smith to escape from the capital. “I survived; a lot of people that I left in London didn’t.” By the time of 1992’s Wish, with its jaunty hit Friday I’m in Love, the novelty of being huge had evaporated. “I was coping in a slightly disturbed way with what was going on,” he says. “I felt it was at odds with what I’d started out doing. I couldn’t understand how we could be so successful and still be honest. With hindsight we were, but I couldn’t see it.” So when the Cure were elbowed aside by Britpop, he was relieved. “I felt more comfortable being slightly outside of what was going on, because that’s how I’d felt from the very start. Had we kept pushing it, I don’t think I’d have survived it – not in one piece, anyway.” These days, the Cure are predominately a live act, renowned for their epic, multi-encore shows. In Mexico City, as a 53rd-birthday treat, Smith tried to break Bruce Springsteen’s record of 4hr 6min, but miscalculated and fell three minutes short. “I was a bit crushed,” he says, “because we could have honestly kept going for another half an hour.” Friends, bandmates and critics have all suggested he leave the audience wanting more, but he keeps going because he enjoys it so much, and because he thinks he owes it to the fans. “I still think of that person who’s there thinking, ‘I wish they wouldn’t stop. I wish they wouldn’t stop.’” Hyde Park, he warns (or promises), will be a relatively brisk two hours. It has been a decade since the last Cure album, 4:13 Dream. “I’ve hardly written any words since then,” Smith says glumly. “I think there’s only so many times you can sing certain emotions. I have tried to write songs about something other than how I felt but they’re dry, they’re intellectual, and that’s not me.” He wistfully quotes a line from the Cure’s The Last Day of Summer: “It used to be to so easy.” Would he be disappointed if he never made another album? “I would now, yeah. Because I’ve committed myself to going into the studio and creating songs for the band, which I haven’t done for 10 years. Meltdown has inspired me to do something new because I’m listening to new bands. I’m enthused by their enthusiasm. So if it doesn’t work, I’ll be pretty upset, because it will mean that the songs aren’t good enough.” He has been revisiting old unused lyrics to see if he can repurpose any, but “some of them don’t make any sense to me any more. It would be weird if I felt the same as I did when I was in my 20s. I’d be mental!” How has his outlook changed? “It’s slightly more cynical and slightly less optimistic, which is strange. I was very optimistic when I was young, even though I wrote very dismal songs, but now I’m kind of the opposite. I have a very dismal outlook on life.” Smith worries that, at 59, he has become a reactionary who scorns social media, smartphones and the like. “I’m at war with a lot of the modern world,” he says. “I really hate how things have ended up in the last 20 years. I don’t know how it’s happened. There’s a certain tone to this country that’s really changed for the worse.” He’s building a rant, but a melancholy one. “It’s weird how the 70s is often referred to as a period of great unrest and the three-day week, blah, blah. It’s bollocks. The period from the second world war to the 70s, we were on a great trajectory for equality and so forth. It’s only since the end of the 70s, Maggie and Ronnie, that things have inexorably gone wrong. It’s insane, people’s lust for technology and new things.” He sighs. “I’m just turning into a grumpy old man.” Smith is feeling his age in other ways. He notes that Tom Petty’s last UK show before his death last year was also a 40th-anniversary concert in Hyde Park. “Last time we sold out places in America that we’d never sold out, even in the 80s,” he says. “A darker part of me thinks they like watching us because they think I’m going to fall over and they’re not going to get to see us again.” He shakes off the joke. “I’m just being silly. It will stop, of course it will. I do wake up on a day like today and think, ‘Am I really talking about this band, still?’ I’m honestly astonished at how much love there is for the band. If you’d told me when we started, I would have been quite shocked.” One more encore, then. Maybe two. Meltdown festival runs from 15-24 June.

Not content with keeping Generations Y and Z off the property ladder by trapping them in salary-hoovering brunch-addiction and destroying the environment in the Mexican state of Michoacán, where pine species are being felled to make room for the crop and soil erosion is endangering the habitat of native butterflies, the evil green stuff is now destroying the fashion industry. Style is dead, long live lifestyle. Across the UK, sales of clothes are falling as we choose to spend our cash on going out for brunch. (Or on going to the gym, on a festival ticket, on a holiday.) The experience economy is squeezing our clothes budgets. In 2016, spending on recreation was up 8% year on year among UK consumers, while fashion brands struggled with falling receipts. Last year, a Harris group study in the US concluded that three in four millennials would choose to spend their money on an experience or an event over something physical. An aspirational Saturday afternoon is no longer about dropping a wedge in Topshop; it is an Instagram selfie from the farmers’ market showing you and your best friend in your power mesh leggings you wore to boxing class (£15), splurging on bunches of peonies (£8) and artisan walnut bread (£4.50) before tucking in to a Korean kimchi-tofu-scramble brunch (£10). At its most haute, style has always been about lifestyle. A haute couture ballgown is a beautiful object, but nobody ever paid a five-figure pricetag purely for the love of organza. The expense, the requirement for multiple fittings in Paris, the balls that are implied by the word gown: the lifestyle has always been absolutely the point. When you wear a made-to-measure Savile Row suit, the power dressing establishes membership of the upper strata of the workforce, while also being a badge of being singular. Both the ballgown and the suit are roundabout, cumbersome 20th-century takes on the VVIP pass. It has taken until the 21st century for an aspirational lifestyle to trickle down to us, the norms. At the turn of the century, exercise was a tedious utilitarian chore performed in striplit municipal rooms while staring at MTV on a muted screen. Now, it is your chance to channel your inner Gwyneth Paltrow while picking up styling tips on the artful layering of athleisure. And since it now takes perfectly normal people five words to order coffee, going out to eat does not require a white tablecloth and a decanter of wine to be an event. So if your gym clothes and a favourite pair of jeans look good enough to take you through to dinner time on social media, why shop for anything else? Since what we really, really want is the life, rather than the look, a stuffed wardrobe is now just about as modern as a wallet stuffed with coppers and stamps."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/jun/07/dietland-review-pro-women-fat","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-07T05:00:37Z","webTitle":"Dietland review – a ferocious and funny drama for the #MeToo era","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jun/07/dietland-review-pro-women-fat","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jun/07/dietland-review-pro-women-fat","fields":{"headline":"Dietland review – a ferocious and funny drama for the #MeToo era","bodyText":"‘It can be hard to say goodbye to bad habits like eating!”; “90% of our clients say stress makes them binge. And loneliness. But everybody’s lonely, gosh!”; “I think you’re gonna do great and have a lot of loose skin!” Thus speaks, in relentlessly upbeat tones, Plum Kettle’s slimming-class teacher to her shy, uncertain, morbidly obese client, who is saving up for gastric band surgery, so that she can be reborn as “your thin person within!” and start her life anew. Or rather – since she has been overweight and condemned for it since childhood – for the first time. Plum’s life experiences as a fat woman, living in a world in which eating is the enemy, loneliness is no excuse and the knock-on effects of gastric band surgery are the greatest joys you can hope for, are at the heart of Dietland (Amazon Prime), an adaptation by Marti Noxon of Sarai Walker’s 2015 novel. The book follows Plum, cowed and isolated by her physical appearance and dreaming of the day that surgery will take care of all her problems, in her work as an advice column ghostwriter for Kitty Montgomery, the editor of a girls’ fashion magazine. This relatively innocuous setup quickly darkens as Plum finds herself stalked by a mysterious goth girl who leaves her a book called Dietland, about the founder of the Baptist Diet Plan she followed – religiously – until she left college and became embroiled in a feminist cabal that has infiltrated Kitty’s empire. Meanwhile, someone calling herself “Jennifer” is on a murder spree, killing men who have walked free after being tried for crimes such as the rape of a 14-year-old-girl who then killed herself. Another victim is a photographer known to have a penchant for young models. The rollicking plot, along with Walker’s scabrous satirisation of the beauty industry and the deep-seated self-loathing it breeds, made Dietland a bestseller at the time. But it is now – in the #MeToo era and in the wake of revelations about male depravities and depredations against less powerful women, and the ongoing shift towards body positivity and the dismantling of narrow beauty ideals – that the book’s time has truly come. Noxon’s adaptation keeps all that was true, good, funny and necessary about the book – including its aggression not blunted but made palatable by humour of the blackest sort – and added more. Like Reese Witherspoon’s development of Liane Moriarty’s Big Little Lies, it is pro-women to its bones and infused with sure and certain knowledge about female life. It is another programme that makes you realise how much of what we watch about ourselves and what it is like to move through our world is made up of guesswork, approximation and simple wish-fulfilment by those who have no real knowledge of or interest in its accurate depiction. But every woman will flinch in recognition and feel a slight panic at the casual disrespect and the active harassment of Plum as she walks down the street. Whether you are judged desirable or undesirable, the effect is the same. The clicking sound the men make to get her to turn their way so they can humiliate her further is literally pitch perfect. By the end of the first episode, Plum – masterfully played by Joy Nash in her first lead TV role – has met Julia, the woman who heads the beauty department at the magazine as a cover for her mission to bring down the industry from within, and has been inducted into the resistance (although she may not fully realise it yet). Leeta, her “stalker”, introduces her to the author of Dietland, Verena, who invites her to be part of the collection of confident, supportive misfits at her home and societal-deprogramming centre, Calliope House. Confronted suddenly with examples of other ways of being, Plum is jolted if not out of her discomfort then at least into a new, refreshing kind. All the changes to the book so far have been sensible and superficial: TV Plum interacts more with others than book Plum and Kitty’s part has been beefed up – a cipher in the book, she is now played with perfectly coiffed, ever-smiling venom by Julianna Margulies to personalise an otherwise-too-abstract fight against collective norms – and disparate narrative strands have been more smoothly interwoven. All in all, a delicious, satisfying and moreish meal. One to binge on and not feel a moment’s guilt about."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"global/2018/jun/10/the-secret-shame-of-being-a-sober-mother","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-10T06:00:43Z","webTitle":"The secret shame of being a sober mother","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2018/jun/10/the-secret-shame-of-being-a-sober-mother","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global/2018/jun/10/the-secret-shame-of-being-a-sober-mother","fields":{"headline":"The secret shame of being a sober mother","bodyText":"I’ve got a dirty little secret: I’ve stopped drinking. I’m not an alcoholic. I don’t have an addictive personality. I’m in robust good health. I enjoy drinking. But after the birth of my second child three years ago, I became a sober mother. It wasn’t an obvious progression: I drank with the usual wanton enthusiasm before I became a mother. I continued drinking moderately throughout both my pregnancies and while breastfeeding my firstborn – sticking to the government advice that served previous generations perfectly well, that one or two drinks, once or twice a week, was OK. Advice that was suddenly changed in 2007 to a dictate of complete abstention on the basis of no scientific rationale at all. When my first child was weaned, my friends brought round a few bottles and we celebrated with a “normal service has been resumed” party. Coping with the sleep deprivation caused by one baby wasn’t that different from coping with a hangover, I reasoned, so coping with both was just more of the same. With one child, this approach worked reasonably well. Without thinking about it, though, I was buying into the pro-drinking mothering zeitgeist, alien to my mother’s generation, but so prevalent in my own. It is typified not only by the slew of entertaining, slummy-mummy blogs (Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay, Mommy Wants Vodka), books both fictional (Why Mummy Drinks) and biographical (Hurrah for Gin) and films (Bad Moms, Bad Moms 2) but by its all-pervasive presence on the internet, too. I never joined the nearly 630,000 members of the Facebook group Moms Who Need Wine, but I didn’t need to sign up to absorb its message. Nor did I have to buy one of the jaunty coffee mugs, bags, T-shirts, cards or towels emblazoned with cheery, sassy messages about how raising children requires mothers – and these products are exclusively targeted at mothers – to maintain a steady state of semi-inebriation: the wine glass engraved “You’re not really drinking alone if your kids are home” or the flowery fridge magnet chuckling “The most expensive part of having kids is all the wine you have to drink.” Women do not become fools when they become mothers. We get the knowing nudge of the alcoholic version of the “You’re Worth It” advertising strapline but at the same time, it seems we can’t entirely slough it off. The joke reverberates in our ears long after we’ve shut down the browser, closed the book or switched off the TV. Gabrielle Glaser, author of Her Best Kept Secret: Why Women Drink – and How They Can Regain Control says that wine has become “normalised, expected and then reinforced by popular culture, social media, advertising. The volume and ubiquity of the pro-drinking message has made it infinitely more likely that even mothers who know it’s a caricature, will immediately think of pouring themselves a drink as a release valve once the children are in bed – and then do it.” Perhaps it’s because there’s truth in the joke: lots of mothers I know encourage each other to drink. It’s a shorthand for empathy and sympathy – a euphemism for just taking a break. We smile at the despairing mother whose children are bouncing off the walls and tell her that she deserves a large glass of wine after the kids have gone to bed, and that we would do the same. Or we “jokingly” bring a bottle of wine to the NCT picnic. Or we arrange “prosecco playdates” where the adults bring carrot sticks for the children and wine for each other, to be enjoyed in the kitchen while the children play down the hall. It is a statement of the blindingly obvious to say that we Brits live in an alcohol-dependent culture. We can trace our fondness for drink back to the Anglo-Saxon mead hall – Norman invaders writing in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle remarked on how drunk the English soldiers were – via Chaucer to Shakespeare, when drinking became a demonstration of loyalty to the crown and the church, proving that you weren’t a puritan. Nevertheless, female drinkers have traditionally been criticised for neglecting their roles as wives and mothers. They have been portrayed as sexually promiscuous and lacking in characteristics associated with “femininity”, such as being caring, concerned about appearance and health-conscious. But, says Glaser, times have changed. “The pressure on mothers to drink to prove themselves modern is a relatively new one,” she says. “When I gave birth to my third child, I was given bottles of wine by friends alongside – or even instead of – gifts for the baby. It was generous and kind of my friends, but I couldn’t help being struck by how times had changed. That didn’t happen with my first two children.” I’m not saying the modern mother is a gin-swigging inebriate, forever dropping her baby down the steps of Hogarth’s Gin Lane – but when Kelly Clarkson, a singer and mother of four, recently told People magazine that “Children are challenging. Wine is necessary,” she was the latest in a long line of voices across all layers of popular culture to give currency to the image of the modern mother as one who is knackered, chardonnay-swilling and unrepentant. So entrenched is alcohol in our culture that being a sober mother is nowadays to be fundamentally out of step. The image of a mother with a large glass of wine has become an almost feminist face of motherhood, putting two fingers up at the pressure of being a perfect parent and making it unmistakably clear that we are very much not part of those oft-mocked tribes, the tiger and helicopter mums. It is impossible to track the exact point at which, as Glaser says, times changed, because there is no long-term research on mothers and drinking. But something had already happened by 2009, when a systematic review concluded that an increase in drinking among women was “one of the most important trends in alcohol consumption in the United Kingdom”. By 2012, according to the ONS, a similar proportion of women aged 16-24 years, 25-44 years and 45-64 years were reporting as exceeding the UK government’s daily drinking benchmark (three units for women) on a single day in the previous week. In 2015, a study in the International Journal of Drug Policy found that a significant number of mothers were saying drinking enabled them to “assert their identity” beyond the roles and responsibilities often associated with being a woman in early midlife. Mothers with young children described to researchers the “transformative effects” of “excessive drinking” which, they said, allowed them to return temporarily to a younger, carefree version of themselves. The researchers concluded that women’s drinking in early midlife “revolves around notions of ‘idealised’ femininity but simultaneously represents a way of achieving ‘time out’ from traditional female responsibilities such as caring for others”. This reflects the thoughts of one of my NCT friends, Lucy. “A glass of wine – or to be more honest, half a bottle a night – connects me to other mothers who also struggle with their identities,” she says. “An example is when other mothers call me on the phone and ask: ‘Hello, is this Sophie’s mum?’ After a drink, I no longer feel trapped to be in this world where I’m just someone’s mum, even when that someone is someone I utterly adore.” One of my best friends, Gina, credits alcohol with helping her survive the isolation, anxiety, lack of certainty and responsibility of motherhood. “Raising children is one of the most important and difficult tasks given to human beings,” she says. “Combine that responsibility with the sleep deprivation, anxiety, stress and eradication of virtually all adult life as you know it, and alcohol is a wonderful shortcut: a way to feel calm and warmer.” It also, she notes, connects her to other mums she’s just met – with whom she has no history and perhaps nothing in common other than their children, but on whom she is “dependent for advice, understanding and, in the early months of motherhood, sanity-saving adult company.” So does it matter if mother’s ruin has become mother’s little helper? I think it does: a report in the Lancet earlier this year found that every extra glass of wine we drink over the recommended 12.5 units a week shortens our life by 30 minutes. Drinking, researchers concluded, is as harmful as smoking. The Alcohol Harm Reduction Strategy for England states that there are between 780,000 and 1.3 million children living with an adult abusing alcohol. Two years ago a research project found that British mothers-to-be were among the most likely in the world to drink during pregnancy and harm their unborn baby as a result. The study, conducted by the Canadian Institute of Mental Health Policy and Research, found that four times more children in the UK suffer alcohol-related birth defects than the global average. For the proportion of children with foetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD), Britain came seventh out of 195 countries and sixth in Europe. A report commissioned by a crossbench group of MPs and peers – some of whose parents were themselves alcoholics – found that more than one in three deaths or serious injuries suffered by a child through neglect or abuse is linked to parental drinking. The research also found that 41% of those in the problem category were female – previous studies have also found that women are more likely than men to finish a bottle of wine alone – of whom 61% came from the highest ABC1 professional classes. But then we have the recent research, published at the end of last year, and reported in the press with predictable headlines such as “Breastfeeding mums rejoice!” claiming that not only can new mothers indulge in a hard-earned glass of wine without harming their baby, they might actually be helping it because “babies who were breastfed by mothers who drank in moderation had more favourable results for personal-social development”. However, the report goes on to say that breastfeeding women who consumed alcohol were more likely to be born in first world countries, be tertiary-educated and have higher household incomes. Most drank at low levels and employed strategies (such as the timing of alcohol use) to minimise alcohol passed on to infants via breast milk. The researchers also noted that as a child’s social development is likely to be greatly influenced by their environment, a child’s social advantage could also be a result of their mother simply heading out for a drink. In this case, surely, for those who choose to abstain, just going to a festive gathering could be good for the baby. Child psychologist Dr David Carey had reservations about the study. “There are many factors which influence social and emotional development, the most important among them being family and school. So it is highly unlikely that maternal alcohol consumption is a significant factor.” I stopped drinking after the birth of my second child simply because I had too much stored-up energy at the end of the day to want to sedate myself with alcohol. Prior to becoming a mother-of-two, I had been a keen runner. I continued to run during both my pregnancies, but with two small children, I barely had time to find my running shoes, much less put them on. Without intense exercise to whisk the wine-calories from my body and the fumes from my head, drinking seemed a far less attractive option than before. My energy levels were still high though and, after the kids were finally down for the night, I craved not oblivion but stimulation. Parents of small children become inured to leaving shards of unfinished conversations scattered in their wake, and I would metaphorically grab my husband by the lapels when he came home from work and demand unbroken adult communication. The craving for alcohol did take a while to disappear: my association of wine with relaxation was deep-rooted. But once I realised how much healthier I felt for not drinking – how much less painful it was to be woken early and often by squalling children if I didn’t have a head full of cotton wool, and how much more energy I had during the day for the child-rearing equivalent of herding cats – I decided the itch was not for scratching. I feel frustrated that a harmless personal decision should put me at odds with mainstream society. Perhaps it’s because women are now expected to ape the drinking habits of men, that non-participants feel peripheral. Whatever the reason, I tend to keep my new-found teetotalism schtum. I often avoid invitations to the pub because I don’t want to be thought of as a party pooper or – the horror! – be mistaken for a tiger/helicopter mum. If I do go, I nurse a tomato juice made up to look like a Bloody Mary. If questioned, I prefer to mutter exaggerated stories about fractious, insomniac children rather than come clean. “It’s very hard for the modern mother to talk about not drinking in the current climate,” says Glaser. “Alcohol has embedded itself into modern motherhood so deeply that unless you have an addiction problem, it’s difficult to talk about it without sounding sanctimonious. The attitude is: ‘If you don’t have a problem with it, why do you have a problem with it?’” But if we don’t talk about it, how do we know if we have a problem? Stefanie Wilder-Taylor, an American author, stand-up comic and mother was at the forefront of the boozy mother wave with her blog, Make Mine a Double: Tales of Twins and Tequila and her book, Naptime Is the New Happy Hour, published in 2008. But a year later, she took her audience by surprise: she outed herself as an alcoholic. Her confession seemed to unstop a dam: there has been a tidal wave of books since by women who have given up drink, confessing to their alcoholism. Wilder-Taylor still writes and blogs, but now she helps both stay-at-home and professional parents – usually mothers in their early 40s – who have crossed that fine line from merry boozing to functional alcoholism, which in her case was when her nightly wine became a compulsion and it was an emergency if there was none in the house. “I wanted to be the best mom I could,” she says, “and I felt like I was failing every day. I was drinking to be kind of present, just not all present.” During one hospital scare with her daughter, she remembers thinking, “This is a really great place for a bar: right here in the ER.” “We’re bombarded with images of women drinking wine together, with stories of wine-infused play dates, with husbands and wives enjoying each other with alcohol at the end of the day,” she says. “But I’ve spoken to so many mothers who say they never drank so much as they did after having children. I talk to women all the time who look completely normal and put-together from the outside but are drinking and driving, and putting their lives and their families’ lives at risk every day because they’re too afraid to tell someone they have a problem.” I struggled writing this article. I examined and cross-examined every sentence, fearful of appearing sanctimonious. But I decided to press “send” on the article, because really, it’s crazy that talking about something that’s actually a perfectly reasonable choice to make, should be so freighted with anxiety and stigma. The fact I’ve felt any sort of pressure to keep quiet about a sensible – and moderate – lifestyle choice says so much about modern motherhood and drinking, that I reckoned, at the very least, it was worth seeing if I could start a conversation about it instead."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"global/2018/jun/12/good-to-meet-you-maythee-kantar","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-12T10:59:47Z","webTitle":"Good to meet you ...

After a highly charged debate in the House of Commons on Tuesday, Penny Mordaunt tweeted that the message from Westminster MPs to Northern Ireland’s leaders on decriminalising abortion was, “if you don’t, we will”. Earlier, the Northern Ireland secretary, Karen Bradley, gave her personal backing for reforming the region’s tough abortion law, but cautioned against Westminster taking the matter into its own hands. Bradley, who was among the Conservative frontbenchers who welcomed the opportunity to debate the issue, said abortion was a “matter of conscience” and would always be subject to a free vote in parliament. “There are a number of voices calling for reform, including women and girls affected,” she said. “But it is also clear to me that there is no consensus on what that reform should be, even among those who want to see change.” She said acting to reform the law from Westminster would “disenfranchise 1.3 million citizens of the United Kingdom,” and said the focus had to be restoring the devolved executive at Stormont. “That is why the government, like its predecessors, believes that the best forum to debate and resolve these and many other matters is a locally elected Northern Ireland assembly, so the government’s priority remains to urgently re-establish strong, inclusive, devolved government at the earliest opportunity.” However Mordaunt’s message, that “with authority comes responsibility”, suggested some senior figures in government were keen to see action. The emergency debate was called by the Labour MP Stella Creasy, who has proposed a repeal to parts of the 1861 Offences Against the Person Act, which made it a crime for any woman to cause her own abortion. The 1967 Abortion Act exempted women in England, Wales and Scotland, but the OAPA restrictions continue to apply in Northern Ireland. Creasy and her supporters believe they can force all parts of the UK to reconsider their abortion laws by repealing sections of the 1861 act that criminalise abortion, a move backed by several key women’s charities, including the British Pregnancy Advisory Service. The Walthamstow MP said her proposal would respect devolution, telling MPs: “The time limit [on terminations] would not change, nor would the important role of medics in this matter. “I respect and recognise that some people do not consider abortion a human right and so think a criminal approach is the right response, but I recognise many more agree it’s not that which worries them, but the constitutional issues that are at stake. “Let me reassure those MPs who want to uphold the role of devolved assemblies that repealing OAPA would not write a particular abortion law for anyone, but it would require them to act.” Creasy said ministers should commit to allowing parliament to vote on this issue. The proposal has high-profile supporters on the Conservative benches, including the chair of the women and equalities committee, Maria Miller. “We need a change,” Miller said. “I think it’s wrong that women in Northern Ireland don’t have the same access to abortion as my constituents do” However, she said she did not back Creasy’s bid to repeal OAPA, saying it would have a “profound impact for the whole of the United Kingdom ... the debate today is about the situation for women in Northern Ireland and we need to focus on that.” Miller, Amber Rudd and Justine Greening met Theresa May on Monday to express their support for change in Northern Ireland, warning the prime minister of growing Tory support for a referendum, or for extending the 1967 act to Northern Ireland. May told MPs at the meeting she was not prepared to overrule Stormont, and said the issue was sensitive in both Northern Ireland and the Conservative party. Bradley paid tribute to Creasy’s “passionate and moving contribution” and said she was listening to the arguments. In an emotional speech in the chamber, the Conservative MP Heidi Allen said she had had a termination due to ill health, and believed “passionately in choice, equality and a woman’s right to determine her own destiny”. “Because I have been there, I am making it my business,” she said. “I was ill when I made the incredibly hard decision to have a termination. I was having seizures every day. I was not even able to control my own body, let alone care for a new life. “Are you telling me that, in a civilised world, rape, incest or a foetus so badly deformed it could never live, is not sufficient grounds for a woman to decide for herself? No. Enough.” However, the Democratic Unionist chief whip, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, said 100,000 people were alive in Northern Ireland because it was exempt from the 1967 act. “I am proud of that pro-life position, I am proud of the fact that there are so many people alive in Northern Ireland today because we have a law that respects the rights of both women and of the unborn child and we will maintain that position.” The supreme court will rule on Thursday whether Northern Ireland’s abortion law breaches women’s rights by not allowing abortions in cases of sexual crime and fatal foetal abnormalities."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jun/05/scottish-arts-company-seeking-to-restore-modernist-chapel-st-peters-seminary-closes","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-05T15:35:07Z","webTitle":"Scottish arts firm seeking to restore 1960s seminary closes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/05/scottish-arts-company-seeking-to-restore-modernist-chapel-st-peters-seminary-closes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jun/05/scottish-arts-company-seeking-to-restore-modernist-chapel-st-peters-seminary-closes","fields":{"headline":"Scottish arts firm seeking to restore 1960s seminary closes","bodyText":"A critically acclaimed arts company leading a £10m bid to salvage one of Europe’s finest modernist buildings has folded after it failed to secure funding. The arts company NVA had been at the forefront of plans to rescue St Peter’s Seminary near Cardross on the north bank of the Clyde in Scotland. But NVA announced on Tuesday it was closing down, partly because it had failed to find the money needed for St Peter’s full restoration. The seminary, which became derelict after it was abandoned in 1980, is regarded as a modernist masterpiece. It was built in 1966 as a training centre for priests to a design by the architects Gillespie, Kidd and Coia, but was never entirely watertight. Since it closed down, its arches and walls have become covered in graffiti and battered by the elements. NVA, a critically acclaimed arts company that specialised in open air light, sound and kinetic productions involving runners, cyclists and islands, launched a bid to rescue the building after staging its Hinterland show at St Peter’s in 2016. They were given a £4.2m grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund and Creative Scotland in March 2016 to allow key parts of the building to be made weather-tight and protected, to ensure it was safe for public performances and activities. The original intention was to create a permanent arts centre and community facility. Its triple-height chapel was to be partially restored to house a 600-capacity venue while the former sacristy and crypt was to be used for exhibitions. A path network, walled garden and bridges in the surrounding 104-acre estate – which includes the remnants of the 15th century Kilmahew castle, were also to be restored. The site remains in the ownership of the Catholic archdiocese of Glasgow. NVA said it decided last September it could not continue with the rebuilding project, citing increasing financial and physical risks. It said its efforts since then to find an alternative plan for the seminary and its own business floundered after Creative Scotland, the arts funding agency, announced in January NVA would not be given core funding. “The scale of these challenges has led the NVA board to reflect deeply on the current situation and the company’s future and to conclude, with sadness, that after 25 years NVA (Europe) Limited is now not able to continue,” the company said in a statement. It said its last work would be a co-production with a film company, Hopscotch Films, for the official arts season to commemorate the first world war, 14-18 NOW. It said the film would “reflect on the shortcomings of a century of female enfranchisement, 100 years on since the passing of the Representation of the People Act granted some women the right to vote in the UK for the first time”. Scotland’s culture secretary, Fiona Hyslop, expressed regret at NVA’s collapse but would not interfere in Creative Scotland’s funding decisions. Creative Scotland did not offer any new funding but said: “We appreciate how difficult this decision has been for the board and staff of NVA and will continue to offer support and advice to all those involved.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/jun/05/how-to-get-good-women-on-boards","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-05T16:18:56Z","webTitle":"How to get good women on boards | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/05/how-to-get-good-women-on-boards","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jun/05/how-to-get-good-women-on-boards","fields":{"headline":"How to get good women on boards","bodyText":"If you are looking to have more women on boards, the key issue is whether you are looking for women whose backgrounds replicate those of the men (FTSE firms’ excuses for lack of women in boardrooms ‘pitiful and patronising’, 31 May). You won’t find many: there are far fewer women in the c-suite and even fewer chief executives of major companies. The true value of bringing more women into the boardroom is to achieve greater diversity, so look to senior women in public services and the many walks of civil society. But first make sure your boardroom is an inclusive place; no woman wants to sit on a board if she is not going to be listened to. There is plenty of evidence that women are interrupted in meetings or, worse, have their contributions attributed to a man. To achieve gender equality in the workplace, from entry level all the way through to the board room, men and women need to work together. At Murray Edwards College, University of Cambridge, our collaborating with men research found that women feel that it is workplace culture issues that hold them back in their careers – but the barrier to change is that men are often unaware of these issues. Through working with a number of major companies across the UK, we have shown that making men more aware of the problems that women experience is essential for inspiring change. Barbara Stocking President, Murray Edwards College, University of Cambridge • Many years ago, I was an NHS regional PR and marketing manager.

Worse, many women who have made it to the top seem keen to keep their status exclusive, doing little to promote or support other women in turn.

The mastermind behind some of London’s most sumptuous dining rooms, from the Ivy to J Sheekey, he recently unveiled a £55m makeover of Annabel’s. It’s art that helped to dictate the extreme maximalism of the Mayfair nightclub’s decor (including the Picasso formerly known as Girl with a Red Beret and Pompom, but renamed Annabel by owner Richard Caring). “We built a narrative around the art,” explains Brudnizki, who used paintings by the British artist Ian Sidaway as the starting point for the series of botanical murals that decorate the club’s Garden Room. “Sometimes, though, the art comes last and is simply used to amplify the design story.” It’s an approach he takes home with him, too. Visual art adds a layer of interest to the flat he shares with partner Jonathan Brook, who runs the Martin Brudnizki Design studio’s art advisory service in a Victorian mansion block in Parson’s Green, southwest London. It’s not just the rich assortment of works on display that amps up what is otherwise a serene, understated space, it’s the fact that they’re often hung cheek-by-jowl, wall-to-wall. “I like to make sure every square inch of a space works and has purpose,” says Swedish-born Brudnizki. Here, British art sits alongside architectural drawings and abstracts alongside botanical prints – an eclecticism that’s the result of combining their two strikingly different collections. For Brudnizki, picture hanging is its own art form. “It’s a creative practice that’s all about personal taste,” he says. When artist Luke Edward Hall gave him a blue line drawing for his birthday, he used its cool tones to guide the framing: “I got a blue frame and a blue mount – that made the whole thing pop,” he explains. “It works really well to pick a colour from a painting and build the mounting and framing around that. You can customise it in matching – or clashing – tones. The possibilities are endless.” Brudnizki and Brook have taken years to perfect their ever-evolving display. “It’s a slow process,” he says. “You can’t rush it – you look at these pieces every day so they should make you smile.” Top tips: try a grid ‘Art doesn’t have to be a Canaletto, it can be anything you have a connection to. For our flat, I framed the drawings from an old illustrated book of flora of the British Isles, and hung them on the kitchen cupboards. I tend to keep all the frames uniform, too.’ Frame it well ‘Framing is a very creative process. A frame can make or break an artwork. You can customise the mounts, the slips and the frames – so experiment. An easy trick to lift a cheaper artwork is to add a more expensive frame. Above our dining table we’ve hung a painting where the frame cost much more than the artwork.’ Consider the space ‘Consider the use of the room. In a study where you need to focus, you might just have one piece of art on either side of the space. In a tiny TV room I’d fill it with art to make it feel cosy. Smaller rooms often look bigger if you fill them up: it creates talking points in a space.’ Mix and match ‘How art interacts with an interior is key. Think about the other furniture in the room, and how the art responds to one another. Do you want it to be looking at another painting? Do you want to be able to see it as you enter the room?’ Have some fun ‘There are no rules to picture hanging. Don’t be afraid to hang a bold artwork on busily patterned wallpaper. I also love the juxtaposition of a classical interior with contemporary art, or vice versa. Hanging a single painting can add a bit of fun to a wall without the commitment of painting it.’"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"business/2018/jun/05/theresa-may-faces-dilemma-over-nhs-cash-boost-says-ifs","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-05T16:22:02Z","webTitle":"Theresa May faces dilemma over NHS cash boost, says IFS","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/05/theresa-may-faces-dilemma-over-nhs-cash-boost-says-ifs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jun/05/theresa-may-faces-dilemma-over-nhs-cash-boost-says-ifs","fields":{"headline":"Theresa May faces dilemma over NHS cash boost, says IFS","bodyText":"Theresa May’s plans to mark the 70th anniversary of the founding of the NHS with a big cash boost will force the government to raise taxes, break its own budget rules or slash public spending elsewhere, according to the UK’s leading thinktank on the public finances. Amid growing Westminster speculation that an NHS announcement would be made within the next month, the Institute for Fiscal Studies said the size of the health service meant that any meaningful increase in funding would create problems for Philip Hammond. The chancellor, who has been having discussions with the health secretary Jeremy Hunt about how to fund an increase in NHS spending, is committed to balancing the government’s books by the middle of the next decade. The IFS said that plan already involved £5bn of inflation-adjusted cuts to day-to-day spending together with the continuation of reductions in working age social security benefits. But May has been under pressure to respond to public concerns about the NHS and told MPs in March she wanted a long-term plan for health spending to be announced before next year’s full Treasury spending review. “Ultimately, it is for the government to take decisions about spending priorities, and I would suggest that we cannot afford to wait until next Easter. I think in this, the 70th anniversary year of the NHS’s foundation, we need an answer on this,” May said. Increasing NHS spending by 4% – the annual average real-terms rise between its creation in 1948 and 2010 – would increase government spending by £21bn. The IFS said if Hammond wanted to avoid additional borrowing that would mean other day-to-day departmental spending falling by £26bn – a 12.7% reduction – or an equivalent rise in taxes or cuts to benefit spending. “The government is in a bind,” the IFS said. “It is extremely doubtful that large additional cuts to spending on other public services are either feasible politically or consistent with maintaining quality. “So unless it is able and willing to implement tax rises or further cuts to the social security budget over the rest of this parliament it is hard to see how a significant injection of additional cash into the NHS would be consistent with the government’s stated fiscal objective.” With Britain still negotiating its departure from the EU, the IFS said there was an unusual degree of uncertainty over the future performance of the economy, which made forecasting the public finances difficult. “The Treasury may be even more reluctant than usual to commit to a significant increase in NHS spending over a number of years given this uncertainty. “Whenever an announcement on health spending is made, the same dilemma will also play out when the overall spending ceiling for next year’s spending review is announced in the autumn. Either public services will face more years of substantial cuts, or taxes will rise, or social security benefits will be cut further, or yet another set of fiscal rules will, in effect, be abandoned.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jun/23/fit-in-my-40s-zumba-fun-natural-twerker","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-23T05:59:02Z","webTitle":"Fit in my 40s: ‘Zumba's fun, but a natural twerker is born not made’ | Zoe Williams","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/23/fit-in-my-40s-zumba-fun-natural-twerker","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/23/fit-in-my-40s-zumba-fun-natural-twerker","fields":{"headline":"Fit in my 40s: ‘Zumba's fun, but a natural twerker is born not made’","bodyText":"My sister is a big Zumba fan: the way she tells it, the instructors are all really hot. There’s one who looks exactly like Benicio del Toro in the Usual Suspects, and his classes are so full that on a Friday night all the bars are empty because everyone’s in a municipal gym trying to twerk. Every instructor has a favourite musical bent, either salsa, soca (soul of calypso), Latin or dancehall wine, and all are equally good in their own unique fashions. One of the women in her class recruited her to Momentum. I couldn’t recreate a scene like this in my own postcode; but nor could I turn up at her Zumba class. For some reason relational intimacy doesn’t belong in a fitness environment. It would be like the time my friend met his brother in an underwear-only bar. So let’s just accept that hers (trendy south-east London) was cool and mine (not trendy south London) wasn’t (there is nothing to stop you going to hers). I would still recommend this activity. There is major two-streaming in the fitness economy: fashionable classes will skin you alive, hot yoga and reformer pilates happily relieving you of £20 for an hour, which I balk at even when I’m not paying; meanwhile, age-old activities such as pump, step and Zumba are still a much more reasonable seven or eight quid. Plus, novelty is all very well, but you can’t beat an activity that really knows what it’s doing: the pace of Zumba, its crescendoes of effort, is expertly pitched. You get sucked into physical exertion by the irresistible vortex of your own enthusiasm, rather than the exhortations of a lady yelling at you through a headset. The footwork isn’t hugely complicated, but a natural twerker is born not made: some of us could live a lifetime and not get any good at it. There’s always a topnote of competition in a class environment, but there is a bold-faced mutual appraisal in Zumba based pretty much entirely on who is best at shaking that ass. Never has anything so closely resembled the function of the squat thrust, while being so much more fun. The day after, everything hurts roughly as much as if I’d ridden a horse across a beach, when I didn’t know how to ride and the horse was going too fast. If you measure fitness benefits by how much time you spend out of breath, it’s about the same as aerobics, less tiring than step, not as painful as spin and more demanding than the music video backing dancer classes I got into at the start of the year (where there was a fair amount of standing around, puzzling over moves). Even though I was as foxed by the routines as I am the first 20 times I do anything, the sheer easy grace of the old hands suggests to me that it’s like riding a bike. While it feels quite fun in a diffuse, riotous way, it has actually resolved itself into a fitness discipline: you won’t wake up with one tricep aching and not the other, put it that way. It’s not a new sport and nor is it an extreme one. But I’m arriving at the view that “new” and “extreme” are where the trouble starts.

A large but undetermined number of black people feel acutely disrespected in their everyday lives, discrimination they see as both subtle and explicit. Black folk know everyday racism – that becomes powerfully underscored by highly publicized racial incidents like the incident at Starbucks, the recent spate of police killings of black men, or the calling of police on a black female student while napping in a common area of a Yale dormitory. In the face of these realities, black people everywhere take note and manage themselves in a largely white-dominated society, learning and sharing the peculiar rules of a white-dominated society in which expressions of white racism are becoming increasingly explicit. While American society purports to be open and egalitarian, or “equal opportunity”, such everyday outcomes leave black people deeply doubtful. Moreover, black people are generally convinced that they must work twice as hard to get half as far in life. Among their own, black people affirm and reaffirm these central lessons and, out of a sense of duty, try to pass them along to others they care about, and especially to their children. For black people, experience holds a dear school, and the knowledge they acquire is based largely on the experience of living while black in a society that is dominated by white people. Therefore, this cultural knowledge is most often inaccessible to white people, and when confronted with it, most white people are incredulous. The historical context When US supreme court chief justice Roger Taney declared in 1857 that black people had no rights that white people were bound to respect, he was observing the social reality of his day. Slavery effectively established black people at the bottom of the American racial order, a position that allowed every white person to feel superior to any black person. After Emancipation, as black people migrated to cities in the north and south, their stigma both followed and preceded them. When black people settled in their new communities, their reception was decidedly mixed, but as their numbers grew, local white people worked to contain them. Over time, the lowly position of black people became institutionalized, and passed from racist generation to racist generation. Thus, black people usually were relegated to the least desirable sections of a city, often “across the tracks” from the white communities, or in the “black sections” of town, the precursor to the iconic black ghetto. As black people operate in these segregated spaces, they can “be themselves”, away from the direct control of white people. Yet, there is still a general sense that white people and their agents ultimately control the ghetto’s racial reality, notably the financial, legal and criminal-justice systems. While American society is often ideologically characterized as privileging equal opportunity, the everyday reality of the masses of black people is that of being peculiarly subordinate in almost every way, but this is especially true when they venture into essentially white spaces. Navigating the white space Following the civil rights movement, a “racial incorporation” process of the 1970s and 1980s was established, and along with “fair housing”, school integration, and “affirmative action, it benefited many black people . Many of these people have joined the larger American middle class, and they and their children have become increasingly assimilated. But this assimilation is essentially into what they know and perceive as white space, which they often navigate haltingly, and essentially alone. Yet, large numbers of black people continue to reside in segregated neighborhoods, and their children attend largely segregated schools. When venturing outside their local neighborhoods, particularly into spaces that are overwhelmingly white, they are often surveilled, and at times questioned, harassed, or occasionally arrested by the police – all for essentially “living while black”. In navigating these white spaces, they may feel themselves to be tokens, as symbolic representatives of the urban black ghetto. When encountering a white person in this setting, they tend to assume that person is likely to be racially insensitive, if not openly prejudiced, and before giving the person full trust, they hesitate. In the thinking of many black people, it is a highly unusual or even rare to encounter white people who do not share a negative opinion of them and their kind. At the same time, they know and believe there are non-racist white people; they know that such white people exist and may refer to them as “decent” or “good” white people. Here, black people at times see a class divide – they tend to be biased in favor of the well-off white people, those they guess are less likely express prejudice toward black people. When navigating the white space, black people are typically on the hunt for this type of person, thinking that such people might be supportive and friendly or serve them as allies in their struggles, are likely to understand, or at least are not so likely to exhibit the kind of racial animus against them which they strongly associate with most other white people. For black people navigating white space, such allies are critically important, since black folk know there are in fact white people who absolutely hate them but don’t say so to their faces. In fact, a major problem for black people is to figure out which white persons are decent and trustworthy and which ones are covertly racist; they worry about misplacing their trust, as they commonly experience “let downs” and racial setbacks. Because of these challenges, many black people are suspicious of white spaces and hesitate to invest in relationships with white people they find there. Finding such relations too problematic, they tend to disengage with white people both in public and in private, keeping such relations somewhat superficial. Given the rigid distinctions between black and white people, black people know very little about how white people actually live, and vice versa. In fact, profound borders between ordinary white people and ordinary black people have always existed in this country. Since black and white people have lived apart for centuries, their coming together in a cosmopolitan urban society is often a major challenge, and it presents many issues for black people as they move about. Black people tread lightly and exit from stressful situations as soon as they can. In the white space, white people and others often stigmatize anonymous black persons by associating them with the putative danger, crime and poverty of the iconic ghetto, typically leaving black people with much to prove before being able to establish trusting relations with them. Accordingly, the most easily tolerated black person in the white space is often one who is “in his place”– that is, one who is working as a janitor or a service person or one who has been vouched for by white people in good standing. Such a person may be believed to be less likely to disturb the implicit racial order – white people as dominant and black people as subordinate. Strikingly, a black person’s deficit of credibility – a function of history of white supremacy, but also their more recent association with the iconic ghetto – may be minimized or tentatively overcome by a performance, a negotiation, or what some black people derisively refer to as a “dance”, through which individual black people may be required to show that the ghetto stereotypes do not apply to them; in effect, they perform to be accepted. This performance can be as deliberate as dressing well and speaking in an educated way or as simple as producing an ID or a driver’s license in situations in which this would never be demanded of white people. The nod As black people move about the white space, often the first thing they note is the number of black people present. The presence of familiar faces, or simply other black faces, brings a measure of comfort. Being generally outnumbered by white people, black people feel a peculiar vulnerability, and they assume that other black people understand the challenges of this space in ways that white people cannot. Since the white space can turn hostile at any moment, the implicit promise of support black people sense from other black people serves as a defense, and it is part of the reason that black people acknowledge one another in this space, with the racial nod – an informal greeting serving as a trigger that activates black solidarity in this space. First, the strangers’ eyes meet. If both “pass inspection”, mutual nods likely follow, communicating, “I see you.” Those who project negative images of the iconic ghetto will be ignored. This differentiation reflects how today’s black ghetto differs from the ghetto under the rule of Jim Crow. Then the ghetto included upper-class, middle-class and working-class people, as well as the poor. Excluded from white neighborhoods, all black people lived there, as a caste apart from white society. While desperately poor black people resided in that community, it also included well-educated professional people, supportive social structures, and a strong focus on propriety and decency. Today, black people inhabit all levels of the American class and occupational structure. They attend the best schools, pursue the professions of their choosing, and occupy various positions of power, privilege and prestige. But for the ascendant black upper middle class, in the shadows lurks the specter of the urban ghetto. The iconic ghetto is always in the background, shaping Americans’ conception of the anonymous black person as well as the circumstances of black people in all walks of life.

Amber Hussain (not her real name), who has lived in the UK since 2012 and already had a British-born child, was in the process of applying for leave to remain as a spouse when she was told she was not entitled to NHS services. It is illegal for NHS Scotland to remove a patient from a GP list, irrespective of their nationality or immigration status. It is also illegal to charge someone for health services they have already received on the basis that no charges would be made. NHS Scotland’s own rules state that: “No woman should ever be denied maternity services in Scotland, or have such services delayed, regardless of her liability, or ability, to pay when charges apply.” Amber was not able to visit her GP in the weeks leading up to her second child’s birth earlier this month. She had to diagnose her symptoms herself with the help of the internet and guess which medication she needed to purchase from her local pharmacy. While trying to persuade the Scottish government to overturn its decision, Amber also received an invoice for £4,186 for NHS treatment she had received between 2016 and 2017. The bill noted she was an “overseas patient” and that the sum was due immediately. After the Guardian questioned her treatment, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde reimbursed her for the money she had already paid and the remaining debt has been paused while the investigation is conducted. NHS Scotland’s Practitioner Services Division has announced an investigation into the case, but has not contacted Amber, who is still waiting to be told that she can visit her GP or access care without fear of being charged. “The birth of our beloved daughter was completely overshadowed by the stress and anxiety caused by the first bill and the second, similar bill we expected to get to cover the costs of her birth and my wife’s postnatal care in hospital,” said her husband, Ali Hussain. “We couldn’t enjoy our new baby because we were expecting bailiffs to turn up at our door at every moment.” Amber suffered complications after the birth and was kept in hospital on a pay as you go scheme, where every item was charged for. “The birth of a new child should be the most happy thing in the world,” said Ali (not his real name). “But I couldn’t stop myself counting each nappy the baby used and each blanket, and imagining the bill going up and up.” Ali, who has two master’s degrees from UK universities, was a sales and service officer at a UK bank, earning £21,000. In 2015, his accountant realised that an error made by one of his employees in the 2010-11 accounting year had resulted in Ali under-declaring his self-employment income by £8,000. “Straightaway, my accountant sent a revised return to HMRC and all taxes were paid,” said Ali. “HMRC accepted the correction and never imposed any penalty.” The Home Office, however, said the tax amendment was sufficient evidence that Ali should be deported under paragraph 322(5) of the immigration rules, designed in part to deal with terrorists and those judged to be a risk to national security. “During the course of my 12 years’ stay in the UK I never claimed any kind of benefit, I’ve always been a taxpayer, never broken any law and never even committed a traffic offence,” he said. “How can the Home Office classify me a ‘threat to national security’ based on this one minor tax amendment? “Their effort to link tax correction with ‘national security’ is entirely unjustified and a blatant mockery of the principles of fairness and justice,” he added. “The pain my wife and I have, and the stress and suffering we are going through is beyond measure and perhaps beyond imagination.” In March, Ali was called to report to an immigration centre. He attended with his heavily pregnant wife and believes an official he dealt with then forwarded his wife’s details to the NHS. “A few days later, we received a letter from NHS Scotland saying they had been informed by the UK Home Office that my wife was a visitor to the UK and not entitled to NHS services. The letter said she had been removed from the NHS list at her GP surgery with immediate effect.” With their baby due weeks later and Amber’s health condition worsening, Ali employed solicitors to reverse the Home Office’s decision. The solicitor wrote repeatedly to the Home Office, as did the family’s MP, Paul Masterton. “We repeatedly tried to get the Home Office to admit its mistake, stressing the urgency of my wife’s condition,” said Ali. “But they refused to answer letters from me or from our solicitor, and they lied to our MP, too, by wrongly telling them that my wife’s appeal had been refused and then that it was out of time, neither of which are true.” Ahsan Mustafa from RH &amp; Co Solicitors said: “A counter clerk from the Home Office in Brand Street erroneously informed the NHS that our client was not entitled to access NHS services without charge on the grounds that she is a ‘visitor’ to the UK. This is categorically untrue. The Home Office clerk provided erroneous information to the NHS … As a result, our client was delisted from [her GP].” A Scottish government spokesperson said: “Regardless of residency status, everybody in Scotland is entitled to receive immediate and necessary treatment at a GP practice. On that basis, this case is being reviewed by NHS Scotland’s Practitioner Services Division to ensure that the correct procedures are followed.” A Home Office spokesperson said they could not comment on individual cases. Ali added: “I would like to share a flavour of the treatment we got at the reporting centre in Glasgow. I was sitting in front of an officer on the counter and my heavily pregnant and ill wife was standing alongside me. During the session, when I was providing information to the immigration officer’s queries my wife was unable to stand any further because she was not feeling well, and took an empty chair just two steps away. “The immigration officer angrily asked me why she was sitting down and said she needed to stand in front of her. The officer made my wife stand again in front of her in total disregard to her physical condition,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/jun/07/pollutionwatch-uk-hot-may-high-levels-damaging-ozone","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-07T20:30:52Z","webTitle":"Pollutionwatch: May brought high levels of damaging ozone","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jun/07/pollutionwatch-uk-hot-may-high-levels-damaging-ozone","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/jun/07/pollutionwatch-uk-hot-may-high-levels-damaging-ozone","fields":{"headline":"Pollutionwatch: May brought high levels of damaging ozone","bodyText":"We often think of ozone as a stratosphere pollutant, where it does a useful job blocking harmful ultraviolet radiation, but it is harmful to breathe and damages our crops, too. In a typical May, UK air pollution can reach between four and six on the government’s 10-point scale for a week or so. May 2018 was the hottest since records began in 1919. This brought air pollution problems to the whole of the UK except eastern Scotland. Air pollution reached level 4 or above on 30 days during the month and ozone was one of the main culprits. Europe and the US can lose up to 12% of wheat yields to ozone each year, but the impact is worst in the poorest parts of the world, with losses of up to 25% across India and south Asia. Ozone can also attack mung and soya bean crops that are important sources of protein in India. With no global agreement to control the pollutants that form ozone at ground level, this problem will only get worse. In some countries increased agricultural losses will partially offset economic growth over the next decade. The race is on to find crop varieties that are better able to resist this air pollutant."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/jun/16/government-urged-to-investigate-capita-and-fdm-groups-training-schemes","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-16T05:00:36Z","webTitle":"Government urged to investigate Capita and FDM Group's training schemes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/16/government-urged-to-investigate-capita-and-fdm-groups-training-schemes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jun/16/government-urged-to-investigate-capita-and-fdm-groups-training-schemes","fields":{"headline":"Government urged to investigate Capita and FDM Group's training schemes","bodyText":"The government has been urged to investigate graduate training schemes likened to “tied servitude” run by outsourcing firms Capita and FDM Group. Both companies, which are major suppliers of IT and management professionals to government departments including the Home Office and blue-chip firms such as BP, demand job hunters carry out three or four months of unpaid training before they are put forward for salaried work. Trainees must then work for two years or be potentially liable for fees of more than £20,000 for the training courses, as first revealed by the Guardian last year. Frank Field, the Labour MP and chair of the parliamentary work and pensions committee, has written to the business secretary, Greg Clark, asking if he would “consider a public inquiry into the extent and consequences” of the practice and if further protection for workers was required. The letter, seen by the Guardian, added there were “significant doubts” about whether the training fees reflected their true costs. Field said: “My main concern here is around how the practice is, in effect, trapping vulnerable workers in a particular arrangement over an extended period of time regardless of whether they need to leave the scheme for family, health or professional reasons.” Field’s intervention came as it emerged that Capita had changed its policy in the past fortnight, ditching a demand that graduates pay for training if they leave within two years. The policy shift happened after the company received notification of legal action involving a former trainee. Capita told BBC Radio 4’s Money Box programme, which airs on Saturday:“The repayment clauses for training used in 2015 comply with current legislation and are common practice in the industry, however they are no longer used.” Last week the firm’s website was still informing participants they would be required to pay for training, but – by late on Thursday – this had changed. The campaigning barrister Jolyon Maugham, founder of the Good Law Project, who is backing the legal case against Capita and FDM’s schemes, said Capita’s statement was a “tacit acknowledgement that it was in breach of common law rule that you shall not restrict someone’s ability to earn a livelihood”. Maugham, who has described the schemes as “tied servitude”, added: “Unless there are assurances from Capita that it will permanently discontinue this abhorrent practice and release young men and women permanently labouring under this bond, we intend to go to the high court to release them.” The legal team pursuing the action, which has so far raised £15,000 via a crowdfunding site of a £50,000 target, is also continuing proceedings against FDM, which described a two-year lock-in for trainees as a “bond” in its annual report. FDM was unavailable for comment but previously told the Guardian that it had “a clear and unwavering commitment for all trainees and employees to be treated and compensated fairly and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations”. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said it did not comment on individual cases."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global/2018/jun/10/why-laird-hamilton-is-still-making-waves-surfing-legend-lifestyle-guru","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-10T08:00:47Z","webTitle":"Laird Hamilton's age-busting 10-point plan to supercharge your body","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2018/jun/10/why-laird-hamilton-is-still-making-waves-surfing-legend-lifestyle-guru","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global/2018/jun/10/why-laird-hamilton-is-still-making-waves-surfing-legend-lifestyle-guru","fields":{"headline":"Laird Hamilton's age-busting 10-point plan to supercharge your body","bodyText":"Laird Hamilton has ridden many of the tallest, heaviest, fastest and longest waves ever conquered by a human being. Even people who don’t like him – of which there are a few – have to concede that he’s one of the greatest big-wave surfers of all time, if not the greatest. Even if you don’t have the slightest interest in surfing, there’s a decent chance you’ll have seen mesmerising stills or footage of Hamilton streaking down waves the size of a seven-storey building or, somehow, miraculously emerging from the wreckage of one that has curled over and smashed with the force of a Hollywood explosion. But Hamilton, who is now 54, and who has been catching waves for half a century now (yes, he started when he was three years old) is both the archetypal surfer and not – his wife Gabrielle Reece, a professional volleyball player and model, notes that he has never said the word “dude” in his life. In a sport famed for its laid-back vibe, he has always been driven, even ruthless. Hamilton has become a millionaire many times over, splitting his time between Malibu, California and Kaua’i, Hawaii, because he has become that most un-surfing thing: a brand. You can wear Laird Apparel, eat Laird Superfoods and drink the same “creamer” he uses to jack up his coffee. Underneath it all, though, Hamilton still goes out on his board pretty much every day. And the tale behind how he became the most famous surfer in history is a remarkable one. “I think I’ve had a few lives already,” he tells me on the phone from Kaua’i, one of the wettest spots on earth. “I know I feel sometimes that I’m maybe like a cat.” To start at the beginning, Laird’s father was off the scene before his first birthday; Laird eventually tracked him down when he was 21, but there was little interest on either side to pursue a relationship. His mother, Joann, moved from San Francisco to Hawaii and the story goes that three-year-old Laird was messing around in the surf on Pūpūkea Beach one day when he got the attention of a surfer, Bill Hamilton, then 17. Joann and Bill clicked, Joann got a husband and Laird got a stepfather or, as Laird puts it now: “I had an incredible mother and I had a superhero father turned into ultimate rival.” Early on, Laird found solace in water that he didn’t have on land. With his blond hair and fair skin, he was relentlessly bullied by the Hawaiian kids at school. Today he would have probably been diagnosed with ADHD, but back then he was just considered wild and out of control. Bill Hamilton was young, had a fierce temper and struggled to deal with his often errant stepchild. At least once he struck him with a pipe. “Going through it at the time, not so wonderful,” Hamilton recalls, “but what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger. And the fact is that being an outcast has allowed me to do all the things I’ve done. So in the end, I can only be thankful for that.” In Take Every Wave, a recent documentary made about his life, Hamilton’s half-brother speculates that without surfing, Hamilton would have ended up in prison. “There’s probably some truth to that,” he laughs. “Definitely the ocean was my saviour. It saved me from a lot of destruction. Or I’d say self-destruction.” When Hamilton was in his late teens, a friend introduced him to the photographer Bruce Weber and he did some modelling. He was cast as a cartoonish baddie in the surfing film North Shore. However, while other surfers raised their profile by taking part in competitions, Hamilton never did. He says now that he hated the idea of being judged, but there’s another theory: he couldn’t stand losing. He guffaws. “Well, I’d definitely agree that I’m a terrible loser. And competitions would have been disastrous. I think my nature of competitiveness is such that it’s not meant to be used in sport. It’s meant to be used in survival.” So, instead of world titles, Hamilton made his name with outrageous stunts. In August 2000, on the Teahupo’o break in Tahiti, he came down what became known as the “heaviest” wave ever ridden, or the “Millennium wave”. It was an outrageously dangerous feat: the wave crashed on to a shallow-water reef; had Hamilton been thrown from his board, there was no escape route. Surfer magazine ran an iconic cover with just the words “oh my god…” on it – what everyone said, apparently, when they saw the photograph. “A real common question I get is, ‘Tell us what it’s like right before you’re going to drop into some giant wave,’” says Hamilton. “And it’s like explaining a colour if you’ve never seen a colour. How many guys have been out there on these things doing what we’re doing? Maybe a couple.” Hamilton became a superstar, but behind the scenes his life was unravelling. He met Reece in 1995 during a TV interview and, eight days later, Hamilton left his wife and they moved in together. “It’s part of what the ocean teaches you,” explains Hamilton. “You have to make hay when the sun’s shining.” But by the time of the Millennium wave, he was drinking two bottles of wine a night and it was looking like he and Reece were heading for divorce. In the end, they pulled back from the edge. “Relationships take effort and you have to decide if you want to participate,” says Hamilton. “We had to make decisions about wanting to be together or not be together and what that looks like.” Hamilton has two daughters with Reece, and an elder daughter from his previous marriage; the children are home-schooled. He denies that he has mellowed, but concedes that he is maybe “more focused” these days. “I’m not buckshot right now, I’m more like a sniper,” says Hamilton. He’s in ridiculous shape for his age, especially considering that he’s broken most of the bones in his body at some point. Hamilton puts that down to an attritional daily regime that calls for alternating ice baths with saunas, and esoteric exercises such as working out underwater with dumbbells. His secret, he explains, is “the ability to suffer consistently”. In the water, Hamilton, who popularised tow-in surfing and stand-up paddle boarding, has latterly become a pioneer of foil boarding: a hydrofoil extends from the base of the board, much like the latest America’s Cup boats. Instead of surfing, he appears to fly over the waves, reaching speeds that are impossible with the friction of traditional boards. “Last summer I rode a wave for six-and-a-half minutes in Peru, which is probably as long as anybody has ridden a wave ever,” says Hamilton. “And then we’re riding waves where we’re going over 50 knots, which is as fast as probably anybody’s been on a wave ever. So when you’re at this point in your career and you’re doing things on waves that you have never done and possibly other people have never done – that’s a pretty spectacular thing.” How to stay at your peak Laird Hamilton’s fat-burning, age-busting, fun-loving tips for getting the most out of your body 1 Forget age. Just keep driving the car I take better care of myself today not as an accommodation to age but to maintain continual high levels of performance and just to feel good. I have a friend, Don Wildman (above), who’s 83 – an absolute stud who works out with weights, mountain bikes, paddles and surfs every day. Don’s a living example of what it’s like when you keep driving the car. What happens is we decide we’re old and we just stop, and everything stops working. There’s so much stigma and weirdness around being older. Don and I were watching a tennis match and the announcer was saying, “He’s 34 years old!” Get over it – and keep moving. Don’t wait until you have a health scare or collapse. Get off your butt and feel better now. 2 Take care of everyday priorities The stuff you do every day – your sheets and towels, the food you put in your body – these are your priorities. Not a fancy car or fancy clothes. For instance, I used to drink red wine every day – nothing like a good Bordeaux – but haven’t had a sip of wine or beer in nine years. Sugar is not good for your body and alcohol is one of the biggest culprits. Alcohol doesn’t taste good anyway. The reason people drink it is to have some sort of sensation, right? So if you’re not into that sensation, it’s a waste of time. It’s a discipline thing, too. As proof to myself that I had the willpower, I don’t do it. Bottom line: if you want your rocket to fly, put rocket fuel in it. I want to be able to do certain things at a certain level. 3 Be a fat-burning monster I don’t eat energy bars when I’m out on the water all day. In fact, I don’t need to eat anything. My body runs off its body fat. That’s because I’m paleo. I consume hardly any refined sugar, a few raw dairy products and almost no wheat or grains. I eat plants and animals. I grew up that way in Hawaii. Paleo researcher-kineseologist Paul Chek taught me that your body has enough fat on it to run for days... and that sugar fouls up your machinery. So after I cut alcohol, I began eliminating sugar and sugary fruit. I refined it over the past two years listening to primal lifestyle guru Mark Sisson and other paleo people. A triathlete can go for hours on a little almond butter and their own body fat. But if you eat refined carbs, your blood sugar spikes up and down. I love espresso. You could give me five shots of espresso, a quarter stick of butter, a quarter stick of coconut oil and other fat, and I’ll drink that. I could go for five or six hours and not be hungry, because I’m burning fat. 4 But don’t be a zealot I have a saying: “Every-thing in moderation, including moderation.” I make it achievable, not stressful for me and people around me. I’ll use a little coconut sugar. I’ve got friends who have to stick to a diet at all times, and the stress of that almost overrides the quality of the way you eat. My eating is not such a hassle that I can’t go anywhere. 5 Golf-ball your bare feet I grew up barefoot in Hawaii and didn’t give a thought to walking on gravel, but people who’d been in shoes their whole life couldn’t even cross the driveway. The feet are loaded with nerve endings and are the key to balance – and I’m in the balance business. In fact, we all are. I also believe the earth is charged with an electrical frequency that matches your nervous system and immune system. Bare feet allow us to absorb that energy. To restore dexterity and balance after I’ve been in shoes too long, I warm up by standing with one foot on a golf ball. I roll it around, poke it, put weight into tender spots. It’s amazing how your system will be stimulated through working your feet. 6 Watch your back I’ve had back issues and injuries over the years. When your back goes out, you’re out of commission. Give it relief with stretching and inversion, and strengthen it with core work. Someone once said, “If you did 20 minutes of headstands a day, you probably wouldn’t age.” Gravity is always pulling us down, and inversion fights it. I do it on a teeter board or an upside-down hammock. I do planks and rotational exercises with medicine balls and kettle bells on a Swiss ball. Any natural pick-lift-twist-drop movement pattern, like picking something off the ground and putting it on a shelf, builds core stability. Best one of all? Stand-up paddleboarding. 7 Do the water workout from hell To me, swimming laps in a pool is like punishment – being in a cage. Out of my disdain for lap swimming, I’ve developed what in my opinion is the greatest exercise routine you can do: a no-impact, high-intensity strength and cardio workout that is a cross between swimming and weightlifting. Holding small waterproof dumbbells, jump into a fairly deep pool and sink to the bottom. Then jump up as hard as you can to pierce the surface and gulp some air. As the weights pull you back, blow it out. Exhale as you fall, inhale after you shoot up. The exercise blasts your legs, which consume five times the oxygen as your arms. It’ll make you a stronger swimmer without having to swim laps. 8 Get role models It’s monkey see, monkey do. It’s hard to be the monkey that doesn’t see. We all need an example, a road map, to tell us what’s possible – a Jack LaLanne [the US fitness surperhero]. Am I going to fret that I’m old and washed-up when I’m mountain biking and paddling alongside Wildman, who’s 83? He lives, wears and eats a youthful lifestyle. And, by the way, who does Wildman use as his role model, since all his friends are dead? Me! So get younger buddies, too. When your friends get older and say: “I want to go play some bridge,” you tell them, “I don’t think so – I want to go jump off the bridge.’” 9 Be innovative in all aspects of your life Coming up with new ideas keeps me young and excited. [Hamilton and Wildman invented the GolfBoard, a kind of skateboard for golfers that won the PGA’s New Product of the Year award in 2014.] I think travelling to unique places gives you an opportunity to be active. 10 Make it fun Having as much fun as humanly possible is one of the keys to staying young, so find activities you love. I forget about time when I’m out there on a stand-up paddleboard. Activities are better than the gym because you’re not looking at the clock. You’ll do more reps in nature than you’ll ever do in the gym. You’ll go for hours and hours. And you’ll be thinking healthy thoughts – not about how old you are.

Oxford has bucked that trend: its continuing education department runs more courses, with greater student enrolments than ever – over 1,000 a year, and 23,000 a year respectively (exceeding the number of Oxford degree students). Four examples are relevant to recent media stories. First, the 1922 royal commission on Oxford and Cambridge concluded both should pursue continuing education, based centrally: Oxford in 1927 bought Rewley House for this purpose, and is planning to expand these central facilities for continuing education. Second, in 1990 Oxford agreed postgraduates could study part-time, establishing Kellogg College to support these degree students, now the largest of the university’s 38 colleges. (The WK Kellogg Foundation’s strapline “helping people to help themselves” led them to endow a college to give people a second chance.) Third, foundation certificates in history and English literature enable students to study part time for two years before joining the BA second year – which many have done, often proceeding to master’s degrees and doctorates. Fourth, continuing education runs joint courses with Oxford University Press for teachers globally, online and face-to-face, taught around the world and in Oxford. Enrolments have grown among all categories of continuing education students, up 50% over the past 10 years. Increasing resources go to access and widening participation, with free-of-charge events and activities, automatic fee reductions, and funding for scholarships, bursaries and other support.

Apparently these two universities are wealthy (gosh, who knew?), don’t admit enough students from deprived and/or ethnic minority backgrounds (quelle surprise!) and do admit some students who behave very badly. There is indeed room for improvement in our elite universities but, compared with the disaster engulfing our schools, this is a trivial issue. Please recover your sense of perspective.

When the menswear designer started a Central Saint Martins art foundation course a decade ago, he thought he’d end up being a painter or sculptor. But on the first day, someone advised the students that whatever they were considering, it was probably best not to do fashion. “They said: ‘Don’t bother trying because it’s really competitive and too many apply to do it.’” Green smiles, remembering. “I thought: ‘Don’t tell me what to do.’” Now Green is being lauded as the most exciting menswear designer in fashion. Since launching his own label in 2012, he’s won British Menswear Designer of the Year twice. His clothes are sold in the best stores in the world and have been worn by the likes of Drake, Kendrick Lamar and Rihanna (his men’s clothes have a cool, dedicated female following). You might have seen the costumes he made for Ridley Scott’s 2017 film Alien: Covenant. You can find his garments and specially commissioned works at the current Heavenly Bodies fashion exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum in New York. This week, Green is the guest designer opening Pitti Uomo in Florence, one of the most important showcases for men’s fashion in the world. For all his meteoric success, Green is not some flashy showman. Solid, with a genial, youthful face, he is described by the people who know him with endearments: “Oh, you’ll love him. He’s so sweet.” Born and bred in Hendon, north London, like his parents and grandparents before him, Green still lives just round the corner from his mum. In the decadent bookshop-cum-café where we meet in central London, all glossy wood and devil-red cocktail menus, he sits with a coffee and a roll of Trebor mints. His straight-talking manner belies a unique and imaginative way of seeing the world. When your debut collection causes the Daily Mail to mock you, captioning the wooden structures that frame models’ faces with the immortal line “What a plank!” you’re surely on to a good thing. And what Green has done for menswear is just what the industry needed. His work is a mix of wild artistry, conceptualisation and commercial business sense. The organisers of Pitti, where his guest spot comes in the wake of fellow acclaimed designers such as Raf Simons, JW Anderson and Off-White’s Virgil Abloh, have praised his ability to “innovate menswear ‘codes’ without losing track of the contemporary market” – meaning that while Green’s shows provide drama, innovation and craft, his jackets and shirts shift units like nobody’s business. Ask him about the concepts behind his show collections and he will lead you through a maze of fantastical word association that boggles and enchants the mind. “It’s complicated,” Green admits, apologetically. The spring/summer 2018 collection was a comment on the bleak notion of paradise as aspirational lifestyle and the illusory search for the perfect body. The autumn/winter collection, about to hit the shops, started with the idea of the perfection of military wear, but looped into a questioning of the nature of time, a fusion of medievalism and futurism with Wicker Man-style wooden structures, graphic coats that look like bishops from another planet, T-shirts eaten by shirts, crocheted cropped vests and things “made in the wrong fabric”. But Green doesn’t really care whether you get that or not. Sometimes he thinks it’s better not to say, and just let everyone project their own feelings on to his pieces. What he is keen on establishing is that his label focuses on the idea of uniform. “Everything is based around ideas of workwear,” he says. “Not the uniform of stature, but uniform for function. My family are all carpenters, plumbers, upholsterers. My mum was a nurse. They all wore uniforms you could actually work in.” Rather than being oppressive, Green sees uniform as democratic. “At school when you had no-uniform day, that was the point when everyone separated. You started judging each other on how cool or expensive your clothes were. You started seeing the different levels of rich and poor kids. But when you had uniforms, everyone was equal.” Having said that, Green himself was a 15-year-old metalhead into Korn and Slipknot and doing everything he could to not look like he was in uniform. “I was always getting sent home for not wearing the right trousers. Or to take a piercing out,” he laughs. “I had half a shaved head that I’d do with a Bic razor and then draw on a pattern every day with a black marker. And then I went really normal, before Saint Martins. I got it all out of my system before art school, which is weird.” Green began his course with little art history knowledge but an impulse to create. “It was just what I was good at,” he shrugs. “I was always surrounded by make-y people. My mum was always doing craft things and there were lots of building materials from my dad – immersion boilers and stuff everywhere. At the weekends I’d help my uncle do up a house or I’d strip sofas for my godfather, who had an upholstery workshop.” He was the first person in his family to go to university. The news that he was going to study fashion prompted a certain amount of eye-rolling. “I think they were all a bit: ‘The first one to ever go to university and he’s doing colouring in…’” During his BA he felt out of place. “It was very much the era of Alexander McQueen and Diane von Furstenberg, and everyone was doing florals and feminine. I wasn’t fitting into that aesthetic.” It wasn’t until he did placements with two avant-garde designers, the Belgian Walter Van Beirendonck and the Dane Henrik Vibskov, that he began to see how he could forge a way. “They are outsider designers and they taught me that fashion could be about anything. It could be about DIY or workwear or uniform or craft. It doesn’t have to be glamorous womenswear. And it could come from anywhere. Even where I was from.” He went on to do an MA under the late, legendary Professor Louise Wilson, who gave him a full scholarship (“I think she knew I was poor,” he says.) After leaving, he was asked to do an installation for Fashion East’s MAN platform, for which he made his first full collection. He thought it might get him a job somewhere. Instead, he found himself with his own label – “Maybe that’s what I was thinking all along but I didn’t know it.” The label is now stocked at Dover Street Market, Barneys in New York and SSENSE. Selfridges and Matches Fashion sell it in both their men’s and women’s departments. Last year, Green won £150,000 for the BFC/GQ Designer Menswear award, enabling him to launch a twice-yearly Core collection. Now about 70% of his sales come from there. “With the show anything is an option, it’s fantasy or concept-led. But Core is the things from past collections that we’d wear every day. When we’re developing we’re always asking: would your boyfriend wear that? Would you wear that every day or do you just quite like it? Can you sit down in it? Those very functional design discussions. It’s a bit more like product development.” It’s a bit more like huge success, too. But he laughs off any idea of having arrived. “With fashion everything can change – nothing is permanent, you have to take each season as it comes,” he says. “Six months later and everyone’s bored.” Hardly. Step back and watch him fly higher."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"environment/2018/jun/06/government-promises-profitable-farming-post-brexit","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-06T05:30:05Z","webTitle":"Government promises profitable farming post-Brexit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jun/06/government-promises-profitable-farming-post-brexit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/jun/06/government-promises-profitable-farming-post-brexit","fields":{"headline":"Government promises profitable farming post-Brexit","bodyText":"The government will take steps to ensure farms can operate profitably after Brexit, the environment secretary has insisted, as MPs challenged ministers to keep taxpayer funding for agriculture after EU subsidies are withdrawn. Michael Gove said food production was at the heart of British farming. He told the all-party parliamentary environment group: “It would be impossible to sustain everything we value in rural Britain without thriving food production. And we need a balance [with environmental protection].” His insistence on food at the core of the agriculture remit of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) will be welcomed by farmers, who have seen lower productivity in recent years and were concerned by his previous emphasis on the environmental responsibilities of farming. Gove has repeatedly said subsidies would be given on condition of delivering “public goods” such as biodiversity – meaning they would cease to receive subsidies for producing food. These concerns were reflected in a report published on Wednesday by MPs which said taxpayer funding would still be needed after the UK leaves the common agricultural policy (CAP) and such support should be ringfenced in government budgets. The environment, food and rural affairs committee found, in a report published on Wednesday, that the government’s plans for farming after Brexit have so far been vague and demanded further detail on what funding would be available after Brexit. Farmers currently receive £3bn in annual subsidies from the EU. Neil Parish, the committee’s chair, said: “The government should commit to funding future agricultural policy using ringfenced funds, consider new support mechanisms such as tax breaks and capital grant support, ensure that trade agreements demand that imported products meet our standards, and avoid a regulatory race to the bottom.” In its report, the committee called for a “farm productivity plan” to be brought forward next May, in which ministers would set out how to correct the falling productivity of British farms where food production is concerned. The CLA, which represents the owners of land and businesses in rural areas, said ensuring farms were profitable was essential. Its president, Tim Breitmeyer, said: “Brexit brings major opportunities, but success depends on a carefully planned transition. We are pleased MPs have added their voice to our call for the government to focus on a plan for boosting farm profitability [as a] vital precondition of any moves to remove the basic payment system [under the CAP] The production of healthy food is, and must remain, the most important land use in our countryside.” In February, Defra set out its consultation on health and harmony, a vision of the future of British farming which many campaigners said was too vague on major points, such as how subsidies would work and how high standards would be maintained. Later this year, the government is expected to bring forward an environment bill, including among the provisions the setting up of a new watchdog to oversee the protection of the British countryside and environmental regulations following Brexit. The MPs also raised concerns over whether the “public goods” delivered by farming should be seen solely in terms of environmental benefits or animal welfare. They urged the government to consider the whole food system and the role of farming within it, as a way of cutting obesity and improving people’s nutrition. Vicki Hird, farming coordinator at the campaigning group Sustain, said looking at the food system as a whole was a vital step. “We are very pleased to see the committee recognising the extraordinary failure to consider wider food policy with public impact, such as reducing diet-related diseases, and we agree that future policy must support healthy food and new government buying standards [for all the food used in the public sector, such as the NHS and schools] to ensure the use of healthy, affordable and local food in government procurement,” she said. A spokeswoman for Defra said the government was committed to providing £3bn a year to farmers, followed by a longer transition period to allow them to adjust."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/jun/19/best-films-of-2018-so-far-best-movies-of-year","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-19T05:00:06Z","webTitle":"Best films of 2018 so far","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jun/19/best-films-of-2018-so-far-best-movies-of-year","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/jun/19/best-films-of-2018-so-far-best-movies-of-year","fields":{"headline":"Best films of 2018 so far","bodyText":"All the Money in the World Raucous thriller about the real-life 1973 kidnapping of J Paul Getty’s grandson, and the billionaire’s subsequent refusal to pay the ransom – a film that became notorious in its own right after reshooting scenes featuring disgraced actor Kevin Spacey. What we said: With the help of Plummer’s tremendous villain-autocrat performance, Ridley Scott gives us a very entertaining parable about money and what it can’t buy. Read the full review. Arcadia Archive-clip documentary by Paul Wright examining Britain’s relationship with the countryside, ranging from traditional customs to darker notes of disease and death. What we said: A rhapsody-montage of archive clips, flickering evocations of bucolic calm, bizarre eccentricity and what looks like real-life folk horror paganism, coming at you with Pathe newsreel voices and spoken arias of agony and ecstasy, all compiled into a mysterious, extended hallucination. Read the full review. Avengers: Infinity War Third in the powerhouse Marvel series, bringing together a whole gallery of comic-book characters including Doctor Stranger, Iron Man and Black Panther for an epic showdown with supervillain Thanos. What we said: Colossal, cataclysmic, delirious, preposterous – and always surreally entertaining in the now well-established Marvel movie tradition. Read the full review. BPM: 120 Beats per Minute Eighties-set account of the Act-Up protest movement in France, which took on the medical and political establishment over the Aids crisis with guerrilla campaigns and direct action. What we said: A passionately acted ensemble movie… [that] compellingly combines elegy, tragedy, urgency and a defiant euphoria. Read the full review. Beast Creepy, Jersey-set thriller starring Johnny Flynn as a poacher who may or may not be a serial murderer and Jessie Buckley as the unhappy young woman who falls in love with him. What we said: Beast is a title which might appear to promise horror or melodrama and there is a little of both. But there is always something subtler going on. Read the full review. Black Panther Director Ryan Coogler’s film adaptation of Marvel’s comic book seamlessly combines action-adventure and superhero fantasy with questions of racial discrimination and power. What we said: The intriguing thing about Black Panther is that it doesn’t look like a superhero film – more a wide-eyed fantasy romance: exciting, subversive and funny. Read the full review. Blockers Pitch Perfect writer Kay Cannon makes her directorial debut with this hugely entertaining comedy. Its simple premise – three sets of parents frantically attempt to stop their children having sex on prom night – is undeniably compelling. Here is a “cock-block” like never seen before. What we said: It’s an entirely daft comedy, but its goofy rollercoaster energy and genial good humour keep it barrelling along, with many a bad-taste fiasco as our middle-aged, sex-obstructing adventurers experience quasi-teen nightmares of their own and come to terms with their imminent empty-nest sadness. Read the full review. Brad’s Status Ben Stiller takes the lead in this light comedy, playing a down-trodden middle-aged man facing an existential crisis. Racked with envy of those of his friends who have made it, Brad must now also accept that his son Troy’s potential looks just as likely to eclipse his own. What we said: Brad’s Status is an introspective and downbeat film, but forceful and personal, with excruciating and all-too-real moments of mortification. And it can be weirdly moving, almost out of nowhere. Read the full review. The Ciambra Neorealist-style drama about a Roma community in Calabria acted by non-professionals, focussing on the teenage Pio who has to step up as breadwinner after his father and brother go to prison. What we said: There is something euphoric, but also sad, about watching an unschooled performer dominate through some mysterious and serendipitous rightness. Read the full review. Coco Pixar’s animated film is about a young boy who wants to become a musician – against the wishes of his family who want him to be a shoe-maker. Extending to the Land of the Dead, Coco touches on age-old questions of memory, mortality, family and oblivion. What we said: Being simultaneously life-affirming and death-obsessed is a tough act for any film to pull off, but Coco manages it. This might start bringing Pixar studios back from the dead. Read the full review. Crowhurst The second of the year’s two biopics of Donald Crowhurst, who faked his progress in a 1968 round-the-world yachting race. It is a powerful rendering of Crowhurst’s experience: a psychological thriller whose merit lies in its detail. What we said: Justin Salinger is absolutely superb in the lead role, heart-wrenchingly convincing as the decent British chap who wears pyjamas as he goes to bed on board his boat every night: thin, clenched, wiry, doggedly making the best of it. Read the full review. Custody Award-winning French drama from Xavier Legrand, exploring divorce, familial ties and psychological abuse. It is both hard-hitting and minimalistic, with stellar performances from Denis Ménochet and Thomas Gioria as a father and his 11-year-old son. What we said: There is not much storytelling light and shade in Custody, but it has the shock and swipe of real life” Read the full review. Darkest Hour Rousing biopic of Winston Churchill during his wartime greatness, with Gary Oldman on Oscar-winning form as the statesman struggling with appeasers and the Nazi threat. What we said: This is not so much a period war movie as a high-octane political thriller: May 1940 as House of Cards, with the wartime prime minister up against a cabal of politicians who want to do him down. Read the full review. Early Man Another triumphant animation from Nick Park, Early Man is a family comedy that stages an epic football match between the tribes of the stone age and the bronze age. Endlessly good-humoured. What we said: It’s impossible not to laugh at the inspired silliness and charm of Park’s universe. Early Man is a family film that doesn’t just provide gags for adults and gags for children: it locates the adult’s inner child and the child’s inner adult. It’s a treat. Read the full review. A Fantastic Woman Beautiful, Oscar-winning study of a trans woman, Marina (played by Daniela Vega) living in Santiago, who is plunged into a waking nightmare when her lover, Orlando, dies. Marina must not only confront her loss but also an insidious and deepening sense of alienation and cultural diaspora. What we said: A Fantastic Woman is a brilliant film: a richly humane, moving study of someone keeping alive the memory and the fact of love. Read the full review. Funny Cow Maxine Peake stars and produces this savagely comic portrait of a female standup comedian fighting her way through the sexist comedy-club circuit in the 70s. What we said: Peake gives it a fierce, blazing energy and holds everything together through the magnetic force of her performance. Read the full review. A Gentle Creature Nightmarish Russian parable about a woman attempting to locate her husband, apparently in a Siberian prison, through a fug of bureaucratic delay and deflection. In the Fog’s Sergei Loznitsa directs. What we said: A brutally realist movie – at least at first – that takes its heroine on a pilgrimage into the vast, trackless forest of national suffering. Read the full review. The Happy Prince Biopic of Oscar Wilde, directed by and starring Rupert Everett, focussing on the final months of the outcast writer’s life in exile as he attempts to recover after his traumatic spell in jail. What we said: Everett takes us through the moment-by-moment horror of humiliation and poverty, which Wilde brazens out with gallows humour and wit as best he can. Read the full review. Hereditary Thoroughly creepy haunted-house horror in which Toni Collette plays an artist and mother whose daughter Charlie is the focus for her recently-deceased mother’s ghost. What we said: Hereditary is basically a brilliant machine for scaring us, and Collette’s operatic, hypnotic performance seals the deal every second she’s on the screen. Read the full review. I, Tonya Mockumentary-style biopic tells the story of the infamous skating rivalry between Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan: replete with modern-day interviews, voiceovers and asides, it is a raw investigation into a life torn apart by scandal. What we said: Margot Robbie gives a fantastically uninhibited performance as Tonya – frizzy of hair, angry of demeanour, she often brings out a raptor grimace on the ice, denoting pain or gloating triumph. Read the full review. Isle of Dogs Wes Anderson fable set in a dystopian Japan many years in the future, when all dogs have been banished to an offshore island. Twelve-year-old Atari (voiced by Koyu Rankin) goes in search of his beloved dog, Spots. What we said: Isle of Dogs is another utterly distinctive, formally brilliant exercise in savant innocence from Anderson, somewhere between arch naivety and inspired sophistication. Read the full review. Journey’s End Adaptation of RC Sherriff’s classic first world war drama with powerful performances by Asa Butterfield (as the young and excruciatingly innocent Lieutenant Raleigh) and Sam Claflin as Raleigh’s school hero Captain Stanhope, now brutally ravaged by conflict. What we said: The first world war is one of the 20th century’s oldest, grimmest tales of futility and slaughter. Dibb and his excellent cast put new passion into it. Read the full review. Lady Bird Mother-daughter relationships, teenage identity, classroom politics – there is something for everyone in Greta Gerwig’s growing-up drama. An evocative performance by Saoirse Ronan as Christine “Lady Bird” McPherson. What we said: Greta Gerwig’s feature debut as a writer-director is a gloriously funny and wistfully autobiographical coming-of-age comedy. Read the full review. Lean on Pete Andrew Haigh follows 45 Years with this moving portrayal of two runaways: teenage Charlie (played by Charlie Plummer) and the titular racehorse. Slow-paced yet saturated with a natural dignity. What we said: Haigh has a masterly way with mood and moment, with the play of light on a scene, and with a robust shift from fierce sunshine to sombre night-time. Read the full review. Leave No Trace Ben Foster and Thomasin McKenzie are superb as a father and daughter who are living off-grid in an Oregon national park, in an outstanding study of familial relationships by Debra “Winter’s Bone” Granik. What we said: The intimacy and love between Will and Tom is presented with real delicacy. It’s a movie that will live with me for a long time. Read the full review. Let the Sunshine In Claire Denis creates a superb role for Juliette Binoche as a divorced artist uncertain of her emotional path as she progresses through a number of short affairs and agonised discussions about romance. What we said: An elegant, eccentric relationship comedy of ideas, highly rarefied and possessed of an almost inscrutable sophistication. Read the full review. Love, Simon A coming-of-age and coming-out story, this film offers simple heartwarming romance and a story of self-empowerment as the eponymous Simon, a high-school kid (played by Nick Robinson), comes out as gay. What we said: With its sheer warmth, openness, likability and idealism, Love, Simon won me over. It takes all the corniness and tweeness of the coming-of-age genre and transplants new heart into it. Read the full review. Loveless Leviathan director Andrey Zvyagintsev returns with another masterpiece about Russia’s social and moral breakdown, in which a divorcing married couple realise their 12-year-old son has gone missing. What we said: A stark, mysterious and terrifying story of spiritual catastrophe: a drama with the ostensible form of a procedural crime thriller. It has a hypnotic intensity and unbearable ambiguity that is maintained until the very end. Read the full review. My Friend Dahmer Creepy, unsettling account of the mass killer’s time at high school, adapted from the autobiographical graphic novel by John “Derf” Backderf, in which Dahmer’s teenage strangeness was clear – but perhaps not the direction it would evolve in. What we said: My Friend Dahmer taps into ... the dark side of geekdom, geek rage and geek hate. And mightn’t Dahmer himself have congratulated himself on his nerd destiny: the loser who became super-famous while his tormentors peaked in high school? Read the full review. The Post Steven Spielberg’s high-minded account of whistleblowing in the Watergate era, after the Washington Post agonised over the publication of the Pentagon Papers. What we said: The film is a pointed celebration of liberal decency in the past and implied present ... Lincoln-Memorial-level rebukes to today’s various squalid declines in Washington and Hollywood. Read the full review. A Quiet Place A post-apocalyptic horror film with an achingly simple premise – humans must remain silent in order to survive being devoured by marauding monsters. Brilliantly performed by Emily Blunt and actor-director John Krasinski. What we said: This isn’t a young adult drama, it’s a prematurely old adult drama, a world in which innocence, childhood and happiness have been blowtorched off the face of the Earth. Read the full review. The Rape of Recy Taylor Nancy Buirski’s documentary broadcasts the extraordinary story of Taylor’s rape by six white teenagers in her Alabama hometown in 1944, and the failure to render her any kind of justice. An angry, instructive film What we said: Buirski’s vigorous and wide-ranging film draws on the various modes of expression and protest that the Recy Taylor case brought into focus: the black-oriented press and the ‘race film’ industry targeted at black audiences. Read the full review. The Shape of Water Multi-Oscar-winning fantasy by Guillermo del Toro, in which Sally Hawkins plays a mute woman who falls in love with an amphibious creature held in a military research facility where she is a cleaner. What we said: A visually ravishing fantasy romance that almost drowns in its own gorgeousness. It is a Beauty and the Beast fable where both get to be beautiful and neither has to be beastly. Read the full review. Sicario 2: Soldado Sequel to the Denis Villeneuve cross-border narco terror thriller, this has Josh Brolin and Benicio del Toro teaming up again to combat the cartels’ plans to smuggle Isis bombers across the border. What we said: This delivers a coolly targeted payload of brutality, launched from a cauldron of male aggression and international politics. Read the full review. Solo: A Star Wars Story Despite its ambivalent reception at the box office, this Han Solo origin story is an enjoyable run-through of Solo’s first meeting with Chewbacca, his acquisition of the Millennium Falcon and his brush with the rebels who are trying to weaken the Empire. What we said: Solo: A Star Wars Story has a glorious origin myth meet-cute to set up one of cinema’s greatest bromances: the stoic wookiee Chewbacca and the insolently handsome freebooting rebel pilot Han Solo – and Alden Ehrenreich absolutely crushes the role to powder. Read the full review. The Square Performance art or artistic performance? In Ruben Östlund’s Palme d’Or-winning satire, art museum director Christian’s mobile phone is stolen, triggering a series of bizarre events. In the process, experience is brought dangerously close to social experiment. What we said: This movie really brings some gobsmackingly weird and outrageous spectacle, with moments of pure showstopping freakiness. Read the full review. That Summer Context-filling documentary about Big and Little Edie, the subjects of Grey Gardens, the Maysles brothers’ celebrated mid-70s study of patrician decay. What we said: This is basically a must-see, an archival gem with mouthwatering unseen footage of the two women who were turned by [Grey Gardens] into pop-culture legends. Read the full review. The Third Murder Multi-layered, complex courtroom drama from Japanese auteur Hirokazu Koreeda. When Misumi (Koji Yakusho) goes on trial for the murder of his factory manager, he pleads guilty. As more evidence comes to light, it becomes increasingly difficult for the defence lawyer to ascertain what happened. What we said: An intriguing and cerebral quasi-genre picture ... that can be read at least partly as a piercing – if not precisely passionate – rebuke to the death sentence. Read the full review. Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri Martin McDonagh hit the jackpot with this coruscating drama about a woman attempting to shame her local police department over their failure to find her daughter’s killer. A deserved best actress Oscar went to Frances McDormand. What we said: It is a film about vengeance, violence and the acceptance of death, combining subtlety and unsubtlety, and moreover wrongfooting you as to what and whom it is centrally about. Read the full review. Western A meandering exploration of cultural identity, masculinity and individual choice from German film-maker Valeska Grisebach in which a group of German construction workers are sent to build a hydroelectric plant in rural Bulgaria. What we said: One of the films of the year has arrived – maybe the best of the year – a work of unmatched subtlety, complexity and artistry. It is about tension and transgression and yet also succeeds in evoking a pure and miraculous calm. Read the full review. The Wound South African drama directed by John Trengove that investigates Xhosa initiation rituals, as well as the complexities of transgressive sexualities in the same communities, struggling with tradition and modernity. What we said: Coming-of-age is usually a syrupy Hollywood genre, and it’s bracing to find it given such an unsentimental expression – and to see that it applies not only to adolescents, but to adults, too. Read the full review. The Young Karl Marx Raoul Peck’s film is an account of the birth of communism and the blossoming friendship between its key movers – a sort of bromance between Marx the poverty-stricken thinker, always spoiling for a fight, and rich-kid Engels, a dandy from a well-off background. What we said: It gives you a real sense of what radical politics was about: talk. There is talk, talk and more talk. It should be dull, but it isn’t. Somehow the spectacle of fiercely angry people talking about ideas becomes absorbing and even gripping. Read the full review. You Were Never Really Here Lynne Ramsay’s first film since We Need to Talk About Kevin, a scarily violent study of a security guard (played by Joaquin Phoenix) attempting to rescue a teenage girl from sex traffickers. What we said: A movie that teeters perpetually on the verge of hallucination, with hideous images and horrible moments looming suddenly through the fog. Read the full review. Zama Dreamlike fable from Argentinian director Lucrecia Martel, about an 18th-century Spanish colonial administrator posted to an isolated settlement deep in the South American interior. What we said: Horror and despair hover just out of the frame, or below the surface, or behind the curtain, of Lucrecia Martel’s mysterious and dreamlike movie.

The fact that darts has a new base will come as a surprise to many pubgoers, especially when they learn that an hour’s session for two players is £15 – off-peak. But Flight Club is a million miles from the game of community taverns and the jargon of Bullseye. Here, the boards are electronic. All the score-keeping is done for you, as with bowling. Hit a button, and staff bring more drinks. A screen overhead takes your picture and turns it into an avatar, and the next day you are sent a link to your “Flight Club Story”: a montage of action replays, neatly bundled and ready for upload to your Facebook feed. It is the glossy, hi-tech reboot of a game deemed to be dying as long as a decade ago. In 2007 the bookmakers Blue Square, which organised the Save Our Darts campaign, found that just one in 10 Britons had played pub darts in the previous 12 months, down from one in four five years earlier. The rumoured return of Bullseye to television and the professional league parties aside, darts as a pub game is still on the decline today. The same factors apply as in 2007, though metrics are harder to come by. The cost of floor space in inner cities has squeezed traditional pubs hard. The dartboard is usually the second casualty, after the pool table. Jocky Wilson and Jim Bowen on ITV’s Bullseye in 1984. The show is rumoured to be set for a return Yet Flight Club represents a small demographic pocket in which the trend is reversing. It opened its first venue in Shoreditch, London, in October 2015; it has since expanded to Bloomsbury, with plans under way for its first venue in Manchester’s Ship Canal House, and another in Chicago. It is hard to know what the likes of darts champion Phil “The Power” Taylor, who began life as a sheet metal worker before moving on to making ceramic toilet roll holders, would make of Flight Club. But Mark Ball has a few ideas. The Cityscape: get the best of Guardian Cities delivered to you every week, with just-released data, features and on-the-ground reports from all over the world Ball is researching a PhD at Leeds University in the traditional experience of darts, and has based himself in Stoke-on-Trent – Taylor’s home town and the last redoubt of the British scene. In Stoke, you can still play darts seven nights a week, and many do. The pub Ball plays in hosts two men’s teams, three women’s teams, and three dartboards – “And it’s a small pub,” he says. The city’s passion for the game is obvious; the reasons for it, less so. Some think it is because of Taylor’s mentor and 70s legend Eric Bristow, who moved there from London, says Ball. “Others point to the fact that, well, there’s just not a lot to do.” We meet at Flight Club’s Shoreditch venue, which is kitted out with grandfather clocks, bankers’ lamps, Chinese vases, and other faux-Edwardian decorations now typical of a certain kind of Time Out-friendly London venue. Around us, young City types in suits and pink shirts drink lager and lob arrows. Darts in the 1940s Ball and I play a game of 301 – rebranded by Flight Club as “Demolition” – and an around-the-clock game called Shanghai in which hitting the same spot on the board three times summons an animated ninja on the electronic scoreboard above. He thrashes me. Ball took up the sport only after deciding to set his doctorate (on the relationship between “leisure, meaning and a sense of place”) in the dense and storied world of the Stoke darts scene. Demographically, Stoke is said to be the most working-class city in Britain, with 37% of residents performing “routine work”. It is famed for its community spirit and for getting on with it, often in the face of adversity. With the city in fact a federation of six smaller towns, its urban sprawl allows for a dense patchwork of pubs, rather than a few big bars downtown. Rents are also very low. It is easy to see how the game of darts might strike near the heart of such a place. Some of the locals Ball has met have been playing for 50 years. No wonder it took him weeks of lunchtime practice in the university canteen before he felt ready to join a team there himself. Men throw darts and drink beer at a pub in Porlock, Somerset Flight Club, he says, is a different proposition entirely. It offers a number of packages: corporate teambuilding for groups of up to 400 people, boozy “brunch social” weekends, even speed-dating. The social bit is predominant, Ball argues, with darts more the instrument of a business model. “Places like this feed a need for a certain kind of accessible urban experience – Tinder dates, basically, and work dos,” he says. The formula is “cocktails, plus wood-fired pizza, plus X” – where X is a game dredged up from the youth club or rec room and transformed to fit the urban experience economy. “I’d say the thing that really got me thinking along those lines was when I heard there was a curling bar in London last winter.” Be it hipster bowling places like Brooklyn Bowl or hipster table tennis places like Bounce, they serve the same purpose: an accessible, structured interaction with a novelty element – perfect for that first date or corporate event. The party atmosphere at the BDO World Darts Championships 2018 at Lakeside “It helps if the game is quite short – you need turnover to make it profitable. You can have it explained for you and made slick, so you can dash in and out,” says Ball. “I’d be interested to know how many people [Flight Club] have coming in on a regular basis.” These “adult playgrounds”, as Ball calls them, are as much a reflection of market forces as the struggling pub landlord stocking up on goats cheese tartlets from Brakes’ gastropub range. The price-per-square foot of retail space in London means a cheap evening’s entertainment is now largely the preserve of churchgoers and park drinkers. Standing around costs money – the Flight Club model works well because it effectively charges a ground rent to patrons. “It fits a logic of urban development,” says Ball with a shrug. “The one informed by the logic of accumulation and abundance that says that more is more, and that the old must make way for the new.” An ‘adult playground”: social darts at Flight Club in Shoreditch “It’s not necessarily that darts is being priced out of the market,” a Flight Club representative argues. “Rather, people are now going out less often so are looking for something different when they do. They want unique, memorable experiences they can share with friends, family or colleagues.” As for the distinction between darts and “Social Darts”, Flight Club say that they’ve taken the traditional game of darts and “supercharged” it: “We’ve developed a range of fast and exciting multiplayer games ... Our guests pay to play in large groups and for the spaces that best suit their requirements, rather than for the dartboards themselves.” Ball is keen to clarify that he doesn’t have anything against the brand in particular. “In fact, I think it could be a really positive thing – a gateway to making darts accessible to people who might be intimidated by a locals’ pub.” But he says “[darts in] Stoke has something that London doesn’t – a sense of craft, of community – that isn’t really represented here”. It’s true that darts and other leisure activities are anchored in stable, close-knit communities, which are increasingly rare in the major metropoles – but they also create them. “I’ve made so many friends playing darts,” says Ball. “I can go in there, have a half [pint] for two pounds and get immersed in a game of darts, get lost in it, for an hour. And I think increasingly we all need a space to get lost in. You can’t buy that.” He waves a hand at the studded leather panelling, strings of filament bulbs, and animated ninjas. “If this is our vision of leisure in the 21st century – people coming in for an hour, not engaging with the craft – then I think we’re losing something.” Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}
