World Cup arithmetic","bodyText":"On my puzzle blog earlier today I set you three football table challenges: 1) England, Tunisia, Belgium and Panama make up Group G in the 2018 World Cup. Imagine that once they have all played each other the table looks like this. If you know only that England beat Tunisia 3-0, can you deduce the score of every other match in the group? (For non football fans: the F column is “goals for”, meaning how many goals the team scored in total, the A column is “goals against”, meaning how many goals the team conceded in total, and the P column is “points”, when 3 points are awarded for a win, 1 for a draw and 0 for a loss.) EXTRA CLARIFICATION: Some readers pointed out that Belgium should be above Tunisia in the table, because goal difference is the tie-break when two teams are equal on points. This observation is correct, but does not affect the puzzle. The reason that the error crept in is that I updated the puzzle from one written in 1921 when there must have been a different criterion for the tie-break. Thanks to everyone who spotted the mistake. Solution We know by looking at the points that England won all three games, Tunisia and Belgium both won, drew and lost a game, and Panama lost all three games. Let’s consider Tunisia, which lost to England 3-0. Tunisia must have beaten Panama (since everyone did) and therefore drawn with Belgium, scoring 2 goals and conceding 0 across these two games. The only way this combination is possible is if they won 2-0, and drew 0-0, since if they scored a goal in the draw with Belgium, they would have conceded another goal, which we know they didn’t since they only conceded 3 in total. So far we have: England 3 0 Tunisia Tunisia 2 0 Panama Tunisia 0 0 Belgium And the games left are England vs Panama Panama vs Belgium England vs Belgium England conceded only one goal. Panama scored only one goal. Let’s assume that the goal scored by Panama was conceded by England. In that case, Belgium did not score against England. So Belgium must have scored 3 goals against Panama. We know that Tunisia scored 2 against Panama. But that means that England can only have scored a single goal against Panama, since Panama only conceded 6. Yet our assumption was that Panama scored a goal against England, meaning this match would have been a draw, which we know is incorrect. We conclude that our assumption was wrong, and that the goal scored by Panama was against Belgium, and the goal conceded by England was also scored by Belgium. So, of Belgium’s three goals, one was against England. The other two must have been against Panama, since they won that game despite conceding a goal. Thus Belgium beat Panama 2-1. Panama conceded 6 in total, so England beat Panama 2-0, and beat Belgium 2-1. 2. This GCHQ puzzle: I’m only going to give you a sketch of how to solve this one. First, you need to know that the goals for and the goals column must always be equal. Since Slovakia has a goal difference of zero, the goals they scored are equal to the goals they conceded. Which means that the goals the other three teams scored are equal to the goals the other three teams conceded. Thus Wales and Russia conceded one goal each. Next, looking at the order of the teams, you can work out how many of the games each team must have won, drawn and lost, and once you have that you can work out the exact scores. For example England are top but they cannot have won all three games, since you cannot win all three games and have a negative goal difference. Here’s the full table. 3. I asked if it was possible to design a football table puzzle in which only a single number is given and from which we can deduce every single result between the teams. (Assume that all matches have been played). I think the only possible answer is if the team that is in first place has a 0 in the “goals for” slot. Since from this we can deduce that every match must have ended 0-0. This means all teams are on 3 points. If this were a World Cup group, there would be a tie-break to determine who comes top, which under current rules are be Fair Play points. It is the null solution...but still interesting that we can deduce all the results from a single number. Does anyone know if there has ever been a four-team group in any major competition with only 0-0 results? I hope you enjoyed today’s puzzles. I’ll be back in two weeks.

That moment foreshadowed what is shaping up to be among the most indelible of Trump’s triumphs – the reshaping of the federal judiciary with the appointment of dozens of judges with an ideological bent toward the administration’s agenda. Republicans are working with Trump to make a record-breaking number of appointments to federal courts. These new, mostly young, white men will be in a position to rule on legislation that could change America for years. But the most contentious appointment would be a second nomination to the highest court in the land. The supreme court has over decades delivered landmark decisions on issues from abortion to affirmative action and same-sex marriage. The potential for Trump to install another justice on the nine-seat bench, some legal experts argue, could have profound consequences on issues ranging from women’s reproductive health to LGBT rights. With speculation mounting over the possible retirement of supreme court justice Anthony Kennedy, Trump could have a lasting impact on reshaping America’s most important court. “If President Trump fills another vacancy on the court it will have an enormous effect,” said Erwin Chemerinsky, the dean of Berkeley School of Law at the University of California. “It will create the most conservative court since the mid-1930s,” he added. “It would mean a majority to overrule Roe v Wade and to allow states to prohibit abortions, to eliminate all forms of affirmative action, to eliminate constitutional limits on illegal police conduct.” The president himself underscored the power of future vacancies earlier this year, when he tweeted that Republicans “must ALWAYS hold the Supreme Court!”. While it is not unusual for presidents to appoint supreme court justices with similar ideological leanings, Trump’s comments all but reinforced that he is unlikely to nominate a consensus pick if provided the opportunity. In November, the president updated his shortlist of candidates for a hypothetical vacancy, adding to a roster of proven judicial conservatives. While the likelihood of a pending vacancy is far from confirmed, judicial watchers have set their sights on Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a progressive icon who turned 85 this year, and Kennedy, a critical swing vote who has been the subject of retirement rumors for the second straight year. Any vacancy prior to 2020 would almost certainly be filled by Trump, and a rules change adopted by Republicans during the Gorsuch nomination fight enabled the Senate to confirm supreme court justices with a simple majority vote. Under the current balance of the court, Kennedy and the chief justice, John Roberts, though conservative appointees, have at times sided with the bench’s liberal justices. Kennedy was the architect of several major decisions on LGBT rights, most notably the supreme court’s milestone ruling in 2015 establishing same-sex marriage as the law of the land. He is being closely watched as the likely deciding vote on the court’s highly anticipated decision regarding a case of a baker in the state of Colorado who refused to provide a wedding cake for a same-sex couple. Camilla Taylor, the director of constitutional litigation at Lambda Legal, a national civil rights group focused on LGBT issues, said Kennedy’s previous decisions in the LGBT community’s favor “helped bring our relationships and our families out of the shadows and recognized the full humanity and citizenship of our community on the court”. Taylor voiced concern that a second Trump supreme court nominee would present “an immediate and unambiguous threat to the LGBT community.” “Another conservative Trump justice would jeopardize our right to marry who we love, and also our fundamental equality under the law including protections from discrimination in housing, public accommodations, employment and education.” Some nonetheless argue that if the speculation around Kennedy’s departure proved true, it would not fundamentally alter the supreme court. Brian Fitzpatrick, a professor of law at Vanderbilt University, said Republican vows to overturn Roe v Wade, the supreme court’s 1973 ruling that legalized abortion in the US, are more designed to energize conservative voters than they are grounded in reality. “Even if we have a more conservative replacement for Kennedy, the conservatives are not going to overrule the right to an abortion, they’re not going to overrule gay marriage,” Fitzpatrick said. “The reality is the big cases where he goes with the liberals are cases that I doubt the conservatives have the stomach to reverse, even if they had the votes next year. “That would be too dramatic a change in our society,” he added. “It would cause all kinds of turmoil and backlash in the political system. People like Chief Justice Roberts, he’s a very institutionally minded person. He’s not going to risk the supreme court’s credibility and consistently by operating it like a weathervane.” If Trump were to oversee a supreme court vacancy, a prevailing question remains as to whether Democrats in the Senate would force a similar blockade of the seat as Republicans did under former president Obama - should they retake the Senate in November’s elections Democratic wounds have yet to heal over the refusal of Republicans to grant Merrick Garland, Obama’s nominee to replace Scalia in 2016, a hearing or a vote. The Republican opposition came despite the fact that Garland held a reputation as a widely respected centrist judge on the US appeals court. Progressives now believe Democrats should give any future Trump nominee what has become known in Washington as “the Garland treatment”. Prominent Democrats have signaled reservations about resorting to the same tactics, which they argue would risk further eroding institutional norms. But Senator Elizabeth Warren, of Massachusetts, suggested an overtly partisan pick by Trump would not receive much of an audience with Democrats. “The question is who you put up,” Warren said in an interview with Pod Save America, a political podcast hosted by former Obama aides. “The people that George W Bush would put in wouldn’t be exactly the same as the people that Barack Obama would put in. But they’d be along the same road.” Warren noted that the climate had changed, even as she conceded it was counterproductive to follow in McConnell’s footsteps and state from the outset that Democrats would block any Trump nominee regardless of background. “I think that’s wrong,” she said. “But I do think you send a Neil Gorsuch to us, and the answer is no. We do hearings, we do it substantively, but the answer would be no.” McConnell, for his part, has said any supreme court vacancy this term would be dealt with expeditiously and before the midterm elections. “It would be a top priority,” he told NPR last week. “If we get a vacancy on the supreme court this year, we’ll deal with it.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/31/guatemala-migrant-shot-us-immigration-border-patrol","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-31T09:00:16Z","webTitle":"The Guatemalan migrant shot in the head could have been me | Aura Hernández","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/31/guatemala-migrant-shot-us-immigration-border-patrol","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/may/31/guatemala-migrant-shot-us-immigration-border-patrol","fields":{"headline":"The Guatemalan migrant shot in the head could have been me","bodyText":"I was in the kitchen when I began watching a video on Facebook of a woman screaming that the Border Patrol had shot a young woman in the head. I soon learned the young woman was a paisana of mine – both of us from Guatemala – and that she had been killed while crossing the same border I’d traversed years ago. “They killed her!” the woman filming the video screamed in Spanish. I felt powerless while I watched; there’s nothing you can do in that moment, even though the video is live. “They shot her in head!” the woman exclaimed again. I later learned the woman filming lived near the crime site and that she’d been getting ready for a wedding when she heard the gunshot, grabbed her telephone, and rushed outside. What a hero, I thought. Border Patrol could have arrested her, accused her of anything, but she had the courage to film and confront the agents, to narrate the truth. “Come on, guys!” she screamed, her anguish now directed at the agents. “How are you going to put a bullet in her head?” That’s when I started to feel sick and called my husband to tell him what was happening. “They assassinated a young woman,” I told him. Shortly afterwards, I learned her name was Claudia Gómez González, and I saw a photo of her, in which she’s standing straight and wearing her huipil. She looks so innocent and natural – and yet so beautiful. It reminded me of an old photo of myself, when I was nearly the same age. I had the same sad, innocent eyes, same face without makeup. Looking at her photo, I’m suddenly transported 13 years earlier to the time when I entered this country. Like Claudia, I didn’t know what lay before me, and I never imagined that something terrible would happen to me. I’m reminded of my own innocence, fear, humiliation, and truncated dreams. I was also the victim of abuse by the Border Patrol when I crossed. An agent sexually abused me while I was detained in Texas. This memory is why I’m so affected by Claudia’s killing. But what pains me more than anything else is knowing that she had no opportunity to live her American dream. That’s the difference between us. I survived the Border Patrol. She was killed, without any remorse. Both of us came for a better future, but she was killed in cold blood. Now the Border Patrol says it’s investigating Claudia’s case. Investigating. Investigating. The agency is going to investigate until people forget about this. Local news reports two other members of Claudia’s group were witnesses to the crime. And where are they now? Detained – jailed – so that they can’t speak out. So they can’t say what they saw. From my experience, I know how Border Patrol handles its investigations. Years ago, when I reported the sexual abuse the agent committed against me, the officials said they were going to investigate. I waited and waited for news about the investigation – news that never came. Now immigration is trying to deport me, to silence me. Since Claudia’s killing, I feel as if I, too, am in mourning. I feel enraged and powerless to know how human rights are being disrespected, to know how a border agent can kill a migrant as if she’s a dog. I’m frustrated to see how the new administration has given so much power to the Border Patrol that an agent – a killer – can grab his gun and kill someone who only wanted to achieve a better life for herself and her family. It’s not fair that the agency will now try to wash its hands of this killing by claiming the man was acting in self-defense. Self-defense against what? The only weapon Claudia was carrying was her dreams. I hope that Americans who don’t speak Spanish will learn about Claudia’s killing, about the crimes that are being committed against us immigrants and the ways in which we’re being dehumanized. Recently, President Trump said we aren’t people, that we’re animals. And now, they’re treating us as if we’re even worse that that. When I first saw the video, my husband told me not to worry too much about this, that I had my own case to fight. Right now I’m living in sanctuary in a church in Manhattan to avoid being arrested and deported while I’m appealing my immigration case. But I can’t just forget about the slaying of my paisana. Neither of us will rest in peace until we receive justice for the crimes of the Border Patrol. So I’m calling on everyone: let’s unite as human beings to demand the US government respect our human rights and to demand Claudia’s death does not go unpunished.

Cohen’s lawyers also clashed in the courtroom with Michael Avenatti, a lawyer for Stormy Daniels, the actor and producer of pornographic films, who alleges she had an affair with Trump more than a decade ago and was paid $130,000 in hush money by Cohen, which was later reimbursed to Cohen by Trump. Avenatti is an active thorn in the side of the White House and had come to court to press for his inclusion in the proceedings. Judge Kimba Wood warned Avenatti, who has frequently discussed the Cohen case on TV and social media, that if he joined the proceedings he would have to shrink his media profile. Public discussion of the case by participants could “potentially deprive him [Cohen] of a fair trial by potentially tainting a jury pool”, Wood said, calling the proceedings a “potential precursor to a criminal proceeding if charges are filed”. Avenatti withdrew his request for inclusion after the hearing had ended. The FBI raids were conducted as part of a continuing investigation of Cohen on potential charges of bank fraud, wire fraud or campaign finance violations. The stakes for the president are high. If prosecutors charged Cohen, Cohen could come under intense pressure to cooperate with the government in its investigation of the Trump campaign, as three other former Trump aides have already agreed to do. Trump has denied all wrongdoing, as has Cohen. Appearing in the southern district of New York, Cohen’s legal team argued that material seized in the 9 April raid was protected by attorney-client privilege and should not be used by prosecutors. Lawyers for Cohen said 15 attorneys plus two data experts had been working “full-time” to sort through millions of seized documents, including electronic files, to decide which should be held back, but they could not hope to finish the process before mid-July. “We’re moving heaven and earth,” said Cohen’s lawyer Todd Harris, responding to a suggestion by federal prosecutors that Cohen’s team was seeking to delay the proceedings by slow-walking the review process. “We have people working all night, we have people sleeping on couches,” Harris said, adding that one associate lawyer had even “developed a tremor in his hand. I had to send him home.” Wood told Cohen’s team to complete its work by 15 June. A prosecutor revealed that the contents of a shredder and two Blackberry devices were all that remained to be turned over to a court-appointed special master, who is screening evidence to determine what is covered by attorney-client privilege. Also reviewing the materials are lawyers for Cohen, Trump and the president’s family business empire, the Trump Organization. Upon leaving the courthouse in lower Manhattan, Cohen – who also has the Fox TV star Sean Hannity as a client – did not reply to a shouted question about whether he intended to cooperate with prosecutors. A few people not related to the attending media lingered in the area as Cohen emerged. “Fuckin’ traitor!” yelled one. The courtroom witnessed fireworks as Cohen’s lead lawyer, Stephen Ryan, attacked Avenatti, accusing him of committing a “premeditated drive-by shooting of my client’s rights” by leaking sensitive bank records pertaining to Cohen – records that showed bankers had filed suspicious activity reports over money flows through Cohen’s Essential Consultants LLC. Avenatti helped to publicize the fact that AT&amp;T, Novartis and others had paid Cohen hundreds of thousands of dollars for consulting services in the year after the inauguration. Ryan said Avenatti had “published that information gratuitously. He intended to prejudice and cause harm, and he did. What Mr Avenatti did was entirely reckless and improper.” Ryan further argued that Avenatti should be barred from the proceedings by pointing out that Avenatti’s former law firm was ordered by a bankruptcy court last week to pay $10m to a former partner. Avenatti denied any misconduct and said the bankruptcy case was irrelevant, pointing out that Trump had “had his fair share of bankruptcies over the years”. “The irony of that, your honor, is fairly palpable,” Avenatti said. Avenatti argued for his right to participate in the proceedings because the seized material, he said, included audio recordings between Cohen and the lawyer who represented Clifford in the hush agreement, Keith Davidson. Avenatti said he was “disturbed” that Cohen had had conversations with Davidson about Clifford and recorded them. Davidson also represented a second woman who has alleged an affair with Trump, the former Playboy model Karen McDougal, in a separate deal in which McDougal sold exclusive rights to her story to a tabloid, which then buried it. Avenatti accused Cohen of leaking information about the audio tapes to members of the media “in an effort to paint a false narrative about my client or for some other purpose”. Ryan denied that his team had leaked any audio material, saying his law firm had audio tapes “under lock and key”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/may/30/nfl-owner-oath-colin-kaepernick-grievance-anthem-protests","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-30T18:15:04Z","webTitle":"Kaepernick lawyer: NFL owner testified to shunning my client due to Trump","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/30/nfl-owner-oath-colin-kaepernick-grievance-anthem-protests","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/may/30/nfl-owner-oath-colin-kaepernick-grievance-anthem-protests","fields":{"headline":"Kaepernick lawyer: NFL owner testified to shunning my client due to Trump","bodyText":"A lawyer for Colin Kaepernick says an NFL owner testified under oath that he changed his mind about signing the quarterback after Donald Trump said players protesting during the national anthem should be fired. Kaepernick hired attorney Mark Geragos as he filed a grievance case claiming owners have colluded to keep him out of the league after he knelt during the national anthem to highlight racial injustice in the United States. Under the league’s Collective Bargaining Agreement teams and the NFL are forbidden from coming together to deprive a player of employment. Kaepernick, who led the 49ers to the Super Bowl in 2013, left San Francisco at the end of the 2016 season and has not been picked up by a team since. The fact that teams with a need for a quarterback have passed up the chance to sign Kaepernick left many to believe owners are either punishing him for his stance or believe his presence would alienate fans. A number of NFL owners have been called to testify in the collusion case. On the Straight Aim podcast this week, Geragos said one owner had admitted under oath that he changed his mind because of Trump’s stance on the anthem protests. “Maybe you can prove that [New England Patriots owner] Bob Kraft, for example, was scared of what the president might do, but for collusion you would need to show that that fear actually influenced the owners by clear and convincing evidence. So, that’s kind of a high burden,” says Straight Aim host Amy Dash. “Well, unless you’ve got an owner under penalty of perjury testifying that he changed his mind after he was told what Trump said,” replies Geragos. When Dash asks Geragos if he has such evidence, he replies: “Yeah. Well, bingo.” Geragos does not imply that Kraft is the owner in question. Geragos’s statement appears to be backed up by a report in the Wall Street Journal. The newspaper says it received copies of some of the testimony from owners. “I was totally supportive of [the protests] until Trump made his statement,” said Miami Dolphins owner Stephen Ross in his deposition. In Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones’s statement he describes how Trump told him: “Tell everybody, you can’t win this one. This one lifts me.” Last week NFL owners issued new guidelines that will see teams fined if their players or staff do not show appropriate “respect” for the national anthem. According to the new rules, “a club will be fined by the league if its personnel are on the field and do not stand and show respect for the flag and the anthem”. Geragos said he believes the league adopted the new rules to appease white, conservative fans, who make up the majority of the league’s fanbase. Surveys have revealed that a majority of black Americans support the protests started by Kaepernick, while the majority of whites oppose them. “[The NFL has] made the choice they are gonna opt on the white nationalistic side as opposed to any other demographic,” said Geragos. Last week, Trump said that players “maybe ... shouldn’t be in the country” if they don’t stand for the national anthem."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/31/grenfell-firefighters-heroes-public-inquiry","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-31T09:00:16Z","webTitle":"The Grenfell firefighters are heroes.

They don’t deserve a trial by media","bodyText":"The firefighters who responded to the Grenfell Tower fire, including the emergency fire control operators who took dreadfully distressing calls, acted with courage, professionalism and dedication, rescuing many people. Without them, there would have been far more deaths. It is a source of deep concern and sorrow that they were not able to rescue more. They do not deserve, and they can do without, armchair critics such as the writer Andrew O’Hagan, editor-at-large of the London Review of Books, telling them “the firefighting effort wasn’t all that it could have been”. They can do without the Sunday Times columnist Sarah Baxter saying “the fire brigade certainly let people down”, seeming to regard firefighters as “jobsworths” who “stick to the rigid demands of bureaucratic protocol” and bow to “the bureaucratic gods of health and safety”. Both these writers have prejudged the evidence due to be heard at the public inquiry. Their assessments are based on a lack of understanding of challenges facing firefighters and the fire service. If more people thought about health and safety, the disaster might never have happened. We await the findings of the public inquiry, but it has been clear from the earliest accounts of that night that firefighters faced an unprecedented catastrophe and they responded by going above and beyond the call of duty. Normal working procedures that are in place to keep firefighters as safe as possible while tackling fires could not be applied. Firefighters adapted what they did in order to maximise the number of people they could rescue. Firefighters themselves do not use the term “heroic”, but I have no hesitation in calling their actions that night just that. The Grenfell Tower fire was an unprecedented disaster the likes of which no British firefighter will have witnessed before and will hopefully will never see again. I was a firefighter for more than two decades, and I have been in the fire and rescue industry for 35 years. I have never in my professional life seen firefighters have to deal with a fire on that scale and with such a risk to life. I have never seen firefighters have to do the things they did on that terrible night. I am proud, humbled and for ever in awe of the work they did. I can only imagine their emotions as they headed to Grenfell seeing the block ablaze from miles away. The firefighters who were given a round of applause by the Grenfell community as they returned back to their fire stations are now facing trial by the media. It is both disgraceful and heartbreaking. Journalists seem to forget that we had a 24-storey tower block in the middle of one of the wealthiest boroughs in one of the world’s richest cities that was effectively coated in petrol. If non-flammable cladding had been used on the building, the fire would most probably have been contained to the floor it started on. Baxter asks why the emergency services didn’t save more lives. She blames the longstanding “stay put” policy for high-rise fires. She, unlike the firefighters who were there, is not legally prevented from saying whatever she likes. The Fire Brigades Union hopes the Grenfell Tower inquiry, of which we are a core participant, investigates this issue forensically. There are indeed difficult and complex issues to be addressed. Tower blocks are designed so if a fire breaks out in a property, the blaze can be held there for a length of time, allowing fire crews to respond. This is called compartmentation. It clearly failed at Grenfell Tower. The “stay put” policy may well have to be changed, particularly after this failure of compartmentation at Grenfell, but we will not prejudge the inquiry before it has heard the evidence on this, and we don’t think newspaper pundits should either. I am entirely confident that those taking emergency calls, the firefighters and fire officers attending the incident did their utmost on the night and at the incident to save as many lives as they could. Regrettably, they operated in an impossible situation because the fire was on such an unprecedented scale It is appalling that Grenfell firefighters are being denigrated in this way. We are all aware that the inquiry will be a difficult and traumatic process, to be conducted without fear or favour and without undue deference to vested interests including those of the fire service. However, the danger is that this negative media campaign diverts attention away from more fundamental questions about the fire safety regime that created such a fire risk at Grenfell Tower. • Matt Wrack is the general secretary of the Fire Brigades Union"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sport/2018/may/30/icc-positive-spin-2019-world-cup-launch","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-30T17:32:14Z","webTitle":"ICC chief applies a positive spin at 2019 Cricket World Cup launch","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/30/icc-positive-spin-2019-world-cup-launch","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/may/30/icc-positive-spin-2019-world-cup-launch","fields":{"headline":"ICC chief applies a positive spin at 2019 Cricket World Cup launch","bodyText":"It is a brave move to stage a World Cup in a country where the chairman of the board believes “the younger generation” and the “Asian community” are not attracted to your sport, and braver still to make those two audiences such a key part of your marketing strategy.

Dave Richardson, the ICC chief executive, did his best to be diplomatic about recent comments by Graves, the England and Wales Cricket Board’s chairman. “Well‚ that is very much an English viewpoint,” he said. “Globally we are seeing that the average age of our fans is lower than even football and certainly rugby.” As for whether or not he felt the sport needs a new 100-ball format, Richardson said: “From an international point of view, probably we would say no.” He added some caveats about how it was important to give the competition a chance, then added: “But certainly there isn’t an appetite to create another format.” Richardson said: “Our strategy is clear, in that we’ve got three formats of the same game, and it is challenging in itself to keep them from cannibalising each other. But what it does do is provide us with an opportunity to provide an offering to everybody, every type of cricket fan.” In England, Richardson said, “there is a bit of a challenge making sure we re-engage with the youth and grow the game from a participation point of view”. The 2019 World Cup is the best opportunity English cricket has to do that. Steve Elworthy, the tournament managing director, said that “55% of people who came to the Champions Trophy hadn’t been to cricket in the last five years or so – and there was a huge Asian support base for it – we want to build on that”. Brick Lane is only five miles from Lord’s but in another sense it is half a world away. And here, in the heart of London’s Bangladeshi community, there was a real sense of cricket as a modern, multicultural sport, a vibrant game loved and played by people from all parts. The ICC has even commissioned Caleb Femi to write a poem for the tournament, which includes the line: “Fly your flag with pride, after all it’s Britain, everyone’s welcome.” Femi’s poem is splashed in brilliant colours across the top two storeys of a fabric store just down Brick Lane. The ICC was worried that the owner would refuse but he is a cricket nut and said he would be delighted to oblige. Elworthy said: “We have stated ambitions to engage with a million kids between now and the end of the tournament. We have 100,000 tickets earmarked for under-16s, we have an opportunity to drive huge participation.” The ICC is doing its part. It is planning “inner‑city takeovers” from “Durham to Taunton, fan zones, live screenings for the semi-finals and finals”. It may work, it may not. But the enthusiasm, fresh thinking, is more likely to make a positive difference than the ECB chairman is, so long as he keeps droning on about how no one likes or understands the sport any more. ICC to meet al-Jazeera over fix claims The ICC’s Anti-Corruption Unit will meet al-Jazeera journalists in the next 48 hours to examine its evidence that players from England and Australia had committed spot-fixing in Test cricket. Both England and Australia have denied the claims. Dave Richardson, the ICC chief executive, said it would be “very surprising” if international cricketers were involved in fixing but he promised the ACU would investigate fully all the same. “I’m a little perturbed by any accusation that we would attempt to sweep it under the carpet or pretend that nothing has happened,” he said. Richardson is confident that the International Cricket Council has “got the mitigating measures in place” to make sure fixing does not happen in international cricket, but he admitted there was a growing problem with corruption in domestic Twenty20 competitions. Al-Jazeera’s documentary also exposed an alleged plot to launch a corrupt T20 league in Dubai. The knock-on effect of the tighter security at the international level is that the fixers “are now trying to create their own leagues, at a much lower level, and the danger is they will start going to domestic tournaments”. He said: “Those leagues do provide an additional opportunity for the people that want to get involved and try and fix. We’ve got to take much sterner action in the future.” The ICC will bring in regulations to ensure domestic tournaments held outside full member nations take place only if the organisers work closely with the ACU in doing due diligence on team owners, and on developing an anti‑corruption code and a player education programme."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/30/the-guardian-view-on-hiv-in-the-us-an-invisible-epidemic","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-30T17:39:37Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on HIV in the US: an invisible epidemic | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/30/the-guardian-view-on-hiv-in-the-us-an-invisible-epidemic","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/may/30/the-guardian-view-on-hiv-in-the-us-an-invisible-epidemic","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on HIV in the US: an invisible epidemic","bodyText":"For many young gay men in the US and the UK, the Aids epidemic that cut short so many lives in the 1980s is history – something terrible that shook their community long before they were born. These days, Britons who fear they may have become infected with HIV can access post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) on the NHS. Those who do contract it can be prescribed antiretroviral drugs. And for those at a high risk, pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is increasingly available in Britain (though not Northern Ireland). The effectiveness and availability of these treatments would have been unimaginable to the campaigners and patients of the 1980s. And yet this encouraging picture does not apply everywhere, or to everyone. In the US, the situation divides depending on geography, and, most strikingly, race. According to the Centers for Disease Control, African Americans accounted for 44% of HIV diagnoses in 2016, despite comprising only 12% of the population. And the disproportion seems to be growing. That year, HIV diagnoses among African American gay and bisexual men aged 25 to 34 increased 30%. If you are a young gay black man in America, you have a one in two chance of contracting the virus – compared with a one in 11 chance if you are a white gay man. The situation in the deep south is especially extreme, a Guardian film has reported. The region has the highest HIV diagnosis rate of any part of the US, but African Americans are five times more likely to die from HIV-related problems than white people. Despite many protestations to the contrary, there is no evidence whatever to suggest that these dreadful disparities have anything to do with particularly risky behaviour among African Americans. That HIV – this eminently manageable virus – has reached epidemic levels in the deep south is attributable to a toxic combination of poverty, lack of education, institutional racism, and fundamentally unequal access to healthcare. To make matters worse, private funding is skewed away from this region of deepest need. In 2014, the deep south received $35 per HIV-affected person in private grants, while the US average was $116, according to researchers at Duke University. These problems predate the Trump regime, but there is no suggestion that his presidency will alleviate them: quite the reverse. It is a tragedy that anyone, especially in the world’s richest country, should die unnecessarily. It is a grave injustice that those most likely to do so are from one particular group. The situation is different in the UK. Antiretrovirals do not cost $2,000 a bottle to the patient, as they do to the uninsured in the US. Yet Britain has its own disparities, which demand their own kind of attention. A year ago London witnessed the worse possible object lesson in the human cost of structural inequality when Grenfell Tower burned down. That was another preventable tragedy. The US’s problem with HIV ought not to prompt British self-congratulation, but British self-examination."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"film/2018/may/30/harvey-weinstein-not-testify-grand-jury-rape-charges","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-31T02:32:15Z","webTitle":"Harvey Weinstein indicted on rape and criminal sex act charges","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/may/30/harvey-weinstein-not-testify-grand-jury-rape-charges","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/may/30/harvey-weinstein-not-testify-grand-jury-rape-charges","fields":{"headline":"Harvey Weinstein indicted on rape and criminal sex act charges","bodyText":"Harvey Weinstein has been indicted on rape and criminal sex act charges in New York City. Manhattan district attorney Cyrus Vance announced the indictment Wednesday and said it brings Weinstein “another step closer to accountability”. The move furthers the first criminal case to arise from a slate of sexual misconduct allegations against him. It came came hours after Weinstein’s lawyers said he had decided not to testify before the grand jury. Weinstein’s lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, said he would “vigorously defend” against the indictment and ask a court to dismiss it. He called the allegations “unsupported” and reiterated that Weinstein strongly denies them. In a statement, Vance said: “A grand jury has voted to indict Harvey Weinstein on charges of rape in the first and third degrees, and criminal sexual act in the first degree.” He went on: “This indictment brings the defendant another step closer to accountability for the crimes of violence with which he is now charged. Our office will try this case not in the press, but in the courtroom where it belongs. The defendant’s recent assault on the integrity of the survivors and the legal process is predictable. We are confident that when the jury hears the evidence, it will reject these attacks out of hand. “I thank the heroic survivors for their strength throughout this process. I also thank Commissioner James O’Neill and members of the New York City police department for their dedication to this case. This investigation remains active and ongoing.” Earlier, a statement issued through a spokesman on Wednesday said Weinstein’s lawyers decided there was not enough time to prepare him to testify. They say he learned the specific charges and the accusers’ identities only after turning himself in last Friday, with a deadline set for Wednesday afternoon to testify or not. They say his request for more time was denied. Prosecutors declined to comment. Weinstein faces rape and criminal sex act charges involving two women in New York. Dozens more women have accused him of sexual misconduct ranging from harassment to assault in various locales. The 66-year-old former producer has consistently denied all allegations of nonconsensual sex. Weinstein’s principal lawyer, Ben Brafman, held a closed door meeting with others in the judge’s chambers on Tuesday, during which he argued that bad publicity around his client would affect a potential jury. He later maligned one of the alleged victims in the case, saying she had had a romantic relationship with Weinstein before and after allegedly committing sexual misconduct. Weinstein has been mainly out of the public eye, attending sex addiction rehab in Arizona, since his public downfall last October in the wake of women going public to accuse him of years of abuse of power, sexual harassment and criminal behavior ranging from rape to groping. He turned himself in last Friday in lower Manhattan and was arrested and taken in handcuffs from the police station to court. He is also being investigated by police in California and the UK."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/may/30/closure-of-vedanta-copper-plant-in-india-must-be-followed-by-a-cleanup","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-30T17:07:44Z","webTitle":"Closure of Vedanta copper plant in India must be followed by a cleanup | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/30/closure-of-vedanta-copper-plant-in-india-must-be-followed-by-a-cleanup","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/may/30/closure-of-vedanta-copper-plant-in-india-must-be-followed-by-a-cleanup","fields":{"headline":"Closure of Vedanta copper plant in India must be followed by a cleanup","bodyText":"The achievement of the people of Tuticorin, Tamil Nadu, southern India, in securing the closure of the dangerous Vedanta copper smelting plant deserves congratulation, although it is sad that it was achieved at the cost of 13 lives through police action (Report, 29 May).

The summer before, in the name of research, I’d spent a week with a community of Cistercian monks.” His flight to the deserts of this book is thus framed not as discovery but recovery; his impulse is an ascetic one, rather than voyeuristic or sybaritic. Atkins is not in thrall to deserts – in his words “dead”, “forsaken” places – but loves them for their austerity, and the clarity of thought they grant. From Oman to Australia, from China to Arizona, deserts offer him allegories of humanity’s mistreatment of the planet, and of one another. Into the shifting sands of Oman he follows the stories of Wilfred Thesiger, Bertram Thomas and Harry St John Philby, mesmerised by a stillness in ceaseless motion: “The desert … leaves you dazed,” he writes, “and yet it quickly becomes apparent that, just as the desert is not silent, it is far from being still.” In Australia he visits the Maralinga nuclear test sites, superbly described as “a ruined place whose silence is less tranquillity’s than that of a battlefield where the killing has just ended”. The British director of nuclear testing, William Penney, saw in the undulating Australian desert “the appearance of English downland”. In Atkins’s imagination those outback dusts merge with the blood-red circles on cold war maps – the ones predicting the radii of nuclear devastation. The chapters vary in their focus: Atkins mocks those travel writers who believe themselves to be explorers, and shudders with post-colonial embarrassment at the deeds of Aurel Stein and Sven Hedin. In the city of Hotan, in Chinese Xin Jiang, the state’s intention to “help the backward ethnic groups become more open and modern” is mapped subtly to English missionaries’ determination a century or so ago to do the same. He walks the desiccated sea floor of the Aral Sea, “its emptiness as starkly alarming as a socket deprived of its eye”, reflecting on how the Amu and Syr rivers were diverted to boost Soviet cotton yields. For a few decades the Soviet Union succeeded in becoming self-sufficient in cotton, but poisoned the river basins with weedkiller and fertiliser. “A desertified landscape is not a desert landscape but rather a zone of human making,” Atkins writes, “and often the result of our inability to reconcile ourselves to the arid.” The prose can become directionless, as if spun blindfold on a desert plain and then released, but is also very often gorgeous. In Australia, Atkins feels flooded with red, “as if the cerebral cortex has been injected with a solution of carmine”; in Reno, at a gambling arcade, “I felt that the whole flashing, beeping, chiming arena was on the brink of something hysterical – violence or sobbing or orgiastic sex.” And it’s in the chapters set in the US that the book takes off, perhaps because cultural affinity between the UK and the United States is such that Atkins’s travel writing cedes to something more like anthropology. Wandering in the Arizona desert with the No More Deaths charity, he leaves survival packs out for illegal Mexican immigrants, then follows them into the courthouse where, 60 at a time, hundreds per day, they are sentenced to repatriation. He makes explicit parallels between their own journeys and those of refugees crossing the Mediterranean: “There it was again: the sea, the desert; to die due to water or its lack. Geography enlisted as both cordon and executioner.” In Utah he attends Burning Man, the desert festival phantasmagorical in its outlandishness, debauchery and surreality. He’s welcomed by a man in a Viking helmet, perched on the roof of a school bus guzzling beers. Another man throws out ice lollies to an avid crowd, each made with a mould from his own penis. Women at one stall have set up a dildo hoopla, while at Get Nailed volunteers are nailed to a cross. As a self-confessed “pale scribe from the drizzly shires” he might be expected to reject this kind of bacchanalia outright, but his attitude is more subtle than that: in the hedonistic melee he glimpses the same impulse to get away from it all that drove the desert fathers centuries ago. But then his register switches abruptly from astonishment to unease – the festival “trapped its participants in a state of constant stimulation”. He realises that the only dark faces belong to the people suctioning out the toilets, and “it was the Mexicans, too, who drove the water tanker that each morning sprayed the streets to subdue dust, a parade of nude whites behind, cavorting in the mud”. His ticket had warned “YOU VOLUNTARILY ASSUME THE RISK OF SERIOUS INJURY OR DEATH BY ATTENDING”, but as an adept of desert survival, he is unimpressed. The desert is public land, but for the duration of the festival becomes uniquely out of bounds. “We had to be watched like toddlers on a beach,” he writes, “stoned toddlers.” In keeping with his flight from the “naked flat, with its scent and its photos”, there are few women in The Immeasurable World – for Atkins, as much as it was for St Antony, the desert is the place to get away from womankind. But in Australia he meets Céline, a Frenchwoman who hates Australia, but cannot leave without losing rights to see her children. “I did not once see her eyes and so cannot say what colour they were. Red possibly.” At Burning Man he volunteers with Acumen, a woman who resents his presence and whose face “relaxes into unsmilingness”. But in Utah he also meets Amy, and the reader senses that any self-imposed monastic penance might be nearing its end: “She was from Portland: arch, gently mocking, and seemed to be glowing with the wellbeing that comes from being constantly loved.” Together they visit the Pacific, and he is stunned: “What made the sea so awesome – in the Oxford as well as the Californian sense – was not its vastness or its openness, nor even its depth, but the global energy invoked by its movement. It was alive.” In the final chapter Atkins hikes to the church-shrine of St Antony in Egypt’s eastern desert, its beauty an “illuminated page concealed in a blank manuscript”. The tensions the book sets up between life and death, aridity and fertility, wet and dry, loved and lovelorn, begin to resolve. The engine growl withdraws and the night is returned to quiet, and I register a sound that is familiar to me now; the sound that is what we call silence.

The controversial VAR system will be used for the first time at a World Cup in Russia, with Fifa having selected 13 dedicated officials for the tournament last month. In addition to existing powers, new regulations which come into force on 1 June will enable them to alert the referee to any incidents that have been missed – even if play has restarted. That means an offender can subsequently be sent off at any time during the match. Ifab’s technical director, David Elleray, told the Times: “If there is something away from the action that has been missed and it later comes to the attention of the VAR or the assistant VAR, then they can inform the referee and he can send the player off, even if it is later in the match.

The European commission’s negotiators refused to discuss the issue in formal talks last week, instead insisting they would present the UK with conditions of entry for a “third country” into its €97.9bn research programme once they had been formally published. A draft copy of the so-called Horizon Europe document, seen by the Guardian, suggests that the UK is set to be offered less generous access than countries with associate status in the current programme, known as Horizon 2020, including Israel, Turkey, Albania and Ukraine. Those states, along with countries in the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) – Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland – will be “associated to all programme parts” of the new research and science framework, details of which are to be published on 7 June, according to the leaked document. It is understood that wealthy countries with a developed research and development capacity are to be offered a greater opportunity to pay in and collaborate with the EU under a reform of the current programme, which will end in 2020. However, the UK is set to join Canada and South Korea in the category of countries that will have to pay a higher price for the privilege of collaborating, while being barred from a particular raft of programmes designed to encourage innovation. According to the draft paper, so-called “third countries” will not have a seat on the new European Innovation Council, which sets priorities, and their companies will not have the opportunity to apply for “fast, flexible grants and co-investments” designed to “bridge the ‘valley of death’ between research, commercialisation and the scaling-up of companies”. Sources said it was additionally unclear what role the UK would have in shaping the priorities of Horizon Europe after Brexit, given it would no longer be a member state and would not be an EFTA member, acceding country, candidate country or potential candidate country. The European commission’s proposals will need to be approved by the member states. A senior EU official said they were aware that the UK would seek to change the rules from within during negotiations over the bloc’s future budget, known as the multi-annual financial framework (MFF). An EU official involved in the Brexit negotiations said of last week’s talks with the UK negotiators in Brussels: “We … had a discussion on science and technology where we said that from our point of view unfortunately this was slightly early as we are coming forward in early June with the proposals for the next generation of Horizon Europe, the successor to Horizon 2020, and these programmes will set out the conditions for third countries’ participation. “We would be happy to present that to the UK once that has been published. We take good note that the UK wants to maintain its role in shaping and priority setting of EU programmes in the future, and we also took very careful note of the announcement by the UK negotiators that they intend to use their part in the EU28 negotiations about the future MFF as an instrument to influence the definition of third country part rules in EU programmes.” A UK paper published earlier this year noted that the country’s research institutions had been awarded 15% of all agreed funds under Horizon 2020, worth about €4bn (£3.5bn). Last week a British presentation to the EU negotiators, who were led by Michel Barnier, argued for full access to Horizon Europe and said “as an associate country we would look to agree an appropriate level of influence on the shape of the programme. This should be greater than current non-EU precedents, recognising the quality and breadth of the UK’s contribution”. Thomas Jørgensen, the senior policy coordinator at the European University Association (EUA) working on Brexit-related issues, said the commission was acting to protect its interests in the face of the emergence of the UK as a rival economic power. He said: “It is entirely understandable that you would want to help small countries in your neighbourhood, but why would you do that for small and medium-size enterprises in South Korea or other third countries such as the UK? “The view from Brussels is that leaving the EU is the UK’s choice, it is their choice to be South Korea. If they say they want a special deal, that’s not going to work.” Jørgensen said, however, that the scale of the UK’s research strength was such that it would inevitably have a large say in at least informal settings about the direction of the programmes. He said: “There is elasticity. But if it comes down to a matter of principles, then that could be a problem.” Diplomats attached to the member states suggested there were additional concerns about giving third countries access to sensitive research information. The UK is seeking an agreement to continue the flow of data between it and the rest of Europe, but a recent report on the country’s handling of personal information held on the Schengen Information System, designed to monitor the flow of people around Europe, has damaged that case. An official paper, dated 18 May 2018 and seen by the Guardian, reveals that despite a 2015 evaluation finding serious deficiencies with the UK’s handling of personal data, a follow-up visit in 2017 had discovered that a range of recommendations had not been implemented. The report notes that the EU’s inspectors had found that “very serious deficiencies in the legal, operational and technical implementation of SIS by the UK subsist”. Among the issues that caused concern was the discovery that UK officials had been copying personal data and sharing it with US contractors working for its immigration services and the border police. Some of that information was found to be out of date as well, raising the potential of people being unfairly flagged as they passed through the UK’s borders. In a further indication of the EU’s attitude, on Wednesday the commission announced that the UK could take part in the student exchange scheme, Erasmus, after Brexit, in return for a financial contribution, but that it would have no say in shaping the programme."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/may/30/football-transfer-rumours-liverpool-keeper-loris-karius-off-to-serie-c","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-30T07:39:54Z","webTitle":"Football transfer rumours: Liverpool keeper Loris Karius off to Serie C?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/30/football-transfer-rumours-liverpool-keeper-loris-karius-off-to-serie-c","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/30/football-transfer-rumours-liverpool-keeper-loris-karius-off-to-serie-c","fields":{"headline":"Football transfer rumours: Liverpool keeper Loris Karius off to Serie C?","bodyText":"It was only a matter of time before a move away from the harsh glare of the spotlight was mooted for poor old Loris Karius. He’s been offered a season-long loan deal by newly promoted Serie C side Rimini. Their president has dressed it up as a present for the Liverpool keeper’s upcoming 25th birthday, and a chance for the jittery soul to “rediscover his serenity and self-esteem” in the arms of “a large family”. And to think just four days ago Karius was dreaming of becoming a European champion. Liverpool meanwhile are wondering whether to spend the best part of £80m on Roma stopper Alisson. At some point during the post-Reina era, they’re going to have to bite the bullet. Manchester United are in for Karius and Liverpool’s nemesis Gareth Bale. He’ll cost £122m, an eye-watering sum even for United, so they’ll try to recoup some cash by offloading Anthony Martial. Bidding will start at £100m. Anyone? No, nobody today. Maurizio Sarri is already making plans for his reign at Chelsea, even though the gig doesn’t even exist yet, what with Antonio Conte still in office. The former Napoli boss would make Inter striker Mauro Icardi his first signing. Jordi Alba might become his second, though he’ll have to battle Manchester United for the Barcelona left-back. Or will it be Laurent Blanc making these purchases? The former Bordeaux, France and PSG boss has been sounded out by Roman Abramovich as a cheaper option, his being a free agent and all. Manchester City are still interested in Riyad Mahrez, and reckon £60m will be enough to satisfy Leicester now, even in this Bale-distorted market. The new West Ham boss Manuel Pellegrini has already figured his defence is a load of old toot, and will accordingly fix it by bringing in Armando Izzo of Genoa and Marlon Santos of Barcelona. And Tottenham have their eye on Southampton goalkeeper Alex McCarthy. Where this leaves Hugo Lloris is anyone’s guess, but something tells us this could be a fairly active window for keepers, so opportunities won’t be too hard to come by should the worst happen."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"games/2018/may/30/active-shooter-school-shooting-video-game-removed-from-sale","type":"article","sectionId":"games","sectionName":"Games","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-30T12:25:46Z","webTitle":"Active Shooter: school-shooting video game removed from sale","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/may/30/active-shooter-school-shooting-video-game-removed-from-sale","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/games/2018/may/30/active-shooter-school-shooting-video-game-removed-from-sale","fields":{"headline":"Active Shooter: school-shooting video game removed from sale","bodyText":"A video game designed to simulate school shooting scenarios has been removed from the digital games store Steam. Active Shooter was due to be launched on the popular PC gaming site on 6 June, provoking an outcry from politicians and the parents of children killed during the Parkland shooting in Florida. A petition calling for the game to be removed from the store was signed by more than 180,000 people. Valve Corporation, which runs the Steam site used by more than 100 million people, said in a statement: “We have removed the developer Revived Games and publisher ACID from Steam.

Using a first-person perspective, players would take on the role of an armed officer responding to a shooting incident. However, in a clarification, posted to the site on 24 May, the developer claimed to have decided to add the option to play as civilians or the shooter. Screen shots of the game posted on Steam showed a score for the number of police officers and civilians killed. Outrage quickly gathered online, with Ryan Petty and Fred Guttenberg, whose daughters were both killed in the Parkland shooting, calling the game “despicable” and asking Valve to remove it. Parkland survivor and gun control activist Emma González tweeted: “Valve Corp shut down this shovelware immediately please.” The video games industry has come under scrutiny since the shootings in Parkland and more recently Santa Fe, Texas. In March, President Trump called a meeting with industry executives to discuss video game violence. More than 100 games a week are released on the Steam platform, which analysts have estimated controls 50-70% of the global PC games download market. A similar controversy surrounded the 2015 shooting game Hatred, which featured a murderer on an indiscriminate killing spree. Valve briefly removed the game, but then reinstated it after an apology to the developer from CEO Gabe Newell. Other titles have been permanently removed from the site. In 2015, Valve removed a game entitled Kill the Faggot from its Steam Greenlight section, intended for titles still in development. The company has repeatedly threatened to remove games with adult content from Steam."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/may/30/grenfell-kensington-chelsea-council-replace-fire-doors-social-housing","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-30T08:53:36Z","webTitle":"Kensington council to spend £3.5m replacing fire doors after Grenfell","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/30/grenfell-kensington-chelsea-council-replace-fire-doors-social-housing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/may/30/grenfell-kensington-chelsea-council-replace-fire-doors-social-housing","fields":{"headline":"Kensington council to spend £3.5m replacing fire doors after Grenfell","bodyText":"Kensington and Chelsea council is set to spend £3.5m replacing 4,000 fire doors in all its social housing after the Grenfell Tower blaze. A police investigation found in March that doors used in the tower failed tests and could resist fire for only 15 minutes, instead of the 30 minutes required by building regulations guidance. Earlier this month, James Brokenshire, the housing secretary, said all Manse doors – the kind used in the tower – across the country must to be replaced, but insisted the “risk to public safety remains low”. However, a spokesman for Kensington and Chelsea said the council believed the replacement programme must be started “as a matter of urgency”. “All of the new doors will meet the 30-minute requirement but, given the issue with Manse Masterdor units, the council will send the new doors for independent testing so that we can be 100% sure the doors will resist fire for at least 30 minutes,” he said. “Saving lives is our single priority. We are taking nothing for granted.” The final decision to replace doors across the borough will be made by councillors on 6 June. The news came as the council was heavily criticised in a report commissioned by the voluntary sector organisations that led the response to the blaze. The review, commissioned by the charity Muslim Aid, concluded that the response of local authorities was slow and lacked direction, and voluntary organisations had had to step in. The institutional reaction to the disaster was “badly flawed in the first crucial days and the damage that resulted has been difficult to repair”, the report said, adding that the voluntary sector was “very much on the frontline”. Muslim Aid’s chief executive, Jehangir Malik, who coordinated volunteers in the aftermath of the fire on 14 June last year, said: “I would have expected this chaos in a developing country, because almost always there is poor infrastructure. I honestly thought we had better disaster preparedness and response systems here in the UK.” The report, conducted in partnership with other voluntary organisations including Notting Hill Methodist church and the Rugby Portobello Trust, concluded: “With many of the consequences of the fire still unresolved, it is vital that future action is informed by what has been learnt from the response so far.” The disaster “must be a wake-up call to those in a position to effect change,” it said. A spokesperson for the council said: “We are committed to learning the lessons from the Grenfell tragedy and therefore we welcome this report as part of the learning process. “However, it is not right for the council to comment in detail at this stage – this is a matter for the public inquiry which is reviewing the events around the council’s response to the tragedy. “It is our responsibility to ensure that the whole, unvarnished truth is told so that lessons can be learned and to ensure that such a tragedy can never happen again. We will work with the inquiry to ensure this happens.” Andrew O’Hagan, the editor at large of the London Review of Books, has criticised the fire service’s response, saying it was “not a great night” for the organisation. He spent 10 months interviewing survivors, council workers, local politicians, firefighters and activists for a 65,000-word investigation into the fire and the political aftermath, which is published in full in the latest issue of the magazine. “Chief among the failures” of the fire service was its stay-put policy, O’Hagan said. “People in the emergency services on the phone and in person advised people in Grenfell Tower to stay in their flats long after it became obvious that the fire spread on that night was happening outside the building,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “Anybody inside the building was in fatal danger and the building should have been evacuated as soon as possible.” He said it had been easy to point the finger at the Conservative-run council for people who did not agree with it politically, but when the evidence was examined forensically, Kensington and Chelsea did its best and “responded as well as they could”. “Much of that understandable dismay and anger that we all started out with [at the council] didn’t stand up to the evidence,” O’Hagan said. A London fire brigade spokesperson said: “Due to the ongoing police investigation and public inquiry, we cannot go into details of what happened on the night, as to do so risks prejudicing both investigations. “London fire brigade is focused on supporting the official inquiry and ongoing police investigation to ensure everyone affected, especially the Grenfell community, understand exactly what happened.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2018/may/30/martin-sorrell-plots-his-comeback-weeks-after-exit-from-wpp","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-30T07:27:48Z","webTitle":"Martin Sorrell plots his comeback weeks after exit from WPP","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/may/30/martin-sorrell-plots-his-comeback-weeks-after-exit-from-wpp","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2018/may/30/martin-sorrell-plots-his-comeback-weeks-after-exit-from-wpp","fields":{"headline":"Martin Sorrell plots his comeback weeks after exit from WPP","bodyText":"Sir Martin Sorrell has revealed he is in takeover talks with a number of companies as he looks to rebuild an international marketing business, weeks after he was forced out of WPP following allegations of personal misconduct. Almost immediately after Sorrell was forced to stand down in April, having run the world’s biggest ad group for more than three decades, he began talks to stage his comeback. On Wednesday, he delivered on his promise that it would be a case of “back to the future” – as he had hinted in a resignation letter to WPP staff last month – detailing a reverse takeover of another small listed company to use as a vehicle to rebuild his empire. Sorrell is to take 75% control of Derriston Capital, taking the post of executive chairman, with the aim of building a next-generation WPP for the digital age. “S4 Capital is a company that aims to build a multi-national communication services business focused on growth,” said Sorrell. “There are significant opportunities for development in technology, data and content. I look forward to making this happen.” Derriston, which began talks with Sorrell in May, will change its name to S4 Capital. Sorrell incorporated S4 Capital, a reference to four generations of his family, in Jersey on 22 May, with £40m of his money and £11m from other investors. A number of those investors have also signed “non-binding letters of support” to provide in principle more than £150m of further funding to fuel Sorrell’s acquisition plans. Derriston disclosed in a financial filing that Sorrell is closing in on a number of potential acquisition targets. “The directors of the company understand that S4 Capital is at present in preliminary discussions regarding a select number of potential acquisitions that would fit with the strategy of building a multinational communication services business,” the company said. “S4 Capital intends to target businesses focused on technology, data and content.” Sorrell has also gone back to the future for his non-executive directors, calling in Rupert Faure Walker, who advised on the takeovers of J Walter Thompson and Ogilvy &amp; Mather in the late 1980s, which transformed WPP, a small maker of wire baskets, into a major global force in advertising. He has also appointed Paul Roy, the former British Horseracing Authority chairman, and the founder of the investment management company NewSmith Capital Partners. Alex DeGroote, a stockbroker at Cenkos, believes that Sorrell will not be able to resist targeting a major WPP asset. “It wouldn’t surprise me if he was discreetly sounding out JWT or Ogilvy, they were the anchor assets that built WPP,” he said. “Institutional investors would feel more comfortable backing the acquisition of assets known to them, like Ogilvy which has moved from the Mad Men era to digitally fit for purpose. I think Sorrell will make a headline grabbing, transformational deal within nine months.”Sorrell has structured the deal to give himself a five-year window to grow S4 Capital and make his exit, by which point he is likely to be close to his 79th birthday. If he can engineer a sale, takeover or merger of S4 Capital in that time frame - and the company has produced returns to shareholders at a rate of 6% - Sorrell is eligible to pocket 15% of the increase in value of the company. Sorrell was able to bounce back so quickly because of the unusual nature of the contract he had at WPP. Instead of the standard notice period of 12 months, he or the company was able to terminate the contract “at will” with no non-compete clause. WPP classified Sorrell as having “retired”, after deciding not to make the outcome of its investigation into misconduct allegations public, meaning he will make almost £20m in payouts from his former employer over the next five years. The WPP chairman, Roberto Quarta, is facing an investor backlash at the company’s annual meeting next month over the Sorrell affair, with the influential advisory company Glass Lewis recommending shareholders vote against his reappointment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/grogonomics/2018/may/31/tax-cuts-are-awful-for-middle-australia-to-pretend-otherwise-is-misleading","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-30T23:20:34Z","webTitle":"Tax cuts are awful for 'middle Australia'.

To pretend otherwise is misleading","bodyText":"The government has sought to win the fight over its proposed tax cuts by suggesting it is really a tax cut for middle income earners. But despite assistance from some pretty dire reporting, Treasury’s own figures highlight just how greatly the tax cut is weighted towards high-income earners and those earning far more than the incomes of middle Australia. Before the budget I wrote that the government would likely attempt to sell its budget by misleadingly referring to average income earners as middle Australia. But even I didn’t think we’d be at the point where someone on $200,000 would be considered middle income. “Average” sounds like it is the middle – an “average Australian” sounds like someone who is typical of Australians and “average income” sounds like a typical income. It is why, for example, Malcolm Turnbull in question time on Wednesday referred to his tax plan by saying it would help “middle income earners” and that “middle Australia will benefit from this”. Sign up to receive the latest Australian opinion pieces every weekday But average earnings – especially average full-time earnings – are not what is earned by “middle Australia”. Always remember – average full-time earnings are higher than average earnings, and average earnings are higher than median earnings. Current average full-time annual earnings are $81,531, but median annual earnings for a full-time worker are just $65,577: The median income for all workers – that is, the amount at which half earn more and half earn less – is just $52,988. And yet last week in the Australian we were told that “Turnbull’s tax plan will target the middle class” and that “the bulk of the tax benefit received would come from abolishing the 37% tax bracket and would go almost entirely to middle-income earners on wages of $120,000 to $200,000”. Please. The Australian suggested this was the case because of “Treasury analysis of wage data” that shows someone on an income of $120,000 in 2024-25 “would be considered the average wage equivalent to $84,600 in today’s terms” and that “a salary of $158,730 in 2017-18 would be $200,000 in 2024-25”. This would happen if wages grew by 3.5% each year after 2020-21. That is absurd enough, but there is no reality in which an Australian worker on $120,000, let alone $200,000, can be classed as a middle-income earner. It is utterly misleading to suggest that someone on $84,600 is middle-income – let alone someone on $158,730. We know from the most recent taxation statistics that someone with a taxable income of $84,000 puts them in the top 25% and someone earning $158,000 is in the top 5%: The AFR also got in on this absurdity, suggesting “wage rises will make $200k a middle income” and that “the chief beneficiaries of the third stage of the government’s income tax cuts will be earning up to $200,000 but they will be classified as middle-income earners by the time the cuts are delivered”. We’ve reached a pretty awful place where someone earning nearly twice as much as the average full-time wage and three times the median wage is being called “middle-income”. To be fair, someone on the actual median income of $52,988 will one day earn $200,000 – in 2056-57. And at that time, the AFR’s version of the median-income earner will be on $615,875: On Wednesday the pitch was changed to refer to workers such as police officers and teachers (occupations conservative media governments always love, except when they are conducting industrial action to get a pay rise) and bizarrely a “forklift driver”. The Australian suggested that a “forklift driver/excavator would pay almost $4,000 more a year in tax under Labor on a salary estimated at the most qualified level to be $164,331 in 2024-25”. Such a salary would be news to most forklift drivers. In the latest tax statistics, the median income for forklift drivers in 2015-16 was $48,622, and for an excavator operator the median income in 2015-16 was just $63,300. On the Australian’s list of presumably middle-income earners was “school principal from the ACT”. In 2015-16 those principals had a median income of $131,692 – putting them in the top 8% all of taxpayers. The government needs to push this line, of course, because those on the actual median income will not get to $120,000 until 2041-42 (assuming that wonderful 3.5% wage growth!). On Tuesday the Treasury released new data during a Senate estimates hearing that tried to suggest the benefits of the tax plan would go to middle income earners. But it only serves to reinforce how much the plan benefits higher income earners and how the cost of those high income tax cuts dwarfs the rest. By 2024-25, once the entire set of tax cuts go through, those on $200,000 would receive a tax cut of 3.6%, compared with what they pay now, whereas those on $70,000 (which will be the median income by then) get a cut of just 0.8%: The tax cut is actually awful for “middle Australia”. Median income earners get a smaller tax cut than low-income earners and a very much smaller one than high-income earners. And then we get to the cost – which is now up to $144bn out to the end 2028-29. The biggest cost to the budget over that time is the $41bn to raise the 19% threshold to $41,000. But that is planned to be done in 2022, and thus its cost covers seven years. The $33bn spent to remove the 32.5% tax bracket occurs over just five years – meaning on average it will cost the budget $6.6bn a year: From 2024-25 all the tax cuts combined will reduce revenue by an average of $21.8bn a year, but $13.5bn – or 62% – of that is for tax cuts overwhelmingly for those earning over $120,000. And how will the government pay for that $22bn cut to revenue? This is the problem with misleading talk about who benefits, because when it comes to paying for it, you can bet the ones who will feel the effects of reduced services will be those who actually are part of middle Australia. • Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/live/2018/may/30/european-markets-set-to-open-lower-on-italian-political-turmoil-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-30T13:49:50Z","webTitle":"European markets edgy on Italian turmoil as ECB ponders urgent meeting - as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2018/may/30/european-markets-set-to-open-lower-on-italian-political-turmoil-business-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2018/may/30/european-markets-set-to-open-lower-on-italian-political-turmoil-business-live","fields":{"headline":"European markets edgy on Italian turmoil as ECB ponders urgent meeting - as it happened","bodyText":"After Tuesday’s sharp falls in the wake of the Italian political crisis, most European markets tried their best to regain some of the lost ground. Italy’s FTSE MIB is currently up 1.7%, Germany’s Dax is 0.7% higher, Spain’s Ibex has added 0.4% and the FTSE 100 is up 0.14%. But France’s Cac remains in negative territory, down 0.27%. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 170 points or 0.7%. The euro managed to gain 0.9% to $1.1641, recovering all of Tuesday’s losses, before slipping back to $1.1625. The recovery came despite continuing confusion about the outlook for Italy, with reports suggesting that the 5 Star and Lega parties were attempting to revive their coalition plans. But there is still the prospect of further elections later this year to add to the uncertainty. And the European Central Bank may call an urgent meeting to discuss the situation in Italy, according to sources. Meanwhile an Italian bond auction succeeded, but at the cost of the highest interest rate since May 2014. Over in Spain, prime minister Rajoy was resisting calls for him to step down, as he prepares to face a no confidence vote on Friday. On the economic front, German inflation came in stronger than expected, adding to the problems facing the European Central Bank. Eurozone economic sentiment slipped slightly in May. In the US there were disappointing jobs and economic growth figures. On that note, it’s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we’ll be back tomorrow. The European recovery may in some cases be a little tentative, but the Wall Street rally looks a little more substantial. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 160 points or 0.66% in early trading, while the S&amp;P 500 has opened up 0.47% and the Nasdaq Composite is 0.43% higher. Another piece of US data to keep away from the president. US GDP grew by less than initially thought in the first quarter. On an annualised basis the economy grew by 2.2%, down from the first estimate of 2.3% and much lower than the fourth quarter’s growth rate of 2.9%. But economists expect that Trump’s $1.5bn of tax cuts could boost growth in the second quarter, closer to the president’s 3% target. Don’t tell Donald Trump, but the latest US private payroll figures have fallen short of forecasts. Ahead of Friday’s non-farm payrolls, the ADP employment report shows an increase of 178,000 private sector jobs in May, compared to expectations of a 190,000 rise. On top of that, the April number was revised down from 204,000 to 163,000. The surge in German inflation complicates the European Central Bank’s life even further, says ING Bank economist Carsten Brzeski: While the Easter Bunny Effect has finally been left behind, German inflation is still heavily affected by seasonal effects. The sharp surge in oil prices in combination with several public holidays and long weekends pushed up energy prices, leisure costs and food prices. Under the surface of (too) many one-off factors, German inflation data still tells a two-sided story: while prices for consumer goods have gradually accelerated in recent months, inflation on services has slowed down and has even been negative for a couple of months for communication and clothing. Where available, core inflation measures at the state levels actually dropped in May. Despite today’s increase in headline inflation, the underlying trend still points to a rather benign picture for inflationary pressure. For the ECB, however, today’s inflation data from Germany gives a foretaste of the increased complications on the road to taper. The still undecided debate on whether the Eurozone economy is in a soft patch or at the start of a protracted downswing, the surge in oil prices and latest political developments in Italy have clearly complicated the ECB’s life. It increasingly looks as if the big question for the ECB is not when to stop QE but rather when to signal an extension of QE. With latest market turmoil and political tensions in Italy, giving some certainty in times of uncertainty could be the ECB’s preferred policy choice. This would be an announcement or at least a very clear hint at QE extension at the June meeting. The cost of buying goods and services in Germany has soared above the European Central Banks target of 2%, according to official figures. Consumer price inflation jumped from 1.4% year on year in April to 2.2% in May, the fastest pace since February 2017 and well above forecasts of a 1.8% rise. The month on month increase was 0.6%, compared to expectations of a figure of 0.3%. The biggest rises were in energy and food prices. The figures strengthens the hand of the Bundesbank, which would prefer the ECB to end its QE programme this year and begin raising interest rates, partly to benefit German savers. Here’s our latest report on the day’s political developments in Italy: The head of Italy’s anti-establishment Five Star Movement has rekindled negotiations to form a government, days after a bitter row over the country’s future in the eurozone ended a fledgling deal for populist parties to take power. Luigi Di Maio, the 31-year-old head of the M5S, Italy’s largest party, indicated on Wednesday he was prepared to compromise on his controversial choice of a eurosceptic economist, Paolo Savona, for finance minister. But he insisted that his pick for prime minister remained political newcomer Giuseppe Conte. In the absence of an agreement between Di Maio , the president of Italy, Sergio Mattarella, and the far right leader Matteo Salvini, Di Maio said he favoured snap elections. “There are two paths ahead. Either we launch the Conte government with a reasonable solution or we vote right away,” he said. Italian markets, which have been hit hard by the political crisis, rallied on the news of a potential new deal, which would at least temporarily put plans for a new election on hold. The full story is here: Despite many markets edging higher, they are nowhere near recovering the Italy-driven losses, and investors have very little appetite for risk at the moment. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda, said: It looked as though we were headed for fresh elections as early as July, with negotiations between Five Star Movement and Lega having failed after President Sergio Mattarella vetoed their choice of Finance Minister. Carlo Cottarelli – a former IMF economist - was tasked with forming a temporary government until further elections are called, ideally next year, but that appears to have failed before it got started. While early elections will arguably be very beneficial to the populist parties, who will cite the rejection of its choice of Finance Minister as evidence of Brussels interference and an abuse of the democratic will of the people, it seems one last attempt to form a government is being discussed. The parties seem unwilling to hold an election in July and have no desire to wait until next year. If a government can be formed that receives the stamp of approval from Mattarella and is therefore seen as not posing a threat to Italy’s place in the eurozone, then this will come as a relief to markets in the near-term. Longer-term risks remain though and both parties will likely use recent events as a platform to drum up opposition to the euro with the end goal of holding its own referendum, something eurozone leaders will understandably fear after the UK result in 2016. Over in Spain, prime minister Rajoy is resisting the idea of stepping down as he prepares to face Friday’s no confidence vote: Don’t panic, suggests Paul Donovan, chief economist at UBS Global Wealth Management: Everyone needs to take a deep breath and calm down. Only then can we talk about Italy. 1) Bond market moves do not break up monetary unions. Bank runs do. There is no evidence of bank runs. 2) Neither Italian parties nor Italian voters support leaving the Euro. 3) The anti-party coalition was not expected to last, because of policy disagreements. It is not certain that the two anti-parties would try to form a government after elections. Markets have moved anyway. We are now in that phase where any trader who overheard a conversation in their local Domino’s Pizza takeaway considers themselves an expert on Italian politics. Investors would be wise to treat recent market moves with caution. The Lega party reportedly wants new elections in Italy as soon as possible. Reuters says: Italy’s far-right League party will not block rapid political solutions that would allow the country to handle possible emergencies, but it wants an election as soon as possible, a source from the party said on Wednesday. “At this point, we will not block rapid solutions capable of managing emergencies, but we must let Italians express themselves again as soon as possible,” the source said. The source did not explain what was meant by “emergencies”, though financial markets have been in turmoil over the continuing political uncertainty. Europe is likely to muddle through the current political uncertainty, says Erin Browne, head of asset allocation at UBS Asset Management: Without a swift political solution to the situation in Italy, we believe that the risk-return trade-off for European assets has deteriorated. As things currently stand, we are likely to see a period of heightened volatility in Italian and broader European equities and bonds amid Italian political dynamics and their interactions with ECB policy. That said, we do not see Italian political developments as presenting material systemic risks beyond Europe at this stage. Both populist parties have signalled they will not attempt to leave the Eurozone (and according to the Italian Constitution this would be extremely difficult in any case), even if their desired fiscal policies put them on a collision course with the core of Europe and the ECB. We ultimately expect market and political pressures to constrain these parties, and Europe will find a way to muddle through political uncertainty as it has in the past. Still, we recognize the path to resolution is likely to be bumpy and have downgraded our outlook on European assets to account for recent developments. The Italian bond auction results are in, and it seems to have been a reasonable success although the interest rate is again a high one: The dip in the eurozone sentiment figures shows that even before the Italian turmoil, confidence was not really recovering, says Bert Colijn, senior eurozone economist at ING Bank: Much like fidget spinners, euphoria about Eurozone growth and politics is definitely something that stayed in 2017. A few months ago, the sky was the limit for Eurozone sentiment, but now even stabilisation seems like a good result, as analysts expected worse. Given that the survey does not account for the Italian turmoil, it’s safe to say that moderating growth continues to be the message of 2018. While a few one-offs impacted the disappointing first quarter growth rate of 0.4%, it seems that there is some more permanence to the slower growth than initially expected even though Eurozone fundamentals remain strong with labour market strength and a favourable investment environment. The months ahead will likely see uncertainty continue as the Italian political crisis could drag on during the summer. As developments towards a new government continue, uncertainty about the Italian stance towards the EU and the euro will prevail. Even though it is very unclear what the next steps will be, markets have clearly woken up from the euro-risk lull that started after the Macron presidential election victory in France last year. This continued uncertainty will weigh on Eurozone growth in the months ahead, and a bounce back to growth rates seen in 2017 seems very difficult. Economic confidence in the eurozone dipped slightly in May, according the European Commission. The economic sentiment index slipped by 0.2 points to 112.5 in the eurozone, but edged up 0.4 points to 112.8 in the wider EU. Consumer confidence in the eurozone was down from 0.3 to 0.2. The commission said: Virtually unchanged consumer confidence (-0.1) was the result of a marked decrease in consumers’ assessment of the future general economic situation, which was counterbalanced by a strong increase in their savings expectations. Views on households’ future financial situation and unemployment remained broadly stable. Meanwhile in Spain, ahead of the no confidence vote facing prime minister Mariano Rajoy: The European Central Bank may call an emergency meeting to discuss Italy sometime this week. “Mario Draghi is obviously following events very closely and will likely call an urgent meeting imminently,” said a source close to a member of the European Central Bank’s governing council. On Tuesday Bank of Italy governor Ignazio Visco warned that the crisis-stricken country is at “very serious risk of losing the irreplaceable asset of trust.” Here’s the OECD’s latest economic outlook: Unemployment will drop to its lowest level since 1980 across the world’s richest nations, but global growth remains dependent on cheap borrowing and government spending, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation &amp; Development (OECD) has warned in its latest global economy health check. The rise of tit-for-tat protectionist trade barriers, the return of volatile financial markets, and soaring oil prices also spell trouble for the global economy as it heads towards the 10-year anniversary of the 2008 banking collapse, the OECD said. “The economic expansion is set to continue for the coming two years, and the short-term growth outlook is more favourable than it has been for many years,” said Angel Gurría, secretary general of the OECD, the Paris based thinktank for the world’s 35 richest nations, including the US, Britain, Brazil, Mexico and Russia. “However, the current recovery is still being supported by very accommodative monetary policy, and increasingly by fiscal easing. This suggests that strong, self-sustaining growth has not yet been attained.” The full story is here: More reports from Italy on its political future, suggesting a new coalition may not happen: Away from Italy for the moment, and some good news on the jobs front from Germany. The jobless total fell by a better than expected 11,000 in May to 2.358m. Analysts had been forecasting a drop of 10,000. The unemployment rate fell to 5.2%, down from 5.3% and the lowest since the reunification of West and East Germany in 1990. Head of the Federal Labour Office Detlef Scheele said: “The upward trend on the labour market is continuing, albeit at a slower pace than in the winter months.” As for the euro, it has made a slight recovery along with the Italian stock market, up around 0.5% at $1.1603. Senior finance officials in Greece are watching events in Italy increasingly nervously, reports Helena Smith in Athens. Exiled from capital markets for the best part of the last decade, the debt-stricken country is aiming to return to them once its third - and last - EU-IMF funded rescue programme officially expires in August. “What is happening in Italy worries us immensely,” a senior banking source told the Guardian. “The bond markets have gone mad in southern Europe. With such yields it is totally prohibitive that Greece could return to them when the programme ends.” Any prospect of Athens making a ‘ clean break’ and assuming post-bailout ‘normality’ without outside assistance has also been quashed by the Italian turmoil, well-placed officials say. The Governor of the Bank of Greece Yiannis Stournaras has long argued that Greece will need a precautionary credit line “as a protective cushion” to see it through as it endeavours to stand on its feet after its worst financial crisis in modern times. Athens’ leftist-led government, keen to break free of international oversight, has dispelled any such notion. But another senior official said: “The country will need some sort of fall-back, even if to never uses it. The government’s narrative of clean breaks, and going it alone, is over for now.” Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Despite an eye-watering drop in the Asian session, prompted by duel macro-downers of a new set of US tariffs on Chinese goods and the whiff of eurosceptic Greek tragedy around Italy’s political pile-up, the European indices avoided anything too ugly after the bell.... The DAX is up 0.2%, and is trying its best to re-cross 12700 having briefly fallen below 12600 – a one month low – on Tuesday, with the CAC flat at 5390. Italy’s FTSE MIB was actually the most upbeat... as investors cling onto hopes that this whole situation can avoid the kind of prolonged, and costly, crisis that engulfed Greece a few years ago. As for the FTSE, it showed no signs of bouncing back this Wednesday. Dipping 0.1%, the UK index is just about holding above 7600, and is back at levels not seen since for 3 weeks. With little else on its agenda, the FTSE will be hoping that things don’t take another downturn in the Eurozone (or, indeed, the US). The report that 5 Star and the Lega party are attempting to revive their coalition seems to be one of the reasons behind a slight recovery in the Italian market. The FTSE MIB is currently up 0.77% but could go higher: Italy is issuing new bonds this morning, which will give another indication as to how investors feel about the current situation. On Tuesday it succeeded with a smaller issue, but at much higher interest rates. As investors await the latest political developments in Italy, European markets seem to have shrugged off the heavy falls on Wall Street and in Asia. Italy’s FTSE MIB is up around 1.3% in early trading, with the country’s banking index around 2% better. Spain’s Ibex is up 0.4%, Germany’s Dax is 0.2% better but France’s Cac is down 0.3%. Meanwhile the FTSE 100 has dipped 0.1% or 8 points. That is not to say the situation in Italy is any less confusing: On the other hand: And the controversial finance minister appointee - vetoed by the Italian president - may also be back in the frame: Italian bonds, which suffered heavy selling on Tuesday, appear to have recovered slightly. The yield - which moves inversely to the actual bond price - on two year bills has dipped 33 basis points to 2.095% having hit five year highs. The ten year yield is down 12 basis points at 2.98%. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Fears over the political chaos in Italy spread to the US and Asia overnight, and European markets are expected to open lower as a consequence. After the collapse of the coalition in Italy as the president vetoed its choice of finance minister, former IMF man Carlos Catterelli was put in as interim prime minister. But his failure to come up with a list of ministers reinforced the prospect of new elections before long. The prospect of the anti-EU parties winning more of the popular vote was one of the main factors spooking the markets, with the idea of Italexit gaining ground. But reports that the two mooted coalition partners, 5 Star and the Lega party, could make a new attempt to form a government could provide some relief to the markets, if such a move is seen as credible. Even so, European investors remain nervous, not least because Wall Street tumbled 1.58% on Tuesday and the Nikkei 225 is currently down a similar amount. Here’s our story on the fall in Asian markets: Banking shares were among the biggest fallers on Tuesday, as Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, explains: Big banks dropped the hardest, struck by a double whammy of investors trying to suss out which lenders are capable of surviving a fresh eurozone storm; in addition to being hit by lower US bond yields as investors brought into safe haven treasuries. A lower yield environment is considered less profitable for the banks, a sector which dived as the US 10-year bond enjoyed its biggest rally since the Brexit referendum in 2016, sending yields 15 basis points lower to 2.78. The latest action has put the recent 4 year high of 3.08% 10yr yields into the history books, at least for the time being. The S&amp;P closed 1.2% lower whilst the financial sector shed 3.4%, as the likes of Citibank, JP Morgan, Bank of America and Morgan Stanley closed 4% lower. There are other causes for concern for investors, not least the no-confidence vote facing the Spanish government on Friday. And of course, in such a febrile environment, it is no surprise that President Trump has waded in and ratcheted up the trade row between the US and China. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: [Markets face] the prospect of elevated trade tensions after President Trump announced that the US would be proceeding with $50bn worth of tariffs on Chinese in imports. With EU exemptions on US tariffs also due to expire this Friday, markets are likely to find it difficult to catch a break today. Here are the opening calls for Europe from IG: There are also some economic figures to keep an eye on, as well as what could be a lively annual meeting of the Royal Bank of Scotland. The bank has already announced that finance director Ewen Stevenson is stepping down from his role to take up an opportunity elsewhere.

It read “Grandfathers for Yes”. It came across my phone as I traversed Melbourne in the 86 tram only a couple of days before the vote, like a lobbed bomb of hope and love, relief and change. I sobbed aloud. It struck with specific weight because there’d been another photo circulating a week earlier of Irish men the same age in a sadly more familiar scenario. “Vote NO” read their own pink signs, “Support women, protect babies, save lives.” That one had left me not in hot tears but a cold rage. Because this is what we’re more used to, women. The conspicuous lack of solidarity, from those who would pretend to our support but not trust us with the insight to govern our own lives. You don’t need to watch The Handmaid’s Tale to see pale male authoritarianism at its most extreme iteration. You can see it in one of those art-directed group shots of Trump and his gang of gormless greybeards, striking women’s rights from the ledger with happy sneers and pen strokes. You can see it internationally, across generations of interchangeable, aspirational male totalitarians, always pinning a thousand pseudo-moral justifications on themselves to camouflage an ugly inner truth; the obsession to restrict abortion wells inside from a raw greed to control. But Ireland has said no to this regime, conclusively. It’s said no to this – now proven – minority of men. And hope burbles where the world as it is has so long encouraged the powerless, the disadvantaged and exploited – so many of them women – to squash and suppress it. I’m hardly the only woman who the events in Ireland moved to tears. Suzanne Moore confessed to the same emotions in the pages of this publication, and wet eyes met the river of tweets relating the journeys of Irish travelling #hometovote, and why. I had no skin exposed in this game – I’m Australian, not Irish, and I’ve never had an abortion. My adult life has been dominated by the inability to fall pregnant, my insides wracked with the mess endometriosis has made of them. The old cliches broadcast about womanhood would insist on my jealousy of the pregnant, my resentment of terminations. But, as Ireland has declared at volume, what exists behind the stereotype of “woman” is a human adult, who accepts the world as it is, and, if allowed, can make the best of it on their own terms. This is why the struggle for reproductive choice is so important – because it destroys that insistent mythology that women are, or should be, unable to determine the best shape of their own existence. Reading the stories of choices made – and sometimes denied – of women pouring forth from Ireland has reminded me of the experiences of friends. Religious Ann, pregnant in her 20s from an out-of-character one-night stand with a stranger in another country, had a termination, rejoined her community and got on with her life, built a successful career, loving relationship and two beautiful boys. Working-class Jane, with her contraception-proof body, teenage and pregnant – several times – to a junkie she finally found the courage to escape, now suburban and stable, married and safe, with a permanent job, a boy and a girl. And Eileen – gay, pregnant and poor, who never regretted taking her extraordinary pregnancy to term, because she knew that having him was really, truly her choice. All of these names have been changed because only abortion could stigmatise women for making entirely the right decision. And that’s what the legalisation of abortion vindicates – that, consistently, the implications of pregnancy to mother and child, family and broader society are best made by the woman involved, and no other. One guesses that it’s this powerful capacity for judgment that threatens the greybeards so. The work continues beyond Ireland, of course. There’s still a denial of reproductive rights in Northern Ireland. Campaigns against abortion in America are notoriously horrendous. Less well known is that abortion rights are not entirely confirmed by law for the women of New South Wales, Queensland or the Northern Territory, and lip service to rights does not deliver access to Tasmanian women who, denied safe clinics, must travel to the mainland to receive terminations. The human rights activist Paula Avila-Guillen has been reminding the world in the wake of Ireland that the total denial of rights in the Dominican Republic has seen teenagers fatally denied cancer treatment as because to do so would harm a pregnancy. El Salvador sends women to jail for stillbirths they deem “aggravated homicide”. And Honduras’ marginalisation of women extends beyond total abortion bans to bans on the morning-after pill as well. Unsurprisingly, it also has the second highest rate of teen pregnancy in South America and one of the highest rates of gender-based violence in the world. And if ever there was a reminder that the campaign against women’s bodily autonomy is a campaign of violence, it would be the death of Savita Halappanavar, the dentist who died from complications of a pregnancy that Irish doctors were prevented by law from terminating. Of all the tears shed over the referendum, could there have been a greater sea than the one created in her memory – from the murals on the walls, the flowers left for her, the cards that read “We’re sorry”. The simple chant of “Savita! Savita! Savita!” that rang out from the crowds in the town squares at the referendum’s victory brought me to floods. Finally, a woman’s death at the hands of an old madness did not mean nothing. And that the resounding majority of a country can acknowledge it should never have happened at all, now means everything.

Phoenix finished ninth, one point above wooden spooners Central Coast, during a tumultuous season that saw previous coach Darije Kalezic sacked in March and interim coach Chris Greenacre take over for the rest of the campaign. Rudan, who captained Sydney FC to the inaugural A-League title in 2006, has made a promising start to his coaching career, winning both NSW Premier League and Australian Premier League titles with Sydney United in 2013 and 2016. His first A-League coaching role is with a club whose licence could be terminated in two seasons if they don’t make substantial improvements to off-field metrics such as crowd and broadcasting figures. Turning around their fortunes on the field is where it will begin for the 42-year-old. “Throughout my playing career and my coaching career, I’ve always kept a keen eye on clubs like this and it’s certainly one that needs to change in a lot of areas,” he said. “Not just the players, but the staff and all stakeholders will understand exactly where we’re heading. It’s not a dictatorship but I want to see a change at the football club.” Phoenix general manager David Dome conceded Kalezic failed to succeed because he wasn’t equipped to cope with the Australasian way of doing things. “It was very important for us to find a coach who understood the Australian and New Zealand culture,” Dome said. “When Mark’s name came across our desk, he stood out as someone who would be that kind of coach, who can do a lot for Wellington. “There are two more years left on our current licence. We all understand that the club needs to succeed, the club needs to perform.” Phoenix chairman Rob Morrison said Rudan’s “passion and desire to make a difference at the club” made him stand out from a number of other applicants for the post, including some with considerable A-League experience. “The feedback on Mark from the people we spoke to, which included some of the most respected and experienced people in Australian football, was universally excellent with all stressing what a talented coach, man manager and determined leader he is,” Morrison said. “Mark is an exciting ‘next generation’ coach, who will bring fresh energy, focus and discipline to the playing group at the club and he can’t wait to stamp his mark upon the A-League. “We are an ‘underdog’ club, we can’t escape that, we have to fight for everything we get and we wanted someone who would buy into what the club faces and is capable of leading that fight and we think Mark is that person.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/30/know-your-options-and-shop-around-when-it-comes-to-healthcare","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-30T02:46:32Z","webTitle":"It's up to doctors to behave with integrity when charging patients | Ranjana Srivastava","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/30/know-your-options-and-shop-around-when-it-comes-to-healthcare","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/may/30/know-your-options-and-shop-around-when-it-comes-to-healthcare","fields":{"headline":"It's up to doctors to behave with integrity when charging patients","bodyText":"A patient, only described as aggrieved, is ushered into my room before I have had a chance to find out more. She is a woman in her early 30s, accompanied by a frazzled husband who is responsible for minding twins in a pram and jotting down notes. By the way she grips her chair, I can tell that her emotions are barely controlled. I introduce myself, and her opening salvo is: “And how much will you charge to hear my story?” “Nothing”, I reply, puzzled by her biting tone. “You are in a public hospital”, I add, by way of explanation. “So, there is no bill?” “No, your taxes keep me going”, I smile, but my attempt at levity elicits only a burst of tears. “I didn’t mean to upset you”, I apologise. “It’s not you”, her husband sighs. She had recently discovered a breast lump that resulted in her local doctor sending her to a surgeon who ordered a host of tests to confirm a cancer diagnosis. Every single test was expensive, she says, and I immediately know where this is going. I hear the rest between sobs and curses. Surgery was scheduled for a week later and was subsequently marred by a complication that required a second operation. Her basic private insurance proved too restrictive, and her stress grew in line with the mounting cost. On discharge, she lacked adequate wound care or communication. The final straw came when she begged her neighbour for help, who told her that she could have had the same surgery at no cost in the public hospital and been followed by a nurse on discharge. Through more tears, she flings a flurry of questions at me. “Tell me, did I just lose thousands of dollars on shoddy treatment? Why wouldn’t someone tell a patient that down the road there is a public hospital that would do the same thing for free? What happened to a doctor’s morality?” Pausing to order my own thoughts, I tell her that I am sorry for her experience. Having never met her surgeon, I can’t account for his thinking, but her surgery itself wasn’t shoddy and the complication might have occurred anywhere. I observe that it is the rare patient who doesn’t want a breast cancer instantly gone – some women view the cost of rapid access to a private surgeon as necessary and worthwhile; other women, through circumstance and choice, rely on the public system, where incidentally, they are treated with the utmost urgency too although the wait can be somewhat longer. Whether a small delay impacts survival is debatable but when it comes to cancer, facts can take second place to emotion and visceral fear and surgeons can feel particularly pressured to “do something” to mitigate this. She looks skeptical; I think to myself that in treating her, the surgeon made certain assumptions, namely that a patient referred to him, and not to the public hospital, had already had this discussion with her doctor. That she would be aware of, and willing to, meet the considerable expense of surgery. But actually, the patient had no basis on which to work through these layers of complexity. She had cancer, she wanted it out and was willing to do whatever it took. This isn’t unusual. According to a recent ABC investigation, a quarter of patients who responded to a survey had out-of-pocket expenses of more than $10,000. A third had not been informed of these expenses prior to surgery. This happens in a country that has a generous universal healthcare system with some of the best outcomes in the world. “Doesn’t this bother you?” she asks defensively. “Doesn’t it bother you that your colleagues are unethical?” I can’t tell her how much it bothers me that more money did not buy her better care. It bothers me that there was an egregious lack of informed consent. And it especially bothers me that the conduct of a few tars the many in medicine who are motivated by service, not avarice. While some people think steep medical fees are unscrupulous, others call it doing business. After all, if the market will bear it, why not charge? But in my opinion, doctors have a duty to know that the business of healthcare is like none other. There is such gross asymmetry of information between doctors and patients that it is near impossible for a patient to wade through the options. Is robotic surgery better than the traditional way? It depends. Is it better to wait and watch or operate now? It depends. Is the surgeon who charges six times more than his counterpart worth it? It depends. This reminds me of an apocryphal story that is both humorous and telling. Once there was a specialist who grew old and wanted to close his practice, but such was his eminence that the patients kept coming. So, in order to stem the tide, he doubled his fee. But the patients showed no sign of slowing down so exasperated, he doubled his fee again, thinking that no patient in their right mind would brook such excess. But to his dismay, he noted that this led to a surge in referrals as people assumed that the more expensive the advice the better it was. Disbelievingly, he went back to the original idea of putting up a sign saying he was closing for good. Regulatory bodies can’t regulate the way patients think any more than professional medical groups can police individual ethics, but the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission offers sage advice to patients – know your needs, know your options and shop around. It is worth setting aside panic and heeding this advice. As for doctors, it is not enough to yearn that society weren’t so disillusioned with us. Medicine really doesn’t need the bad publicity, and it is up to each one of us to scrutinise our actions, behave with integrity, and act collectively in the best interest of the patient. The ancient counsel of Hippocrates should ring loudly in our ears: Make a habit of two things – to help, or at least to do no harm. • Ranjana Srivastava is an oncologist and a Guardian Australia columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sport/2018/may/30/serena-williams-wakanda-catsuit-superhero-roland-garros","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-30T00:35:21Z","webTitle":"Serena Williams on her 'Black Panther' catsuit: 'It's my way of being a superhero'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/30/serena-williams-wakanda-catsuit-superhero-roland-garros","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/may/30/serena-williams-wakanda-catsuit-superhero-roland-garros","fields":{"headline":"Serena Williams on her 'Black Panther' catsuit: 'It's my way of being a superhero'","bodyText":"Serena Williams considers the black bodysuit she wore at the French Open much more than a fashion statement. The full-length, skintight outfit is designed to protect against blood clots. But it isn’t only practical. The suit also contains a message that Williams wanted to send about self-worth as she returns to grand slam action with a first-round victory at Roland Garros on Tuesday, about nine months after giving birth to a daughter. “It feels like this suit represents all the women that have been through a lot mentally, physically, with their body to come back and have confidence and to believe in themselves,” Williams said, after beating Kristyna Pliskova 7-6 (4), 6-4 at Court Philippe Chatrier. “I definitely feel like it is an opportunity for me to inspire a whole different group of amazing women and kids.” The outfit called to mind Williams’s black “catsuit” that she wore at the 2002 US Open. It also was reminiscent of the white bodysuit that the American player Anne White wore at Wimbledon in 1985. Williams referred to what she wore Tuesday as the “catsuit — the new version, 2.0”. “I call it, like, my Wakanda-inspired catsuit,” referring to the fictional nation in the film Black Panther. “We designed it way before the movie,” she said, “but still, it kind of reminds me of that.” Williams said she feels “like a warrior princess, kind of” when she wears the outfit. “I’m always living in a fantasy world,” she added. “I always wanted to be a superhero and it’s kind of my way of being a superhero.” Tuesday’s match was the first at a major tournament for the 23-time Grand Slam champion in 16 months. She gave birth to her daughter Alexis Olympia on 1 September, then dealt with serious complications related to a pulmonary embolism. After her recovery Williams revealed that she almost died giving birth. “I had a lot of problems with my blood clots, and, God, I don’t know how many I have had in the past 12 months. So it is definitely a little functionality to it,” Williams said. “I have been wearing pants in general a lot when I play, so I can keep the blood circulation going. It’s a fun suit but it’s also functional, so I can be able to play without any problems.” The suit garnered a lot of fans on social media, including Williams’s partner Alexis Ohanian Snr.

Albert Arenal, the Coconut Creek police chief, announced Tuesday that he had suspended the officer, Brian Valenti, for five days without pay for posting a comment about David Hogg, a high school senior and survivor of the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school. Hogg had organized Friday a “die-in” at the Publix supermarket chain over its support of a pro-NRA gubernatorial candidate. Valenti posted he hoped “some old lady loses control of her car in that lot” under a photo of Hogg. Valenti has since deleted the post. A union representative, Rod Skirvin, told the South Florida Sun-Sentinel the 45-year-old veteran officer was sorry for his actions. Hogg – who has been one of the most vocal student activists for gun reform since the 14 February attack, which killed 17 people – said he respected the apology, but added that comments like Valenti’s were not helpful. Parkland students have found themselves the target of numerous attacks as a result of their outspoken calls for gun control reform in the wake of the shooting.

The grocery market rose by 2.7% in the three months to 20 May, up from 2% reported a month ago, according to Kantar Worldpanel. “The sun shone on the grocery market over the past month with record-breaking temperatures, a bank holiday weekend and royal wedding fever all contributing to a bumper period,” said Chris Hayward, a consumer specialist at Kantar. He said the festivities and warm weather encouraged shoppers to fire up the barbecue with sales of burgers and sausages up by 39% and 12% respectively, while non-alcoholic beer sales jumped by 64%. Over 16.6m households chose to pick up an ice-cream as temperatures soared. Brits were also slathering on the sun cream with sales rocketing by 64% on this time last year. Over the early May bank holiday, spending in supermarkets was up 10% compared to the same long weekend last year as temperatures reached record highs. The strong sales came despite inflation of 2.1%, down from 2.5% two months ago and 3.6% at the beginning of the year. Kantar expects inflation to fall slightly this year, but pricescontinue to rise particularly fast in goods such as butter and canned colas. “Growth is well ahead of inflation, indicating that despite any underlying concerns shoppers may have around balancing the monthly household budget, they are willing to spend on food and drink,” said Mike Watkins, the UK head of retailer insight at analysts Nielsen. Nielsen said the heatwave had helped the supermarkets to sell more food and drink, rather than relying on inflation to boost sales. Alcoholic drinks were up 12%, soft drinks 13%, ice-cream 41%, and crisps and snacks 7.5% as Brits dined alfresco. Morrisons was the strongest performer of the big four traditional supermarkets with growth of 2.9%, according to Kantar, ahead of Asda on 2.8% and Tesco on 2.2%. Sainsbury’s is trailing the market with just 1% growth, but at least one analyst suggested this may be as a result of the supermarket switching sales of non-food products to its fast-growing network of Argos concessions. Lidl was the only high street grocer to see growth in double digits with sales up 10.4%. Aldi’s sales rose by 6.7%, its lowest growth since the end of 2010. Analysts said growth at both Lidl and Aldi was being driven by store openings, with sales at established stores rising at a slower pace than the traditional supermarkets. “The German discounters continue to show signs of fatigue,” said James Grzinic, a retail analyst at Jefferies. But figures from the home goods store B&amp;M underlined how cut-price chains are benefiting from an increasingly competitive market in which shoppers are looking to save money. The discounter said sales rose 4.7% at its established UK stores in the year to 31 March, underpinning a 25% rise in group profits to £229.3m despite a 52% crash in profits at the group’s German chain Jawoll. B&amp;M said poor weather had hit sales of gardening goods in Germany and the business also experienced disruption from the arrival of a new management team.

That is not consistent with her current plans; the government says it wants trade with the EU to be as frictionless as possible after Brexit, implying some new friction will be added, and in her Mansion House speech May said: “In certain ways, our access to each other’s markets will be less than it is now.” In a statement issued after a meeting with May in Downing Street, the European Round Table of Industrialists (ERT) said its members expressed their “concerns” to the prime minister. The ERT went on: The uninterrupted flow of goods is essential to both the EU and UK economies. This must be frictionless as with a customs union. We need clarity and certainty, because time is running out. Uncertainty causes less investment. Sky’s Tom Boadle has tweeted a copy of the full statement. May’s appeal for a special Brexit deal on science and research collaboration, worth billions to the British economy, is being stonewalled by Brussels as it prepares to offer an arrangement less privileged and more expensive than that given to non-EU states such as Israel. A defunct European political grouping that was dominated by Ukip has been asked to repay €1.1m (£977,000) to the European parliament following an investigation into misspending of EU funds. As Jennifer Rankin reports, the Alliance for Direct Democracy in Europe was a Eurosceptic pan-European political party, until it was closed down after a 2016 auditors’ inquiry found misspending of EU funds, including on Nigel Farage’s bid to become an MP in the 2015 UK general election. Voters have become significantly more negative about the impact of Brexit on the British economy and on life in Britain in general over the last 15 months, a Guardian/ICM poll suggests. (See 12.53pm.) Food safety standards could be put at risk by Brexit if the UK quits the EU without a deal to keep exchanging information on public health issues, the Local Government Association has warned. That’s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. The People’s Vote campaign, which is campaigning for a referendum on the final Brexit deal, is not surprised by the findings of our latest Brexit poll. (See 12.53pm.) It has put out this statement from the Labour MP Stephen Doughty. It’s no wonder voters are becoming increasingly pessimistic about the economic impact of Brexit, as we already know households are £900 worse off and that the UK has slipped to the bottom of the GDP growth table for developed countries, and that’s before we’ve even left. It’s becoming increasingly clear that the public can see that the Brexit promises of the likes of Boris Johnson and Michael Gove are not going to be delivered. With the fantasy promises of Brexit melting away, and the public increasingly pessimistic about the economic consequences, we need a People’s Vote on the final Brexit deal. Some Labour MPs have been criticising Theresa May for refusing to commit herself to legislate for the liberalisation of abortion laws in Northern Ireland. James Cleverly, the Conservative party deputy chairman, has hit back. In a Twitter thread starting here, he defends her record on women’s right and points out that Labour was quite happy to leave the abortion laws in Northern Ireland unreformed when it was in power. He even suggests the female Labour MPs attacking May over this aren’t proper feminists. Labour’s investigations into antisemitic abuse are to be strictly time-limited, de-politicised and made more consistent under new moves to tackle the problem within the party, HuffPost’s Paul Waugh reports. His story goes on: A 13-point action plan, leaked to HuffPost UK, includes proposals to fast-track the process by using smaller, specially-trained teams of investigators and by anonymising complaints to remove any risk of political or personal bias. More disciplinary cases will be dealt with solely through written testimony rather than oral hearings and a new in-house lawyer will produce clearer evidence tests to standardise the system and make it more transparent. You can read his full report, including a the document presented to Labour’s national executive committee explaining the plan, here. The Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union will not reaffiliate to Labour but will “align” itself to the party, a special conference has decided. As the Press Association reports, the union’s 80,000 members will be encouraged to be active in the Labour party, whilst remaining unaffiliated. RMT general secretary Mick Cash said: Our consultation has shown that the views of our branches and regions are finely balanced and the conference has decided that, whilst we do not support affiliation at this current time, there is the potential for the union to affiliate to the Labour party at a future date if there is clearer support for this. Many of our members have also reacted angrily to constant attempts by a hard core of Labour MPs to undermine Jeremy Corbyn and the radical progressive changes he has made to Labour. In contrast, there is a clear desire amongst RMT members to support Jeremy Corbyn and the left leadership of the Labour party and that is why we are now putting in place other concrete steps to throw the weight of the RMT behind supporting the socialist advances that have been made in the Labour party - this will include aligning ourselves towards Labour, encouraging members to be active in Labour and allowing our branches and regions to fund Labour candidates. The RMT used to be affiliated to Labour but was expelled in 2004 after it backed the Scottish Socialists, a rival party. Nicola Sturgeon has tweeted an unexpected and detailed defence of the report by the SNP’s Growth Commission, which was published last Friday. (See 11.11am.) Following significant criticism of the report - designed to offer a more sober evaluation of Scotland’s economic future as an independent country - by figures across the wider Yes movement as well as opposition politicians, Sturgeon insisted today that it offered an alternative to Westminster austerity, the “Brexit spiral” and lack of investment. Perhaps most interesting is not the content of the tweets but the fact that the first minister felt moved to type them in the first place. She has, of course, said that the report should be a starting point for fresh debate on the economic practicalities of independence, so in that sense she is simply sticking to her word. But it does raise the question whether she has been stung by criticisms from those within the pro-independence family, like that of Orwell Prize-shortlisted commentator Darren McGarvey - who is fast becoming one of the most interesting observers of Scottish politics currently writing. He described the report as “laughably centrist”, “too keen to placate the financial sector” and offering a “timid vision” of Scotland’s future. Meanwhile, former SNP MP George Kerevan warned that the report “sticks to the very currency option that helped defeat the independence proposition back in 2014”. Likewise, Scottish Labour quickly found a catchy rejoinder when they characterised the report a “cuts commission rather than a growth commission”. Sturgeon has promised a series of assemblies of SNP members over the summer to discuss the report’s content. It will be interesting to hear how many of these concerns are shared by the membership who now, let’s not forget, represent a significant tranche of Scottish society. Theresa May is chairing a meeting of business leaders and industrialists to discuss Brexit at Number 10 this afternoon. Here are some of the attendees arriving. Theresa May was criticised yesterday for refusing to commit the government to legislating to give women in Northern Ireland the same abortion rights as women in the rest of the United Kingdom. Downing Street says this is a devolved matter, and the power-sharing executive at Stormont (when or if it ever gets going again - it’s been suspended for 16 months) should decide. It is an issue on which Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Conservative leader and about the most prominent figure on the modernising/progressive wing of the party, could easily have chosen to cause trouble. As she proved in a major speech in Scotland last night (full text here), Davidson is willing (at least up to a point) to say when she thinks May is wrong. Yesterday she criticised May’s target for cutting annual net migration. But, on abortion, Davidson is backing May’s argument that this is a matter for Stormont, not for MPs. These are from the FT’s Laura Hughes. Davidson also said the same thing in an interview yesterday with ITV Border. She said she was “torn” on the issue but that, even though she would vote for abortion liberalisation if she sat in Stormont, she did not think it was right for Westminster to take the initiative. She said: As a devolved politician in Scotland, if the House of Commons changed the law in Scotland in an area that was under Holyrood control, I would be pretty annoyed about that. And I’m pretty sure the nationalists would be even more annoyed about that. (The SNP would say that, on the subject of the EU withdrawal bill and its incursion on devolution, Davidson and the Scottish Conservatives have managed very successfully to hide their annoyance, although arguably the issues are different.) When ITV Border’s Peter MacMahon put it to Davidson that legislating from Westminster might be justified because there is no Northern Ireland executive at the moment, she replied: I think that you run into very, very tricky waters, particularly as somebody that operates in a devolved parliament, to say that anytime something is in stasis, we just let the Commons legislate on a domestic issue. I don’t believe in that. For anyone unfamiliar with 1970s comedy, the interview also included a bizarre line when Davidson quoted Monty Python after MacMahon suggested that she was seen as the “messiah” for the Conservative party. There is a link to the interview here. Theresa May’s appeal for a special Brexit deal on science and research collaboration, worth billions to the British economy, is being stonewalled by Brussels as it prepares to offer an arrangement less privileged and more expensive than that given to non-EU states such as Israel, my colleague Daniel Boffey reports. Severe flooding has played havoc with the telephone lines in Parliament, the Press Association reports. Engineers were called to the parliamentary estate after exceptionally heavy rainfall caused “intermittent faults” with the lines. Tottenham MP David Lammy advised constituents attempting to contact his office to email instead. A House of Commons spokesman said: Due to severe flooding, there are intermittent faults on a number of telephone lines on the estate. We are working to restore connectivity as soon as possible. This is just the latest in a long list of episodes showing how dilapidated the Palace of Westminster is. At the Victoria Tower end of the building there is currently scaffolding up to protect pedestrians after a chunk of masonry (said to be the size of a football) fell 70m to the ground. The building is, quite literally, falling apart. We have some new Guardian/ICM polling out today, covering Brexit and voting intention. Impact of Brexit We asked respondents whether they thought Brexit would have a positive impact or a negative impact on the British economy, on their personal finances and on life in the UK generally. Voters are more likely to think that the impact of Brexit will be negative than positive. They are particularly likely to think it will be bad for their personal finances (14% positive, 32% negative, making a net rating of -18), but they also think it will have a negative impact on the economy (net -15) and on life in Britain generally (net -7). Here are the detailed figures. Impact on the British economy Positive impact: 30% Negative impact: 45% No difference: 13% Don’t know: 13% Net: -15 Impact on your personal finances Positive impact: 14% Negative impact: 32% No difference: 40% Don’t know: 14% Net: -18 Impact on life in Britain generally Positive impact: 32% Negative impact: 39% No difference: 18% Don’t know: 11% Net: -7 If these figures seem broadly familiar, that’s not surprising. This is a tracker question, and we have asked it repeatedly over the last year or so. That means we are able to say with some certainty how opinion has (or hasn’t) shifted. Here are the details. Voters have become significantly more negative about the impact of Brexit on the British economy and on life in Britain generally over the last 15 months. Here are the figures showing changes in the net score on the impact on the economy measure. And here are the figures showing changes in the net score on impact on life in Britain in general. Voters are marginally less negative about the impact that Brexit will have on their personal finances than they were 15 months ago. But the shift is relatively small (net -22 in February 2017, net -18 now), and overall the pessimists still strongly outnumber the optimists. ICM’s Alex Turk says that the detailed polling figures help to explain why the headline figures are shifting. While these headline figures show a slight increase in negativity towards Brexit, our polling also offers clues on where this may be coming from. These are small changes – but across all three statements, there’s an indication that the increase in overall negativity could be attributed to increasing negativity among those who voted remain in 2016, while those who voted leave look increasingly unsure about the likely impact of Brexit, answering ‘don’t know’. This last finding – of possible increasing uncertainty on the impact of Brexit among leave voters – is something to watch out for over the coming months. If remainers become increasingly certain that Brexit is a bad idea, while leavers waver more and more, then interesting times lie ahead. If you are interested in looking back at the previous figures, the February 2017 results are here, the July 2017 ones are here, the September 2017 ones are here, and the January 2018 ones are here. Voting intention We also asked our regular question about voting intention. With the exception of the Greens, who are down one point, all parties are recording exactly the same support that they had in the Guardian/ICM poll two weeks ago. Conservatives: 43% Labour: 40% Lib Dems: 8% Ukip: 3% Greens: 2% I will post a link to the tables here a bit later, when they go up on the ICM website. ICM Unlimited interviewed a representative online sample of 2,002 adults aged 18+, between 25 and 29 May 2018. Interviews were conducted across the country and the results have been weighted to the profile of all adults. ICM is a member of the British Polling Council and abides by its rules. UPDATE: The tables are here (pdf). And here is the ICM write-up. Minor excitement at Westminster. This is from ITV’s Carl Dinnen. An influential global body has upgraded its forecasts for UK economic performance, but warned of continuing “high uncertainties” over the outcome of Brexit, the Press Association reports. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s twice-yearly Economic Outlook report found that economic growth remains “modest” in the UK, compared with other major economies. It warned that the government must stand ready to ease up on austerity measures if growth weakens significantly in the run-up to the UK’s withdrawal from the EU. Brexit negotiations should aim to “preserve open trade with the European Union and high access for financial services to EU markets”, said the report. The May 2018 Economic Outlook projected GDP growth of 1.4% in the UK this year - up from 1.2% in its November 2017 forecast. Growth in 2019 was also nudged up from 1.1% six months ago to 1.3% now. But the UK continues to lag behind most major economies, with world economic growth forecast at 3.8% this year and 3.9% in 2019, the Press Association reports. Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, has been tweeting about Russia this morning. He has welcomed the Spanish decision to release Bill Browder, the anti-Putin campaigner detained in the country under a Russian warrant. And he condemned the murder of Arkady Babchenko, the journalist and Putin critic, in Kiev. Lord Malloch-Brown, the former Foreign Office minister who chairs the anti-Brexit group Best for Britain, was on the Today programme this morning defending the George Soros campaign for a second referendum. As the New European reports, he said there was nothing wrong with asking people to change their minds. He said: Democracy is a history of U-turns. The day that, you know, Britons just settle back and accept one election victory as the end of democracy - that party is in power forever - is an unlikely moment. It is the same with this referendum, it was a referendum on the principle to negotiate a deal for exit. We will soon see the terms of that deal and it’s already evident from the confusion in the government that those terms are going to offer Britain a much less good economic prospect than we currently enjoy. I think the British people who have been very badly let down by their politicians on all sides of this then deserve the right to have the final say on is this deal good for us or not. When the SNP published its sustainable growth commission report last week, an economic blueprint for independence, Scottish Labour said it would perpetuate austerity. Today Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first miniser, says they’re wrong. She addressed this point in a series of tweets defending the report. The Electoral Commission has published figures showing what donations were made to political parties in the first quarter of 2018. The Conservatives received more than three times as much money as Labour. Here are the overall figures. Ukip did not receive any donations big enough to meet the threshold for reporting (£7,500.) But the Electoral Commission report (pdf) setting out these figures in detail also shows that Ukip did take out new loans in the first three months of this year worth £86,379. The only party that took out more was the Liberal Democrats, who took out loans worth £100,000. And here are the top individual donors in the first three months of this year. Earlier this month, in an interview with the Financial Times (paywall), Erna Solberg, the Norwegian prime minister, suggested she would be happy for the UK to remain in the EEA (European Economic Area) after leaving the EU, joining Norway. Sky’s political editor, Faisal Islam, has been looking at Norway’s Europe strategy and he has posted a thread on it starting here. He says Norway will seek to match any special arrangements the UK gets with the EU after Brexit in terms of a security deal. Stanley Johnson, the I’m a Celebrity contestant, father of Boris, remain voter and ubiquitous rent-a-quote, has said the Brexit referendum should be re-run if it is proved that Russia tried to sway the result. Speaking on ITV’s Good Morning Britain, he said: It’s perfectly obvious the Russians were pretty heavily involved in the American election, more and more comes out, and it’s perfectly obvious to me at least that there is far more in the Brexit vote than has so far come out. Asked if he meant Russian involvement, he replied: Yes, absolutely. We are getting the Facebook stuff, the data which went into Facebook, all the tweets, and above all, some mega event like a massive migration crisis in the run-up to the 2016 election. If it was proved conclusively that everything I said happened, happened then you might say, some might say, was this a fair fight? Let’s not have a second referendum but let’s have a rerun of the first. One consequence of Brexit is that it is focusing public attention on all sorts of issues - basically, the regulatory and legal plumbing of the modern British state - that for years have languished in obscurity. For example, have you ever heard of RASFF (the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed)? Or TRACES (the Trade Control and Expert System)? Me neither, until they featured in a press release that arrived in my inbox. They are both EU databases relating to food and livestock safety. RASFF allows food safety alerts and notifications to be shared amongst EU member states. And TRACES is a similar system, circulating information about sanitary requirement relating to animals and plants. Councils are responsible for consumer safety and today the Local Government Association, which represents 370 councils in England and Wales, is today warning that, without access to these databases, there will be a risk to public health. Access should continue during the transition, but after that finishes in December 2020, nothing has been agreed. In a statement Kevin Bentley, chair of the LGA’s Brexit taskforce, said: If we lose access to these databases, we will lose access to vital intelligence about the origin of food, feed and animal products, and won’t be aware when rapid alerts are issued to the rest of the continent. This will significantly weaken our ability to effectively protect the food system, increasing the risk of a new scandal and undermining public confidence in the food industry. After years of funding reductions for trading standards and environmental health, we simply do not have the capacity to increase checks to offset this risk, either at ports or inland, unless this is fully funded. Without additional capacity, there is simply no alternative to continuing to receive and share this type of information. Continued access to these EU wide databases is of vital importance and the government and the European Union must ensure that it is maintained. The LGA is cross-party, but Conservative-led. Bentley is a Conservative councillor from Essex. In response, the government claimed Brexit would lead to food safety standards being enhanced. A government spokesman said: As we leave the EU, food safety and consumer protection will not only be maintained but enhanced. From day one our world-class Food Standards Agency will have a robust and effective regulatory regime in place to ensure business can continue as normal. Parliament is still in recess and it looks like another quiet day at Westminster. The only item on the agenda is Theresa May chairing a meeting with industrialists to discuss Brexit at 1.30pm in Downing Street. But, as usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens - at least, if there is any - as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary at the end of the day. And we have got a new Guardian/ICM poll. I will post the findings later. You can read all today’s Guardian politics stories here.

Last month, Patterson unveiled his new strategy for the company, which includes axing 13,000 jobs, as the telecoms group struggles with increased competition and falling revenues. Patterson is investing in building up its mobile and TV services to complement its broadband and fixed line business. But he has been criticised for spending billions of pounds on sports rights in an attempt to attract customers to its TV service, as well as the company’s difficult relationship with regulator Ofcom. Days after the news of the job cuts, the company revealed Patterson was paid £2.3m last year, including a £1.3m bonus and a 1.5% rise in his basic salary. The company, still reeling from a disastrous 18 months that included an accounting scandal in Italy and a record £42m fine from Ofcom, has seen its share price slump to a six-year low. The BT chairman, Jan du Plessis, has publicly endorsed Patterson and his strategy. Last month, he said: “You do not build great businesses by being fussed about tomorrow morning’s share price. “This is a great company, but we’ve got problems and challenges, and we’re going to address them by focusing on the right places, by investing in networks, by investing in converged connectivity, and by reshaping the organisation the way that Gavin announced.” Representatives of a number of major shareholders have told the Financial Times they are not happy with the chief executive and said they planned to call for further meetings with the company. One said Patterson was not the right man for the job, while others said he was being given his last chance and his strategy seemed to “chop and change”. But a company source said Du Plessis wrote to shareholders after last month’s strategy update offering follow-up meetings. He has already met a number of them, with another half dozen planned ahead of July’s AGM. Fund manager Thomas Moore of Aberdeen Standard defended Patterson. Speaking on BBC radio’s Today programme, he said: “I think it’s a tough set of cards he’s been dealt. When you consider the sort of pressures they’ve been under, they would have been there whoever the chief executive would have been. “Some of them are self-inflicted, like the accounting scandal in Italy, but you’ve got to consider there’s a lot of regulatory pressure on BT to cut tariffs, pressure to improve customer service and pressure on them to contribute to their pension fund and all of that has put a lot of pressure on Gavin Patterson and the dividend is also coming under some pressure. “It’s not an easy situation, he’s dealing with it with this convergence strategy, investing in mobile and TV alongside broadband and fixed line.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"games/2018/may/30/pokemon-lets-go-games-announced-for-nintendo-switch","type":"article","sectionId":"games","sectionName":"Games","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-30T07:05:07Z","webTitle":"Pokémon Let's Go games announced for Nintendo Switch","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/may/30/pokemon-lets-go-games-announced-for-nintendo-switch","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/games/2018/may/30/pokemon-lets-go-games-announced-for-nintendo-switch","fields":{"headline":"Pokémon Let's Go games announced for Nintendo Switch","bodyText":"The Pokémon Company and Nintendo have announced new Pokémon games for the Nintendo Switch. The announcements were headlined by two games that aim to mix the approachable nature of the hit mobile app Pokémon Go with the more in-depth appeal of the mainline role-playing game series, alongside a healthy hit of nostalgia. Based on a combination of the first-generation 1998 game Pokémon Yellow and Pokémon Go, Pokémon: Let’s Go Pikachu and Pokémon: Let’s Go Eevee return players to Kanto, the setting of the original games, in an updated graphical style. Various familiar elements of the mainline series, such as battling, trading and exploration, are also shown. Catching Pokémon now involves players flicking the Switch’s Joy-Con controllers or a new gadget, the Poké Ball Plus, at the screen in a manner familiar to players of Pokémon Go. Other elements, such as cooperative play and the ability to transfer Pokémon captured in Go into the new games, point to an attempt to capitalise on the wildly successful worldwide phenomenon. “I wanted to bring the fun of this more intuitive, as well as widely accepted and popular, Pokémon-catching gameplay, right back to the Pokémon main series RPGs,” said director Junichi Masuda, one of the original developers, at the reveal event in Tokyo, Japan. “Not only have we managed to make these titles great entry games for those who are new to the Pokémon RPG series, but at the same time really provide a new and fresh experience that fans of the series will enjoy.” Nintendo and the Pokémon Company also said a “free-to-start”, simplified RPG titled Pokémon Quest would release on the Switch’s digital storefront on Wednesday, coming to mobile phones in June, and an “all-new core series” title was in development for the second half of 2019."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"film/2018/may/30/censored-was-meant-to-celebrate-freedom-instead-it-exposes-something-darker","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-30T18:00:01Z","webTitle":"[CENSORED] was meant to celebrate freedom.

Instead it exposes something darker","bodyText":"In 1969 Australian government censors claimed a Swedish film playing at the Sydney film festival included an actual sex scene involving a heavily pregnant woman. The film could only play, they said, if the offending copulation were deleted. But the scene in question involved no sex whatsoever. The censors apparently couldn’t distinguish between an embrace and penetrative sex – and weren’t prepared to admit they were wrong. This wasn’t the first time the Australian government had tried to cut scenes from films showing in Australian cinemas – they had been secretly banning films and slicing out scenes as they came through customs for years. But the uproar over this particular film became the catalyst for reforming the censorship laws at the dawn of the 1970s. The film critic David Stratton, at the time at the helm of the Sydney film festival, played an enormous role in championing this change, and fundamentally altered how we view movies in this country. Long before bringing foreign films with sexy scenes to SBS – and lovingly bickering with Margaret Pomeranz on a weekly basis – David changed our eye. He changed what we saw in this country. In 2014 I made a short film with Stratton, called Smut Hounds, about the Swedish film furore. While making that film I found a huge audiovisual archive of all the clips sliced out of cinema in the period 1958 to 1971. Some were stray frames, other clips were full scenes and sequences that had been totally redacted before the films were released in Australian cinemas. It would be nearly 2,000 clips, tens of thousands of papers, and two years before I would figure out what to do with it. The project began optimistically – I figured I would liberate this archive so audiences could revel in seeing what had been denied. A celebration of democracy, a celebration of cinema. How playful, how irreverent and how cathartic it could be. But after months on end watching this collection, I found I was wearily dragging myself into work. It was a grind, a chore, a commitment to make a film I wished I’d never started. The censor’s act of cutting a scene from a film strips it of context and its story. It does not matter if it is a good or bad film, an important or forgettable film; the act of cutting a scene, dislocating action from story, is violent. To my surprise, watching these redacted scenes didn’t feel liberating – it felt suffocating. It was initially chaotic – almost meaningless stimulus on loop. But then I started to identify the patterns, the repetition, the tropes and I found something deeply disturbing. These stray fragments were screaming an unexpected message – and it wasn’t about government censorship. I was drowning in an archive of a dominating, violent gaze: a male gaze. And I hated it. When I started this work there was no #MeToo, no #TimesUp, no #OscarsSoWhite movement; no pussy-grabbing US president, no Harvey Weinstein in handcuffs. Just as the world was reckoning and transforming, I found my feminism in watching this archive of old film clippings: a flick of a knife, a casual slap, a naughty striptease, men punching, kicking and hurting other people. Scene after scene after scene. A single clip is innocuous but seen on repeat it is visceral, and uncomfortable. Censorship in the 1960s was about a handful of bureaucrats prescribing an illusive and contested “community standard”. But in creating this archive, what the censors accidentally created was a distilled catalogue of the destructive patriarchal imaginary. So, in 2018, with the government out of the way, what do we believe as a collective? What do we like to be entertained by? Are terrorised women and toxic men all that excite us as eager voyeurs? My film is not about the female gaze – this archive could not be redeemed or restored in that way. Neither the violence of censorship, nor the violence of these film-makers, could be made right through its re-presentation. But I wanted us to sit in the trouble of what this archive means, and how this history speaks to us today. I am a female film-maker exploiting the male gaze – [CENSORED] makes this male gaze so visible, so difficult, that it can no longer merely wash over us. As I prepare to screen the film for the first time, there has been a furore at Cannes about the dearth of female directors in the history of the festival, and the uproar of the violence of Lars Von Trier’s latest film, The House that Jack Built. It all speaks to a cultural shift surrounding who makes film and how our stories are told on screen. I hope my film will complicate how we feel about censorship, what we define as censorship, and how we feel about cinema. In creating [CENSORED], I wanted to create space for understanding the problems of our spectatorship; to use this archive to make us better, more discerning viewers. Forty-nine years after David Stratton fought the government censors, I am trying to follow his lead: trying to change what we see and how we see it. • [CENSORED] will premiere at Sydney film festival on 11 June"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/may/30/police-prosecute-videos-glorifying-violence","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-29T23:23:18Z","webTitle":"Police may prosecute those who post videos glorifying violence","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/30/police-prosecute-videos-glorifying-violence","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/may/30/police-prosecute-videos-glorifying-violence","fields":{"headline":"Police may prosecute those who post videos glorifying violence","bodyText":"Police will look to prosecute gang members who post videos glorifying violence online, even if they cannot be linked to actual attacks, Scotland Yard’s most senior anti-gang officer has said. Commander Jim Stokley said the Metropolitan police had identified legislation that he believes officers could use to tackle the content, which police believe drives much of the violence. “We have been in consultation with the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) and the Home Office around the use of current criminal legislation, particularly under the Serious Crime Act, that could be used to prosecute people who post social media videos that incite violence,” Stokley said in a statement released to the Guardian on Tuesday evening. The news came soon after police figures were released showing that the video site YouTube had deleted just over half of the music videos Scotland Yard had asked it to remove because they incite violence. Stokley said that the inspiration for his approach was that adopted towards terror suspects, whose online incitements do not need to be linked to actual violent acts for police to act. He added: “There are no current cases in which we have tried this approach and our ability to use the legislation in this way will be dependent on the interpretation of the court. As shown by the innovative use of the Modern Slavery Act to prosecute ‘county lines’ drug dealers, the Met is committed to exploring all possible legislative options to target those responsible for offences linked to violent crime.” Should his approach fail, the force would pursue new legislation in consultation with the Home Office, the Times reported. The Met has built up a database of more than 1,400 videos to use as an intelligence tool as the force tries to tackle an increase in killings and other violent crime, with more than 60 murder investigations launched already this year. In the past two years, Scotland Yard has asked YouTube to take down between 50 and 60 music videos, having to prove they incite violence for the requests to be successful. The video-sharing site, owned by Google, has removed more than 30 of the clips which it found to be in violation of its policies. According to the Times, a YouTube spokesman said: “We have developed policies specifically to help tackle videos related to knife crime in the UK and are continuing to work constructively with experts on this issue. “We work with the Metropolitan police, the mayor’s office for policing and crime, the Home Office and community groups to understand this issue and ensure we are able to take action on gang-related content that infringes our community guidelines or breaks the law. “We have a dedicated process for the police to flag videos directly to our teams because we often need specialist context from law enforcement to identify real-life threats. Along with others in the UK, we share the deep concern about this issue and do not want our platform used to incite violence.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/blog/2018/may/30/monaco-grand-prix-f1-lewis-hamilton","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-30T15:58:07Z","webTitle":"Monaco monotony: F1 is in trouble when even the drivers are bored | Paul MacInnes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/may/30/monaco-grand-prix-f1-lewis-hamilton","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2018/may/30/monaco-grand-prix-f1-lewis-hamilton","fields":{"headline":"Monaco monotony: F1 is in trouble when even the drivers are bored","bodyText":"There’s a rule of thumb around talking down the product, a “doing a Ratner” kind of thing, and by God does it apply to sport. Such is the competitive nature of the business, and of the individuals involved, that saying anything remotely critical about an activity in general or a performance more specifically is about as likely as watching a free-to-air Test match. So the aftermath of the Monaco Grand Prix on Sunday was quite something to behold. “This is probably the most boring race ever,” was Fernando Alonso’s considered opinion. “Extremely boring.” Lewis Hamilton began his remarks more cautiously – “It was a super-unexciting race for everyone” – but when a fan hollered his own opinion that it was the “most boring race ever”, Hamilton put his foot down. “Thank God you said it,” he replied. “I thought I was the only one. Wow, it was intensely boring. Oh my God, yes. Forty laps to go, I was like, ‘Oh God, please.’ When it finished, I was like, ‘Thank goodness.’” Reading those remarks back, they look a little odd. It’s a bit like Hamilton has belatedly read the room and realised no one is in the market for a “I think the team did a great job” analysis. Alternatively, it’s how he actually feels and he’s delighted at being given licence to talk about it and he could go on for days. Either way it looks a bit weird. The technical explanation for Sunday’s snoozefest centred on the choice of tyres. Pirelli’s hyper-soft range, as well as sharing the marketing language usually reserved for toilet paper, were the sort that wear down easy. The faster that cars drove on them the quicker they would need changing and that might run the risk of taking more than one pit stop, a potentially catastrophic tactical error. So everyone drove slowly. Hamilton diagnosed another problem with the race, however, and that was Monaco itself. The picturesque principality, so beloved of leathery old men and their unbuttoned lilac shirts, does not have quite the right topography for modern Formula One. But Hamilton has a plan to fix that. “I spoke to Prince Albert the other day and said maybe we should make it longer,” he said. “There are more roads so maybe we can change this great track and make it even better. Or maybe the format should change.” Just chuck that in at the end there, why don’t you. A civil engineering subcommittee of Hamilton and Prince Albert is a prospect that naturally excites. Lewis lives in the principality, of course, and surely knows the streets well, flaneuring around the more obscure routes as he contemplates how little tax he pays. Albert, meanwhile, not only shares Hamilton’s elite sporting credentials (he was unfailingly selected for the Monaco bobsled team in the 80s and 90s whenever the then-heir to the Monégasque throne put his name forward), he also goes by the nickname “the Plugged-in Prince” because of his penchant for electric cars. These two men getting together over a Pschitt! and contemplating optimal traffic flow couldn’t fail to get lap times down by a second or two. “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it” is another phrase used in business and there’s certainly been a lot of fixing in F1 of late. Since Bernie Ecclestone relinquished the steering wheel to Liberty Media last year, the sport has changed its race times to encourage European TV audiences. It has realised women are people too and replaced grid girls with grid kids. It has got a new logo and will even unveil an international theme tune, composed by the bloke who did the score for Iron Man 3. All this could be seen as a certain amount of tinkering around the edges. More systemic problems in the sport are still visible from space. These include the massive financial disparities between teams that, for instance, meant Ferrari, second in the constructors’ championship, took home nearly 10 times the amount in payments from Formula One Management in 2017 than eighth-placed Haas. Then there are the regulations around aerodynamics, which go way over my head but have contrived to create a situation where only three teams have won a race since 2014. One final problem is the tracks themselves: F1’s global expansion by chequebook has occasioned circuits in Azerbaijan, Bahrain and elsewhere that have served up tedious fare regardless of the state of the tyres. All these problems are for the owner to work out and new aerodynamic rules come into effect next year. Perhaps Liberty could also ship Hamilton off to Baku with his planometer and see how he can shake things up. Whatever is planned, it might be best to do it quickly, however. Despite a slight uptick in the UK this year, the long-term trajectory for F1 viewing figures across the world is downwards. So maybe the fixes will come in and F1’s glory days will return. But with Nascar also experiencing a sharp decline, perhaps motorsport is experiencing something more existential. In the real world people still love their cars but they don’t necessarily enjoy driving them. Most journeys are characterised by snarl-ups and that platonic ideal of an empty, winding road is increasingly a myth (I sat in traffic in the Cairngorms last year, go figure). Perhaps the car is losing the romantic association it held in the public imagination for a century. After all, the last thing driving was supposed to be was boring."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"money/2018/jun/02/e-bike-owners-buy-insurance","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-02T06:00:11Z","webTitle":"Should e-bike owners be forced to buy insurance?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/jun/02/e-bike-owners-buy-insurance","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2018/jun/02/e-bike-owners-buy-insurance","fields":{"headline":"Should e-bike owners be forced to buy insurance?","bodyText":"The bike hire shop owner in Cap Ferret, near Bordeaux in France, was rueful as he lent me his new e-bike last summer. “You are going to love it,” he said. “They are so much fun but it won’t last. They will limit the speed, make you wear helmets, show your insurance. Enjoy it for now.” He was right. It was fun (and the only way an out-of-shape holidaymaker could do the 40-mile circuit of Arcachon Bay in an afternoon). He was right about the rules too: this week, in an amendment to the motor insurance directive, the EU said that anybody with an e-bike could soon be cycling illegally unless they have third-party insurance, or a government scheme that will pay out in the event of the rider crashing into someone. Cue predictable headlines about “EU bureaucracy gone mad” (no, I’m not going to link to the Express) and outrage from cycling groups around Europe and MEPs. E-bike sales have boomed in Europe in the past few years – not just because they are fun, but also because they are great for commuting and for older cyclists who need a little “assist” getting up hills. In Holland, at the forefront of cycling in Europe, e-bikes make up one in three of all sales. Irish MEP Brian Hayes called the EU’s restrictions “crazy”, tweeting: “We should be encouraging alternative forms of transport like e-bikes as that will reduce our reliance on cars. E-bikes promote a healthier lifestyle and are more sustainable for our cities.” Insurance will require e-bikes to be registered and maybe even carry number plates. It will stop sales dead in their tracks at the very time we are trying to remove heavily polluting diesels from our streets. Look what happens in cities that make it illegal to cycle without a helmet – almost instantly, cycling rates decline (even if helmets are a good thing). It will be the same if insurance is required. That said, as I hurtled down the Bassin d’Arcachon’s cycle path, a speed camera aimed at cars flashed up that I was exceeding the French 50km/h (33mph) speed limit. It’s easily done on an e-bike. And in Holland, the craze for e-bikes has resulted in a spike in deaths; more people now die on bikes in the Netherlands (206 in 2017) than in cars (201). A quarter of the cyclists who died were on e-bikes, many of them in their 60s – the group most enthusiastic about e-biking. In the UK, 102 cyclists died on the roads in 2016, according to Department for Transport figures. More importantly, for insurance purposes, it is estimated that cyclists are involved in only three pedestrian deaths a year compared with the 300-plus killed by car drivers. Individual registration and insurance of e-bikes is the proverbial hammer to crack a nut. Yet some sort of cover is probably sensible. A levy on the sale of e-bikes could go into a central fund to meet payouts and would probably need to be no more than a few quid. E-bikes are already limited to 15.5mph (the power-assist cuts out when the cycle reaches that speed) and can’t be used by under-14s. They are one of the solutions to our polluted streets and we should be promoting them, not regarding them as an insurance problem."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"film/shortcuts/2018/may/30/danny-dyer-wont-be-having-sex-on-love-island-but-hes-fine-if-dani-dyer-does","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-30T16:44:37Z","webTitle":"Danny Dyer won't be having sex on Love Island – but he's fine if Dani Dyer does","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/shortcuts/2018/may/30/danny-dyer-wont-be-having-sex-on-love-island-but-hes-fine-if-dani-dyer-does","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/shortcuts/2018/may/30/danny-dyer-wont-be-having-sex-on-love-island-but-hes-fine-if-dani-dyer-does","fields":{"headline":"Danny Dyer won't be having sex on Love Island – but he's fine if Dani Dyer does","bodyText":"Name: Dani Dyer Age: 21.

Close: Dani is one of three Dyer offspring with bespoke spellings, along with Sunnie and Arty. Does she suffer from an uncomfortable sense of being Danny Dyer’s face transplanted on to a younger woman’s body? Thankfully, she mostly takes after her mother, but her father has still added more than enough parenting to the mix. Like what? He has permitted her to have sex while she is participating in Love Island. That’s heartwarming. My dad forbade me from having sex on Love Island, and I never forgave him for it. Times have moved on. But don’t panic: Dani says she probably won’t have sex either way. “He said that because he doesn’t want me to worry and wants to put me at ease.” Thank God producers won’t fill the place with booze to help put people at ease. Oh there will be booze. But there is a smoking ban in force this year. ITV had too many complaints. Any complaints about the sex? Nothing but plaudits. In fact, last year’s finale gave ITV2 its highest-ever ratings. It beat BBC1 by nearly a million viewers – and the series won a Bafta. Is everyone else who is taking part the child of an East End TV legend even your mum can do a decent impression of? Only Dani. The rest are the usual personal trainers, dancers, cabin crew and nuclear systems design engineers. Ha ha. No, really. His name is Wes, and he has abs that could double as a fallout shelter. What is Dani Dyer’s job? She’s an aspiring actor. Is aspiring very time-consuming? She is also a barmaid, non-aspiring. But she has reality-TV previous. She was on ITV2’s hot person’s boot camp show Survival of the Fittest, until she dislocated her shoulder during an assault course challenge in South Africa. So we’re in for a lot of Danny impressions. At least from those who weren’t already doing unconscious Danny impressions. It still can’t be more annoying than that guy last year who used to be in Blazin’ Squad talking about how he used to be in Blazin’ Squad all the time, can it? It probably can.

That is the warning to millions of credit card holders from the Royal Bank of Scotland/NatWest group, who are being sent new terms and conditions giving the company the right to “freeze spending” or withdraw it altogether. It says the changes are designed to help customers avoid long-term credit card debt. But one Guardian Money reader tells us that, in her opinion, the leaflets could “cause massive stress” to some. So why is the bank clamping down – and is it a good or bad thing? It says the move is in line with industry-wide new rules introduced by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) designed to help people in “persistent debt”. That means RBS is unlikely to be alone in sending out such warnings. The new terms and conditions, state that if a customer pays more in interest and charges than other amounts owed (ie, purchases, balance transfers, advances etc) over two 18-month periods in a row, “we may freeze spending on your card account”. It says this will be done “to help you focus on starting to reduce your outstanding debt”. It adds that a customer will always be alerted before this happens, and an account would only be frozen or withdrawn “if you’re unable or unwilling to reduce the amount you owe”. These changes took effect from 21 May. RBS/NatWest tells us: “We want to help customers pay off their debts” and the changes “will help us to be able to do that”. However, the card holder who contacted us says: “The wording on the pamphlet is designed to read as though the bank is helping me, the customer. But it rang serious alarm bells as I considered the implications of what I can only describe as a ‘threat’... RBS appears to be saying that those of us who have used the 0% balance transfers and who are either paying the minimum, or even a higher amount, will now be penalised.” Meanwhile, one credit card industry expert told Money that the aim of this sort of measure was about “protecting the customer ... so people can’t rack up more debt if they are not managing to pay off the debt they already have”. Some card holders may take the view that they are managing their finances perfectly well and do not need protecting from themselves, particularly if that protection is going to take the form of the card company threatening to pull the plug on their plastic, potentially leaving them high and dry at the supermarket checkout or on holiday. RBS says the changes reflect the new FCA rules, introduced on 1 March this year but which do not fully take effect until 1 September. They will force credit card providers to take a series of steps to help customers who have got into a long-term habit of only making the minimum payment each month – something that can often mask underlying financial difficulties. The regulator says action is needed because more than 3 million UK credit card holders are in persistent debt, typically handing over about £2.50 in interest and charges for every £1 they repay. Only making the minimum payment can prove hugely costly in the long run. The FCA says someone who borrows £3,000 on a card with an interest rate of 19% APR and only makes the minimum payment – starting at £74 a month and gradually reducing over time – would typically take 27 years and seven months to clear the debt (assuming there was no further spending), and would end up paying £4,192 in interest. It comes amid this week’s clampdown on high-cost credit by the FCA, following an 18-month review into bank overdrafts, doorstep loans, catalogue credit and rent-to-own borrowing. It proposed a price cap in the rent-to-own sector, but stepped back from ordering price caps on overdrafts."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jul/14/where-to-move-for-affordable-rents","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-07-14T07:00:33Z","webTitle":"Where to move for… affordable rents","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jul/14/where-to-move-for-affordable-rents","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jul/14/where-to-move-for-affordable-rents","fields":{"headline":"Where to move for… affordable rents","bodyText":"I think we can all agree where not to move.

However, it’s one where the solution lies primarily with Norman and his boss. In an interview with the Independent, Norman said he worried cycling in the capital was too much the preserve of white, middle-class men. Many might agree. But what Norman omits is that this isn’t down to the cyclists – it’s a direct product of the streets they are forced to use. The evidence from around the world shows that the more safe and reassuring the road infrastructure is for bikes, the greater the variety of cyclists. In the Netherlands, for example, a slightly higher proportion of women cycle than men. In Odense, which styles itself as Denmark’s most bike-friendly city, 81% of children ride to school, generally without their parents. These are places that have spent 40 years making streets more amenable to human beings. In contrast, London remains a largely feral and hostile environment for cyclists, despite the arrival of a handful of so-called cycle superhighways. It is a road culture that emphasises speed and assertiveness, and this tends to put off many but the most gung-ho, enthusiast riders, who tend to be drawn from a smaller demographic pool. The solution is clear – safer cycling streets. Unfortunately, Norman and Khan aren’t exactly rushing ahead with this. Khan promised before his election in 2016 to transform cycling, but he and Norman have become mired in endless delays and consultation, seeking to assuage a minority of critics who will never be convinced. It is, as one exasperated campaigner notes, as if Joseph Bazalgette had been stopped from building his sewers for a two-year consultation on whether separating drinking water from sewage was a good idea. Norman is enthusiastic and keen, and no one can expect he and Khan to transform London overnight. But equally, it needs to be pointed out that their own lack of boldness is exacerbating the very male problem Norman complains about."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"society/2018/may/30/faith-based-groups-increasingly-stepping-in-plug-gaps-nhs","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-30T14:54:19Z","webTitle":"Faith-based groups 'increasingly stepping in to plug gaps in NHS'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/may/30/faith-based-groups-increasingly-stepping-in-plug-gaps-nhs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/may/30/faith-based-groups-increasingly-stepping-in-plug-gaps-nhs","fields":{"headline":"Faith-based groups 'increasingly stepping in to plug gaps in NHS'","bodyText":"Faith-based organisations are increasingly stepping in to support the overstretched NHS, research has found. More than 3,500 churches and 200,000 volunteers are working on health and social care initiatives that are “plugging the gap” left by funding cuts and limited resources, according to the Cinnamon Network, a charity that connects faith-based organisations. Sarah Mullally, the new bishop of London, said the charity’s report – called The Church’s Impact on Health and Care – showed the important contribution being made by the voluntary sector and specifically the church to promote health. She said: “The NHS is under considerable pressure: increasing public expectation, increasing life expectancy, improvements in technology and limited resources. If we are able to improve our health and the health of the community, [the church] can contribute to the better use of those limited resources.” The Cinnamon Network studied 32 church-led initiatives and identified how they tackle issues including mental health, obesity and social isolation. David Simmons, who conducted the research, said the projects should be appealing to the NHS as they are so cost-effective. Research from 2016 estimated the value of the time given by UK church and faith groups to their communities each year to be £3bn. Simmons said: “The potential is enormous and the work of these projects enables doctors and nurses to focus on their job. Most healthcare professionals I spoke to during the research were really glad that church groupsare really stepping up.” Parish nursing is one of the projects highlighted by the report: registered nurses – some of whom are retired while others do it alongside working for the NHS – are recruited by churches on either a voluntary or paid basis to provide support to patients in their area. James Morrow, a GP and managing partner of Granta Medical Practices in Cambridgeshire, said the parish nurse who worked with his GP practice was an invaluable addition to the team. He said: “It’s clear that the NHS is being asked and expected to deliver things far beyond what it was expected to deliver 70 years ago, partly because care is being moved out of hospitals into the community, many more people are living longer and more people are living with chronic conditions. As a practice we really welcome voluntary organisations and the local community coming up with solutions.“Our parish nurse has the ability to provide time and space in a non task-oriented way when so much of the health service is about productivity, measurables and deliverables. That doesn’t match to what people frequently need. She has the freedom to sit, engage and talk and can also act as an advocate for them. Parish nursing is everything we think community-based healthcare should be about.” While the concept is popular in other countries, with 15,000 parish nurses globally, the most being located in the US where it was founded, it only came to the UK when a small pilot was launched in 2005. Ros Moore, the chief executive of Parish Nursing, said the discrepancy was because the UK had a “very well developed” health service and the church’s role in healthcare had diminished since the launch of the NHS 70 years ago. There are more than 100 nurses working with 85 churches across the UK and another 100 are expected to be established within the next 18 months, which Moore says highlights a growing need. She said: “Parish nursing is doing what the NHS would like to do but doesn’t have the capacity to any more.” While the initiative was not a silver bullet for the supply and demand issues of the NHS, she said, the health service “knows it can’t do everything that it used to do in the past”. “District and practice nurses do a fantastic job but they have plenty to do,” she said. “Parish nurses are not here to replace them but they do more preventative care, support and monitoring of people who have been ill, which to be honest the NHS doesn’t do a lot of now. That’s just how it is.” Ruth McDonald, a parish nurse in Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria, does the job alongside temporary nursing work. She said that while some of the patients she worked with were members of the church, most were not. She said: “I have a real mixture of patients. I see people from many faiths or none. It’s not a barrier these days, especially as the church is now known for food banks, which are accessed by anyone. I think people are becoming much more accepting of what the church can offer.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"social-care-network/2018/jun/05/social-work-el-salvador-gangs-murder-rate","type":"article","sectionId":"social-care-network","sectionName":"Social Care Network","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-05T11:19:13Z","webTitle":"Social work in El Salvador: 'We either do something – or let the children be killed' | Rory Truell","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2018/jun/05/social-work-el-salvador-gangs-murder-rate","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/social-care-network/2018/jun/05/social-work-el-salvador-gangs-murder-rate","fields":{"headline":"Social work in El Salvador: 'We either do something – or let the children be killed'","bodyText":"In a country with the world’s largest gang problem and the highest murder rate, El Salvador is not an easy place to practise social work. Tens of thousands of children have been abandoned, abused, trafficked, organ harvested, and denied access to health or education services. The social context dates back to the civil war, which ended 25 years ago and caused large numbers of people to abandon their homes and flee violence and poverty. During the war, many children were forced to become child soldiers, the legacy of which is still felt in the country today. Despite the immense dangers, social workers in El Salvador are facing up to the problems. They work in communities the police are too afraid to enter. They put their lives at risk every day, negotiating with gang leaders to access children who are abused and desperate. “There is no choice,” one social worker told me. “We either do something or let the children lead a terrible life of exploitation until they are killed.” In May, I had the opportunity to visit a social work-led agency in the capital city, San Salvador: the Salvadoran Institute for the Integral Development of Children and Adolescents. Over the last four years, social workers have transformed an agency that used to offer aid and help, but ignored the root causes of social problems. Now they offer a range of programmes that connect children to their birth families and provide guidance for families on their social and economic development and wellbeing. “Often, we have to provide temporary care with the extended families of the children while we support the parents on how to gain control over their lives,” a social worker explained. The institute offers community therapy, which provides people with a safe space to talk about themselves and the problems in their community – and how to resolve them. Social workers facilitate the process, ensuring all participants are respected, respectful and learning and contributing. They also offer programmes to support traumatised teenagers, but acknowledging the young person’s right to self-determination, the programme is only offered to those who want to partake. In addition, they offer education, vocational training and special programmes to help people take control of their lives. “In these programmes we get people to talk,” a social worker explained. “We have a saying here: ‘When the mouth stops talking, the body gets sick’. “We focus on change, we focus on transformation – not just for the children, for their whole communities.” The social workers at the institute are mostly women in their 40s, 50s or 60s. They are deeply compassionate and possess a wealth of human experience. During their long working lives, they have encountered every kind of social injury – and forged a career in seeing and supporting the strength in everyone. Their manner, calm and confident, reveals skill and humility. It normally takes a lifetime to attain such wisdom; yet all of this is accelerated in social workers who have learned to respond to prolonged trauma, deal with their own sense of responsibility, and master their craft. Out of the sheer terror of war and poverty, absolute beauty grows.

When Caruana Galizia was killed by a car bomb in October 2017, she was fighting 47 civil and criminal defamation lawsuits from an array of business people and politicians, brought by multiple law firms. In the months before her death, the anti-corruption journalist received letters from the London office of the blue-chip firm Mishcon de Reya, which specialises in bringing defamation cases. Mishcon had been hired to defend the reputation of a client doing business in Malta. “The firm sought to cripple her financially with libel action in UK courts,” Caruana Galizia’s three sons claim in a letter to the writers’ campaign group English PEN and seen by the Guardian. “Had our mother not been murdered, they would have succeeded.” The case highlights what appears to be a trend: the use of London law firms by wealthy individuals and corporations to threaten foreign reporters with libel action in the UK, rather than in their home country. It has triggered a debate at English PEN, which in December appointed Mishcon’s deputy chairman, Anthony Julius, to its board of trustees. The organisation’s mission is to defend writers and freedom of speech. PEN has been campaigning for justice for Caruana Galizia. It marked the six months since her death with a letter to the European commission calling for better protections for whistleblowers and journalists, and condemning Malta’s prime minister for bringing a libel case against Caruana Galizia’s son Matthew. The family have urged PEN to reconsider its decision to make Julius a trustee. One of Britain’s best known lawyers, he advised Diana, Princess of Wales, during her divorce and specialises in resolving disputes for ultra-wealthy families. In their letter, the sons claim: “The campaign for justice in our mother’s case cannot be disentangled from the abuse that she suffered at the hands of Mishcon de Reya’s lawyers. “The reputational damage to English PEN is only going to get worse for as long as [Julius] is there and his firm continues to harass and intimidate journalists.” Both PEN and Julius have made it clear that he will remain on the board. Julius said he believed a Mishcon lawyer could be a trustee of PEN. He has not been asked to step down. PEN said it would stop campaigning on Caruana Galizia’s case for the time being, because her family had withdrawn their cooperation in protest at Julius’s presence on the board. The PEN director, Antonia Byatt, has ordered a review of how the organisation works with lawyers. A working group of trustees, including the Guardian associate editor, culture, Claire Armitstead, will devise a policy on the question. The working group will not include the two lawyers on the PEN board or its president, Philippe Sands QC. PEN also plans to interview journalists and bloggers about their experiences with London libel firms. In a statement published on Thursday, PEN said it was aware that libel threats remained a problem for investigative journalists. “We are therefore consulting with journalists – particularly those operating independently – on how the current law operates in practice.” The Running Commentary blog, where Caruana Galizia published revelations that continue to rock her country’s political establishment, drew most of its readers from within Malta. Mishcon was acting on behalf of the golden passports agent Henley and Partners, which has a contract with the Maltese government to market citizenship to wealthy investors. Mishcon wrote to Caruana Galizia more than once in 2017 asking her to remove what it said were defamatory articles and reader comments, and factual inaccuracies about Henley. Its letters make reference to British courts, stating, for example, that failure to take down material “will leave our client with little choice but to take legal action against you in the court of England and Wales”. Mishcon said that under EU law, a complainant could bring defamation proceedings either in the state where the publisher was based, which allowed them to claim for damages to their reputation worldwide, or in any EU state where damage was suffered, in which case the payout only related to harm caused in that country. The firm said that after she received their letter, Caruana Galizia had made corrections to her blog. Henley said it was a British company, with its largest office in London. It had not sued Caruana Galizia, but politely asked her to remove material, and had a right to object to “fake news” and “defamatory insinuations”. Caruana Galizia’s sons said they were prompted to complain to PEN on 6 May after Mishcon made another threat of UK court action, on behalf of a different client, against the newspaper Malta Today. The request to take down the article or face a claim in Britain prompted a furious reaction from the editor of Malta Today. “British law firms have a reputation for muscling in on journalists and silencing critics with the threat of ruinous court action,” Matthew Vella claimed. He described the case as a Slapp threat, an allegation which Mishcon rejects. Slapp stands for Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation, a term for often baseless claims which aim to silence free speech and debate about issues of public interest by forcing critics to spend money defending themselves. America has strong anti-Slapp laws, but the concept does not exist in the UK. The European Union is being urged by some MEPs to introduce anti-Slapp legislation. Mishcon claimed Malta Today had written a defamatory article without giving its client a chance to respond before publication. The firm said its response was proportionate, and was neither a jurisdictional threat nor a Slapp. Vella said jurisdictional threats were being used to “condition” Maltese journalism, and that his paper has separately been threatened with UK court action by a Lebanese energy giant, a British biotech entrepreneur and a UK company with interests in football and shipping. “If the Maltese courts uphold decisions delivered in a UK court on defamation actions, the consequences for the free press and Maltese democracy would be disastrous,” Vella claimed. Such cases could be seen as a “jurisdictional tactic to silence the press without trial”, according to the academic Justin Borg-Barthet, who said the cost of defending suits was often enough to force small media houses to redact or remove articles. Borg-Barthet, who is from Malta and lectures in the school of law at the University of Aberdeen, said a revision of EU law on jurisdiction in libel cases was urgently required to protect press freedoms."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/jun/02/new-york-remaining-independent-bookshops-booksellers-ungar-bohbot","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-02T17:00:24Z","webTitle":"A story of survival: New York’s last remaining independent bookshops","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jun/02/new-york-remaining-independent-bookshops-booksellers-ungar-bohbot","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/jun/02/new-york-remaining-independent-bookshops-booksellers-ungar-bohbot","fields":{"headline":"A story of survival: New York’s last remaining independent bookshops","bodyText":"Years ago, a friend invited me to something called Brazenhead Books, only she didn’t call it that. She, like everyone else, called it “the secret bookstore”. Except it wasn’t a bookshop so much as a small apartment on Manhattan’s Upper East Side, deliriously overstuffed with paperbacks and presided over by a bearded guy named Michael Seidenberg. On certain nights Seidenberg, who exudes a maverick ingenuousness, might open up his treasure cave for late-night salons where a bottle of whiskey is generally understood to be the entrance fee. Perhaps a couple of books will be exchanged for a few dollars (I once bought a bright green, 1969 first edition of Renata Adler’s Toward a Radical Middle from him for about five bucks) but sales aren’t really the point. In a city like New York, a place increasingly beholden to money, it’s good to be reminded that there are other forms of currency. Not just the civility of a bottle of bourbon, but those other, priceless currencies, too, the ones that New Yorkers don’t like to invoke because they all sound embarrassingly earnest: community, human connection and the preservation of knowledge and ideas. Seidenberg, pictured kingly in his throne of a wicker chair, feet spread, pipe in mouth, is one of around 50 New York indie booksellers featured in a series of portraits by Philippe Ungar and Franck Bohbot, a pair of bibliophilic Frenchmen who met and befriended each other in Brooklyn. The two, writer and photographer respectively, have taken great pleasure in travelling across the city, to neighbourhoods in every borough, to meet and photograph booksellers in their habitats. Despite their diversity, the way their distinct personalities and passions are reflected and amplified in their shops, they are all, says Ungar, “looking for the same thing – a generous vision of sharing culture”. Ungar mentions Corey Farach, owner of the scruffy, adored and longstanding feminist bookshop Bluestockings. Farach, as Ungar recounts with admiration, encourages those people who can’t afford to buy a $40 book to take a seat, make themselves comfortable, and just read it in the shop. “That is to me,” says Ungar, “the spirit of the indie booksellers.” Because, as he sees it, “a bookstore is much more than a bookstore, it’s much more than selling books. It’s a public shelter. Whoever you are, you don’t have to buy anything, they won’t ask you for your ID. You’re free – you can stay for hours and browse. There’s a generosity, an optimism. And that’s what we wanted to enhance.” In this way, indie bookshops are outposts of idealism. And if they seem like the most romantic places in the city, it might be down to this – to the way their owners and customers (although “guests”, frankly, seems a more appropriate term) might all be engaged in the same project, a kind of sanctuary building in the unsheltered world. No one is getting rich from indie bookselling, yet everyone Ungar and Bohbot spoke to professed contentment. “Everyone,” Ungar stresses. “Every bookseller says: ‘I’m happy.’” He mentions Bonnie Slotnick, who runs Bonnie Slotnick Cookbooks in the East Village, a small space crammed with vintage titles. Slotnick acknowledged to Ungar that she was not doing something vital, at least not in the way most people understand it. She was not a soldier or a doctor or a scientist curing disease. And yet she thought there was a place in the world for people who are just making other people happy. “They are heroes of their neighbourhood, monuments of their neighbourhood,” declares Bohbot, who sought to shoot them accordingly, with dramatic, dimmed lighting and cinematic composition in which the subject is alone, surrounded by their books. Often, there’s a poignancy to this heroism; the photos are haunted with a question: how much longer can they last? New York, a city unsentimental about its past, endlessly, relentlessly revises itself. That extends to its bookshops, many of which have fallen to astronomically rising rents. St Mark’s Bookshop, for example, which opened in 1977 and became a sort of literary HQ for punks, was the oldest independent bookshop in Manhattan until it closed in 2016, despite celebrity support from Patti Smith and Salman Rushdie. Three Lives &amp; Company, an extremely charming West Village shop run by Toby Cox, a gentle, stooped guy in a knit hat, looked to go the same way as St Mark’s but narrowly escaped closure in 2016 after an upswell of neighbourhood support. Oliver’s Realty Group, which owns the building, provided a statement in a letter Cox sent out to his customers: “We know how beloved Three Lives is in the West Village and we’re thrilled to provide it with stability.” Like actual endangered species, independent bookshops induce a fiercely protective kind of love; paradoxically, it’s often their precarity that saves them. Bohbot says he wants people to view his images and feel “we don’t know which year we are – we don’t know if it’s the future or the past”. He adds: “I want to stop time - I’m trying to keep them for ever, in this photo.” Like a bookshop, then, it’s an act of preservation.

The ground flora and insect life has become more diverse with every passing year, but the most conspicuous beneficiary has been a single tree, an old bird cherry (Prunus padus). It stands in what was a small clearing in the pines, now flooded with sunlight after decades in the shade. This morning its 40ft dome of white blossom stood before us, with a blackcap singing from within. This tree supports an extraordinary abundance of life. Red pouch galls caused by a mite, Phyllocoptes eupadi, have erupted from upper surfaces of foliage on its reinvigorated shoots. Below, its leaves are infested with vast numbers of bird cherry aphids. Swarms of hoverflies settle on flowers to feed on pollen or to lay eggs among the aphids that the hatching larvae will soon consume. Spiders lurk amid the flowers, with snares well stocked with insect prey. Scarlet soldier beetles hunt among the inflorescences. But it took a long search to find the insect we had expected to find in abundance; caterpillars of the small ermine moth. They spin a tent of tough silk that encloses leaves and flowers along a twig and then feed within, protected from foraging birds like tits and warblers and from parasitic ichneumon wasps. Eventually we found a single colony. In some years armies of these small grey caterpillars defoliate a whole tree, enclosing every bare shoot and branch in what appears to be, from a distance, a shimmering silk stocking. I have occasionally seen lengths of hedgerow sheathed in their ghostly white shrouds, but for this tree at least this does not seem to be a small ermine summer. These moths often go through boom-and-bust breeding cycles, so host trees have a chance to recover from periodic setbacks. Bird cherries growing in open hedgerows always produce a glorious floral display, in spite of this burden of invertebrate herbivores. This particular specimen, now thriving in its place in the sun at last, was a wondrous sight."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/may/31/truth-about-only-children-insular-confident-worry","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-31T05:00:12Z","webTitle":"The truth about only children: are they more insular and confident?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/31/truth-about-only-children-insular-confident-worry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/31/truth-about-only-children-insular-confident-worry","fields":{"headline":"The truth about only children: are they more insular and confident?","bodyText":"Nineteenth-century psychologists, it seems fair to say, did not always approve of only children. It was G Stanley Hall, the American psychologist, who claimed being a lone child was “a disease in itself”. Soon afterwards, another psychologist called Eugene W Bohannon offered a devastating analysis of the only child. They were “less venturesome” and “oversensitive”; prone to “priggish self-conceit”. An only boy was likely to be “effeminate, both because he associates too little with boys and too much with the mother”. Bohannon did concede that only children were imaginative, though he put this down to “a lack of companionship” and besides, he pointed out, such talents could well be used for “the practice of deception and lying”. Such stereotypes about spoiled, lonely and peculiar only children have endured for more than a century, despite a wealth of research showing lone children are usually none of those things and often do better in many areas than children with siblings. But despite one-child families becoming far more common, our fascination with their implied unusualness endures. This week, the actor and model Elizabeth Hurley – who has a 16-year-old son, Damian – offered her own take on the issue, saying her one regret was not having more than one child. “I was one of three, a big sister and a little brother to squabble with and to love,” she said in an interview with Grazia. “Damian doesn’t have that. They’re very different, single children, more insular but very at ease with themselves, very self-possessed, focused.” According to the Office for National Statistics, in 2017 55% of lone-parent families had just one dependent child, as did 51% of cohabiting parents. Among married couples, which make up the biggest family type, 40% had a single child. These figures aren’t perfect – they don’t account for older children who have left home, or for families who plan to have more children – but they do show that the trend for smaller families is becoming the norm. There are obvious reasons for this. Often it isn’t due to a choice to stick with one child – or it doesn’t feel like a choice. Delayed parenthood, fertility problems, relationship breakdowns and financial pressures including housing and childcare costs can all result in a single-child family. But at the same time, evidence is mounting to show a one-child family can be a positive choice for both parents and child. So-called “only child syndrome” – used to describe a spoilt, odd and “lonely only” – has largely been debunked as a myth. “In China there has been quite a lot of interest in what might be the effects of having a whole nation growing up [in one-child families],” says Claire Hughes, a professor of developmental psychology and the deputy director of the Centre for Family Research at the University of Cambridge. With so much parental and family focus on one child, “the potential for them to be very egocentric is there, but actually, when people have looked, they haven’t really found it”. Much of the only-child myth-debunking has been done by Toni Falbo, a professor of educational psychology at the University of Texas, who has researched only children since the 1970s. In one meta-analysis of studies, with Denise Polit, the pair found that “across all developmental outcomes, only children were indistinguishable from firstborns and people from small families” and did better than children from large families. As for being awkward and antisocial, one study from 2011 found that while adults who had been only children engaged in fewer social activities with relatives (which may possibly be explained by having fewer relatives to begin with), they found no difference in the number of social engagements with others, such as friends and colleagues. A survey of more than 2,500 Spanish teenagers found only children experienced higher rates of peer victimisation, but Hughes points out this may be affected by their perception of victimisation: “To some extent, siblings really teach you how to take the rough with the smooth.” A study last year, by Southwest University in Chongqing, China, on more than 250 college-aged students, suggested only children were more flexible in their thinking, and therefore more creative, though showed “lower agreeableness”. The clinical psychologist Linda Blair, author of the book Birth Order, says there can be huge benefits to this family structure, as parents can focus all their time and energy on an only child, “and also continue to have your own life. That means, in terms of the child’s point of view, you make growing up look pretty interesting.” In previous generations, being an only child “didn’t used to be so good for two reasons. One was that parents usually couldn’t have another child – it wasn’t because they chose not to – and the problem was that then they overprotected the child. The other reason was only children were in the vast minority, so they often felt bullied and left out. But nowadays, this is a positive choice for a lot of parents so the kid feels not that unusual and also they don’t feel overprotected, they just feel valued.” There are also downsides, Blair says. “One is that, even with the best efforts of parents to get their child to spend lots of time with kids their own age, they often feel a little bit awkward.” This is partly because these encounters usually happen in a supervised setting – nursery, or school, for instance. “So you don’t get the ease of street smarts that kids learn when they have siblings – not to get your Lego knocked over, not to get beaten up.” Children with siblings “learn to read other kids more quickly and easily. It still comes with single children, but it’s just not quite the same.” Blair advises going on holidays with other families with children of similar ages: “That’s the nearest you’ll get to a situation like siblings.” Another problem, she says, is that an only child’s home life, ruled by adults, will usually be ordered and relatively calm. “If I see an issue of control, a problem of really being upset when things go wrong, that’s often [displayed by] an only child because they are used to things not being too chaotic. The thing you do about that is be a little bit easy and slack and let things get a little chaotic as parents. Allow a little bit of chaos, just as would happen if you had three or four kids.” But she adds that she doesn’t think there are any serious problems at all in being an only child. What may be great for a young child or teenager – having more resources, more attention – doesn’t necessarily hold true when that child is an adult, dealing with ageing parents and, eventually, being alone, with nobody who remembers the idiosyncrasies of your family or who shared your childhood. Although this assumes that most people have a reasonable relationship with their adult siblings. For every only child who remembers a lonely childhood there will be others who were traumatised by a bullying brother or sister. Hughes says it is not the number of siblings that is important, but the quality of the relationships. “There is no guarantee if you had a second child that your children are going to get on beautifully. I personally think that having a sibling is an amazing thing, but I wouldn’t want people who have one child, and don’t think they’re going to be able to have a second, to feel their child is inevitably going to lose out.” As for the perfect family size, says Blair, there is no such thing. “The perfect family, if you want the most psychologically well-adjusted children, is the number of children you have, because if you love them, they will be happy.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"cities/2018/jul/05/meet-the-numtots-the-millennials-who-find-fixing-public-transit-sexy-urbanist-memes","type":"article","sectionId":"cities","sectionName":"Cities","webPublicationDate":"2018-07-05T06:15:23Z","webTitle":"Meet the Numtots: the millennials who find fixing public transport sexy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/jul/05/meet-the-numtots-the-millennials-who-find-fixing-public-transit-sexy-urbanist-memes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/cities/2018/jul/05/meet-the-numtots-the-millennials-who-find-fixing-public-transit-sexy-urbanist-memes","fields":{"headline":"Meet the Numtots: the millennials who find fixing public transport sexy","bodyText":"The year is 2025. There are no cars, only public transport and bicycles. Four-lane highways have been replaced by bike paths. Pedestrians share the pavements with cyclists. The air is clean (because the buses are electric), and the living is easy. This is the future the Numtots want. Predominantly millennials with a passion for public transport, urban planning and internet humour, Numtots’ interests intersect in New Urbanist Memes for Transit-Oriented Teens, the Facebook group from which they derive their nickname. There, nearly 100,000 of them discuss and debate their perfect city, or transit lines in their area, or perpendicular traffic flow and improvisational vehicle pathing. “Yeah sex is cool, but have you ever fantasised about an infrastructure renewal program funded by the taxes of billionaires?” is a representative Numtot fantasy. (Someone responded with a gif of Homer Simpson drooling.) Numtots – or just ’tots – are the sorts of older teens through to thirtysomethings who identify as being “irrationally excited” for the forthcoming Maryland purple line; who claim their first word as a child was “bus” (“I think I was destined to become a Numtot ...”); who stridently propose ideas for “what the Amtrak system should look like” (“Fight me if you don’t like it”); and who mercilessly make fun of Richard Florida’s leather jacket. It is achingly millennial, no doubt, often ironic and sometimes silly – but it is also hard to argue with their vision, half-jokingly articulated as “peak transit”: a city that functions for everyone, exactly as it should. There are dedicated meme pages on Facebook for just about every niche interest, but this one stands out for its members’ levels of engagement and even earnestness. Jokey memes about future cities run solely on public transport spark heated discussion below the line about whether it is ableist to imagine a world entirely without cars. Numtots’ guiding principles are broadly summed up by the page’s URL: “What would Jane Jacobs do?” The group was co-founded by Juliet Eldred and Emily Orenstein, both students at the University of Chicago, with Jonathan Marty of New York University following a heated disagreement with strangers on the internet about – of all things – the National Interstate and Defense Highways Act of 1956. “We were getting upset at them because we were saying we didn’t want them to glorify car culture,” says Marty, 21. “That led to a conversation: ‘someone should make a new urbanism meme group’.” That was in March; membership has since ballooned to more than 95,000 members, with about 300 posts made every day. Did Marty and his co-founders have any inkling of the response? “Frankly, no,” he says. “I don’t think any of us understood quite how mainstream these issues are – though maybe they’re not.” The founding joke of Numtots was that these ideas and issues are almost ludicrously niche while memes are, in essence, relatable, expressing something so instantly recognisable you’d feel moved to tag a friend. The combination of the two results in memes such as one that says: “bicyclists can do whatever the fuck they want. Rules are for cars”. “We pride ourselves on being interested in these issues, and making lowbrow jokes about complex urban planning processes,” says Marty, adding that it is, perhaps counterintuitively, a perfect union of medium and message. “Memes are the first major form of media that people my age have created, and kind of own.” The enthusiastic response to the group – and the Generation Y-led “yimby” movement for high-density housing it dovetails with – suggests there may be something fundamentally millennial about urbanism. “I think at first people were really excited that they had a place to talk about living in cities,” says Orenstein, also 21. “But as the group has picked up steam, more people are joining that weren’t interested in the issues but are finding that maybe, actually, they are.” It makes sense: improving public transport, transitioning to renewable energy and investing in future-focused infrastructure are not often vote winners, being costly and slow to enact – but young people have more of a stake in seeing them put into action. “A lot of young people live in cities, plan to move to cities, grew up in cities,” says Marty. “If you live in a city, you’re already an urbanist. You’re around trains and buses; you think about planning and zoning and gentrification.” He singles out an aversion to cars as being an especially “millennial thing”; like many Numtots, he himself does not drive. Gen Y is often tagged as being disengaged, with “youth voter turnout” spoken of as though a white whale by politicians. But research has shown millennials to be highly engaged in specific issues such as climate change, inequality and housing affordability – all of which are intersected by urbanism. Similarly, the most recent Millennial Impact Report found that in the US they were more driven to engage locally than they were nationally, in part, Orenstein suggests, because it is possible to have a greater impact that way under President Trump: “I think that’s part of it – municipal politics seems easier to salvage.” Certainly, the Numtots discourse does nothing to challenge the characterisation of millennials as leftwing and socially progressive, though Orenstein reports an uptick in “market urbanist types” following coverage on CityLab: “That changed the content of group discussions a bit.” While members agree there is a housing affordability crisis, there is contention over how to solve it, she says. But Marty welcomes the different perspectives and opinions brought together by the group, which, he says, has representation from major cities on every continent (“except Antarctica”). “I feel like I learn a lot, just in a comparative way,” he says. “It expands your understanding of what cities are, and makes you less myopic.” The network of information-sharing – on public transport systems, gentrification, what works and doesn’t in global cities – has been inspiring, he says: “That was never the intention, the intention was to make silly jokes – but it’s morphed into this thing where people feel inspired by the group, directly or indirectly, to go into urban planning and policy.” Lest the memes get lost in the debate, the final entry in the board’s rules post – dubbed the “Numtot constitution” – serves as a reminder: “Though there’s frequently intense discussions in here on high-stakes, high-impact issues, please remember that at the end of the day, this is a meme group about trains.” Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/jun/01/the-1975-chvrches-years-and-years-the-sleeperbloke-is-back","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-01T12:00:49Z","webTitle":"The 1975, Chvrches, Years & Years: the Sleeperbloke is back","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jun/01/the-1975-chvrches-years-and-years-the-sleeperbloke-is-back","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/jun/01/the-1975-chvrches-years-and-years-the-sleeperbloke-is-back","fields":{"headline":"The 1975, Chvrches, Years & Years: the Sleeperbloke is back","bodyText":"In the 1990s, when journalists could be mean to bands without the fear of being “cancelled” by their fans on Twitter, the term Sleeperblokes was invented, to refer to those anonymous men who stand at the back of bands, inspired by Sleeper and their frontwoman Louise Wener. Incredibly, the band took it quite well and even sold Sleeperbloke T-shirts. Now, in 2018, Sleeperblokes are everywhere. Bastille’s new single Quarter Past Midnight came out last month, but could you recognise the band if they didn’t have high-haired Dan Smith standing in front of them? Chvrches’ Iain Cook and Martin Doherty get all of seven seconds’ screen time (compared to Lauren Mayberry’s three minutes) in their recent video for Miracle. And did you know the George in AlunaGeorge is a real person? Or that Lion Babe isn’t just Jillian Hervey, but also a man called (*checks Wikipedia*) Lucas Goodman? Sometimes, members take a blissful, intentional step back into anonymity. While Years &amp; Years frontman Olly Alexander bears his soul in interviews to promote upcoming album Palo Santo, the band’s Mikey Goldsworthy and Emre Türkmen can do the weekly shop without getting asked for a selfie down the loo-roll aisle. The 1975’s “other” members don’t even have to speak in interviews ahead of this month’s album Music for Cars. Band spokesperson Matty Healy works the press while the rest of the lads knock off early and get home in time for Hollyoaks. Not for one second is anyone saying that Sleeperblokes aren’t essential parts of a band’s success. In many cases, it would be hard for these aforementioned frontpeople to scale the charts without the heft of the band’s established brand behind them (although The Lauren Mayberry EP feels oddly inevitable in a not-so-distant future). But the key shift is the necessity of being in a band in order to “prove” musical authenticity. It no longer exists as it once did. Instead, an artist needs an interesting story and something to say about social issues to confirm that, yes, Trump is indeed bad. Back in the days of the NME, bands used to need serious-faced members who would confirm that it really is “all about the music”. In 2018, those magazines aren’t around any more and frontpeople have stepped forward. In the modern day, when fame is toxic and fans can hack into pop star iClouds, being an anonymous Sleeperbloke seems like the best career move. You get paid to play gigs and festivals, then slip off into the crowd looking like every other bloke queuing for a warm Tuborg. They don’t even need to do “outspoken” interviews in which they’re castrated online for holding vague opinions on feminism. Maybe the much-mocked Sleeperblokes were actually the winners this entire time."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2018/may/30/irish-pm-apologises-to-126-people-illegally-adopted-decades-ago","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-30T16:24:34Z","webTitle":"Irish PM apologises to 126 people illegally adopted decades ago","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/30/irish-pm-apologises-to-126-people-illegally-adopted-decades-ago","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/30/irish-pm-apologises-to-126-people-illegally-adopted-decades-ago","fields":{"headline":"Irish PM apologises to 126 people illegally adopted decades ago","bodyText":"The Irish prime minister has apologised in parliament to 126 people who were illegally adopted between 1946 and 1969, saying the disclosures were “another chapter from the very dark history of our country”. As campaigners said the number quoted was likely to be the tip of the iceberg, Leo Varadkar said: “What was done was wrong. What was done robbed children, our fellow citizens, of their identity. It was an historic wrong that we must face up to – and again, on behalf of the government, I’m very sorry for it.” The taoiseach’s apology followed a government statement revealing that 126 births were illegally registered by St Patrick’s Guild, a Catholic adoption agency. Those affected, now in their 50s, 60s and 70s, may not know they were adopted. The government launched an independent review and said the records of the other adoption societies would be reviewed. “This is potentially very traumatic for a lot of people and I am so sorry for it,” Varadkar told the Dáil. His apology came just days after Ireland voted by a landslide to repeal a clause in the constitution underpinning a near-total ban on abortion in a sign of the waning moral authority of the Catholic church. At a press conference on Wednesday Varadkar said: “People are going to find out that they were adopted in this way having thought for the past 50 or 60 years that they were the natural child of the people who brought them up. “It’s going to be really difficult for those parents who did bring up those people. They are going to have to have a very difficult conversation with the children they brought up.” He added: “We have now very clear evidence that there were illegal registrations at the St Patrick’s Guild, and we feel we have to share that information with the people who were affected … They want to know who they are. They want to know what their birth story is.” The revelations opened “what is another chapter from the very dark history in our country. But we are a different country now and I think the results from the [abortion] referendum at the weekend show that,” he said. One woman who was illegally adopted in 1954 said the 126 people referred to in the statement was “just the tip of the iceberg”. Theresa Hiney Tinggal traced her birth family through DNA to Tipperary after discovering at the age of 48 she had been adopted, but found her birth mother had died. “For a woman in the [19]50s, it was a big shame” to become pregnant, she told the Irish broadcaster RTE. Her adoptive mother collected her when she was two days old, she said. “And the nurse said to her: ‘Go out the side door because Bridget [her birth mother] might be looking out the window’. And the nurse and my [adoptive] mother took me to the church in Donnycarney and had me baptised as Theresa Hiney.” The new disclosure follows revelations in recent years about the Magdalene Laundries, run by the Catholic church to house “fallen women”. Thousands of women who had babies outside marriage or were considered morally wayward were incarcerated and used as free labour. Many had their babies forcibly removed and put up for adoption. Five years ago, the Irish government apologised for the state’s collusion in the Magdalene Laundries. The scandal is one reason for the draining of the church’s moral authority in Ireland. A statement released this week by Tusla, Ireland’s state-run child and family agency, said it had identified 126 cases of illegal registration of births by St Patrick’s Guild, and it was trying to identify, locate and inform those involved. It added: “We cannot say with certainty how long this process will take.” Tracing people was slow and labour-intensive. “This is an extremely sensitive issue and one which we acknowledge may cause upset and anxiety for those affected, as well as adopted people, adoptive parents and birth parents across the country.” According to the Adoption Rights Alliance, “St Patrick’s Guild did not run a mother and baby home. Instead babies were sent to St Patrick’s Infant Hospital, Temple Hill before being adopted. Mothers were not present at Temple Hill and St Patrick’s Guild have been very uncooperative in providing information about what conditions were like in the hospital … There were also babies in Temple Hill who were adopted through agencies other than St Patrick’s Guild. “St Patrick’s Guild was involved in the secret export of 572 children to the US for adoption from the 1940s to the 1970s, which was more than any other adoption agency.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/may/30/uncomfortable-truths-about-the-control-of-predators","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-30T17:07:53Z","webTitle":"Uncomfortable truths about the control of predators | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/30/uncomfortable-truths-about-the-control-of-predators","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/may/30/uncomfortable-truths-about-the-control-of-predators","fields":{"headline":"Uncomfortable truths about the control of predators","bodyText":"There is growing anecdotal evidence that the fox population in lowland rural Britain is in sharp decline (Is Britain’s fox population in decline?, Shortcuts, G2, 23 May). This is not because they are short of food, and thus in need of feeding on roadkill by Chris Packham or anybody else. Professor Stephens of Durham University is right that “fox populations appear to have dropped specifically within the past 15 or 20 years”, ie since the enactment of the ban on fox-hunting in 2004. Nor is he wrong when he suggests that “people who were enthusiastic about hunting would often encourage fox populations”. More accurately, this means that they provided habitat (which benefited all wildlife), observed a closed season to allow foxes to breed and rear their cubs in peace, and practised a method of culling that encouraged survival of the fittest and removed the surplus numbers required to maintain a level population. The existence of hunts also acted as a deterrent to those wishing to shoot foxes indiscriminately and all year round with rifles which have significantly increased in accuracy and range over the past 15 years. Collectively, these factors resulted in the most stable, healthy fox population in Europe, in perfect balance with other wildlife, and with the needs of land managers. Unfortunately, the Labour party in the House of Commons allowed its prejudice that all hunting people were toffs to blind it to the realities of managing apex predators in a manmade environment. This can all be sensibly corrected, but it will require Labour to stop playing class war and behave like a responsible party of government when issues around the management of wildlife, such as foxes and badgers, returns to the House of Commons. That is unlikely to happen in the foreseeable future. Benjamin Mancroft Chairman, Masters of Foxhounds Association • As a “compassionate conservationist” I found myself often agreeing with Mary Colwell about the realities of predator control (The bloody truth about conservation, 28 May). By the end of the article, however, I had to question how much experience she has had of the realities of the “dialogue” she advocates between landowners and the anti-shooting voices who have no vested financial interests to protect. It is hard to remain positive and avoid finger-pointing when one side continues to indulge in the largely unpunished criminality that has virtually exterminated breeding hen harriers in England and wantonly persecutes golden and sea eagles in Scotland. I fear she also misunderstands the situation when claiming both sides want the same thing, ie a nature-rich country. The evidence suggests that the natural richness many landowners want is one in which red grouse and pheasant can flourish to the detriment of everything else. Such intransigence makes both sides working together well-nigh impossible. Professor Andrew Barker Lothian &amp; Borders Raptor Study Group • Mary Colwell’s feature on the need for opening up the discussion on predator control is timely. Across the UK, ground-nesting birds such as curlew and lapwing are disappearing from farmland at an alarming rate. Their destruction is directly fuelled by the 1,000% rise in crow numbers since the 1960s, and by foxes; the UK has the second highest number of foxes in Europe – fed by the shooting industry releasing 35m pheasants into the British countryside each year. The current pheasant biomass is unsustainable and destructive, but is being allowed to continue. By now it is clear that we cannot have both ground-nesting birds and crows and foxes. Open up the debate to honest if uncomfortable dialogue. Karen Lloyd Kendal, Cumbria • Stopping the release of pheasants would do nothing to prevent, or even reduce, fox predation on ground-nesting birds. Depending on whose data you select, the fox population has remained stable since the 1990s or declined by up to 40%. There is no evidence of a continuing or recent rise in fox numbers. In any case, preventing the local extinction of increasingly rare species such as the curlew, lapwing or grey partridge does not depend on reducing the national fox population, such an idea is plainly untenable. When a householder or council sets out to deal with a rat infestation, their success is not based on reducing the UK’s rat population but on killing the particular problem animals in a particular place. In the same way preventing the local extinction of rare ground-nesting birds may depend on stopping a particular fox killing a sitting curlew, it most certainly does not rely on reducing the guesstimated number of foxes in the UK to a smaller guesstimate. What is usually needed is carefully targeted, efficient and humane action, taken at the right time in the right place. That such an idea is controversial continues to surprise many reasonable and informed people and, as Mary Colwell suggests, has much to do with the larger conservation businesses not wanting to compromise their fundraising potential by being too frank. Ian Coghill Chairman, Game and Wildlife Conservation Trust • Due to predator control being included in the conservation management mix of our national nature reserve on the Kent marshes, this reserve now holds the largest concentration of breeding waders in lowland UK. The harsh reality is that conservationists have either to accept the need for effective predator control or to accept the continued tragic decline of curlew, lapwing and other ground nesting birds.

Children are like sponges and will soak up what’s around them, so your actions are important. If you want – and get – stuff all the time, they will expect that, too. Spend time with them, listen to them, talk to them. Help your child feel secure. Understand that there’s a difference between wanting and needing. What your child needs most is a connection with you. They need that far more than the latest gizmo they say they want. It’s up to you to gently show them that. Children are not born entitled or spoilt. If they are, there’s often a lack of emotional connection with the important people in their lives. Parenting styles have changed for the better. We’re less authoritarian and want to respect our children, but that doesn’t mean they should get everything they want. Saying no to your child is not a bad thing; neither is them crying because you’ve said it. Don’t get angry because they’re showing emotion – listen to their outburst. Cuddling and chatting at those times helps release the sense of entitlement. You’ll help them understand that it’s not all about them. The word ‘entitled’ gets a bad press. It’s great that our children want the best for themselves, and have high expectations of their lives. Your older children and teenagers still need you. Find out the best times for spending time with them: when are they receptive to you, and to making a connection? Let them know that they’re important.

In the “popular nationalist revolt,” he responded, “Europe leads”. It’s through this lens that we can view Tommy Robinson and the recent shenanigans at Leeds crown court. First, you need to understand what I call the “master narrative” that the American right propagates about Britain. According to this story, the country has been conquered by foreign elements. City centres, particularly “Sadiq Khan’s London”, are no-go areas and, as Trump said, the hospitals are a “war zone for horrible stabbing wounds”. If you do reach a hospital, you will be subjected to socialised medicine. Meanwhile, the radical leftist elites control the media and have no respect for free speech. It is through this murky lens that the US right is questioning our justice system. There was Charlie Gard, a desperately ill baby whose parents and doctors were battling over what treatment was right for him. A sad but not unusual case, until the US media turned up, leading to Trump offering his help. The Gard case was followed by that of Alfie Evans, a toddler with a degenerative brain disease. His parents were fighting his case in the court of protection when the US celebrities piled on. Mike Huckabee, the former Republican presidential candidate, tweeted: “Government-run health care fails again.” Alfie died, but not before protesters tried to storm Alder Hey children’s hospital. In Scotland Mark Meechan, otherwise known as the YouTuber Count Dankula, was fined £800 for committing the crime of posting grossly offensive material on social media by teaching his pug to do a Nazi salute in response to the phrase “Gas the Jews”. The far-right website Breitbart has taken up his cause, referring to it as a “conviction for sh*tposting”. This week Stephen Christopher Yaxley-Lennon, also known as Tommy Robinson and the founder of the defunct English Defence League, was imprisoned for 13 months for contempt of court after live-streaming from outside a long-running criminal trial. His conviction triggered a worldwide media circus. A court order prevented UK media reporting of his case over the weekend so the space was filled by rightwing foreign news outlets. The Drudge Report tweeted to its 1.37 million followers: “UK in shock as judge covers up Soviet-style disappearance of journalist.” The disgraced US comedian Roseanne Barr and Donald Trump Jr tweeted their support. There was a huge amount of misinformation. When the reporting restrictions were lifted on Tuesday, it turned out that Robinson had, contrary to conspiracy theories circulating among his supporters on social media, pleaded guilty to committing a contempt of court. His live streaming in relation to a continuing case had potentially prejudiced a fair trial. So what was the point? Robinson is neither stupid nor ineffective. He has closely followed the “alt-right” playbook, moving away from classic far-right activism to ethnic nationalism. Now he isn’t a far-right provocateur, he is a fearless citizen journalist. What better evidence that he is on to something than the fact that he has been imprisoned by the state in the midst of a media blackout? As Breitbart said, we would tell you why but [redacted]. Robinson, better known in the UK is known as a failed far-right attention seeker, is transformed into a free speech martyr imprisoned for speaking truth to power – “What do we want? Free speech,” sang the thousands at the #JusticeForTommy rally at the weekend. Robinson will be released to a hugely increased profile and access to major funding. If you don’t believe that, look at Count Dankula, whose case helped him triple his YouTube following to more than 237,000 and raise almost £200,000 for his legal appeal. Why should we care? Because the US right is watching the UK carefully. That the far right has traditionally failed here is irrelevant – in his interview Bannon cites Brexit as an early example of the popular nationalist revolt. Nigel Farage is now a Fox News star. And our legal system is a soft spot for intervention. The Count Dankula case and, more recently, that of Alison Chabloz, convicted of posting “grossly offensive” material for Holocaust denial songs uploaded to YouTube, show the danger of criminalising grossly offensive speech. Because while it can be satisfying to convict people who publish horrible views, the knock-on effect is to transform them from minor figures to social media stars. Blocking reporting of criminal trials no longer works. The mainstream media at least understands the rules – citizen journalists will do what they like. Once the foreign media get involved there is no way to control reporting. Activists such as Robinson will keep attempting to disrupt trials because, in the context of reporting bans, the tactic is a win-win for them. It is vitally important to protect the fair trial rights of defendants and ensure that victims get justice, but the laws surrounding contempt need to be urgently reviewed. I would also suggest a wider review of laws such as those criminalising “gross offence”, which affect free speech and were designed before Twitter and Facebook existed. Bannon is right in one sense. The popular nationalist revolution isn’t coming to the UK: it is already here. We can laugh at provocateurs such as Robinson and jokers such as Dankula, but there is nothing funny about the continuing rise of the far right.

At Scotch Corner I turned for Barnard Castle. The villages were well kept, the countryside was green, the fields dotted with sheep. Everything was normal. Or so I thought. Beyond Barnard Castle I took a narrow lane into part of Upper Teesdale and suddenly colours exploded along the roadside. I stopped the car and jumped out. There was a bed of orchids, hundreds of them, and behind that, billowing banks of violet, scarlet, white, yellow and cornflower blue. I had seen alpine meadows, but this took my breath away. Further into the dale I found a footpath that led me down beside a shady brook. There were more orchids of a different species and a grass snake hunting frogs in a pool. Out in the open again, there was the haunting cry of curlews overhead, then redshanks, plovers and snipe. I spent two days up there, talking to environmentalists and farmers involved in the upland hay meadow project for the North Pennines area of outstanding natural beauty (AONB). The landowners were being paid to restrict the use of fertiliser, not employ herbicides, and stop grazing after mid-May. Together with some seeding programmes and careful monitoring, the meadows had become magnificent. When I drove back home, I came down to a countryside where the only flowers were dandelions, watched over by crows. The monotonous green of the rye grass was unbroken. Compared to what I had just experienced, it felt like a desert. I felt cheated. My entire adult life had been spent admiring a shoddy and simplified reproduction, a poor impersonation of a much-loved friend. That evening I sat up late reading. I had recently discovered the American farmer and poet Wendell Berry. “The face of the country is everywhere marked by the agony of our enterprise of self-destruction.” I found myself staring at the lamp. All evening, despite the windows and doors being wide open, there had been nothing flying around the light. In my city, in midsummer, and close to a large riverside park, there were no moths at all. Seven years on, the statistics for the British countryside are heartbreaking. Over a quarter of all British birds are under threat, eight species are almost extinct. Three-quarters of all flying insects have disappeared since 1945, including a staggering 60 different moths. Orchid ranges have shrunk by half; two species are gone. The State of Nature 2016 report described Britain as being “among the most nature-depleted countries in the world”. A combined effort by more than 50 nature conservation and research organisations, the report went on to reveal that 40% of all species are in moderate or steep decline. Over a quarter of the hedgehog population has disappeared in a decade. Toads are down 68% in 30 years, water voles are no longer found in 94% of the places where they once lived. Likewise mountain hares are in steep decline, as are rabbits. Even that great survivor, the fox, has lost over 40% of its population. There are a few positive notes: the loss of hedgerows has largely stopped (about nine kilometres were being grubbed up every day until the mid-1990s) and the red kite is back, but the news is overwhelmingly bleak. Our countryside, the report concluded, needs radical action. And now, with Brexit looming, there is a sense that things must, and will, change. The question is: for better or worse? Back in June 2017 journalists waiting for news of Theresa May’s cabinet reshuffle were surprised to see Michael Gove enter No 10. His failed leadership bid and public falling out with Boris Johnson appeared to have hamstrung his political career. By 7pm he was back, replacing Andrea Leadsom as environment secretary. The news was greeted with alarm by environmentalists. After all, this was a politician who had voted against action on climate change, against incentives for low carbon electricity generation, and against requirements for environmental permits to frack, but had favoured selling state forests, culling badgers and introducing high-speed rail. It seemed at least one British fox was alive, and now in charge of the hen house. Within months Gove was taking decisive action, but not in ways anyone had predicted. In rapid succession came measures to ban the controversial neonicotinoid insecticides, introduce CCTV in abattoirs, strengthen animal cruelty laws, stop ivory sales and control the use of plastic microbeads. Even George Monbiot was astonished. “One by one, Michael Gove is saying the things I’ve waited years for an environment secretary to say.” Then in January 2018 came A Green Future: Our 25 Year Plan to Improve the Environment with bold targets on air and water quality, and protection for threatened plants and wildlife. The sheer scale and ambition is breathtaking: all sales of new conventional petrol and diesel engines to be stopped by 2040; an area the size of Norfolk to be made wildlife-rich habitat (500,000 hectares over and above existing protected sites); and 180,000 hectares of new forest. Gove has also now ordered a review of national parks, with a view to expanding on the 10 existing areas. This is revolutionary and, perhaps, too good to be true? So I head back to Upper Teesdale, praying the hay meadows are as I remember them. I meet the AONB’s biodiversity lead officer Rebecca Barrett in the new visitor centre at Bowlees. All around us the woods are humming with life: wild garlic and bluebells are starting to bloom, despite the late arrival of spring. A woodpecker drums industriously near the car park, which has a good number of cars and campervans present – plus seven species of orchid near the picnic tables. “This area attracts botanists from all over the world,” says Barrett. “We’ve got an incredibly rare mixture of arctic and alpine species: things like spring gentians, teesdale violets and yellow marsh saxifrage.” As for birds, “We have loads of good bird walks to see waders, raptors and so on.” Any losses or extinctions? “Some historic ones, like the corncrake. They were very common here, but mechanised grass-cutting drove them out before anyone even thought about conservation. Now we’re really concerned about curlews: the UK population has halved in the last 16 years.” The phone rings. A visitor wants to know if the spring gentians are out. “Try up at Cow Green reservoir,” she says. “You should find them.” Are the meadows in good health? She pulls a face. “There are still a lot of flowers, but the sad fact is that they are declining. The potential is still there to reverse that trend, but they are definitely declining.” A Natural England report from 2014 pointed the finger at the use of artifical fertilisers. Farmers like them as they can increase silage production, but the downside is that wildflowers cannot cope. So why not ban them? “We can’t fall out with the farmers,” Barrett says carefully. “They must be part of the solution.” Other voices are less circumspect. The State of Nature 2016 report declares: “The intensification of agriculture has had the biggest impact on wildlife, and this has been overwhelmingly negative … farming has changed dramatically, with new technologies boosting yields often at the expense of nature.” Those new technologies include a formidable armoury of artificial fertilisers, herbicides, pesticides and insecticides, all poured liberally over the British countryside since the second world war. On top of that are all the other industrial chemicals that find their way into the food chain. The Green Future plan promises significant change on this. There are commitments to eliminate by 2025 the use of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs – used in sealants, coolants and paints), and five years later to achieve negligible emissions of persistent organic pollutants (Pops) – harmful chemicals that resist environmental degradation. Both types have been linked to serious environmental damage. The Pop lindane, for example, was first recognised as a lethal insecticide during the second world war. Subsequently, an estimated 600,000 tonnes were sprayed on crops worldwide before an EU ban in 2009. By then it had been connected with everything from human cancers to a drop in the otter population. Pops are thought to be responsible for the infertility of a killer whale that died by entanglement in fishing lines off Tiree in 2016, an infertility that has doomed to extinction the UK’s only resident orca pod. In 2003 blood samples from 14 EU ministers were analysed, including one from Alun Michael MP, then minister of state for rural affairs and local environmental quality. All 14 were found to be contaminated with Pops, PCBs and flame retardants. No doubt the rest of us are also contaminated. Another old favourite that refuses to go away is the herbicide paraquat, banned in Europe in 2007. The US Environmental Protection Agency describes it as “extremely biologically active and toxic to plants and animals”. Hares and small mammals are particularly sensitive. Spraying of potato fields in the UK often caused mass deaths of hares before the ban came in. Despite this, around 41,000 tonnes of paraquat are still manufactured annually by Syngenta in Huddersfield, all for export. Understandably, the negative effects on humans have always been a priority for research into agricultural chemicals. Troublesome environmental consequences are usually a bit slower to emerge. After all, these are substances designed to kill things; it seems a little churlish to complain when they do precisely that. Currently, the most popular poison of all is Monsanto’s Roundup, a glyphosate herbicide that has been applied in staggering quantities: 8.6m tonnes, since its debut in 1974. Usage has only increased since Monsanto released glyphosate-tolerant crops in 1996. As of 2014, around a third of the world’s arable land had been sprayed with it. In rural mid-Wales I ask a hill farmer (who prefers to remain anonymous) about his use of chemicals. “I use Roundup every two or three years,” he says. “It kills everything in a field, then we can start again and re-seed.” It is not only farmers. Roundup is found in the cupboards of most lawn-owners, allotment holders and anyone with a patio problem. Councils use it; so do schools. As such, you might imagine it is safe. But studies have shown it reduces the ecologically vital activity of earthworms (Lumbricus terrestris); while interfering with their reproductive success, it harms bee navigation, hits butterfly populations and severely affects amphibians. In a study at the University of Pittsburgh, Roundup was sprayed over tanks filled with tadpoles. Within 24 hours most were dead. In three weeks they all were. When adult frogs and toads were tested, they suffered catastrophic mortality rates. The concentrations of the herbicide used were those recommended by the manufacturer, Monsanto, which responded by saying the tests were not realistic. The World Health Organization has classified glyphosates as “probably carcinogenic to humans” although several international agencies, including the European Food Safety Authority, subsequently came to opposite conclusions. Monsanto insists glyphosate is safe. In November 2017, an EU vote to re-licence glyphosates was narrowly passed. Britain voted in favour. In 2022, the next vote will probably go against, since Italy and France are lobbying hard for a ban. Britain’s commitment to a green future will then be truly tested. Our countryside has been drenched in legal poisons for over half a century, and not by the Russians. Out near Malton in Yorkshire, I meet Hugo Hildyard, who farms 300 acres on heavy clay soils. He is doubtful that reliance on products such as Roundup can be broken. “Without chemicals it probably isn’t possible to grow crops on land like mine. Done naturally, the land might support a few cows and sheep, but that wouldn’t be economic. What wildlife likes is no interference. I’ve got a marshy patch where curlews nest. If I ploughed it up and drained it, I could plant crops there and get agricultural payments. It’s the improvement of land for production that harms wildlife.” He has been farming for 40 years and thinks the countryside is in relatively good shape. “The chemicals we used years ago were worse, so the land has benefited from the EU bans.” Data backs that up. Defra records show pesticide poisoning of UK wildlife almost halved in the last 20 years of the 20th century. Grounds for hope? Hildyard has mixed feelings. He remains sceptical that Gove’s 25-year goals can be achieved, or even that the government has the heart to deliver. “Around me landowners are being bullied into allowing fracking, which is largely to produce gas that makes plastics – not for cooking or heating homes. It’s hard to see how that is consistent with a green future.” Likewise he is scornful of British agriculture competing against giants like Brazil, Argentina and the US, where farms are bigger, with less rigorous controls on chemicals. The Welsh hill farmer goes further: “The EU has been good for British farmers, not our own government.” He leans on the bonnet of his 20-year-old Land Rover. He hasn’t had a holiday since 1987. This year the cold spring has delayed grass growth, causing major headaches. “It’s like this,” he says. “If British farming was a fighter in a boxing ring, the government would blindfold him and pull down his shorts, celebrities and experts would kick him in the nuts and pressure groups would beat him with sticks. Meanwhile the public would be in the best seats – they didn’t pay much for them – complaining that their fighter isn’t any good.” He chuckles. “That’s me on a bad day. On a good day I still enjoy farming.” There are plenty of factors outside agriculture that are significant in the decline of the countryside. On the cliffs near Whitby, I find ornithologist Richard Baines from Yorkshire Coast Nature, spotting birds faster than I can see them, often by the calls alone. “There’s a short-eared owl – it will have flown in from Scandinavia.” Baines is working with a turtle dove conservation programme. “They are facing extinction in the UK and a big part of the reason is illegal hunting on the flyway, the migratory route.” Turtle doves winter in Mali and their 11,000km round trip passes through southern Europe where hunting is illegal, but common. “ We think 2.1m birds are lost every year.” Not all migrants are welcome. Walking the South Downs Way near Petworth recently, consultant entomologist Richard Baker spotted many unhealthy looking ash trees. “It was ash dieback,” he tells me, “A fungus, probably blown in on the wind, or brought in with imported trees.” Our wild and cultivated plants are threatened by numerous pests and pathogens from overseas. “There’s an Asian beetle called an emerald ash borer that is devastating Russia and the US,” Baker says. “Unless we’re vigilant, that could get in.” It is worth remembering that invasive species like Japanese knotweed, black grass and bracken can often only be fought with chemical assistance. All this gives an idea of the immense challenges, both biological and political. Sarah Lee, head of policy at the Countryside Alliance, supports Gove’s 25-year plan, but warns: “It is vital that delivery involves working with rural communities, not imposing solutions on them.” Despite all the bold talk, budget cuts to the organisation that has to deliver on many of these challenges, Natural England, have been severe: 27% by 2020. In the fours years up to 2014 it shed one-fifth of its staff. Already there are signs that its ability to fight the corner for wildlife has been compromised. In March 2018 a Lords select committee reported that Natural England “struggled to perform all its key functions”. Do they believe in the Green Futures plan? Many I speak to think it radically ambitious, even improbable, but it was already galvanising people into action. Back in Upper Teesdale, I go with Barrett to meet a farmer at the sharp end: Karen Scott at Low Way farm near one of England’s highest waterfalls, High Force. “The rule is that we must remove our sheep from the pastures by 14 May,” she says. “Then the wildflowers can grow. We’ve done it for 30 years.” An oystercatcher speeds overhead while Scott shows me her bunkhouse and cafe near the river. “We diversified to stay in business.” She is anxious about changes that are coming for environmental schemes. “Payments are delayed, inspections rare, the paperwork gets longer. I had three sleepless nights doing the forms last time.” Barrett wants it all to switch to a results-based system where farmers are rewarded for environmental excellence. Scott agrees. “Definitely, but locally-tailored. Every farm is different.” Like the Welsh farmer, there is a sense of impatience with bureaucracy and time not spent out on the land. Barrett is hopeful, however. “We’ve just started a project right across the northern Pennines to encourage low intensity farming and wildlife. It could transform the way a lot of farmers work.” The idea is popular in government too. There’s a recognition that a topography of small, well-protected oases of wildlife within a desert of intensive farming has failed to stem the general decline. Now cooperation and wider participation are the watchwords. There are plans within Natural England for the 224 underused national nature reserves to develop connections deep into surrounding land, spreading biodiversity. The idea is supported by the Countryside Landowners Association whose 2016 report talks about developing “natural capital” and claims that 52% of landowners have already invested in improvements like wildflower meadows, wetlands and woodlands. There is certainly a lot of goodwill and hard work going into the countryside by many people who care deeply about it. Are there reasons to be optimistic? Baines thinks so. “Co-operation between organisations and groups has never been better – right across deep divisions. I’ve seen Israeli and Palestinian ornithologists working together to solve the illegal shooting problem.” Hildyard is more cautious. “I’d join a wildlife-enriched scheme, but it has to be financially supported, and not too bureaucratic.” Baker points to successes. “A colony of the Asian longhorn beetle was found in Kent in 2012, but we identified and eradicated it. That’s impressive.” In the State of Nature 2016 report, David Attenborough declared that, “Landscapes are being restored, special places defended, and struggling species are being saved and brought back.” One day this spring, I had my own cause for optimism. The corncrake, a bird that was once widespread and common, now teeters on the brink of British extinction. But on a cold and blustery day on the Hebridean island of Iona, I sat beside a small patch of long grass just behind the island’s small fire station and heard its distinctive rasping snore of a call. The sound was confident, even assertive. For the moment, like the British countryside, the corncrake is hanging in there."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/may/30/lucian-pintilie-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-30T14:49:44Z","webTitle":"Lucian Pintilie obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/may/30/lucian-pintilie-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/may/30/lucian-pintilie-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Lucian Pintilie obituary","bodyText":"Until 2005, when the Romanian new wave was launched with Cristi Puiu’s The Death of Mr Lazarescu, Romanian cinema was little known internationally. However, Puiu, Cristian Mungiu, Corneliu Porumboiu and Cătălin Mitulescu, winners of stacks of prestigious awards, all acknowledged the influence of Lucian Pintilie, who has died aged 84. Unlike Pintilie, these younger directors were able to make films free from the censorship that existed under Nicolae Ceauşescu, the communist despot who had controlled the arts with an iron fist. It was only when Ceauşescu was executed in 1989 that Pintilie was able to make films again in his homeland after many years of self-imposed exile, mostly in France, where he gained a reputation as a theatre director. The films that initially got Pintilie into trouble with the authorities were Sunday at Six (1965) and Reconstruction (1968). Despite the use of metaphors of Romanian society to get by, the films were seen, quite rightly, as criticisms of totalitarianism. Sunday at Six, Pintilie’s first film, follows the romance between two communist revolutionaries at cross-purposes with the interests of the party. Its non-linear narrative, underscored by a dark sense of humour typical of the director, revealed an unacceptable “western influence”. Reconstruction tells the story of two juvenile delinquents who injure a waiter in a fight while drunk. The police force them to recreate their crime for an educational film on the evils of alcohol with disastrous results. Grim and sardonic, it is a disturbing work of intense realism that explains why Pintilie is known as the godfather of the Romanian new wave. The film was denounced by Ceauşescu and was not shown again in Romania for two decades. At the same time, Pintilie was resident director of the Bulandra theatre in Bucharest, where he was supposedly free of censorship. His productions there included George Bernard Shaw’s Caesar and Cleopatra, Max Frisch’s Biedermann and the Firebugs, Anton Chekhov’s The Cherry Orchard and Nikolai Gogol’s The Inspector General, a satire of government bureaucracy, which was suspended by the regime in 1972. This was the last straw, causing Pintilie to take up posts at the Théâtre National de Chaillot and the Théâtre de la Ville in Paris, where he staged, among other plays, Carlo Gozzi’s Turandot, Henrik Ibsen’s The Wild Duck, and Chekhov’s Three Sisters and The Seagull. He also directed Bizet’s Carmen (1983) for the Welsh National Opera in Cardiff and Molière’s Tartuffe and The Wild Duck in the US. Pintilie was born in southern Romania in the Bessarabia region, now part of Ukraine. His father was a teacher of French and Pintilie studied at the state-supported Institute of Theatre and Cinematographic Art (IATC) in Bucharest. Despite his cosmopolitanism, he felt profoundly Romanian; almost all his films were set there and were sharp comments on the conflict between politics and ethics in that region. During his exile, he returned briefly to Romania in 1979 to shoot Carnival Scenes, which was banned before it was released. “It is true, on one level, my work does not correspond to official art,” he told the Washington Post in 1986. “My vision of the world is crueller, more sarcastic, more satirical. But at the same time, there is a great deal of tenderness underneath. ... But the bureaucratic mentality is ridiculous. They are stupid people. They live in a nightmare and they see monsters where none exists. But one day, I shall win this bet. I have a mystical conviction that I will make movies again in my country.” He did. After the return to democracy in Romania and his return to his homeland, Pintilie was able to consolidate his reputation as a maverick master by making several eccentric films on his own terms. The Oak (1992) is a bleak allegory of the corruption and terror that marked the Ceauşescu era. It focused on the rebellion of the daughter of a former colonel of the Securitate, the Romanian political police. The visually splendid An Unforgettable Summer (1994), set in the 1920s, starred Kristin Scott Thomas (speaking in Romanian, English and French) as the wife of an army officer who takes a decision to stand firm against her husband’s orders to execute a group of Bulgarians. Further films were nihilistic views of post-communist Romania. Too Late (1996), about the plight of coal miners, is disguised as a thriller; Next Stop Paradise (1998) deals with the American influence on young people while The Afternoon of a Torturer (2001) resurrects the horrors of the Ceauşescu regime through the confessions of a former prison torturer. In 2011 at the film festival in Cluj in Romania, and in 2012, in New York, Pintilie was given overdue comprehensive retrospectives, much of which came as a revelation to those who had not had the chance to see his films during the dark period in Romania. Pintilie was married to the actor Clody Bertola from 1965 until her death in 2007. • Lucian Pintilie, theatre and film director, born 9 November 1933; died 16 May 2018"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2018/jun/06/50-great-tracks-for-june-christine-queens-playboi-carti-the-1975","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-06T09:00:09Z","webTitle":"50 great tracks for June from Christine and the Queens, Playboi Carti, the 1975 and more","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jun/06/50-great-tracks-for-june-christine-queens-playboi-carti-the-1975","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/jun/06/50-great-tracks-for-june-christine-queens-playboi-carti-the-1975","fields":{"headline":"50 great tracks for June from Christine and the Queens, Playboi Carti, the 1975 and more","bodyText":"Christine and the Queens – Girlfriend Or rather, Chris and the Queens. In her accompanying notes on Genius, the returning French pop star explains how this song sees her take on a macho persona as a way of sparring with male sexual energy – even if there are those who will reject her for it. Also done in French as sister recording Damn, Dis-Moi, Girlfriend is set to HD 80s boogie production – redolent of the guest star Dam-Funk, who delivers some deep, sexy vocal interjections. Playboi Carti – Fell in Luv In a very strong month for rap albums, what with A$AP Rocky’s impressionistically blunted Testing and Pusha T’s Kanye-produced side of beef Daytona both proving excellent, Playboi Carti’s newest full-length, Die Lit, still stood out. His hopscotching flow broke through on Magnolia last year, and that track’s producer, Pi’erre Bourne, is the key to the album’s hazy appeal. For Fell In Luv, he cuts up a sample of a sample – Purity Ring’s lift of Young Magic – to end up with something Holly Herndon might make if she segued into mumble-rap production. The 1975 – Give Yourself a Try Recent months have seen the 1975’s frontman Matty Healy credited with inspiring a spuriously named genre called Healywave (though he prefers Mattycore). To be fair, he has worked with most of the acts connected with it – his Dirty Hit labelmates Pale Waves and No Rome – and to be even fairer, it should probably be called Hutchencewave for its clear debt to INXS. Still, technicalities: no sooner had the term started catching on (sort of) than the 1975 return with a completely new sound. The first track from their third album hooks around a single, strangulated riff that sounds a bit like Room on Fire-era Strokes rendered as a polyphonic ringtone. It’s miles better than that suggests, and completely unlike anything else on the radio. Like always, Healy’s lyrics veer between ludicrous and devoutly sincere, touching on STDs, finding grey hairs in your “zoot” (zoot!) and an impressively self-lacerating description of himself as “a millennial that baby boomers like”. As neurotic as the song is, Healy suggests being kinder to yourself as you grow up; the strangely affecting Give Yourself a Try is a sign of the 1975 letting themselves grow in weird and wonderful ways. Troye Sivan – Bloom Speaking of Healywave, there’s definitely a touch of the 1975 in the muted guitar that chimes through the second chorus of Troye Sivan’s excellent single Bloom. But most of this glorious ode to bottoming shimmers by on synths that channel the sense of anticipation and nervousness that Sivan conveys as he plays the part of a receptive partner losing his virginity. It’s stylishly done stuff: his voice on the tantalising first verse is coated in whispery reverb, an invitation to come closer, while the choruses are peppered with subtle gasps that imbue the elegant Bloom with an indecently good sense of lust. Tirzah – Gladly It seems far too long since Tirzah’s brief run of brilliance in the mid-2010s – not least the brilliantly scruffy I’m Not Dancing. Similarly earwormy is Gladly, the first single from her long-awaited debut album Devotion (out this August on Domino). Produced by Mica Levi, the track lopes sleepily around a single loop, a heavy, warped piano refrain that seems to pace around in circles and mirrors Tirzah’s state of mind. “All I want is you,” she repeats, drowsy with longing and obsession: “I love you.” Proof that the simplest songs are sometimes the most profound. Skepta – Pure Water It’s been a banner month for the Tottenham MC. Not only has he guested on standout tracks on the aforementioned Playboi Carti and A$AP Rocky albums – appearing on stage with the latter and a giant crash test dummy head in London – he has also released one of his strongest solo tracks ever. Over a minimalist beat that perfectly encapsulates the way he currently straddles grime and US rap, Pure Water sees him announce his own greatness with armour-plated self-confidence. Prophet – Tonight (feat Nite Jewel &amp; Mndsgn) Thirty-four years ago, Prophet self-released 1,000 copies of Right on Time, an album of scuffed, wonky but compelling electro-funk that disappeared without trace. But it was coveted by Stones Throw label head Peanut Butter Wolf, who met with Prophet and got him in the studio to finally do the follow-up. Tonight is a rerecorded version of a track from his debut, which was covered by Nite Jewel in 2011, who turns up here to join in the homecoming: a magnificent, stumbling funk jam. Nite Jewel – one of the most underrated songwriters around today – has her own track on the playlist too, On Your Own, a Hi-NRG synth workout topped with a soaring vocal. Parquet Courts – Freebird II The Brooklyn garage rockers keep knocking out classic after classic, with new LP Wide Awake! another essential collection of varied, literate, totally satisfying jams. One highlight, Freebird II – the title typical of their droll hipster humour – features a big, satisfying organ melody matched by a blokey singalong for the chorus. Andrew Savage’s verses are like a positivist spin on those from Human Performance, the title lament from the band’s last album. Miss Red – Dagga Miss Red was born in Israel to Moroccan-Polish parents but, with her girlish patois, she sounds more like she was brought up in a Kingston ghetto. Pairing her once more with producer the Bug, who she accosted at a Tel Aviv rave and went on to tour and record with, Dagga is the first track from her debut album. One of the Bug’s hallmark industrial-dancehall riddims rides under Miss Red’s coquettish singsong vocals. Oneohtrix Point Never – Toys 2 Fresh from a brilliant score for the Robert Pattison thriller Good Time, and following a string of albums of densely splintered electronics, Daniel Lopatin has released an ambitious new record in Age Of. It finds space for drunken harpsichords, Anohni, terrifying shouting, tender Bon Iver-style digital songcraft, harsh trap and jazzy synth solos, and yet hangs together: he is the great sonic essayist of our voracious, always-on culture. The highlight is the symphonic Toys 2, his biggest, cheesiest moment yet, and his most moving."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/01/something-has-to-give-italians-back-euro-but-rail-against-eus-rules","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-01T05:00:42Z","webTitle":"'Something has to give': Italians back euro but rail against EU’s rules","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/01/something-has-to-give-italians-back-euro-but-rail-against-eus-rules","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/01/something-has-to-give-italians-back-euro-but-rail-against-eus-rules","fields":{"headline":"'Something has to give': Italians back euro but rail against EU’s rules","bodyText":"Ever since the inception of the EU, Italians have been among the staunchest defenders of the European project. But the political crisis that engulfed the bloc’s third largest economy this week, centring on a debate over Italy’s commitment to the eurozone, has spooked investors and worried Brussels. It has raised a question that just a few years ago would have seemed unfathomable: are Italians ready to ditch the euro? The answer, like most aspects of Italian politics, is complicated. Opinion polls show that a majority of Italians – 59%, according to Eurobarometer – support the country’s continued inclusion in the eurozone. But that does not mean they want to continue to abide by the rules set by Brussels, which Italy agreed to when it adopted the currency. Instead, more Italians are seeking a tougher and more antagonistic approach towards Brussels, after years of frustration over fiscal constraints set by the EU coupled with a feeling that Europe has abandoned Italy to cope on its own with the migration crisis. The latest Eurobarometer survey found that only three in 10 Italians believed their voices counted within the EU. While a full break from the EU – an “Italexit” – is not a matter of public debate (such a move is considered implausible even among the most hardline Eurosceptics), surveys show Italians generally have a dim view of the bloc. Eurobarometer found that 39% believed Italy’s inclusion in the EU was a “good thing” and 44% believed Italy benefited from being in the EU. In March, stagnant economic growth and concerns about immigration drove voters across Italy to vote in large numbers for two populist parties – the Five Star Movement and the League, formerly the Northern League – while the most pro-EU party, the Democratic party (PD), suffered a humiliating defeat. Josef Janning, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said: “There is no desire to exit. But there is a willingness to follow the League and the Five Star Movement and to say ‘we don’t want to follow the rules’. That seems to be the new consensus.” Research by Roberto D’Alimonte, a political scientist at Luiss University in Rome, shows that among Italy’s biggest political parties, only the far-right League, which used to be a secessionist party, has a majority of supporters who want Italy to exit the single currency. More than half (56%) of all M5S supporters and 91% of PD voters want to remain in the eurozone, compared with 38% of League supporters. Italians’ views on the eurozone are difficult to correlate with age or other demographics. D’Alimonte said the biggest indicators were employment status and education, with unemployed people – especially young people in the poorer southern regions of Italy – more inclined to have negative views about the euro. It would be very difficult for Italy to exit the eurozone. Currently the constitution states that referendums cannot be held to change international treaties. The constitution therefore would have to be amended to allow for a referendum on a departure, and this would require the support of two-thirds of both houses of parliament. The constitutional court would probably weigh in, and the process could take years. In the eventual event of any referendum, most analysts agree that voters would strongly favour keeping the euro – driven perhaps more by fear than love. The complication in Italy is that Europe is not seen as the most important issue for voters in a general election. Domestic issues take precedence. “If there were a referendum, I am pretty positive that the euro would prevail,” said D’Alimonte. “But in a general election, where the euro is one issue but there are others like immigration, pension reforms, cost-cutting issues, it becomes less clear what the outcome becomes.” Both the League and the M5S insisted this week that they had never called for an exit from the euro. But top officials from both parties have called in the past for either an exit or at least a referendum on the issue. For supporters of the EU, the worry is how far sentiment has shifted in Italy. “The politicians will probably keep their ambivalent stance,” said Wolfango Piccoli, an analyst at Teneo Holdings in London. “But we know they want a confrontation with Brussels. We should not expect that relationship to stay the same. Something has to give. A compromise is possible but so far there is no indication from Brussels that there is one.” At the centre of the dissatisfaction with Brussels is the view that Italy has, as a net contributor, given more than it has received, with funds being diverted to eastern Europe while southern Italy has languished. Janning said: “The deficit rules and the fiscal constraints that the eurozone applies are a source of frustration. Italy is a wealthy and large country, so they feel that they should be treated differently, and that they should not be bound by rules that they perceive to be dysfunctional. “There is a view of a north/south divide, of the rule-makers and the rule-takers. And that the success of economic change in the east has created the neglect of southern Europe.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2018/may/31/nest-hello-google-launches-facial-recognition-data-doorbell-uk-privacy-concerns-amazon-ring","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-30T23:01:05Z","webTitle":"Google launches video doorbell with facial recognition in UK","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/may/31/nest-hello-google-launches-facial-recognition-data-doorbell-uk-privacy-concerns-amazon-ring","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/may/31/nest-hello-google-launches-facial-recognition-data-doorbell-uk-privacy-concerns-amazon-ring","fields":{"headline":"Google launches video doorbell with facial recognition in UK","bodyText":"Google’s facial recognition video doorbell, the Nest Hello, is launching in the UK to challenge Amazon’s Ring. Initially released in the US in March, Nest Hello is the first of Google’s new home security product lineup to make it to the UK, ahead of its Nest Secure alarm system. Nest Hello is a £229 wifi-connected smart doorbell with a wide-angle camera that captures high definition HDR video with night vision after dusk. It will send alerts with pictures from the camera to users’ phones and allows them to talk to visitors through the doorbell from anywhere with an internet connection. Users can also opt to have the doorbell say one of three quick phrases, such as “we’ll be right there”. Nest’s big differentiating feature, however, is its machine-learning technology that analyses video from the front door, which Google claims can differentiate between people walking by, visitors or delivery people approaching and loitering burglars, only alerting users when necessary. Lionel Guicherd-Callin, head of EMEA product marketing for Nest Labs, said: “Your front door is where home begins. It’s the entryway to special moments with family and friends – but also the most common way burglars enter your home. So we’ve designed a doorbell experience that makes your front door more safe and secure, yet still feels friendly.” With an optional Nest Aware subscription starting at £4 per month, Google goes one step further with cloud video recording and face recognition, which allows users to name visitors and then have them automatically identified on subsequent arrivals at their door. “Instead of just alerting you that there’s someone at the door, we can tell you that your kids are at the door, or there is someone you don’t know standing at the door,” said Guicherd-Callin. The Nest Hello can also connect to other smart home devices, including Google Assistant speakers so that users can get alerts through them. If the face of the visitor is recognised the speakers can announce the name of the person at the door, for instance, or Nest Hello can trigger a smart light. Ben Wood, head of research at CCS Insight, said that a recent survey by the analysis firm of smart home device owning UK consumers put connected doorbells in the top three next purchases. But, Wood warned: “Ring has become synonymous with connected doorbells and with the might of Amazon behind it there have to be concerns for rivals such as Nest and DoorBird as to whether they are able to survive the competitive onslaught.” Google’s facial recognition system first launched in the UK in April, but the same technology in a doorbell, which primarily faces the street and is more likely to capture neighbours and passers-by, is more likely to raise privacy concerns. “Facial recognition on smart home cameras is not something new – but the Nest Hello will likely raise awareness among consumers that could spark a deeper debate about the implications of such technology being deployed by people’s front doors,” said Wood. “This could be a major challenge for Google given the broader unease around privacy at present.” Nest warns about the implications of capturing others on video and the fact that such cameras facing into public spaces could face regulation under data protection laws which are currently being revised. “The ICO’s current guidance on domestic CCTV and data protection was principally based on a judgment of the European Court of Justice under the previous legal regime for data protection,” said an ICO spokesperson. “Following the introduction of GDPR and the new Data Protection Act 2018, we are the process of reviewing the legal position and will update our guidance in due course.” Nest does not offer a free trial of the service for the doorbell, unlike its IQ cameras, and stores video and facial-recognition data within Irish data centres for those in Europe. But it remains to be seen whether facial recognition technology at the front door will prove the killer feature or simply create a privacy headache for Google.

Workers stream out into the early evening light, a group gather to chat, and in the far corner a woman in a bright yellow coat is caught in an embrace. “I love it, I just love it,” says O’Grady of the restored painting, which was found in the basement of the TUC’s headquarters, Congress House in London. “I never had that romantic view of mining. [But] this picture shows there was a kind of nobility about it. “But what was that nobility about? It was about solidarity between people. It wasn’t what they actually did, it was something about that sense of community. I think we need to have a very basic discussion about the value of labour and [ask] how did we end up forgetting it – and how do we rediscover it.” This week marks 150 years since the first Trades Union Congress gathered in the Manchester Mechanics’ Institute. O’Grady, who became the TUC’s first female leader in 2013, finds herself at the helm in an era of zero-hour contracts and ever more complex, atomised supply chains. Union membership, particularly among young people, is falling. The TUC is using the anniversary to overhaul the way it recruits younger members, launching a pilot for a new app to offer young people advice about their rights and how to get ahead in work. It will also quietly try to bring them into trade unionism, with the idea of offering users the chance to connect with other similar workers across industries. “If we’ve got a digital economy we’ve got to have digital trade unionism,” says O’Grady. “And if we have young people whose bosses will do everything they can to avoid recognising a union, we don’t walk away, we reinvent ourselves, we do something new. If you can’t get through the front door, you go around the back. I want that spirit that we are a ‘have-a-go’ movement.” The new online factory gate, developed over the last two years with the 50 unions that fall under its umbrella, will use the power of online networks instead of penny newspapers to connect workers, she says. “Wouldn’t it be wonderful if we could say: would you like to talk to other baristas, or people working in this company? This is the great efficiency of cooperation and organising: we can begin to bring people together online and offline to get a better deal for people at work.” Instead of paying subs to a union in the normal way, the WorkSmart app will use the “freemium” model used by music streaming services such as Spotify, with workers encouraged to pay for some added services while also being nudged into union membership. With a report on Monday suggesting the generational pay gap between over- and under-30s has more than doubled in the last 20 years, and millennials increasingly being priced out of the housing market and struggling to find secure work, O’Grady says there needs to be a “civil rights movement for young people”. Unions find themselves in an unenviable position, arguably increasingly necessary for younger workers, who nonetheless join their ranks in fewer and fewer numbers. Last year saw the biggest trade union membership drop since records began. O’Grady stresses that the TUC is still nearly 6 million strong, and it remains the largest democratic membership organisation in the UK, but she recognises that the threat is real. “Conventional trade unionism still works very effectively in some areas but what’s clear is that business models have radically changed,” she says. “Unions have to change too – change or die.” Despite the falling numbers, she is doggedly optimistic and points to recent strikes at McDonalds, TGI Fridays, Picturehouse cinemas and Sports Direct as the “sparks” of a new mass movement. “It is within our grasp because certainly some of the conditions that gave rise to the [first wave of mass unionism] are echoed in conditions we see today,” she says. “We tell ourselves that these young people are on insecure contracts and if they put their head above the parapet they’ll be sacked, but some of them have that sense that they have nothing to lose. And they have more courage than perhaps they have been given credit for.” Almost a year after the publication of the Taylor review, which proposed new protections for workers in the gig economy, O’Grady is angry at the lack of action from the government, despite promises from the prime minister. “I don’t know what has happened to Theresa May tackling burning injustices because at the moment it feels like petrol is being poured on the flames of them,” she says. With the Brexit deadline drawing closer these are precarious times for Britain’s workers, she adds. The TUC, which supports staying in the customs union and single market as “the least worst option”, worries about the erosion of hard-won worker rights enshrined in EU law. “That floor of rights wasn’t something that was given to us, it was something we fought for across borders to get pushed through the system of social partnership in the EU,” she says. “If we lose that level playing field of rights how long before Boris Johnson and Michael Gove start chipping away at the rights that we have, never mind keeping pace with improvements in Europe?” So while the TUC’s 150th anniversary could be a moment for some wistful glances in the rear-view mirror, O’Grady insists it has to be used to propel the movement into the future. “This isn’t a trip down memory lane,” she insists. “It’s drawing on that history of constant innovation and daring and that’s what I want us to do – to take a few risks. We won’t succeed on every front but if we don’t try, as they say, we will surely fail. So we are going to try.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/may/30/bob-higgins-southampton-fc-sexually-abuse-boys-jury-told","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-30T14:03:19Z","webTitle":"Bob Higgins used 'supreme power' to sexually abuse boys, jury told","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/30/bob-higgins-southampton-fc-sexually-abuse-boys-jury-told","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/may/30/bob-higgins-southampton-fc-sexually-abuse-boys-jury-told","fields":{"headline":"Bob Higgins used 'supreme power' to sexually abuse boys, jury told","bodyText":"A former Southampton Football Club youth coach is a “predatory paedophile” who used his “supreme power” over the boys he worked with to carry out a widespread campaign of sexual abuse, a jury has been told. Bob Higgins, who coached many players who went on to achieve national and international success, was a serial abuser of young teenage boys over a period of 25 years, Salisbury crown court heard on Wednesday. Higgins, 65, who also worked at Peterborough United and ran his own football academy, denies 50 counts of indecent assault against 24 boys between 1971 and 1996. Opening the case for the prosecution, Adam Feest QC told the jury Higgins won the trust of the boys, who idolised him, and their parents as part of “a systematic and all-pervasive pattern of grooming behaviour” that allowed him to act with “near impunity”. Feest told the jury that in 2016 the former Crewe Alexandra professional footballer Andy Woodward came forward about abuse he had suffered at the hands of a coach when he was younger. The NSPCC set up a hotline to field calls from anyone who had encountered childhood sexual abuse within football. “The telephone started to ring and one name was mentioned over and over again – that of Bob Higgins,” said Feest. Higgins was involved with youth team training at Southampton from the mid-1970s until the later 1980s, the jury was told. He spent time with the Maltese football association, then worked with Peterborough until 1996. Feest said Higgins was a talented coach, spotting and nurturing many young players who went on to achieve significant success. Teenagers turned down more prestigious clubs so they could work with him, the court heard. “However, it is the crown’s case that during this time there was a much darker aspect to this defendant’s character and behaviour, an aspect which his footballing roles, and the very significant power that came with them, gave him the opportunity to pursue and indulge,” the prosecutor said. “Throughout this period, this defendant was carrying out a widespread campaign of sexual abuse against many of those in his charge. This activity ranged from sticking his hand down their shorts to masturbating in front of them, from touching their legs and genitals while driving his car to sneaking into their bedroom to fondle them when they stayed overnight at his house. “For some boys, he appears to have developed a real, if somewhat perverse, affectionate attachment, telling them he loved them and getting them to display signs of affection towards him. For others, his sexual acts were more opportunistic, testing out how far he could go before his victim would rebuff him.” Feest continued: “Behind all this abuse lay a systematic and all-pervasive pattern of grooming behaviour. He gained the trust of the boys and their parents. The young footballers idolised the defendant. He held supreme power over their footballing futures. “The defendant manipulated these feelings and desires, making sure that in order not to feel left out, the young teenagers would join in with sexualised behaviour, their infatuation making them blind to the real nature of it. “Once their trust had been gained and their devotion to him made absolute, this predatory paedophile with a sexual interest in young teenage boys was able to act with near impunity.” As the calls came in to the helpline, Feest said, a picture emerged. Particular types of behaviour were repeatedly mentioned, such as being sexually assaulted under the pretext of being shown a training drill or being examined for injury. For many of the complainants – all adults now – it was the first time they had spoken of the alleged abuse, the court was told. Many wished they had come forward years ago, especially in the early 1990s when the defendant was investigated for similar offences and cleared at trial. Feest said: “It is the crown’s case that for the best part of 25 years this defendant had been a serial abuser of young teenage boys.” One alleged victim, who can be identified only as B, was spotted by Higgins when he was 13 and asked to a Southampton schoolboys’ training camp, the prosecutor said. “Being football-mad and thinking this might be his key to a bright future, [B] was very eager to go,” said Feest. “His mother put him on a train to London and the defendant picked him up at the station.” During the journey to the camp, the coach played love songs on the car cassette player and frequently touched the boy’s leg. Higgins allegedly massaged his thigh and genitals. B later refused to continue any contact with Southampton because of the alleged abuse and did not tell anyone what had happened for many years. Another alleged victim, C, had a professional career and won international caps, the court was told. He would wait to be picked up after training at Higgins’ house. When he was 14, he was sitting next to Higgins watching television. The defendant allegedly touched his penis. As with many complainants, C remained in contact with Higgins during his career, Feest said: “The defendant was such a central part of these boys’ lives … that many were unable to completely break the ties they had with him.” Another alleged victim, D, who signed schoolboy forms with Southampton, said Higgins was a father figure to him and players regarded him as “like a god”. He claimed Higgins touched him intimately during a massage, hiding what he was doing from another coach and a boy who were present. D looks back on the incident with “crushing disappointment”, wondering if he was on Southampton’s books only because Higgins had an ulterior motive. The court was told that Higgins had his favourites. He used to tell complainant H that he loved him. H would stay at Higgins’ home and he came to regard cuddles, goodnight kisses and alleged assaults as something he had to accept to progress his career, the court heard. But he was “fearful” and has a memory of being curled up in a ball, hoping nothing would happen. Complainant J, who became a successful professional player, said Higgins would play the Lionel Richie song Stuck On You on the car cassette player, and if he was in the middle seat in the back the defendant would wink at him in the mirror. He told police he did not come forward earlier because he felt he would be ridiculed in the football world. Higgins allegedly told another boy, L, that if he made accusations about him he would make sure he never played football again. Nevertheless, L fled and went on to play football. Later when he feared that Higgins might move to his new club, he packed his bags and left immediately. The court was told that there were alleged assaults by Higgins, who was married, during tours to the Gothia Cup in Sweden. Higgins has not been charged over those allegations because they they concerned events said to have happened abroad, the court was told. One alleged assault was said to have taken place on a ferry from Sweden, the court was told. Higgins shared a twin cabin with the complainant, allegedly getting into bed with the boy and touching his penis. The court was told Higgins could not be prosecuted for this as it was outside British jurisdiction.

I find it hard to believe that we have been married for a quarter of a century – it seems just a few years ago that we said our vows to each other. So much has happened since then. We met on a blind date arranged by our mutual friend Anne on 1 December 1991. As I was getting ready, I changed my outfit five times – I was that nervous about meeting you. Although there was an immediate attraction between us, I didn’t realise that I had met the man I was going to marry. We started dating on a regular basis and a mere 24 days later, on Christmas Eve, you proposed. It didn’t matter that we had been together for a little more than three weeks, I knew that I loved you and that what we had was special. We were married 18 months later, on 19 June 1993. We had such plans but, six months later, I fell ill. After a year of treatment, including surgery, we realised that my illness was chronic. Ill health forced me to retire due from a nursing job I truly loved. I was soon using a wheelchair when out of the house, and our hopes of having three children were put on hold. I became more and more depressed; I hardly left the house and I spent more time in bed. The one constant in my life through all this was you, my darling Pete. You never wavered in your support and love for me. Nothing was too much trouble and you helped me in any way you could, even helping to do my hair. Your continued love for me got me through the most awful time of my life. Although I remained ill, I started to live my life within those restrictions. After nine years, our dream came true when I gave birth to our long-awaited child in 2002. Maria brought an extra light into our life. You are a wonderful, loving and caring father. You work so hard in your factory job, but you never complain. Our home is such a happy place and the three of us laugh together every day. Your name means “rock” and you truly are the rock in my life. I cherish you and I want to wish you a very happy silver wedding anniversary. Thank you for the past 25 years – you have made me a very happy woman. I don’t know what the next 25 years holds for you, but I know that with you at my side I can face whatever comes.

As a child of the eighties, growing up in a science fiction bubble where daleks, vogons and the fighting machines of the War of the Worlds were at least as concrete to me as anything happening in the real world, After Man presented a biologically-themed alternative world to lose myself in. The premise of the book is simple: take the Earth today, remove the humans, and let evolution take its course for 50 million years. What new animals evolve? Of course, in other hands this approach could have resulted in a throwaway romp. In Dixon’s, it produced an incredibly detailed, thoughtful book, in which the principles of evolutionary theory and ecology are rigorously applied. Crypsis (adaptations to avoid being seen by either predators or prey) is a common theme, as is mimicry. And convergent evolution (the idea that unrelated organisms in similar ecological niches evolve similar adaptations) is everywhere. Each species has a scientific name which follows the conventions that taxonomists use, and the text describes their behaviours and inter-species interactions. The striking illustrations, with copious annotations, resemble a naturalist’s field notes. As well as being rigorous, After Man manages to be fun. On newly-formed volcanic islands in the Pacific, bats arrived before birds did, and radiated to occupy new niches. The Flooer, Florifacies mirabila, is one of these new species. The shape and colouring of its head mimics the appearance of a local flower, and its sweet-smelling saliva mimics nectar. It sits on the ground with its face upwards and its mouth open. It is, unsurprisingly, an insectivore. Dougal Dixon, who studied geology at the University of St Andrews, followed up After Man with two similar speculative biology books. In 1988, The New Dinosaurs: An Alternative Evolution was published, and explored a world where the end-Cretaceous mass extinction hadn’t wiped out the non-avian dinosaurs. Man after Man: An Anthropology of the Future came out in 1990, and speculated on the evolution of our own over the next five million years. There’s a whole generation of evolutionary biologists and palaeontologists who, like me, were inspired by his work. Happily, a new edition of After Man, featuring an updated introduction from Dougal Dixon and a new cover, has just has been published by Breakdown Press, so a new generation can revel in this landmark piece of speculative biology. There aren’t many areas of science where speculation is not only tolerated, but can be argued to be essential. Palaeontologists must take an incomplete body of evidence from fossils, and, like Dixon, apply their knowledge of how the natural world works, in order to understand the living organism as it once was. How far that speculation is allowed to expand beyond the existing physical evidence is a judgement call that the researcher, and often the palaeoartists they work closely with, must make. This theme is explored in All Yesterdays, by John Conway, CM Kosemen and Darren Naish, published in 2012. While the palaeontological reconstructions are fascinating, the most enlightening section of this book for me is the reconstructions of modern animals from their skeletons alone, some of which bear no resemblance to their real counterparts. I’ll never look at a baboon in quite the same way again. Comparative morphology and trace fossils, such as trackways, can tell us a certain amount about behaviour, but without a time machine, interpreting the behaviour of extinct animals is speculative. With soft part preservation rare or absent for most fossils, careful, conservative speculation is essential in reconstructing the appearance of organisms. That’s not to say that bolder speculation isn’t great fun: the reconstruction of elasmosaurs engaging in a neck-swinging competition for mates in All Yesterdays is wholly speculative, but certainly makes you consider all the facets of animal behaviour in the past that we will never be able to know about. And where there are differences between researchers in the degree of speculation, coupled with interpretation of the physical evidence, it can result in ‘interesting’ debates: witness the recent scuffles over a revived theory for aquatic dinosaurs (the #FordvNaish hashtag provides a taster). Speculative biology has been around ever since HG Wells tackled human evolution in The Time Machine in 1895, but its power to spark our imaginations, as well as inform our understanding of organisms through deep time, is undiminished. Careful, informed speculation is crucial to palaeobiology, and long may it continue."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/jun/01/friday-best-tv-africa-journey-into-music-the-bridge","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-01T05:20:40Z","webTitle":"Friday’s best TV: Africa – A Journey Into Music; The Bridge","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jun/01/friday-best-tv-africa-journey-into-music-the-bridge","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jun/01/friday-best-tv-africa-journey-into-music-the-bridge","fields":{"headline":"Friday’s best TV: Africa – A Journey Into Music; The Bridge","bodyText":"Africa: A Journey Into Music 10pm, BBC Four There could be no better guide for this series than the broadcaster DJ Rita Ray, who travels to South Africa, Mali and, in this opening episode, Nigeria to look at Africa’s great musical traditions.

Le Guin’s first three books about Earthsea centre on the male wizard Ged, with women “either marginal or essentially dependent on men”, according to the author herself. In director Arwen Curry’s forthcoming Worlds of Ursula K Le Guin, which Curry worked on with Le Guin for 10 years, the novelist speaks of how when she started writing, “men were at the centre” of fantasy and admits that “from my own cultural upbringing, I couldn’t go down deep and come up with a woman wizard”. The third book in the series, The Farthest Shore, was published in 1972. When Le Guin came to write the fourth, which centres on the female character, Tenar, she found it “just wouldn’t go”. It took her another 17 years to work out how to tell Tenar’s story, with the 1990 novel Tehanu. “What I’d been doing as a writer was being a woman pretending to think like a man … I had to rethink my entire approach to writing fiction … it was important to think about privilege and power and domination, in terms of gender, which was something science fiction and fantasy had not done,” Le Guin tells Curry. “All I changed is the point of view. All of a sudden we are seeing Earthsea … from the point of view of the powerless.” Although Le Guin won many awards during her lifetime, the documentary – which will premiere on 10 June at the Sheffield Doc/Fest – reveals her initial struggle to be published. Rejection letters from publishers in the 50s tell her, variously: “You write well and are obviously very erudite. But here you have a book that we feel, regretfully, would be of interest to very few American readers,” and “the basic subject matter and background is so remote that I could not encourage you to recast it from a practical point of view”, and “there would not be a large enough audience for a novel of this kind”. Le Guin tells Curry: “When I started writing, the basic assumption about fiction was that men were at the centre of it … I don’t know how many times I was told I write well, but, ‘we don’t know quite what you’re doing’. I was beginning to feel a little desperate. If I can’t publish anything except for the occasional poem in a tiny, tiny poetry magazine what am I doing? Am I kidding myself?” The documentary also features conversations with authors Michael Chabon, David Mitchell and Neil Gaiman, who credits Le Guin’s 1968 novel The Wizard of Earthsea, about a wizard at a magical school, with inspiring Harry Potter. “I don’t think Harry Potter could have existed without Earthsea. That was the original, the finest and the best,” Gaiman says in the documentary, adding: “What Ursula was having to navigate was the societal prejudices against science fiction, against the fantastic, and against children’s fiction. All of these things were marginalised.” The documentary makers, who funded the film with a combination of a grant and crowdfunding from more than 3,000 backers, describe Le Guin as an author who “defiantly held her ground on the margin of American letters until the sheer excellence of her work, at long last, forced the mainstream to embrace fantastic literature”. Le Guin died in January 2018, at the age of 88."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"film/2018/may/31/concealed-review-matlock-style-thriller-cant-hide-its-ibsen-ambitions","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-31T08:00:15Z","webTitle":"Concealed review – Matlock-style thriller can't meet its Ibsen ambitions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/may/31/concealed-review-matlock-style-thriller-cant-hide-its-ibsen-ambitions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/may/31/concealed-review-matlock-style-thriller-cant-hide-its-ibsen-ambitions","fields":{"headline":"Concealed review – Matlock-style thriller can't meet its Ibsen ambitions","bodyText":"Aspiring actor Max (Simon Lyndon) returns to Sydney from South Africa with his girlfriend, Sallie (Nadia Townsend), to audition for a big part. Unspoken recriminations seem to hang in the air between the tense couple, who go to sleep in separate rooms after Sallie discovers her wallet missing and a child’s elephant toy stuffed inexplicably in her bag. In the morning, Sallie is gone, and Max becomes increasingly concerned as the days go by and she fails to show up. Teaming up with his oldest friend Richard (Paul Tassone), Max turns amateur sleuth to find his missing girlfriend, with unexpected results. Conflict diamonds, illegal handguns and long dormant family secrets are eventually churned up in the plot’s tide while frequent time lapse shots of the ocean punctuate the proceedings and add ominous atmosphere. There’s a palpable sense that Australian writer-director Shane T Hall and his cast and crew were trying to make something edgy, urban and genre-hopping. Sadly, it’s more of a mud pie of contemporary thriller tropes that don’t hold together for long. The toy elephant in the room, in this case stuffed with contraband, is the weak cast. When, at one point, a supporting character insults Lyndon’s Max by positing that he’s probably a lousy actor, it’s hard not to giggle in agreement. Nor does it help that everything seems to have been shot through one of the more dour Instagram filters, creating a Sydney landscape that’s unexpectedly colourless and dull. That would be fine if the story had more bite and didn’t feel like an episode of Matlock that wants to be an Ibsen play when it grows up."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"public-leaders-network/2018/jun/05/slow-progress-women-fighting-political-influence","type":"article","sectionId":"public-leaders-network","sectionName":"Public Leaders Network","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-05T12:03:37Z","webTitle":"It may be slow progress, but women will keep fighting for political influence | Jane Dudman","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2018/jun/05/slow-progress-women-fighting-political-influence","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/public-leaders-network/2018/jun/05/slow-progress-women-fighting-political-influence","fields":{"headline":"It may be slow progress, but women will keep fighting for political influence","bodyText":"Every year, at the annual conference of global female political leaders, there is a group photo. It’s a heartwarming moment, when hundreds of elected politicians from almost every country in the world stand and smile for the camera. The image of so many women, and a couple of token men, makes a welcome change from the usual shots of world leaders. It will happen again on Thursday in Lithuania, when a group photo is firmly on the agenda of this year’s meeting of Women Political Leaders, the independent, international organisation based in Iceland that campaigns for more women and greater female influence in positions of political leadership. But behind the smiles, and despite what will no doubt be an upbeat opening speech by Dalia Grybauskaitė, the Lithuanian president, things remain tough for women trying to achieve positions of power. For one thing, it’s proving hard work to get more women into parliaments. According to the UN, as of June 2016, only 23% of all national parliamentarians were women. In 195 countries, as of October 2017, only 11 women were heads of state and 12 were heads of government. Globally, in June 2016 there were 38 states in which women account for less than 10% of parliamentarians in single or lower houses, including four chambers with no women at all. Not only is progress slow, but in other ways the position of female politicians is becoming more challenging. Violence against women appears to be increasing – a startling 82% of female parliamentarians who participated in a 2016 study by the Inter-Parliamentary Union reported having experienced some form of psychological violence (defined as remarks, gestures and images of a sexist or humiliating sexual nature made against them, or threats and/or mobbing to which they might have been subjected), mainly through social media, while in office. Nearly half of those surveyed (44%) reported having received death, rape, assault or abduction threats towards them or their families. Then there is the constant challenge to prove the difference it makes when women participate in parliamentary decision-making. Because, for some reason, it doesn’t ever seem enough that women exist and so should be part of their country’s political process, just like men. But that does mean one thing, at least: there is now a solid and growing body of evidence about the impact of having more diverse parliamentary bodies. As Minna Salami wrote last year, “not only are women in public office more likely to promote bills that address the socio-economic and political challenges facing disadvantaged groups, but their presence is also key to decreasing corruption and increasing political interest among young women. There should be no question about their value to all citizens.” And it’s not all bad news. Look at the record number of women standing in Lebanon’s first elections since 2009. The Scottish government has allocated £500,000 to encourage greater representation of women in political roles at all levels of Scottish society. London this year hosted the first ever conference on combating violence against female politicians. And this year’s prestigious World Mayor prize, which recognises the work of city and regional mayors around the world, is dedicated entirely to women, with the aim of encouraging more to consider a career in local government and to stand for political office.

Now scientists studying the brains of mice have revealed why, unpicking the pathways in the brain which result in sweet foods being perceived as nice and bitter foods as nasty. What’s more, they have managed to tinker with these routes so that mice get a kick out of a tasteless substance such as water, and have even managed to switch off such judgments completely. Researchers say the finding may help with the search for treatments for eating disorders. “The very concept of sweet, the very word sweet, implies this goodness, this reward, this craving that we link to it, and similarly bitter on the other side has an immediate meaning to it. So we wanted to know, how does the brain encode meaning on sensory experience?” said Charles Zuker, lead author of the research from Columbia University’s Zuckerman Institute. While the work was carried out in mice, Zuker said there could be parallels for the human brain and that understanding the brain circuits involved in taste and our responses to it might eventually open up the possibility of tinkering with our own responses to certain foods – including sugar cravings. The team has previously shown that chemicals behind sweet and bitter tastes are detected by different cells in the mouth and on the tongue of mice, and that the resulting signals then sent to different areas of a part of the brain known as the insular cortex, where the tastes are labelled as being sweet or bitter. Now the team say they have discovered how the identity of a taste as sweet or bitter is linked to a mouse’s perception of whether it is nasty or nice. Writing in the journal Nature, the team reveal how they used brain imaging techniques to reveal that the neurons from the insular cortex are connected to a number of different areas of the brain, including a part that processes emotions – the amygdala. Crucially, they found that where in the amygdala the signals are sent is different depending on whether the substance the mice consumed was sweet or bitter. The researchers then genetically modified mice so neurons in their amygdala responded to light. That allowed them to use light, via implanted optical fibres, to trigger the “sweet” or “bitter” regions of the amygdala when the mice entered different rooms of a test area, without the animals actually consuming anything. The upshot was that the mice avoided rooms in which researchers triggered the bitter area of the amygdala, but hung around in the room in which they triggered the sweet area. That, the team says, showed the “sweet” areas of the amygdala generate a positive experience, and the “bitter” ones a negative experience. The team also found that if the “sweet” area of the amygdala was triggered with light while the mice drank water – a neutral tasting substance – they guzzled the liquid, but turned their nose up at it if the “bitter” area of the amygdala was triggered. What’s more, the team found that mice which had been genetically modified so their amygdala could be turned off using a drug no longer lapped up sweet substances or shunned bitter ones when the drug was given. “Silencing the amygdala abolishes the emotive, hedonic component associated with what you and I would call sweet or bitter,” said Zuker. In addition, the team found that animals trained to go to a particular door in a test area depending on whether they were given a sweet or bitter substance were able to do so even when their amygdala was chemically turned off, meaning they could still tell the tastes apart. While the tests were small, with as few as three mice used in some, the team say the fact the same results were found many times over indicate a strong finding. Zuker said the results show the positive perception of sweetness is an innate association, probably down to an evolutionary drive for energy-rich foods, and that the identity of a taste and whether it is deemed nice or not involve two separate brain areas."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/may/30/rbs-cautions-against-a-restart-of-sale-of-taxpayers-stake","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-30T18:41:19Z","webTitle":"RBS cautions against a restart of sale of taxpayers' 71% stake","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/30/rbs-cautions-against-a-restart-of-sale-of-taxpayers-stake","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/may/30/rbs-cautions-against-a-restart-of-sale-of-taxpayers-stake","fields":{"headline":"RBS cautions against a restart of sale of taxpayers' 71% stake","bodyText":"Royal Bank of Scotland directors have faced angry questioning from shareholders over planned branch closures and the bank’s treatment of small businesses – and the bank’s finance chief has warned that now may not the best time for the government to restart sales of the taxpayers’ 71% stake in the lender. Speaking on the sidelines of the bank’s annual shareholders’ meeting in Edinburgh, Ewen Stevenson – who also unexpectedly announced that he is quitting RBS – said recent stockmarket jitters meant that an immediate sale may not be the best timing. “Obviously when you look at what’s been happening in the markets in the last few days, with Spain and Italy and a significant sell-off in bank stocks, I would be surprised if now is an optimum time to sell stocks,” Stevenson said. The government is hoping to sell £15bn worth of shares by 2023, around two-thirds of its stake, and reports have suggested that a sale of 10% of the bank’s shares could be imminent. The final obstacle to a sell-off was removed earlier this month when the bank reached a $4.9bn settlement with US authorities related to selling toxic mortgage-backed securities in the run-up to the financial crisis a decade ago. However, Stevenson also revealed that the government was unlikely to let the bank know its intentions. “Last time they gave [chief executive] Ross [McEwan] a call out of courtesy a few minutes before they were due to start selling.” McEwan apologised in his opening remarks for the way the bank’s Global Restructuring Group had treated small businesses seeking help in the wake of the global financial crisis. A report commissioned by the Financial Conduct Authority and finally released in February detailed “disgraceful” practices at GRG. One shareholder, Neil Mitchell, described how small firms were “targeted and destroyed” and told the board that he was aware of multiple suicides that he believed had been directly caused by the bank. In the wood-panelled conference hall of the RBS head office – designed by the bank’s disgraced former boss Fred Goodwin – McEwan insisted: “Any financial services business must always hold two things – its financial strength and its reputation. We lost both of these – we fell the furthest – but we have also changed the most. We are a different bank now.” A decade on from the bank’s taxpayer £45bn bailout, the chairman, Howard Davies, lauded a “landmark year” for the bank. RBS made a £750m profit last year – after nine years of huge losses. However, there were a number of heated interventions from shareholders. One eventually had the microphone removed as he continued to argue his case for greater accountability. The meeting also rejected the setting up of a shareholder committee that would give investors power over the pay levels of senior executives. A number of shareholders argued from the floor that such a committee could avoid a repeat of the “lack of integrity and fleecing of customers” that led to the 2008 bailout. The bank’s board had urged the proposal be rejected and the government voted its stake against, even though it has previously supported such moves. Representatives from rural Scotland described the plan for branch closures as “ripping the heart out of local communities”. A protest outside the conference hall, organised by Unite, called on the bank to reconsider its decision to close 62 branches in Scotland. The House of Commons Scottish affairs committee has described the plan as “a devastating blow to the affected communities”. Another 162 closures are planned in England and Wales. Community councillor and former RBS employee Alastair Forsyth, who had travelled from Aberdeen to join the protest, pointed out that the move to digital banking was not easy for those living in rural areas with limited broadband access. McEwan insisted RBS had to respond to changing customer trends and that all growth in payment volumes comes from digital platforms. Shareholder Peter de Vink expressed his disappointment that Goodwin had not faced legal action last year – which the bank avoided when it settled a legal row with shareholders who had supported a cash call in the months before its near collapse. He accused RBS of paying £1bn to spare its former CEO that embarrassment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/jun/03/my-friend-dahmer-review-portrait-serial-killer-young-man","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-03T08:00:41Z","webTitle":"My Friend Dahmer – portrait of the serial killer as a young man","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jun/03/my-friend-dahmer-review-portrait-serial-killer-young-man","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/jun/03/my-friend-dahmer-review-portrait-serial-killer-young-man","fields":{"headline":"My Friend Dahmer – portrait of the serial killer as a young man","bodyText":"“Friends are our connection to this world,” says Lionel Dahmer, concerned by the fact that his eldest son, Jeffrey, doesn’t seem to have any. Yet, as this film’s title suggests, Jeffrey Dahmer had at least one friend – John “Derf” Backderf, who wrote the bestselling, based-on-a-true-story graphic novel it’s adapted from. Jeffrey Dahmer would go on to become one of America’s most notorious serial killers, raping, murdering and cannibalising 17 young men, and confessing to his crimes in 1991. In this drama, writer-director Marc Meyers looks at Dahmer in his last year of high school in an attempt to figure out who he might have been before the atrocities that came to define him. In 1978, among the verdant forests of Bath, Ohio, Dahmer (Ross Lynch) collects roadkill, dissolving it in acid in a shed at the back of his garden. Dead cats; stiff, bloodied possums; unidentifiable animal corpses bottled in formaldehyde – he “likes” bones. “It interests me, what’s inside,” he mutters, palming dried bones as though they were worry beads. Chastised for his unsavoury after-school activities by his chemist father Lionel (Dallas Roberts), and butting heads with his erratic, depressed mother Joyce (Anne Heche – a little hammy here) at home, Dahmer also acts out in the classroom. Imitating an aggressive epileptic seizure, he becomes a source of fascination for a prankish group of boys including aspiring artist Derf (Alex Wolff of Nickelodeon show The Naked Brothers Band, and the forthcoming Hereditary). Interpreting his “spaz” attacks as a form of countercultural resistance, Derf and friends form the “Dahmer Fan Club”, putting him in the background of every school yearbook photo and encouraging him to continue this “performance art” in other public spaces. Meyers makes the most of the 70s setting, from Dahmer’s aviator glasses to the saturated gold-browns of Daniel Katz’s widescreen cinematography and the creeping hangover of the liberal excess that thrived in the previous decade, prior to Reagan’s America. He also makes the most of Lynch, a Disney Channel kid best known for his role on the TV series Austin &amp; Ally, and in the teen boyband R5. With a shock of blond hair that flops over his eyes, shuffling feet and a hunched, lumbering gait, Lynch’s performance is remarkably physical, internalising the way shame weighs down on the character’s shoulders. He doesn’t walk so much as stalk, his body dragging behind him as he slips further inside himself. There are glimmers of the icy charm that perhaps helped him seduce his victims – like in a scene where he persuades a younger female classmate to go to prom with him. Yet Dahmer isn’t really interested in women. He develops a crush, if you could call it that, on a male jogger who turns out to be a neighbouring doctor (Vincent Kartheiser), and wrangles a physical examination with “Dr Matthews”. The film’s single most interesting sequence sees Dahmer masturbating, his back to the camera, following their otherwise innocent encounter, convulsing in humiliation that quickly turns violent – and morbid. It would be troubling, lazy pop psychology to draw a straight line between Dahmer’s closeted homosexuality and his vicious impulses, but Lynch’s acting complicates this subplot. It’s not just the embarrassment of rejection that he captures but a clue – a kind of spark of recognition – about his sexuality, swiftly disregarded. “He’s not a sideshow attraction,” insists one of Dahmer’s friends, and Meyers tries his best not to treat him as such. Unlike the source material (a memoir written from Derf’s perspective), the film operates from a conventional, omniscient point of view, allowing the audience to experience Dahmer’s private moments. At times, the film struggles to permeate his psyche. However, the way the character wobbles between bizarre high-school band kid and burgeoning psychopath works as an acknowledgement of Derf’s fallible memory – after all, the film is based on his recollections, not Dahmer’s. Derf’s impulse to fill in the gaps – sometimes too simplistically – in order to make sense of the crimes his friend would commit feels like a queasy admission of complicity. It makes for something that ends up being sadder, weirder, more boring – but more convincing – than the average serial killer movie."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"books/2018/may/31/you-cannot-be-well-read-without-reading-women","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-31T10:28:00Z","webTitle":"You cannot be 'well read' without reading women | Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/31/you-cannot-be-well-read-without-reading-women","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/may/31/you-cannot-be-well-read-without-reading-women","fields":{"headline":"You cannot be 'well read' without reading women","bodyText":"Lauren Groff did something brilliantly subversive last week. In her New York Times By the Book Q&amp;A – an interview in which authors are asked such questions as “What’s the last great book you read?” and “What book by somebody else do you wish you had written?” – she named only women authors. You may not notice it at first, but about halfway through it clicks – perhaps because naming only women in a discussion about great books is so unusual, a point that she hammers home when asked about her ideal literary dinner party: “I would invite every woman writer I have mentioned here, plus hundreds of others I did not have space to name. I would serve unlimited quantities of excellent wine and we would get blitzed and the conversation may eventually meander to touch on that most baffling of questions: When male writers list books they love or have been influenced by — as in this very column, week after week — why does it almost always seem as though they have only read one or two women in their lives?” This week, a bookseller working at Waterstones in Uxbridge said on social media that, while they had never had a female customer say “I don’t read books written by men”, male customers tell them they don’t read women at least once or twice a month. This, predictably, led to a cacophony of “not all men”s, and the original point was somewhat lost. It’s certainly true that there are male readers out there who read women: my father, for one, loves Ursula K Le Guin and James Tiptree Jr (aka Alice Bradley Sheldon), has read The Golden Notebook and greatly admires the work of Gitta Sereny. (He also introduced me to the poetry of Hera Lindsay Bird.) Several of my male friends read women, too. I remember a few years back being pathetically impressed when my friend, a neuroscientist, said his favourite author was Virginia Woolf. So, I’m aware such readers exist. But the fact remains that many men continue to be put off by a female name on a book cover, especially if that cover looks cutesy or at all feminine – just look at the books of Elena Ferrante, one of the greatest novelists writing today. As Groff said, male novelists and critics too rarely cite women writers as influences. What we consider “great literature” continues to be shaped by men, because too many men only consider other men to be worthy competitors (and indeed, maybe such novelists aren’t so much interested in learning about humanity as they are in learning about other male novelists, so that they can then strive to better them). Much has been made of the notion that the era of the “Great White Male Novelist” is coming to a close. Readers are crying out for new voices, but I remain unconvinced they’ll get the attention they deserve. The privileged do not relinquish their power so easily; they’ll continue to read and recommend one another, glad-handing those that fit the mould, offering those vital leg-ups that are elusive not just to female authors, but authors from other backgrounds, too. I overheard at a party recently that if you don’t have a quote from a male novelist on your novel then it won’t do well. While I doubt such a generalisation is completely true, it did strike fear into this first-time novelist. (All my endorsements are from – brilliant – women.) What baffles me – and I have written about this before – is that you can read only male authors and somehow consider yourself well read. Lots of feminists didn’t like Philip Roth, but my God, they read him. Female readers do not have the same myopia, perhaps because male authors claim a universality of which women writers tend to steer well clear. As Anne Enright once wrote: “If a man writes ‘The cat sat on the mat’ we admire the economy of his prose; if a woman does we find it banal.” Let’s be honest: you are not “well read” if you don’t read women. You cannot consider yourself a man of letters if you leave the women of letters on the bookshop shelf. Just as we would regard anyone who said “I don’t read the Russians” or “I don’t read working-class authors” as shallow, saying “I don’t read women” just makes you look as though you lack curiosity. We all have our preferences, or things that we just don’t get, but to proudly proclaim your ignorance? That’s something else."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/31/education-prison-work-ex-offenders-university-convictions","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-31T07:00:13Z","webTitle":"Education is one way out of prison.

Let’s make work another","bodyText":"The news that ex-offenders wanting to study at university will no longer have to declare their criminal convictions is welcome, though long overdue. Announcing the move Ben Jordan, from the university admissions service, Ucas, said he hoped the change in policy reaffirmed that “higher education is open to everyone”. It’s better late than never. But our high seats of learning should not expect an avalanche of applications from those with criminal convictions. By and large, offenders tend to come from more fractured backgrounds than those who walk the straight and narrow, and this is reflected in the educational statistics from our jails. Around one in three prisoners in England and Wales in 2015-16 were identified as having a learning disability or difficulty, and sadly it has long been established that around half of all prisoners have a reading age below that of an average child of 10. But those offenders who learn, some later than others, that education can be a path leading away from crime and punishment tend to embrace it. Many times in prison, I have seen teachers, new to their surroundings, being overwhelmed by the keenness and positivity of their inmate students. And of the several dozen former prisoners I know personally who went on to study at university , only one has reoffended. As Nina Champion, from the Prisoners’ Education Trust, said: “People with convictions who are applying to university are showing a huge commitment to turning their lives around and society should support them.” If education is a way out of offending, surely work is another route. On my last prison sentence, in an open jail, I had a job in the community, working long hours and enjoying every minute of it. Why wouldn’t I? The work was in a hotel, and I cycled there through beautiful countryside. All while being paid wages and serving my time. But a good number of my fellow travellers in the jail were not, I thought, as fortunate as me. They were employed in a nearby meat processing and packaging factory. With temperatures ranging from cold to freezing, and the pay in keeping with the climate, you might have thought they would be glad to see the back of their workplace when their time was up. Not so: I had it on good authority back then that a significant number of men relocated to the area of the prison after their release in order to carry on working in the plant as free men. And now, 20 years later, and earning my crust as a hack writing mainly about prisons and the criminal justice system, I come across many ex-prisoners who have found a niche in the workplace and reward their employers, who have taken them on irrespective of their previous “form”, with hard work and honesty. Employers such as James Timpson, chief executive of the multinational chain of shoe repair shops, actively seek to employ people with criminal convictions. Timpson has told me heartwarming success stories that have resulted from this approach. Would that more bosses would follow suit. But many former prisoners will have to continue to declare their convictions, even if they are very old, when applying for jobs. Some convictions remain with the offender for life, never to be “spent”. A couple of my offences fall into that category. If I were to apply for a new job tomorrow, I would have to declare my criminal past. It’s not a problem for me now, as I write about my criminal and penal history in the course of my work, and it sits easily with me. But if I were applying for a “normal job”, coming clean would almost certainly be to my disadvantage among the majority of employers. My last conviction was in 1995, but my 23 crime-free years since, after almost half a century of offending, would not cut me a bit of slack. For some jobs, some criminal convictions will always be relevant, for example convictions relevant for safeguarding for those working with children and vulnerable people. But for far too many ex- (I repeat, ex-) offenders, the punishment continues, long after they thought the prison gates had closed behind them. • Eric Allison is the Guardian’s prisons correspondent"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/may/30/edward-burne-jones-masterpieces-briar-rose-persues-paintings-united-first-time-tate-britain","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-30T15:13:11Z","webTitle":"Edward Burne-Jones masterpieces to be united for first time","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/may/30/edward-burne-jones-masterpieces-briar-rose-persues-paintings-united-first-time-tate-britain","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/may/30/edward-burne-jones-masterpieces-briar-rose-persues-paintings-united-first-time-tate-britain","fields":{"headline":"Edward Burne-Jones masterpieces to be united for first time","bodyText":"Two of the most famous cycles of paintings by the 19th-century artist Edward Burne-Jones – one never completed, even though he caused his unfortunate client to rebuild part of his home to hold them – will be united for the first time in an exhibition at Tate Britain this autumn. Although Burne-Jones’s dreamy-eyed maidens and muscular heroes in melancholy romantic settings became some of the best-loved paintings in British art and influenced generations of artists including Pablo Picasso, this will be the first large exhibition in London in decades and the first at the Tate since 1933, the centenary of his birth. Burne-Jones loathed the impressionist painters – instead of capturing the moment he liked to brood over work in his studio for years or even decades – and he fell out of critical favour after his death in 1898. However, the public never fell out of love with his work. Many works coming to the exhibition were sensations when first displayed. In 1890, thousands paid to see the Briar Rose cycle at Agnews gallery in London, and ever larger crowds descended when the paintings were shown for free at Toynbee Hall in the East End. The Tate’s lead curator of British art to 1900, Alison Smith, said the artist’s work had contemporary resonance, partly because of the public’s renewed enthusiasm for fantasy. “Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings, Game of Thrones – those are pure Burne-Jones,” she said. Although the exhibition will include stained glass and tapestry, many designed for his friend and fellow social reformer William Morris, as well as portraits, gifts he made for family and friends, and a piano painted inside and out with scenes from the story of Orpheus and Eurydice, the centrepiece will be some of his most ambitious projects, the Briar Rose and Perseus cycles of paintings. The Briar Rose paintings – each almost 3 metres long, illustrating the fairytale with the artist’s daughter, Margaret, as Sleeping Beauty – are still in the house for which they were bought in 1890, Buscot Park in Oxfordshire. For the first time they are being loaned with the decorative panels Burne-Jones created to link the paintings on the walls of the Georgian saloon. The client for the Perseus cycle had a harder time: the 26-year-old MP and future prime minister Arthur Balfour was required to block up windows and change doors to make room for a 10-painting telling of the Greek hero Perseus’s rescue of Andromeda. Though Burne-Jones took a meticulous approach, including having the monster that Perseus battles created as a full-scale wax model for his studio, the project was never completed. Smith said while there are photographs, she had been unable to trace the monster for the exhibition. The four finished paintings are on loan from the Staatsgalerie in Stuttgart, Germany, with 10 full-scale drawings showing the full grandeur of his plan arriving from Southampton City Art Gallery. Smith said Burne-Jones decided to become an artist before he knew how to be one, abandoning theology studies at Oxford to become an apprentice to the pre-Raphaelite artist and poet Dante Gabriel Rossetti. He was elected to the prestigious Society of Painters in Watercolour, but it disapproved of his thick paint and sombre colours instead of the light, translucent style of more typical English watercolourists. In 1870, Phyllis and Demophoön, with its full-frontal male nude, was regarded as scandalous. Instead of agreeing to make the man more “respectable” with a flutter of drapery, Burne-Jones abandoned the society and became more closely associated with the pre-Raphaelite group and his friend Morris. Many loans are from private collectors, including the Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page, who is locked in battle with his neighbour Robbie Williams over development plans that could affect his antique-stuffed gothic mansion in Kensington, south-west London. “People were really anxious to come on board,” Smith said. “We were offered more works than we could show. Maybe we should have had a second overflow exhibition.” The Edward Burne-Jones exhibition will be at Tate Britain in south-west London from 24 October until 24 February 2019."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"books/2018/may/30/chuck-palahniuk-agent-accountant-faces-charges-fight-club","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-30T13:19:20Z","webTitle":"Chuck Palahniuk 'close to broke' as agent's accountant faces fraud charges","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/30/chuck-palahniuk-agent-accountant-faces-charges-fight-club","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/may/30/chuck-palahniuk-agent-accountant-faces-charges-fight-club","fields":{"headline":"Chuck Palahniuk 'close to broke' as agent's accountant faces fraud charges","bodyText":"Fight Club author Chuck Palahniuk has said that he is “close to broke” after it emerged that an accountant at his literary agency had been arrested for embezzling $3.4m (£2.5m) from the company. Darin Webb, an accountant at Donadio and Olson in New York, was charged on 15 May with “defraud[ing] a literary agency during his engagement as that agency’s bookkeeper, by converting funds that belonged to the agency and its clients to his own use”. The charge states that Webb allegedly admitted in video interviews that he prepared monthly financial reports and sent emails to the agency’s clients “that contained false and fraudulent representations, in order to accomplish the theft and evade detection”. The complaint does not name the literary agency, but the name was confirmed to the New York Post by Donadio and Olson’s lawyer. Palahniuk – one of many starry authors represented by the firm, including the estates of Mario Puzo and Studs Terkel – said his income had dwindled for several years. He had blamed multiple factors, including piracy and problems at his publisher, for the decline in earnings. More recently, Palahniuk said, “the trickle of my income stopped” and payments for titles including Fight Club 2 “never seemed to arrive”. He wondered if the money had been stolen, but told himself he “had to be crazy” – until the news broke. “All the royalties and advance monies and film-option payments that had accumulated in my author’s account in New York, or had been delayed somewhere in the banking pipeline, [were] gone. Poof. I can’t even guess how much income. Someone confessed on video he’d been stealing. I wasn’t crazy,” wrote Palahniuk in a statement on his website. The novelist said that “this chain of events leaves me close to broke”, but that he had found himself to be “rich … with friends and readers who’ve rushed to my rescue”. “On the minus side, the legal process will be long and offers an iffy reward. On the plus side, I’m not crazy. Nor am I alone,” added the author. Webb’s alleged activities emerged when an unnamed author did not receive an expected payment of $200,000, and repeatedly asked him where it was. From November 2017 to March 2018, “Webb sent emails … to the author containing false explanations as to why the author had not yet received the funds he was owed. In truth and in fact, the author did not receive the payment because Webb had converted the funds to Webb’s own use,” says the charge. Webb was arrested and is currently in custody. FBI assistant director William F Sweeney Jr said in a statement: “As alleged, Darin Webb was responsible for the financial welfare of the agency whose accounts he oversaw, but instead of upholding his fiscal responsibilities, he spent his time swindling more than $3.4m from his victims. Cooking the books rarely pays off in the long run, as the defendant has learned today.” A lawyer for Donadio and Olson told the New York Post: “The agency’s singular focus at this time is ensuring that all of its impacted clients are made whole to the greatest extent possible, and the agency is co-operating in every possible way with the government’s efforts.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"higher-education-network/2018/jun/01/awarding-university-subjects-gold-medals-is-deeply-flawed","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-01T07:30:43Z","webTitle":"Awarding university subjects gold medals is deeply flawed | Hetan Shah","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2018/jun/01/awarding-university-subjects-gold-medals-is-deeply-flawed","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/higher-education-network/2018/jun/01/awarding-university-subjects-gold-medals-is-deeply-flawed","fields":{"headline":"Awarding university subjects gold medals is deeply flawed","bodyText":"The government’s teaching excellence framework, or Tef as it’s usually known, is supposed to eventually measure the quality of teaching in each subject at every university. The idea is that the data will help future students make improved choices about where to study, and that it will incentivise better, more transparent behaviour from universities. These are all laudable aims, but what if the tool isn’t right for the job? There is a real risk that the Department for Education’s statistically inadequate approach will lead to distorted results, misleading rankings and a system which lacks validity and is unnecessarily vulnerable to being gamed. The original Tef evaluated the whole institution, and our response at the time was critical of its methodology. But the new subject-level Tef introduces further issues [pdf]. In trying to allocate each subject a bronze, silver or gold it has introduced more complexity to the operation, which makes gaming more likely. It will also rely on smaller, more uncertain sample sizes. The Tef doesn’t work because it assesses what we can, rather than what we should, measure. It incorporates employment metrics even though graduate jobs may be a result of family background and income rather than university teaching. It also uses the numbers of students per class to capture teaching intensity, which is too simplistic. And it’s too reliant on the National Student Survey, which doesn’t measure teaching, but rather how students generally feel about their course, which can be affected by a wide range of factors. For instance, London universities have lower scores which are often attributed to the cost of living in the capital. The NSS is also an unstable data source – in 2017 around 25 student unions boycotted the NSS, leading to the data being invalid in a number of universities. So the Tef is measuring things which have a limited relationship with “teaching excellence”. Further, there will be a lot of statistical uncertainty surrounding any given TEF score, making comparisons (a primary purpose of the whole exercise) close to useless.A new book by Professor Jerry Muller argues that we are seeing the rise of metric fixation, and that this inevitably leads to gaming of the system. The architects of the Tef are not particularly mindful of how the system leaves itself open to being played. We have seen this in many other arenas of public policy. Think of NHS waiting targets where the National Audit Office found many hospitals under-recording wait times. Or school league tables, where teachers have focused on getting D-grade students up to C grades to the exclusion of the needs of other students – as this is what makes the difference for the league table score. Nobody knows how much the entire Tef exercise will cost. Jo Johnson, the minister who introduced the Tef, said he wanted to avoid it being a “big, bossy and bureaucratic” process. But partly in response to the criticism that the metrics underlying the Tef are poor, new qualitative panels have been introduced, pushing the costs up. Meanwhile, the main reason many universities adopted Tef was because the government linked it to increases in student fees. This idea has now been ditched, so there is less of an incentive for universities to take part. In the long run, the public learn which data they can trust – and which they can’t. Over time, people will realise that Tef doesn’t really tell us very much and will lose trust in the numbers. In the meantime, the whole exercise will waste enormous amounts of time, energy and funding. There are lessons from history. The teaching quality assessment (TQA) was a project run over a decade to judge the quality of teaching across universities. It was abandoned in 2001, and was widely thought not to have been worth the cost in time or resources. “The dons have outsmarted the government by turning the exercise into a game and playing it brilliantly,” said Prof Geoffrey Alderman, a former TQA assessor, when it ended. That’s not to say that students don’t need better data on universities so that they can make better choices. We could tell them about the quality of the teaching environment – including class sizes, IT provision, libraries – but we should not pretend this is measuring teaching excellence. To do that properly would be a seriously expensive exercise, using unannounced observation of classes, similar to Ofsted in schools, and looking at how each institution embeds mechanisms for accrediting, assessing and rewarding teaching. The new universities minister, Sam Gyimah, has nothing personally invested in this system. It’s rare for ministers to have a policy option that would save money, be popular, and be the right thing to do. Not proceeding further with the Tef is one such rare opportunity. The minister should take it. • Hetan Shah is the executive director of the Royal Statistical Society Join the higher education network for more comment, analysis and job opportunities, direct to your inbox.

It will be much harder to repair the relationship if you don’t both acknowledge what went wrong – and either or both of you may be making assumptions about the other’s actions. But try not to obsess if you can’t identify clear reasons why your relative has cut off contact with you.

There could be an opportunity for learning to come out of this, and you may find it easier to build bridges once wounds begin to heal. Build bridges. If possible, keep lines of communication open by sending the occasional friendly card and message. If you want to heal the rift, is it appropriate to send an apology and a request to meet?

I notice Meghan was in ivory-tinged nylons for her first engagement of married life in May, with the temperature showing 22C. What’s going on? Marina, west London Requested deep dive completed. You are not alone, Marina of west London, in noticing the awful beige tights Meghan wore last week. They immediately became the most talked about fashion item of the month, gazumping Meghan’s wedding dress. Think of it as that ubiquitous “distracted boyfriend” meme, in which a man eyes up some woman to the disgust of his girlfriend. Us = the man. New woman = Meghan’s new tights. Girlfriend = Meghan’s wedding dress. Really, who needs columns any more when we can all just communicate in memes? Anyway, these tights were shocking for two reasons: first, Meghan had heretofore, like all good Cali girls, always gone bare-legged and, two, they were “flesh coloured” but not the colour of her actual flesh. Perhaps a courtier saw her coming down the hall, spotted those unacceptably naked legs, ran into Beatrice or Kate’s room, rooted through their laundry basket and pulled out the first pair of half-clean tights they found. Remember how we were all so excited two weeks ago that a mixed-race woman marrying into the royals proved the Windsors were finally shaking off their racist not-too-distant past? Well, there were always going to be bumps on their journey to the present day, I guess. But even leaving aside the colour of the tights, there are the tights themselves. You know how all those British romcoms about love across the Atlantic go, with American women bringing their Americanness to British men, teaching them to be open about their feelings and to stop only hanging out with people they went to school with? Well, that is not the way this story is going to play out. Meghan’s new coat of arms may be “California-inspired” with its blue background (like the ocean, see) and yellow lines (like the sun, see) but that is as far as the House of Windsor is going to go in accommodating Meghan’s individuality: she isn’t bringing her plucky Americanness to them; they are forcing their flesh tights Windsorness on her. (Incidentally, my absolutely favourite headline about the Duchess of Sussex’s new coat of arms was: “Will Meghan Markle’s new California-inspired coat of arms convince millennials to embrace traditional heraldry?” Tl;dr, no!) Bad tights and the Windsors go together like the older royals and blackamoor brooches: long after everyone else consigned them to the dustbin of shame, the royals consider them the crucial finishing touch. Diana wore some terrible tights – including shiny beige ones for her famous solo photocall in front of the Taj Mahal. Proving Windsors never change, they just interchange: Kate, Beatrice and Eugenie also go for beige ones and sheer black ones, looks favoured by no one in the 21st century outside the home counties, and the London postcodes SW1, SW3, SW6 and W8. Must female Windsor legs be covered in case they excite too much male excitement, like the apocryphal table legs in the Victorian era? And are beige ones the new uniform? “No, it is not true!” one royal expert recently insisted in an American fashion magazine. Well, thank God for that. “They are at liberty to choose whatever colour tights they wish!” Oh. “I think the only reason they have chosen ‘nude’ in recent years is because they have become so much more fashionable, and the ‘bare legs’ look became the craze.” Well, I don’t know if I would have called it a “craze”, but it’s good to know that “the ‘bare legs’ look” is allowed, even if bare legs aren’t. I was intrigued about how things would pan out for Meghan, fashion-wise. It was easy to see the future with Harry’s previous girlfriends: if he had married Chelsy Davy it would have been an Andy and Fergie re-run; Harry and Cressida Bonas looked like a Charles and Diana repeat (again, just in the fashion sense). But how would a California actor emerge from the Windsor meat grinder, which has chewed up so many women before her? We’re still in the early days, of course, but the beige tights are a deeply ominous sign. You know that famous saying: if eyes are the window to a woman’s soul, then bad tights are the awful curtains that your in-laws make you hang, ruining your trendy new loft extension."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/aug/31/what-my-grandmothers-taught-me-being-mixed-race","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-08-31T12:00:25Z","webTitle":"Granny, Teta and me: what my grandmothers taught me about being mixed race","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/aug/31/what-my-grandmothers-taught-me-being-mixed-race","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/aug/31/what-my-grandmothers-taught-me-being-mixed-race","fields":{"headline":"Granny, Teta and me: what my grandmothers taught me about being mixed race","bodyText":"It was a glorious July afternoon and my Arab grandmother – Teta, we called her – was being daubed liberally with margarine by my Scottish grandmother. On a goofy impulse, Teta had climbed inside an inflatable rubber ring and become stuck. We all took turns trying to budge it, but she was lodged firmly. So, Granny retrieved a tub of marge. My grandmothers wept with laughter as Granny smeared Teta with grease until the ring popped off like a champagne cork. We all cheered. Teta decided not to go swimming after all. When my parents met in the 1980s, they were newly arrived in England. My father was a posh international graduate student from Beirut and my mother was a working-class Scottish girl doing night shifts in the local pub while working as a librarian. They were married in a civil and a Muslim service, where my grandparents exchanged gifts to symbolise the union of our families: a kilt and a jellaba. My siblings and I grew up in London and negotiated our divided identity with no small amount of confusion and crisis. Our grandparents represented the extreme split in our heritage. We spent a summer under Israeli bombardment in Beirut with my Arab grandparents; we spent winter evenings tucked up next to a gas fire eating mince and tatties with my Scottish grandparents. I had rarely seen my grandmothers in the same room until one year we decided to take a joint family holiday in Cornwall. I was 10. My grandmothers were my heroes in different ways. A chain-smoking maverick in a pinafore, Granny was from a small mining village in the middle of Scotland. She was a snooker connoisseur with a lusty baritone and a love of grisly police procedurals. Tirelessly productive, she crocheted blankets at a rate of one a day. Granny believed in fortification against discomfort; she was a consummate master of the cosy. On cold evenings, she would warm our beds with an electric blanket and a hot-water bottle, then tuck us in so tightly that we lay bound to the bed, sweating and gasping for breath. My other grandmother is the most eccentric person I have met. Irreverent and misleadingly ditzy, she gleefully stole from hotels, trespassed for wild flowers and drove like a Beiruti speed racer. Teta was from a privileged background: she had grown up in a mansion and was the sister of a Lebanese prime minister. She was well educated and sophisticated. She had an ear for classical music, spoke three languages fluently and performed calculations in French. She was a friend of Kim Philby and Patricia Highsmith, but, if you asked her questions about the glamorous people she had met, she would produce breathless and giggly anecdotes about their pets. The summer we arranged the joint holiday, I counted down the days until I would be cosseted by so much grandmotherly attention. But, in the weeks leading up to the trip, I began to worry. Granny did not like to go swimming or go on walks. Granny went to church; Teta cackled at the idea of mosque. Granny cooked; Teta had a cook. In the narcissistic preoccupation of identity politics, my siblings and I assessed each other against a roving scale of categorisations: were we like Granny – pragmatic, stoic, competent? Or were we fussy, flamboyant and impulsive, like Teta? The summer began and we piled into a huge rented house. Granny was palpably nervous – she did not know how to be lazy. I had seen photos of my mother’s childhood holidays, with Granny wrapped in a blanket and a woollen hat on a grey pebbled beach. It was probably August. But now that we had secured a summer vacation with nothing for her to do, or fix, or crochet, Granny could not sit still. “It’ll just take a minute,” was her perpetual refrain as she leapt to her feet to adjust cushions or make cups of tea. Teta was the youngest of 12; she had grown up with an army of sibling caretakers, while Granny had been a lifelong caregiver. Teta was enthusiastic about the luxury of leisure time. Each evening, she counted down to the curfew of a permissible whisky, while Granny perched on the edge of her seat, unable to give herself permission to relax. One Saturday, I dragged them on an expedition to the tiny, slanted high street. I had an ulterior motive for the outing: a lurid confection I had spied in the window of a sweet shop. Vivid pink with a stripe of white through the middle, it conjured the Enid Blyton magic of a bucolic childhood I never experienced, as I grew up in the middle of London. I fantasised about this treat for days – I was delirious for it. When the afternoon arrived for a special outing to the shop, I was half-crazed with anticipation. After my first mouthful, however, I broke into grief-stricken tears. It was coconut-flavoured. I sobbed. The pink and white stripes did not taste different at all. I was devastated. A betrayal! My grandmothers locked eyes. “Don’t waste it,” they said in unison. While food waste hardly seems a foundation for a friendship, it was the first time I had seen them agree wholeheartedly. Their parsimony about food immediately became a point of solidarity. Teta would cut around putrid sores in fruit and then nibble them up: “Mmm,” she would say, “delicious.” Granny sawed the burnt crusts off my toast and then crunched them herself. That summer, Teta and Granny commandeered the kitchen. The meals were delicious, but the leftovers were a plague. During each meal, they were dutifully returned to the Tupperware, the same plate of rice and peas hardened into a glistening shell. Dingy rags of chicken skin sat in saucers of stiff dripping. Table crumbs were scattered on the lawn for the birds. At restaurants, Teta would fold tiny scraps into her napkin and hide them in her handbag, bringing them out again at home with a flourish. “Look,” she would cry, “liver!” Over pots of boiling stock, my grandmothers shared jokes and stories, poking fun at us, at themselves. Despite their differences, they shared histories of personal struggles. Two of Teta’s houses and their entire contents had been bombed and occupied. Granny had worked her entire life, securing her financial independence through difficult jobs: at a petrol station; at a hospital, where she washed and prepared bodies after death. Teta was a breast cancer survivor. But their tragedies were discussed with a shared insouciant challenge to authority, an irreverent form of defiant resilience. Granny’s osteoarthritis pained her every move, but good luck to anyone who suggested she sit down and relax. With cheerful enthusiasm, Teta encouraged us to play catch with her prosthetic breast. At the time, I had been afraid that my grandmothers’ differences were an omen of something incongruent about me and my siblings. While I know as an adult that mixed-race families are not a magic solution to racism, as a child their friendship seemed to validate our bothness. One Sunday, when Granny made pancakes still lemony from washing-up liquid left in the pan, she and Teta sat down and ate the whole pile together. Watching them scoff and laugh and gobble up inedible pancakes acted as reassurance for my childish anxieties that it was possible to be Scottish and Arab, Presbyterian and Muslim; that we could navigate the contradictions through squabbling, forgiving, loving and Tupperware. My grandmothers died within months of each other in 2004. In a total coincidence, Teta was buried next to a gravestone sharing Granny’s name. I think of their friendship whenever I scoop a froth of mould from the top of jam or boil up carrot shavings for stock. And I am still surprised that they agreed to waste the margarine.

Yet the latest takeover of a stalwart of the Belgian scene, this time by the Qatari royal family, has caused something of an existential crisis. The Flemish daily newspaper Het Nieuwsblad asked: “How Belgian is Belgian chocolate, if just about all the top players are in foreign hands?” The founder of Galler, the latest chocolaterie to be purchased, is at least surviving the Qatari takeover. Jean Galler, who once enthused that “chocolate is freedom”, is being retained by the House of al-Thani, headed by Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, the emir of Qatar, as creative director. Last year, the Liège chocolate company recorded a record turnover of €35m and a recurring gross operating profit of €2.5m. The acquisition is the latest foreign takeover of a Belgian chocolate company. Guylian, founded by Guy Foubert in 1958, is owned by the South Korean conglomerate Lotte. Jacques, founded in 1896, is owned by the Dutch business Baronie. Côte d’Or (1883) and Meurisse (1845) belong to the US confectionary group Mondelēz. Dominique Persoone, a chocolatier, told Het Nieuwsblad: “Of course, it is a pity that foreign companies are buying up our crown jewels. I feel it myself: every week, there is a Chinese or Arab person calling me who says he wants to invest millions to grow and conquer the world.” Guy Gallet, the secretary general of the Royal Belgian Association of the Chocolate, Praline, Biscuits and Sugar Confectionery Industries (Choprabisco), was sanguine on the issue. “If they are owned by a foreign company, or the capital is in foreign hands, that is of less importance than that they are creating employment in Belgium,” he told the Guardian. “There are a lot of French wines, French châteaux, that have foreign investors, but the wine is still French. It is the same story.” Asked what makes Belgian chocolate special, Gallet said: “It is the heritage, the knowledge, the expertise. The blending and the selection of the cocoa beans. “In general, the bean is ground to a very small particle size so it is smooth in the mouth. And no other vegetable fat is used, although it is allowed.” Questioned as to whether Belgian chocolate could be made outside the country, he insisted: “No, of course not. We have a code of practice and companies know that a Belgian chocolate has to be made in Belgium.” Exports have nearly doubled in the past 18 years, from 300,000 to 600,000 tonnes. Gallet said Choprabisco was now working on an application for EU’s geographical indications. “If we hear of a maker saying their chocolates are Belgian, which are not made in Belgium, then we write to them. We try to do it in a friendly way,” he said. “It depends on national laws, but in Europe, you cannot mislead the consumer. With products that say they are Belgian flavour, or a Belgian collection, it is difficult. But we are applying for geographical protection to be proactive rather than reactive. It has to be protected.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2018/may/30/meet-jacob-burckhardt-the-thinker-who-invented-culture","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-30T13:34:20Z","webTitle":"Meet Jacob Burckhardt, the thinker who invented 'culture' | Jonathan Jones","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2018/may/30/meet-jacob-burckhardt-the-thinker-who-invented-culture","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2018/may/30/meet-jacob-burckhardt-the-thinker-who-invented-culture","fields":{"headline":"Meet Jacob Burckhardt, the thinker who invented 'culture'","bodyText":"The bicentenary of the birth of a Swiss historian might not seem the most glamorous of anniversaries. Unlike his contemporary Karl Marx, also born in 1818, Jacob Burckhardt never inspired any revolutions and doesn’t get his face on T-shirts. Yet some of us are celebrating the 200th birthday of Jacob Burckhardt lavishly. This week a British Academy conference reinterprets his intellectual legacy with contributions from leading international scholars and me, kicking off with a public event tonight at the Warburg Institute. What’s all the fuss about? Take a look at the names of the Guardian’s online sections: opinion, sport, culture ... why culture? Once upon a time, newspapers used to have arts sections. Today, they’ve caught up – very belatedly – with Burckhardt. The use of the term culture to mean a broad and changing flow of forms from opera to video games may seem like an innovation of the postmodern age, but it actually goes back to Burckhardt’s 1860 book The Civilisation of the Renaissance in Italy. Burckhardt invented culture as we know it – not just the official “arts”, but any human activity that has symbolic meaning. Newspapers and their websites are still behind Burckhardt on this. Looking for articles about fashion and food? You’ll find them in “lifestyle”. Burckhardt saw these too as culture. Of course, so do we – it would just get hard to organise stuff if it was all classed in one big mix. But everyone knows today that clothes are significant cultural creations and that cooking is about meaning as much as flavour. The amazing thing is how clearly Burckhardt saw it 1860. The Civilisation of the Renaissance in Italy has not one single chapter dedicated to Renaissance art. It does have, however, a section called Ridicule and Wit. Burckhardt explores every nuance of how people expressed themselves in 15th-century Italy, from cruel jokes to street festivals. In one of his most astonishing insights he even explores how people listened – he shows how sitting through long speeches was a cultural rite in itself. It’s a revelation that makes you think about music and performance in a totally new way. One day, someone will write the history of how we listen today, the cultural history of headphones and podcasts. And that historian will owe everything to Burckhardt. So who was this daring thinker? His portrait on Switzerland’s 1,000-franc note makes him look stern yet sensitive. Born in Basel to a wealthy family and educated in Berlin, where he was taught by the pioneering historian Leopold von Ranke, he doesn’t come across as much of a rebel. Yet Burckhardt’s work is an insidious attack on Germanic nationalism. Writing at a time when Prussia was leading the unification of Germany and pride in Teutonic northern virtues was growing, Burckhardt went out of his way to belittle north European achievements and show that Italy was the true source of European genius. There is a sensual, amoral intensity to his vision of the Renaissance. He thrills to the ruthless violence of Cesare Borgia, and of Ferrante, ruler of Naples, who according to Burckhardt used to make his guests dine alongside the preserved corpses of his torture victims. It’s the kind of gory detail that makes his masterpiece a still-powerful read. It also widens his notion of culture still further. For Burckhardt, politics and war are cultural forms. He gets this idea from the Renaissance itself – one of his inspirations, Machiavelli, wrote a book called The Art of War. So perhaps, in his bicentenary, Burckhardt has another, more troubling relevance. Writing when modern European states were being forged, he called his opening chapter The State As a Work of Art. After 1918, it would be dictators who forged a demonic art of mass politics. The Marxist Walter Benjamin accused fascism of “aestheticising” politics. Anyone who has seen Leni Riefenstahl’s film Triumph of the Will knows what he meant. In 2018 we seem to be living in Burkhardt’s world – and it ain’t pretty. Not only is everything culture, but politics is a mad art form, ruled by symbolic forces and gestures that surge through social media. Are the new populist monsters of politics the descendants of the Renaissance despots who shocked and fascinated Burckhardt? This quiet scholar’s great book helps us understand our world just as much as the writings of Marx. More so, I fear, in this age when culture Trumps reality."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2018/may/31/readers-recommend-playlist-great-solo-performances","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-31T11:00:20Z","webTitle":"Readers recommend playlist: great solo performances","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/31/readers-recommend-playlist-great-solo-performances","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/may/31/readers-recommend-playlist-great-solo-performances","fields":{"headline":"Readers recommend playlist: great solo performances","bodyText":"Here is this week’s playlist – songs picked by a reader from hundreds of your suggestions last week. Thanks for taking part. Read more about how our weekly series works at the end of the piece. Can the individual top the collective? Many of our favourite songs are the result of teamwork, but as your nominations last week showed, solitude can be a powerful creative impulse, in all of its many forms – which we’ll explore with this week’s selection. Introspection: jazz pianist Bill Evans was working on an introduction to Leonard Bernstein’s Some Other Time for his trio when he became fascinated with a chord sequence – to the extent that he created an entirely separate improvisation playing off it. Peace Piece was that result, and is said to have laid the groundwork for ambient music. Obsession: Janice Whaley set herself the challenge of creating multitracked a cappella versions of all 71 Smiths songs in one year. While technically astonishing – with up to 50 separate vocal channels per song, as well as pitch-corrected bass parts – the project’s main strength was the sheer power of the music created. That Joke Isn’t Funny Anymore is one of the strongest songs in the set. Nonconformism: Smiths songwriter Johnny Marr was indebted to folk legend Bert Jansch, considered one of the most influential British guitarists. Jansch cultivated a style deliberately at odds with the “pretty” sound of the acoustic guitar, throwing in off-key notes and loose rhythms and attacking the strings. His performance of Davy Graham’s challenging Angi was a fine example of his art – and one of the defining moments of British folk music. Reduction: Bruce Springsteen originally intended his Nebraska album to be a group recording with the E Street Band. The material seemed to suit the rawness of his solo demos, however, and the production team decided to release them as they were. Atlantic City became one of his best-loved songs. Isolation: Suzanne Vega wrote Tom’s Diner in sympathy with a friend’s remark that he often felt like a witness, but seldom a participant. Her narrator is an observer taking in the events around her without being touched by them. Appropriately, the track was later used by the creators of the MP3 to test various compression algorithms – the lack of instrumentation made it the ideal benchmark. Dedication: Jaco Pastorius’s Portrait of Tracy became his standard solo feature during his years with Weather Report, with onstage looping and frequent bouts of feedback. The original, released on his self-titled debut, was a simpler, heartfelt performance, a lovely ballad whose advanced harmonics set new standards for the bass guitar. Improvisation: saxophonist John Surman has recorded numerous solo albums, with an increasing interest in multitracking and electronics. His Whistman’s Wood layers saxophone, bass clarinet and soft electronic sounds beneath evocative improvisation, creating an orchestral soundscape dedicated to his West Country home. Multiplication: time for the drum solo... Japanese virtuoso percussionist Kuniko Kato takes on all six roles in a breathtaking split-screen performance of Peaux, from Iannis Xenakis’s Pléïades suite. Emotion: Odetta’s stark version of the traditional lament Another Man Done Gone resonates with today’s Black Lives Matter movement. Magnificent singing, accompanied only by her own handclaps. Tradition: Malian Toumani Diabaté is descended from a line of kora players his family says can be traced back at least 70 generations. Alla L’aa Ke was released on his 1988 debut solo release, Kaira, and connects us directly with ancient sub-Saharan music-makers. Desolation: Skip James’ legendary Hard Time Killing Floor Blues draws on the blues singer’s experiences working in a slaughterhouse. The song’s beauty is at odds with the brutality of its lyrics, and James’ falsetto is almost angelic in tone. Single mindedness: American troubadour Phillip Roebuck started performing as a one-man band after his group efforts failed to find success. He’d rather be seen primarily as a songwriter, but it’s undeniable that a man with a drum on his back will always have a special appeal. His high-octane bend of bluegrass, punk and rock in Monkey Fist suits it perfectly. Not all songs appear on the Spotify playlist as some are unavailable on the service.

Jane Fonda, Diane Keaton, Candice Bergen and Mary Steenburgen give performances in animatronic soft-focus as four friends – forever uninhibitedly laughing, gossiping, drinking chilled white wine from giant balloon glasses and not touching the plates of food dotted about. They’re not getting much bedroom action these days, but their life-affirming sensuality is reawakened when their book club knuckles down to EL James’s super-saucy S&amp;M romp Fifty Shades of Grey – apparently undeterred by how awful the films were. James’s novel and its raunchy sequels unlock their dormant passions, a bunch of adorable silver-fox guys show up and soon our mature heroines are banging like outhouse doors in a gale. Some of them, anyway. But there’s no question of any BDSM. Inevitably, EL James herself shows up in a coy cameo as a passerby when one of the leads moans: “I wanna have sex!” It’s a film to remind you that the comedy confectionery of Nora Ephron or perhaps Nancy Meyers is not that easy to replicate, and you can be left with all of the guilt and none of the pleasure. Certainly all four leads are on their worst and horrendously unfunniest form: Diane Keaton is like a Diane Keaton impersonator on YouTube. When Candice Bergen has to get all tangled up while putting on her first ever pair of Spanx, I wanted to blast off into space and live on one of Jupiter’s moons until that scene was over. But however bad the leads are, they are better than the smug men – including Andy García and Don Johnson.

Figures from the Office for National Statistics show 33,000 workers were involved in labour disputes in 2017, down from 154,000 a year earlier. This is the lowest number since records began in 1893, the year of Britain’s first national coal strikes, when the figure was 634,000. While the previous record low came in 2015, when 81,000 workers went out on strike, there have only been four other occasions over the past 120 years when fewer than 100,000 employees went on strike. The latest figures are likely to stoke renewed debate over the role of unions in Britain amid a government crackdown, at a time when workers are coming under increasing financial pressure. With average pay yet to recover to levels before the financial crisis a decade ago, workers are going through the worst period for wage growth since the end of the Napoleonic wars in 1815 – well before the labour dispute records began. The use of zero-hours contracts and the rise of the gig economy has also fuelled fears over a decline in working conditions in recent years. The ONS’ senior statistician David Freeman said: “This is a stark contrast to the levels seen when the miners went on strike in the 1970s and 1980s, and the even greater levels of industrial action in the 1910s and 1920s.” While the number of workers involved in labour disputes has reached a record low, the number of days lost to industrial action did not set a record. There were 276,000 working days lost because of labour disputes in 2017, the sixth lowest annual total since records began in 1891. The highest numbers of people going on strike came during the late 1970s, with a peak of more than 4.6 million in 1979, around the time of the winter of discontent. Successive governments have since curbed the power of trade unions, kickstarted by Margaret Thatcher after the industrial strife of the 70s, when blackouts and the three-day week were triggered by striking coal miners. Since then, the number of people counted as members of a trade union has fallen to around six million, down from a peak of more than 13 million in 1979. Some pockets of union strength remain, reflected in the regional breakdown and industry group data for labour stoppages. The transport and storage sector lost the most working days to disputes last year, while London had the highest rate of days lost per 1,000 employees, which could reflect disputes on the undeground and the railways. Many economists fear weak wage growth since the 2008 banking crisis has been exacerbated by the waning power of labour unions, arguing that workers are less able to demand better pay and conditions despite record-low levels of unemployment. They include the chief economist at the Bank of England, Andy Haldane, who has warned the lack of wage growth shows the British economy had gone “back to the future” to the days before the Industrial Revolution. Hannah Reed of the TUC, the unions umbrella group, said: “Strikes are always a last resort for union members but it’s clear that many workers are fed up of years of paltry pay rises.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/may/30/french-riot-police-clear-1000-migrants-from-paris-makeshift-camp","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-30T09:32:15Z","webTitle":"French riot police clear 1,000 migrants from Paris makeshift camp","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/30/french-riot-police-clear-1000-migrants-from-paris-makeshift-camp","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/30/french-riot-police-clear-1000-migrants-from-paris-makeshift-camp","fields":{"headline":"French riot police clear 1,000 migrants from Paris makeshift camp","bodyText":"French riot police have cleared more than 1,000 migrants and refugees from one of the largest makeshift camps in Paris, where they had been sleeping rough for months in squalid conditions. Hundreds of homeless people were taken by bus to temporary shelters on Wednesday. Among them were women, children and unaccompanied minors. More than 2,000 migrants and refugees had been sleeping on pavements under bridges and canals in northern Paris, with scant access to running water, no showers and few temporary toilets, in what doctors and aid groups described as “catastrophic sanitary conditions”. There has been a scathing political row as the Socialist mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, accused Emmanuel Macron’s government of failing to provide state help for the large number of people sleeping rough in the capital. At about 6am, riot police arrived at the largest of the camps, where more than 1,700 people have been sleeping under a motorway bridge along canal Saint-Denis. Calmly, migrants and refugees boarded buses clutching small bags of belongings, before the tents were destroyed. The interior ministry said people would be housed in temporary shelter while their documents and administrative situation were checked. Many who had been sleeping rough are from Sudan, Somalia and Eritrea, and had made perilous crossings of the Mediterranean after detention and ill-treatment in Libya. Further camps along the canal and at Porte de la Chapelle, where hundreds more are sleeping on the streets, are expected to be cleared in coming days. The local prefect’s office said 1,017 people were transferred to temporary shelters, including 64 vulnerable people such as women, children and unaccompanied minors. Local authorities said the dawn operation was the 35th police eviction of camps in Paris in the past three years. There has been a cycle of tents being evacuated and destroyed. But homeless migrants and asylum seekers with no other solution often quickly set up camp elsewhere in the city in squalid locations that are becoming more and more remote. Pierre Henry from the aid group France terre d’asile said: “This is an issue of dignity. Street camps should not exist in our country.” Paris has long faced problems of migrants and asylum seekers sleeping rough, separate to issues around Calais, where a makeshift camp of up to 8,000 people was dismantled 18 months ago. Macron’s proposed immigration law, currently being examined by the French senate, seeks to criminalise illegal border crossing, and speed up the processes for asylum requests and expelling people unable to claim asylum. Aid groups have argued the plan does not set out a long-term system to receive and provide shelter for those arriving in France."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/may/30/abbott-backs-craig-kelly-as-preselection-battles-hot-up","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-30T09:41:55Z","webTitle":"Abbott backs Craig Kelly as preselection battles hot up","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/may/30/abbott-backs-craig-kelly-as-preselection-battles-hot-up","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/may/30/abbott-backs-craig-kelly-as-preselection-battles-hot-up","fields":{"headline":"Abbott backs Craig Kelly as preselection battles hot up","bodyText":"Tony Abbott has warned it would be a “disaster” if the outspoken Liberal Craig Kelly were to be rolled in a looming preselection battle, as it emerged that Ann Sudmalis will face a challenge in Gilmore despite public intervention from Malcolm Turnbull and Scott Morrison to shore her up.

Insiders suggest Johns, a party moderate, will have the numbers – which prompted Abbott to go into bat for the backbencher on Wednesday. Abbott warned there would be no “harmony” inside the Liberal party if Kelly – his factional ally – was “rolled”. “I think it would be a disaster for our party if Craig Kelly were to lose preselection, an absolute disaster,” the former prime minister told 2GB. “He has been a very good local member, he has been a very strong participant in all of our policy discussions, he has been a very good and vocal advocate for our position. “The idea he should be knocked off, at this point in time … I just think that is the worst possible look. “The only way we can win the election is if we have harmony inside our party and we sure ain’t going to have harmony if Craig Kelly gets rolled.” The preselection dramas in New South Wales don’t end with Sudmalis and Kelly. The moderate Jason Falinski faces a challenge from an ally of Walter Villatora – the president of Abbott’s federal electoral conference – Frederick Mare, a 65-year-old company director. Two government ministers, Angus Taylor and Craig Laundy, also forgot to lodge their nomination forms for their seats by the cut-off, which was last Friday.

For fans of the classic 1975 documentary Grey Gardens, by Albert and David Maysles, this film is a startling, even sensational event. Despite some faults, it is basically a must-see, an archival gem with mouthwatering unseen footage of the two women who were turned by that film into pop-culture legends. It throws real light on them, and on the silent cunning of the Maysles brothers themselves, with a Greeneian splinter of ice in their hearts. That Summer is effectively a backstory-prequel to the making of Grey Gardens, which famously unveiled the tragicomic twilit existence of two eccentric American women of faded patrician glamour in their rambling chaotic home in the Hamptons. They were the elder Edith “Big Edie” Ewing Bouvier Beale and her skittish and madly eccentric daughter Edith “Little Edie” Bouvier Beale, who had lived together there for over 30 years in bizarre seclusion, after Big Edie’s husband left her, each like something between Blanche Dubois and Miss Havisham. Their niece Lee Radziwill, sister of Jackie Onassis, tactfully wanted to help the Edies restore Grey Gardens, evidently with Ari Onassis’s money. But how did the Maysles brothers gain the women’s trust to make their documentary? The answer is that there was an earlier film project, begun and then abandoned in the summer of 1972, masterminded by the well-connected artist and photographer Peter Beard – an intimate of Hampton habitués such as Lee and Jackie, Andy Warhol and Truman Capote. He got permission to make a fly-on-the-wall study of poor Big Edie and Little Edie and hired the Maysles brothers as humble cameramen. (We have to listen to a lot of irrelevant waffle from Beard about his famous friends before we can get on to the main event: his footage and the women’s show-stopping double act.) He finally shelved his project, but the Maysles came back and evidently asked permission to make their own film – and the women were sufficiently accustomed to their presence to agree. Or did the sly film-makers allow these befuddled women to assume that this was simply an extension of the first film, the one licensed by their grand family friend? We don’t know. But the Maysles’ film was much colder, shrewder and more pitilessly brilliant than anything Beard had in mind, with his emollient emphasis on fixing up the house, and all the local history. Yet the women are still extraordinary, speaking lines no screenwriter would dare invent: lines that are funny, petulant, crazy, melancholy and sometimes just plain gibberish. (I’d forgotten something from Grey Gardens: the Edies can be talking and two or three sentences can go past before you realise it’s as incomprehensible as birdsong!) But why did Beard abandon his film? He doesn’t say. It was reportedly because he had to return to Africa, but I wonder if he may have been nervous of what his film uncovered – a suggestion of abuse. Is that the answer to why this poor, bewildered, humorous and yet defiant Little Edie retreated into seclusion along with her cantankerous, guilty mother? No one who loves Grey Gardens can do without this."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"crosswords/quick/15003","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-07T23:00:55Z","webTitle":"Quick crossword No 15,003","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/quick/15003","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/quick/15003","fields":{"headline":"Quick crossword No 15,003","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"culture/2018/jun/01/historic-england-spotlights-significance-of-suffragette-sites","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-01T05:00:42Z","webTitle":"Historic England spotlights significance of suffragette sites","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/jun/01/historic-england-spotlights-significance-of-suffragette-sites","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2018/jun/01/historic-england-spotlights-significance-of-suffragette-sites","fields":{"headline":"Historic England spotlights significance of suffragette sites","bodyText":"The grave of Emmeline Pankhurst and other sites associated with the suffragette movement are to have their listed status increased or are being re-listed with a more detailed explanation of their importance in the history of the campaign for votes for women. The campaign leader Emmeline Pankhurst was from Manchester, but died in London in 1928. She was buried at Brompton Cemetery under a Celtic cross designed by the female sculptor Julian Phelps Allan, who reached the rank of colonel in her army career and served in both world wars. The memorial is being upgraded to Grade II* by Historic England. Other sites were already listed, but without any mention of their place in the campaign, are now being added. They include Manchester Free Trade Hall, where Christabel Pankhurst and Annie Kenney were arrested in 1905 for disrupting a Liberal election meeting. They refused to pay a fine and were jailed, launching the militant direct action phase of the campaign. In 1913, a home-made bomb, believed to be made by suffragettes, went off under the stage of the hall without injuring anyone. Other sites include art galleries where paintings were attacked and buildings which were bombed, set on fire, had their letter boxes blown up or had their windows smashed, including the orchid houses at Kew Gardens. The Old Grammar School in Kings Norton, Birmingham, is remembered for a break-in in 1913 by two women who left a message on the blackboard reading: “Two suffragists have entered here, but charmed with this old-world room, have refrained from their design of destruction.” The significance of the towering organ case of St George’s Hall in Liverpool is also being noted.

As the mass cancellations of trains by Northern and Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) continued into an 11th day, Lilian Greenwood, the chair of the transport select committee, said she would ask the committee on Monday to review the situation, which may lead to a full parliamentary inquiry. Greenwood, the Labour MP for Nottingham South, said Grayling, Network Rail and the train operating companies all had questions to answer about the introduction of the timetables on 20 May and how they managed the subsequent disruption, which has become a “complete shambles”. “The ongoing timetabling chaos is making the lives of passengers very difficult. The transport committee has discussed the problems and is watching the situation carefully,” she said. On Thursday, the Greater Manchester mayor, Andy Burnham, accused Grayling of being “asleep at the wheel”. The mass cancellations have particularly hit Thameslink services in and out of London, and Northern trains to and from Manchester. Grayling angered passengers on Thursday after he appeared to blame all the problems on Network Rail, rather than examining his own department’s role in the fiasco. On Wednesday rail user groups and one MP called for the Department for Transport to introduce emergency measures to restore a reliable service. Despite working on the new timetable change for more than a year, Network Rail, GTR and Northern have blamed the problems on the “sheer number of changes” and late running engineering projects. They said they were now working on a recovery plan. Station staff have told passengers the companies failed to train staff to drive the new routes, or to have enough trains to operate the new timetable. Burnham was among a group of northern leaders who spoke with Grayling to discuss what he described as the “shambolic” state of rail services in the region. Burnham told BBC Radio 4: “I am left with the clear impression that nobody – least of all the transport secretary – has got a grip on this situation. “He now needs to take personal responsibility and set a deadline by which services will be brought back up to an acceptable standard.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/2018/may/31/corrections-and-clarifications","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-31T20:00:29Z","webTitle":"Corrections and clarifications","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/may/31/corrections-and-clarifications","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2018/may/31/corrections-and-clarifications","fields":{"headline":"Corrections and clarifications","bodyText":"• The Democratic Unionist party has 10 MPs, not 12 as we said (Northern Ireland abortion laws ‘a test of May’s feminism’, 29 May, page 4). • Nick Bailey, the officer treated in hospital in Salisbury after being exposed to the nerve agent novichok, is a detective sergeant, not a police constable (Doctors did not expect Skripals to survive poison, 29 May, page 18). • Other recently corrected articles include: Unicorns, Almost review – poignant portrait of a tormented war poet FTSE firms’ excuses for lack of women in boardrooms ‘pitiful and patronising’ My best summer photograph: suckers, sizzlers and surfers"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/may/31/dinesh-dsouza-who-is-he-trump-pardon-filmmaker","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-31T19:34:02Z","webTitle":"Donald and Dinesh: how Trump found his new favorite film-maker","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/may/31/dinesh-dsouza-who-is-he-trump-pardon-filmmaker","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/may/31/dinesh-dsouza-who-is-he-trump-pardon-filmmaker","fields":{"headline":"Donald and Dinesh: how Trump found his new favorite film-maker","bodyText":"Razzie-winning, Democrat-baiting, Hillary Clinton-hating documentary film-maker Dinesh D’Souza has spent the majority of his career working within a conservative bubble, creating content clearly targeted for and solely enjoyed by the far right. His history of making problematic comments, on everything from same-sex marriage to campus rape to race, may have granted him a certain notoriety, along with a conviction for violating campaign finance laws, but his name has always remained on the cultural outskirts. Yet this week, his career received a surprise boost from the most famous man in America. Despite pleading guilty for his crime, and being sentenced to five years probation and a $30,000 fine, D’Souza has been granted a shock full pardon by Donald Trump. Claiming that the 57-year-old had been “treated very unfairly” by the government, the president has suddenly propelled D’Souza’s name into the mainstream, causing him to trend on Twitter and leading many to ask just what led to this left-field decision? While Trump had spent a large portion of his pre-presidential career dazzled by Hollywood, making big and small screen cameos and befriending A-listers, since taking office, his outlook on the industry has soured. The doors that he’d barged through were now locked and the stars who might have entertained his company before were now rallying against him. But a vocal minority has remained on side and eager to maintain affection from those within a community he collectively slams, Trump has spoken out to defend and celebrate them. This year, Roseanne Barr, who transformed from a Democrat to a staunch Trump defender, saw her revived ABC sitcom become a monster ratings hit, and the two paraded their friendship with grating pride. After a racist tweet this week saw her show cancelled, Trump has been caught in a frustrating place. Barr’s tweet, comparing an ex-Barack Obama aide to an ape, was almost universally reviled, even by some far-right figures, and the pair’s connection has been put under the spotlight. Trump has avoided an open show of support for Barr but instead launched an attack on Disney CEO Bob Iger for not apologizing for comments made about him on ABC. Yesterday, Michael Moore tweeted a tease for a “secret project” accompanied by footage of himself and Trump guesting on Roseanne’s short-lived talk show. Moore claimed the two would “rue the day” they met him. (He is also at work on a feature-length Trump documentary called Fahrenheit 11/9.) While Trump hasn’t directly responded to the threat, there’s an uncanny coincidence that just hours later, he would announce a full pardon for a film-maker who could easily be called the anti-Moore. There’s previously been tension between the pair. Moore criticized D’Souza in 2013 after he called Obama a “Grown-Up Trayvon” in reference to slain teen Trayvon Martin, and has referred to him as a “conspiracy nut”. D’Souza appeared in the 2004 documentary Michael Moore Hates America and has made numerous attacks on him since. D’Souza’s career has been propelled by anger directed at left-leaning figures and progressive causes, something that can be traced back to his time editing the Dartmouth Review, a paper not affiliated with Dartmouth College, which he attended in the late 70s. According to AlterNet, D’Souza published a “lighthearted” interview with a former Ku Klux Klan leader, accompanied by a staged photo of a black man hanging from a tree. One of his proteges at the paper was Laura Ingraham, who has gone on to become a Trump-supporting host at Fox News, and as editor, she sent a reporter undercover to an LGBTQ meeting and proceeded to publish the names of the attendees in the paper. It was a piece that D’Souza was allegedly proud of years later while the New York Times reported that one gay student dropped out of college while another was suicidal. Ingraham called it “a freedom of the press issue”. In the late 80s, D’Souza worked as a policy adviser for the Reagan administration and in 1997, wrote a book entitled Ronald Reagan: How an Ordinary Man Became an Extraordinary Leader which was heralded by Rush Limbaugh and Tom Wolfe. (Two years earlier he published a book arguing that slavery wasn’t a racist institution.) He continued to explore his career as an author with a string of increasingly far-right books. In 2007, he released The Enemy At Home: The Cultural Left and Its Responsibility for 9/11 which Michiko Kakutani called “shrill” and “preposterous” in her New York Times review. The book acted as something of a shift for D’Souza, whose rhetoric became more intensely focused and led him directly towards Obama. In 2010, he wrote The Roots of Obama’s Rage, which alleged that the president was an anti-colonialist attempting to reduce America’s global power. Newt Gingrich praised the book and D’Souza’s “stunning insight”. It was later adapted into a documentary entitled 2016: Obama’s America which became a surprise hit, bringing in over $33m at the US box office despite negative reviews. Entertainment Weekly’s Owen Gleiberman called it “an outrageously unsubstantiated act of character assassination” while the Obama administration dismissed it as “nothing more than an insidious attempt to dishonestly smear the president”. Its success drove D’Souza to make two more films, America: Imagine the World Without Her and 2016’s Hillary’s America: The Secret History of the Democratic Party, both of which were moderate hits yet critical support remained absent. The latter won D’Souza four Razzies but also attracted the attention of Trump, who called on his supporters to see the film via Twitter. As D’Souza’s star seemed to rise, off-screen he was dealing with a legal issue that threatened to derail his career. Two years prior to the release of Hillary’s America, D’Souza had pleaded guilty to charges of making illegal campaign contributions to New York Republican senate candidate Wendy Long, who D’Souza initially met at the Dartmouth Review. His statements were also becoming more inflammatory and he gained over 880,000 followers on Twitter, using the platform to shock, provoke and often disgust. He defended Hitler as being “not anti-gay” despite his history of sending gay people to concentration camps, called Rosa Parks an “overrated Democrat”, continued to question Obama’s place of birth long after even Trump had dropped the issue, shared a meme calling the Obamas a gay Muslim and a man and speculated that the Charlottesville rally was staged by the left. He was also forced to apologize earlier this year when he mocked the grief of students who survived the Parkland high school shooting, accepting his tweet was “insensitive”. Trump’s attempt to align himself with D’Souza, by granting him a full pardon and by bringing his name and work into the public eye, is a clear, strident step that, for now, is achieving the desired effect: shock and confusion. It’s also led some to note that the crime D’Souza has been pardoned for is the same as one of the allegations against Michael Cohen. “Nobody asked me to do it,” Trump said to press earlier today. “I read the papers – I see him on television.” D’Souza, who has previously appeared on Fox News, used the rush of publicity to promote his new movie, out this summer “in time for the midterm elections” and presumably at a similar point as Moore’s latest project. He was also a guest at the White House to promote his last book The Big Lie, which saw him pose for photo opportunities with leading cabinet members and signing a book for Trump himself. “[Trump] said I was a great voice for America,” D’Souza said to the Hollywood Reporter after his pardon. “He said these people went after you for a mere technicality, I’m going to set that right and clear your record so that you can be an even more visible voice for the country than you are now.” The news also arrives amid a renewed attempt by Trump to re-align himself with the stars who abandoned him. Last week, he hosted Sylvester Stallone in the White House for the pardoning of boxer Jack Johnson, while earlier this week Kim Kardashian met with him to discuss prison reform. The pardon of D’Souza has also led Trump to suggest pardoning Martha Stewart, saying she “used to be one of my biggest fans”. Trump’s obsession with celebrity continues to outweigh his political ambition, despite his current place at the top of the government. (His recent desperate embrace of Kanye West is a clear sign of what such support means to him.) Trump’s wars with everything from Saturday Night Live to Hamilton have dominated almost as much as his wars with political rivals. As the majority of film-makers continue to openly criticize his presidency, D’Souza’s unwavering support of his agenda has a profound importance. With the rebooted Roseanne cancelled, arguably the only network show that featured a positive representation of a Trump voter, there remains a gap for entertainment that speaks to the president and his supporters. Despite critical bile, D’Souza’s work has succeeded commercially because of this very demand, and with the midterms approaching, he has a new war to take part in, culturally and politically. For now, Trump has a new friend and with dark clouds on the horizon, he’ll need as many of them as he can get."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"books/2018/jun/08/life-in-the-garden-by-penelope-lively-review-a-rewarding-evocative-ramble","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-08T13:00:12Z","webTitle":"Life in the Garden by Penelope Lively review – a rewarding, evocative ramble","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jun/08/life-in-the-garden-by-penelope-lively-review-a-rewarding-evocative-ramble","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/jun/08/life-in-the-garden-by-penelope-lively-review-a-rewarding-evocative-ramble","fields":{"headline":"Life in the Garden by Penelope Lively review – a rewarding, evocative ramble","bodyText":"Penelope Lively modestly admits she is “only the most amateur gardener”. And yet this delightful and very personal paean to gardens amply demonstrates her abiding love of tending them. From the hot, sunny garden in Egypt where she grew up and discovered the joys of reading amid bamboo groves and lily ponds, to the small London one in her ninth decade and with a chronic back problem, gardens have always played a “formative and essential” role in her life. A hands-on gardener, not afraid to get what Virginia Woolf called “chocolate earth” under her nails, Lively sees gardening as a vital, even therapeutic encounter with nature. Importantly for a novelist, “gardens are never just themselves: they are allusive, evocative”. In this rewarding ramble through the sumptuous blooms of art (Monet’s water lilies, Nolde’s peonies) and literature (Larkin wasn’t keen, referring to his “bloody garden”), Lively finds in our love of gardens a rich and enduring connectedness to memory and the passage of time. • Life in the Garden is published by Penguin.

The backlash came after a list of comments made by chairmen and chief executives of FTSE 350 companies was published. Their remarks were collected by the ongoing Hampton-Alexander review into increasing female boardroom representation. One male business leader claimed women did not “fit comfortably” into a boardroom environment, another said women “don’t want the hassle” and a third said that “all the good women have already been snapped up”. Reasons given by a range of chief executives and chairs of top 350 companies for not appointing more women directors: • “I don’t think women fit comfortably into the board environment” • “There aren’t that many women with the right credentials and depth of experience to sit on the board – the issues covered are extremely complex” • “Most women don’t want the hassle or pressure of sitting on a board” • “Shareholders just aren’t interested in the makeup of the board, so why should we be?” • “My other board colleagues wouldn’t want to appoint a woman on our board” • “All the ‘good’ women have already been snapped up” • “We have one woman already on the board, so we are done – it is someone else’s turn” • “There aren’t any vacancies at the moment – if there were I would think about appointing a woman” • “We need to build the pipeline from the bottom – there just aren’t enough senior women in this sector” • “I can’t just appoint a woman because I want to” Senior women in business lined up to lambast the anonymous male bosses behind the 10 selected quotes published by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS). Carolyn Fairbairn, the director general of business lobby group the CBI, said they were “10 pitiful excuses that have no place in today’s Britain. “We need more female leaders – and not just on boards. No arguments, no excuses.” According to the latest figures from the Hampton-Alexander review, which date from November, FTSE 100 boardrooms are 27.7% female, up from 12.5% in 2011. However, the proportion declines dramatically for the most senior positions, with only 10% of the highest full-time “executive” roles held by women. Only six out of the top 100 chief executive positions are held by women. The 30% Club, which campaigns for a minimum of 30% women on FTSE 100 boards, warned the comments published by BEIS indicated there was still a long way to go. The group’s global chair, Brenda Trenowden, said they were the result of a minority of men likely to be damaging their own companies. “If they’re so out of touch with the real world, I wonder if they’re really qualified to be doing those jobs. “It’s backwards thinking, it’s wrong and if they honestly believe what they say, they’re not doing justice to the companies they’re chairing because they’re missing out on a huge talent pool and they’re going to get left behind.” She called on the directors who made the comments to stop hiding behind anonymity and “step forward and show themselves”. Stevie Spring, a media industry grandee and the remuneration committee chair of the Co-operative Group, ridiculed one director’s comment bemoaning a lack of qualified women. She said: “All the good women have been snapped up? “We’ve got true equality when mediocre women get snapped up, like mediocre men do.” Spring, who said the Co-op’s group executive was majority female, added that too few women were coming up through the ranks into senior positions. “Women on boards is about having the right pipeline of executive women and getting more senior executives onto the board,” she said. The gender equality campaign group the Fawcett Society said it was concerned by the views expressed in some corners of the business community. “The idea that some of the most powerful people in the business world have so little self-awareness, appetite for innovation or interest in challenging overt sexism leaves me deeply worried about the future for our economy,” the policy head, Jemima Olchawski, said. “And these are just the things they were prepared to say out loud.” Kate Grussing, the managing director of the recruitment firm Sapphire Partners, contested the suggestion that there were not enough women in the talent pool. “The appalling excuses given by many companies for why they can’t appoint more women to board or executive roles are truly disgraceful, lame and lazy,” she said. “Companies and recruiters have to be more creative and persistent in looking for diverse talent but it exists in greater numbers than ever. “Putting token women on their boards or photographs on their careers website won’t make a difference to the executive pipeline.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/may/31/us-fires-opening-salvo-in-trade-war-with-eu-canada-and-mexico","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-31T18:56:46Z","webTitle":"US on brink of trade war with EU, Canada and Mexico as tit-for-tat tariffs begin","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/31/us-fires-opening-salvo-in-trade-war-with-eu-canada-and-mexico","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/may/31/us-fires-opening-salvo-in-trade-war-with-eu-canada-and-mexico","fields":{"headline":"US on brink of trade war with EU, Canada and Mexico as tit-for-tat tariffs begin","bodyText":"The United States and its traditional allies are on the brink of a full-scale trade war after European and Canadian leaders reacted swiftly and angrily to Donald Trump’s decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminium producers. The president of the European commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, promised immediate retaliation after the US commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, said EU companies would face a 25% duty on steel and a 10% duty on aluminium from midnight on Thursday. Europe, along with Canada and Mexico, had been granted a temporary reprieve from the tariffs after they were unveiled by Donald Trump two months ago. However, Ross sent shudders through global financial markets when he said insufficient progress had been made in talks with three of the US’s traditional allies to reduce America’s trade deficit and that the waiver was being lifted. Wall Street slumped as the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down more than 250 points as investors sold off shares in manufacturers and corporations with global reach. Shares across Europe also declined. The move from Washington – which comes at a time when Trump is also threatening protectionist action against China – triggered an immediate and angry response from Canada, Brussels and from individual European capitals. Juncker called the US move “unjustified” and said the EU had no choice but to hit back with tariffs on US goods and a case at the World Trade Organisation in Geneva. “We will defend the Union’s interests, in full compliance with international trade law,” he added. Brussels has already announced that it would target Levi’s jeans, Harley-Davidson motorbikes and bourbon whiskey. The UK, which has hopes of agreeing a trade liberalisation deal with the US after Brexit, expressed alarm at Ross’s announcement. Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, said Britain would not rule out countermeasures or taking Washington to the WTO, which arbitrates on global trade disputes. Speaking to Sky News he attacked the tariffs as “patently absurd” and urged the US to think again. “It would be a great pity if we ended up in a tit-for-tat trade dispute with our closest allies.” A spokesman for Number 10 said the government was “deeply disappointed” the US had decided to apply the tariffs and that Theresa May would raise the issue with Trump at next week’s meeting of the G7 industrial nations in Canada. “The UK and other European Union countries are close allies of the US and should be permanently and fully exempted from the American measures on steel and aluminium.” The French president, Emmanuel Macron, called the US tariffs illegal and a mistake, while the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, issued an immediate like-for-like response – announcing tariffs of up to 25% on US imports worth up to 16.6bn Canadian dollars (£9.6bn), which was the total value of Canadian steel exports to the US last year. The tariffs will cover steel and aluminium as well as orange juice, whiskey and other food products. With the White House having used national security legislation to introduce the tariffs, Trudeau called the measures an “affront” to Canadians who had fought alongside their American comrades in arms. “That Canada could be considered a national security threat to the US is inconceivable.” Canada’s foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland, went further calling her country’s $16.6bn retaliatory tariffs “the strongest trade action Canada has taken in the postwar era. This is a very strong response. It is a proportionate response, it is perfectly reciprocal ... this is a very strong Canadian action in response to a very bad US decision.” Mexico also denounced the move, saying it “deeply regrets and disapproves” the US decision. The economics minstry said it would adopt equivalent measures on a variety of products, including flat steel, lamps, pork legs and shoulders, sausages and food preparations, apples, grapes, cranberries, various cheeses, and other products, “up to an amount comparable to damage caused by the United States’ action”. It added: “This measure will be in force for as long as the US government maintains the imposed tariffs.” Hopes remain that the fallout could be contained. Analysts at the research firm Oxford Economics said the economic hit for Europe would be well below 0.1% of GDP, as steel and aluminium only make up a small part of the bloc’s overall exports around the world. However, they warned a tit-for-tat escalation leading to tariffs on other goods, such as cars, would have dire consequences for global trade. Last week, the Trump administration launched a national security probe into car imports on national security grounds that could lead to tariffs on cars from Europe, Japan and South Korea, should trade tensions spiral further out of control. For the struggling UK steel industry, the news of US tariffs prompted fresh alarm. The director of UK Steel, Gareth Stace, said: “President Trump had already loaded the gun and today, we now know that the US administration has unfortunately fired it and potentially started a damaging trade war. “Since President Trump stated his plans to impose blanket tariffs on steel imports almost three months ago, the UK steel sector had hoped for the best but still feared the worst. With the expiration of the EU exemption now confirmed to take effect tomorrow [Friday, 1 June], unfortunately our pessimism was justified and we will now see damage not only to the UK steel sector but also the US economy.” Representatives for the US metal industry also expressed disappointment. “Make no mistake: restricting the raw material supply in the U.S. and imposing tariffs on imports from our closest trading partners places American manufacturers directly in harm’s way,” said Paul Nathanson of The Coalition of American Metal Manufacturers and Users. The CBI warned the EU against overreacting to Washington’s move. Ben Digby, international director at the employers’ organisation, said: “The president’s measures are deeply concerning for firms in the UK, for close trading partners and across supply chains.” Trump announced his tariffs in March as a way of protecting US firms from cheap imports but Digby said the problem was caused by global overproduction of the metals and needed to be tackled jointly by Brussels and Washington. “There are no winners in a trade war, which will damage prosperity on both sides of the Atlantic. These tariffs could lead to a protectionist domino effect, damaging firms, employees and consumers in the US, UK and many other trading partners. Now is not the time for any disproportionate escalation, and we urge the EU to consider this when initiating its response.” But neither side showed any immediate sign of being willing to defuse the tension. Cecilia Malmström, the European trade commissioner, said the Brussels response would be proportionate and in accordance with WTO rules. Ross shrugged off the threat of EU retaliation, saying it would have little impact on the US economy. Manfred Weber, the leader of the European People’s party, the largest group in the European parliament and a key ally of German chancellor Angela Merkel, warned that treating the EU as the “enemy” would damage US consumers. “Europe does not want a trade conflict. We believe in a fair trade regime from which everybody benefits,” he said. “We have tried everything to make dialogue and mutual understanding prevail. If President Trump decides to treat Europe as an enemy, we will have no choice but to defend European industry, European jobs, European interests.” Ross blamed insufficient progress in talks with Mexico and Canada over changes to the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) for the US’s decision to slap tariffs on its two neighbours. Mexico’s under-secretary of foreign trade, Juan Carlos Baker, tweeted: “Mexico categorically rejects any unilateral, protectionist measures that distort trade in North America.” China, too, warned that it would respond with tit-for-tat action of its own."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2018/may/31/lets-have-three-strikes-at-the-dispatch-box-too","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-31T16:40:01Z","webTitle":"Let’s have three strikes at the dispatch box too | Brief letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/may/31/lets-have-three-strikes-at-the-dispatch-box-too","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2018/may/31/lets-have-three-strikes-at-the-dispatch-box-too","fields":{"headline":"Let’s have three strikes at the dispatch box too","bodyText":"I think Richard Madeley is on to something with his “three strikes and you’re out” proposal to deal with politicians who won’t answer the question put to them (Cutting short the interview was the best thing I’ve done, 31 May).

The paintings by Louis-Léopold Boilly were all owned by the late property billionaire Harry Hyams, who changed the London skyline forever when he built the Centre Point tower in the 1960s. In 1964 he paid what now seems a derisory sum, £650,000, but was then a record price for a beautiful 17th-century Wiltshire mansion, Ramsbury Manor. He filled the house with art and antiques but it remained one of the most private homes in England, viewable by the public only from a bridge half a mile away. In 2006 the Johnson Gang, who over 20 years were responsible for a string of raids on stately homes and antique shops, rammed a ground floor window of the house with a four-wheel drive and escaped with a record haul of more than 300 pieces valued at over £30m. Only some of the loot was recovered, with many pieces damaged. Five members of the family later received prison sentences of up to 11 years. Hyams died in 2015 and left £450m in his will to establish a trust to finally make his home and collection public. The house will not open for at least another 18 months, but the small exhibition of 20 Boilly paintings in London is the first glimpse of its treasures. Curators at the National Gallery said that not only had the pictures never been exhibited before, most had never been photographed or catalogued. Boilly, renowned for his meticulous technique and minutely detailed works, had been titillating the wealthy with suggestive pictures of partially clothed beauties, when the French Revolution made such art deeply suspect. According to art history legend, the authorities broke into his studio looking for more evidence against him – and instead found his painting of the revolutionary leader Jean-Paul Marat being carried shoulder high by an adoring crowd throwing their hats in the air and holding up children to see him. Marat himself would famously be stabbed to death in his bath, but the artist was spared, and lived until 1845, with a lucrative career in landscapes, portraits, and trompe l’oeil – a term used to describe his convincingly 3D works, including views of the backs of canvases and stretchers. His street scenes teeming with detail, including one that will be in the exhibition showing jolly crowds gathered for a carnival in 1832, record Paris during the rise, reign as emperor and fall of Napoleon, and the restoration of the monarchy. Boilly: Scenes of Parisian Life will be at the National Gallery from 28 February to 19 May 2019, with free entry."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"cities/2018/jun/21/serene-symmetry-in-the-london-underground-in-pictures","type":"article","sectionId":"cities","sectionName":"Cities","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-21T10:30:08Z","webTitle":"Symmetry and serenity in the London Underground – in pictures","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/jun/21/serene-symmetry-in-the-london-underground-in-pictures","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/cities/2018/jun/21/serene-symmetry-in-the-london-underground-in-pictures","fields":{"headline":"Symmetry and serenity in the London Underground – in pictures","bodyText":"For most Londoners the tube is an unpleasant hotbed of stress to be avoided whenever possible, but Jess Macdonald captures a different side to the underground.

Peter Clarke has put the justice secretary, David Gauke, on notice that he must explain how conditions at HMP Exeter will be improved using an “urgent notification” protocol for only the second time since the power became available. It also emerged that Bedford prison had been placed into special measures on Wednesday by the Prison Service meaning additional support would be brought in. An unannounced inspection at Exeter in May discovered high rates of self-harm and suicide, including six self-inflicted deaths, increasing numbers of assaults against prisoners and staff, and high levels of drug use. In his letter to the justice secretary, Clarke said: “During the inspection we saw many examples of a lack of care for vulnerable prisoners which, given the recent tragic events in the prison, were symptomatic of a lack of empathy and understanding of the factors that contribute to suicide and self-harm.” Clarke told Gauke the principal reasons for invoking the urgent notification mechanism were that safety in the prison had “significantly worsened in many respects” since the previous inspection in August 2016. The urgent notification power came into force in November and has been used once previously for HMP Nottingham. Prisoner-on-prisoner assaults in Exeter had gone up by 107% since the last assessment, while attacks on staff had risen by 60%. Clarke reported that there was a “strong smell” of drugs on some of the wings and he saw inmates who were “clearly under the influence” during the inspection. Many cells were in a poor state of repair, with broken windows, leaking lavatories and sinks, and poorly screened toilets. In one case a vulnerable prisoner assessed as being at a heightened risk of suicide was found in a “squalid” cell without bedding or glass in his window. Clarke said: “The senior management team that is currently in place at HMP Exeter is largely the same as at the last inspection in 2016. “The failure to address the actual and perceived lack of safety, and the issues that contribute to both, is so serious that it has led me to have significant concerns about the treatment and conditions of prisoners at HMP Exeter and to the inevitable conclusion to invoke the UN (urgent notification) protocol.” Under the urgent notification process, the chief inspector can inform the government of any urgent and severe prison problems found during an inspection. The justice secretary then has 28 days to publicly report on improvement measures adopted at the jail in question. Deborah Coles, director of Inquest, a charity dealing with deaths in police and prison custody, said: “This cannot be blamed on staffing levels. That serious safety concerns are systematically ignored points to an institutional and shameful indifference to the well-being of prisoners. In any other setting this institution would be closed down.” Peter Dawson, director of the Prison Reform Trust, said: “Exeter prison is a grossly overcrowded prison where most prisoners are either not convicted at all or are serving short sentences.” Bedford, a Category B prison that holds more than 500 male prisoners, was placed in special measures following a riot and “unprecedented levels of violence”, the Prisons Officers Association (POA) said. Glyn Travis, POA spokesman, said: “Bedford is a low performing prison. There have been issues around the prison for about 15 months. High levels of violence, high levels of rioting and a member of staff was almost murdered.” The prisons minister, Rory Stewart, said: “I am grateful to the chief inspector for identifying the urgent attention required at HMP Exeter – and I am determined that we act immediately. Staffing has increased at Exeter and we expect to see improvements as a result. “We will provide all the additional support needed to improve safety and reduce self-harm and we are already conducting a rapid review of conditions to improve the standard of cells.” Built in 1853, HMP Exeter is a category B facility for male inmates and has an operational capacity of 544. The unannounced inspection was undertaken between 14 May and 24 May."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/may/31/abortion-clinic-safe-zones-backed-by-australias-federal-and-state-governments","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-31T03:31:17Z","webTitle":"Abortion clinic safe zones backed by Australia's federal and state governments","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/31/abortion-clinic-safe-zones-backed-by-australias-federal-and-state-governments","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/31/abortion-clinic-safe-zones-backed-by-australias-federal-and-state-governments","fields":{"headline":"Abortion clinic safe zones backed by Australia's federal and state governments","bodyText":"The Turnbull government and Coalition governments in New South Wales and South Australia have defended Victorian laws protecting safe zones around abortion clinics. Victoria’s laws creating safe zones of 150 metres around abortion clinics are the subject of a high court challenge. A bill to replicate that provision passed the New South Wales upper house last week. In a full court press the commonwealth, NSW, South Australia, Queensland and Western Australian governments all intervened to argue the law banning communications that are “reasonably likely to cause distress or anxiety” does not infringe Australia’s limited constitutional protection of freedom of speech. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon The challenge has been brought by a religious picketer, Kathy Clubb, who was fined $5,000 for approaching a couple in the safe zone outside an east Melbourne clinic in August 2016 and trying to hand them pamphlets. Human rights groups and the Fertility Control Clinic have also applied to be heard in the case. The Castan Centre for Human Rights Law pointed to research that in other cases protesters were found to: distribute models of plastic foetuses; implore patients not to “kill” their “baby”; castigate patients as murderers; heckle, threaten and verbally abuse patients and staff; display visually graphic material including posters displaying foetuses in buckets; provide misleading information that abortion results in infertility, failed relationships, mental illness and cancer. Susie Allanson, a clinical psychologist at the Fertility Control Clinic, gave evidence that women had delayed seeking medical assistance due to protests that also harmed staff. She had experienced nightmares and sleep disruption. In a submission to the high court the federal attorney general, Christian Porter, argued there was “no evidence” Clubb was engaged in political communication and the burden on political communication of the law was “slight and readily justified”. The commonwealth argued communications about whether abortion should be lawful were political communications but dissuading a woman from seeking one may not be. The submission is similar to Victoria’s defence that protesters are not engaged in public debate but rather targeting women for their medical choices in a way that will cause them to delay or not to seek those services. The commonwealth argued that the protection of free speech in the Australian constitution is “not an end in itself” and is limited only to what is necessary to preserve representative government. “What is protected is the freedom to communicate political ideas to those who are willing to listen, not a right to force an unwanted message on those who do not wish to hear it,” it said. The commonwealth argued Victoria’s laws had a legitimate purpose and the burden it imposed was limited to regulating the “time, place or manner” of communications. The NSW government also defended the legitimate purpose, arguing that the law established safe zones not because anti-abortion speech is “undesirable per se” but because the communications in safe zones are seen as a “potential source” of harm. It rejected the suggestion the court should shrink the safety zones to less than 150 metres, arguing that to do so would make them less effective. The commonwealth warned the court should not substitute its judgment on the size of the safe zones. The Queensland government accepted that the safe zone law could burden the time, place or manner of political communication, but argued in Clubb’s case it “imposed no burden on the free flow of political communication”. The Western Australian government adopted many of Victoria’s submissions and argued that abortion protesters could get their message out in other ways. The South Australian government argued communications in abortion safe zones were likely to be “unsolicited and made predominantly to an audience who are considering a difficult, personal choice regarding receiving medical care”. It concluded the justification for the Victorian safe zone law is “incontrovertible”. Clubb’s submissions in the case are due by 8 June, and submissions in a similar challenge to Tasmania’s laws are due by August."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/may/31/nt-police-release-man-wrongly-charged-with-sexual-assault-of-tennant-creek-toddler","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-31T02:04:46Z","webTitle":"NT police release man wrongly charged with sexual assault of Tennant Creek toddler","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/may/31/nt-police-release-man-wrongly-charged-with-sexual-assault-of-tennant-creek-toddler","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/may/31/nt-police-release-man-wrongly-charged-with-sexual-assault-of-tennant-creek-toddler","fields":{"headline":"NT police release man wrongly charged with sexual assault of Tennant Creek toddler","bodyText":"Northern Territory police have released a 24-year-old man wrongly charged over the alleged sexual assault of a two-year-old girl in Tennant Creek. The man, who has been held on remand at Alice Springs jail for more than three months, was released on Wednesday and had charges against him withdrawn. NT police said it had become aware of “new information” which led to the arrest of another man earlier this week and this man’s release. After the second arrest on Monday, Guardian Australia was told the 24-year-old’s charges remained and he was still set to face trial. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon A NT police spokeswoman said the two-day delay between arresting the second man and releasing the first was because of “ongoing investigations”. On 15 February the two-year-old girl was allegedly raped at her home, and transported to hospital in Tennant Creek, then Alice Springs, before being transferred for treatment in Adelaide owing to the seriousness of her injuries. She remained in hospital for several days, accompanied by her mother. South Australian child protection workers have since removed the girl and her brother from their mother’s care. The 24-year-old was arrested shortly after the assault and police at the time said they were not calling for any information or witnesses relating to other perpetrators. NT police stood by the original arrest and said it was not a bungle, but conceded a compensation claim by the man was a possibility. Asked if an innocent man had been in jail for three months, the assistant police commissioner for crimes, Tony Fuller, said the matter was still under investigation. “The arrest was made on the evidence we had at the time, and it just goes to show we don’t stop an investigation because someone is under arrest,” he said. “We consider all the evidence and, as a result of that, we’ve maintained contact with that person’s legal representatives and our prosecutors, and with information we’ve supplied to them. As a result the charges were withdrawn.” He said it was a complex case with vulnerable witnesses and “it’s not as simple as people think”. “There was a prima facie case on the night that satisfied the court to hold that man in custody,” he said. Fuller wouldn’t give any further details about the evidence, the timing of the evidence, the point at which police considered dropping the charges, or whether the man who was originally arrested remained a person of interest. He had “no idea” if the man had been subject to any violence while on remand. Nor would he say if the second man had been living in the community until now. At the time of the attack the local community and family members criticised the NT government, saying they had tried to raise concerns about the child’s safety but the department said that while more than 20 notifications had been made about her family, they did not relate to threats of sexual violence. But a highly critical report by the NT children’s commissioner determined it was foreseeable “that [the girl] was at risk of harm and that risk could have been managed or mitigated” by NT child protection services. It revealed that the Territory Families department had “an abundance of evidence” that all the girl’s siblings had suffered substantial neglect and numerous harms. “Police had also conducted investigations in relation to sexual and physical abuse upon her siblings, some of these investigations resulted in prosecutions, with the perpetrator incarcerated.” The report was erroneously published and distributed without proper redactions in place. Only part of it was supposed to be visible outside the children’s commission. Among the unredacted sections was a finding that the child had tested positive for gonorrhoea after the attack and had been given post-exposure HIV medication. The assault “was not the only violence that [she] had been exposed to, and experienced, in her short life”, the report said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/01/online-sexism-targeted-in-world-first-bystander-project","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-31T18:00:28Z","webTitle":"Online sexism targeted in world-first 'bystander' project","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/01/online-sexism-targeted-in-world-first-bystander-project","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/01/online-sexism-targeted-in-world-first-bystander-project","fields":{"headline":"Online sexism targeted in world-first 'bystander' project","bodyText":"The Victorian government is funding a world-first project to address sexual abuse and violence against women online through a program that will train people to call out sexism and aggression on the internet. The project is an alliance between a number of domestic violence and women’s advocacy organisations including Gender Equity Victoria, Domestic Violence Victoria and Women’s Health Victoria. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon Last year the UN special rapporteur on the promotion of freedom of expression, David Kaye, said “online gender-based abuse and violence are undeniably a scourge, and governments and companies should be taking action against it”. But Gender Equity Victoria’s manager, Jacinta Masters, said governments had not known where to start to tackle online violence against women. “For a long time the internet has been seen as too big or too overwhelming,” she said. “But it is imperative we make sure women’s voices aren’t silenced. We hope this project will particularly strengthen the voices of women from LGBTIQ and migrant and refugee communities, as well as the voices of women who don’t conform to dominant ideas of femininity, because we know they’re the ones who are so often targeted and silenced. “A lot has been done in workplaces to tackle sexism but these methods haven’t really been trialled before on social media.” Masters said women were tired of waiting for major social media platforms like Facebook, Reddit and Twitter to address the targeting of female users and stamp out pages and users promoting revenge porn and misogyny. The project being led by Gender Equity Victoria will work with moderators at media organisations to help them understand the gendered nature of violence. But a major part of the initiative, Masters said, would be empowering online “bystanders” to speak up and call out sexism. “We want ethical internet users to, when we see abuse online, to feel able to intervene,” she said. “This project is about supporting people who believe in equality and respect towards women to get behind and support women who receive online abuse. Often bystanders feel ill-equipped to do this or are worried about saying the wrong thing, so we will support those people to get the skills they need.” Victoria’s minister for women and minister for the prevention of family violence, Natalie Hutchins, on Thursday announced $400,000 in funding for Gender Equity Victoria, and a further $114,000 for the Active Bystander project. “We need to take the lead from brave women who call out sexism and sexual harassment online, and ensure those who speak out are supported,” Hutchins told Guardian Australia. “This project is a significant step in addressing the sexist commentary which women continue to endure online.’’ An Amnesty International report published in March found 9% of 1,100 British women surveyed thought Twitter was doing enough to stop violence and abuse against women, while 78% felt that sharing their opinion would lead to being targeted with abuse. Amnesty found women reported stress, anxiety and panic attacks as a result of these harmful online experiences. • Guardian Australia is a partner in the Active Bystander project"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"games/2018/jun/04/space-invaders-at-40-tomohiro-nishikado-interview","type":"article","sectionId":"games","sectionName":"Games","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-04T05:30:07Z","webTitle":"Space Invaders at 40: 'I tried soldiers, but shooting people was frowned upon'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/jun/04/space-invaders-at-40-tomohiro-nishikado-interview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/games/2018/jun/04/space-invaders-at-40-tomohiro-nishikado-interview","fields":{"headline":"Space Invaders at 40: 'I tried soldiers, but shooting people was frowned upon'","bodyText":"In the 1970s, as Tomohiro Nishikado began to consider designing his next arcade game, the video game medium was in a fledgling state. With few rules to follow or break, the pioneering game developer had the creative freedom he needed to build a true cultural phenomenon. The game Nishikado was starting to plot out in his mind was Space Invaders, the iconic shoot ’em up that is celebrating its 40th anniversary. “I had no idea the game would become so popular it would become a social phenomenon,” Nishikado remembers. “I was totally taken aback.” Despite his surprise, the game designer had certainly crafted something of great cultural significance. Often credited as the title that single-handedly elevated video games above their then-status as a passing fad, Space Invaders is one of the foundation stones of today’s multibillion-dollar global games industry, along with other early arcade classics like Pong, Breakout and Pac-Man. Four decades after its release, Space Invaders continues to hold sway and status; its pixelated enemy aliens are frequently used as shorthand for video games in their entirety. Not that Nishikado was even thinking about leaving a permanent mark on popular culture. He just wanted to push what could be done with the level of interactivity in a video game. In that aim, he succeeded and then some. Sea Wolf had introduced the notion of “high scores” two years previously, but Space Invaders did a great deal to popularise the concept. Nishikado linked points to in-game progression and introduced the concept of saving scores to the arcade cabinet. That framed score as a signifier of skill and survival, and lured players back to a given arcade cabinet to beat the tallies of others who had played before them; a convention that established competitive gaming. “My initial intention was not to create a game that centred on scoring mechanics, but rather one where players would compete to see who could clear the most waves,” he explains. “However, making the UFO’s score a mystery led to players becoming very conscious of their score and eventually they started competing on that basis. “My aim was to give players a shooting game the like of which they’d never experienced before,” says Nishikado. “I did have the notion that I was introducing a new gameplay element, as the trend had been for only the player to shoot, but here the enemies fired back. More than that though, my focus was more on beginning software development for the microcomputer I used for the game, which was a new sensation given that games had been developed on hardware up until then.” Before Space Invaders – which did require Nishikado to build some hardware using parts ordered through the mail – games were often created by plotting out circuitry and electronic components on an arcade board. Nishikado saw another way, however, and pioneered the notion that games could be designed on a computer. His ambition wasn’t quite met by the underwhelming power of the microcomputers of the time, but in building his own development tools and customising the hardware, he set a convention for the future of the video game industry: games were now software, not hardware. Space Invaders’ popularity and legacy, of course, means that there’s been a lot of speculation about what inspired the game’s themes. Was it the presence of the tail end of the cold war, and paranoia about invading forces? Was it a trip to see a new movie called Star Wars? Did it stand as a metaphor for the relentless demands of modern life as computing power accelerated the human experience? “I wasn’t influenced by any social phenomenon or issues,” Nishikado says. “My aim was purely to create a game that was interesting and fun to play.” But what about George Lucas’s iconic film, which is often credited as inspiring the game? “It wasn’t Star Wars that led to the outer space theme,” he explains. “Initially I started with tanks, then tried warships and warplanes – but the movement and animation didn’t match the game. After much trial and error, by far the best match were soldiers, but shooting people was frowned upon. It was at this time, while I was stuck for an alternative, I chanced upon Star Wars and realised I could use aliens because no one would complain about shooting them. For the actual design of the aliens, I took inspiration from HG Wells’s octopus-like Martian design.” Forty years on, Nishikado admits he doesn’t find time to play many games. But he can’t quite stop dreaming them up. “I still think about how I could use some new technology or other and create an interesting game, so you could say that games are still part of my life,” he says. As well as spawning several dozen rereleases, remasters and sequels, Space Invaders has had a huge influence over video games. In the late 1970s and 80s, countless arcade companies rushed to release contenders for the game’s crown. Space Invaders stirred something in a whole generation of future game development superstars: Mario and Zelda Creator Shigeru Miyamoto, Metal Gear maestro Hideo Kojima and first-person shooter pioneers John Romero and John Carmack all credit it with setting them on the path to becoming game designers. Space Invaders was one of the first games to become a popular phenomenon, as Pokémon Go and Fortnite have become in more recent years. It stands up as an example of compelling game design, and a cabinet resides in MoMA’s permanent collection in Manhattan. It’s an ongoing entity for its publisher, Taito: a version called Space Invaders Extreme was recently ported to Steam in a nod to the 40th anniversary of the original. But Nishikado’s original arcade cabinet remains the locus of its cultural impact."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2018/jul/17/how-we-made-roni-size-on-the-mercury-winning-album-new-forms","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-07-17T05:00:58Z","webTitle":"How we made: Roni Size on the Mercury-winning album New Forms","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jul/17/how-we-made-roni-size-on-the-mercury-winning-album-new-forms","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/jul/17/how-we-made-roni-size-on-the-mercury-winning-album-new-forms","fields":{"headline":"How we made: Roni Size on the Mercury-winning album New Forms","bodyText":"Roni Size, AKA Ryan Williams, producer I was born Ryan Owen Granville Williams but, because I was lighter-skinned, everyone called me Roni, after the only white character in the film Babylon. I was quite short and if my mates were talking about a girl, they’d say: “Oh, she’s Roni’s size.” So that’s how I came up with the name Roni Size. Getting expelled from school in Bristol was one of the best things that ever happened to me. I started going to the city’s Sefton Park youth centre and they had a drum machine. Suddenly I had something that excited me. Then they got a sampler and I was in the basement all the time, making tunes. I got to know [female vocalist] Onallee after she did some jingles for me. We formed part of a collective, Reprazent, with DJ Krust. We’d go to raves, recreate the parts we liked, then use them to build our own music, which could be drum’n’bass, breakbeats, soca, jazz. I sampled everything from James Brown to Everything But the Girl and put all this into New Forms. We wanted to make music that sounded like the future. So the track Beatbox was just us making drum patterns with our own voices. Brown Paper Bag started off as samples of double bass licks. I chopped them up on the sampler and suddenly there was a song. The title didn’t mean anything. It was just something that came to me after smoking herb, which I did back then. At first, the album went right over people’s heads. One reviewer described it as: “Kids in a bedroom on drugs fiddling around with computers.” But when we started touring, with a bass-player and a drummer, people went: “Wow.” We found out we’d been nominated for the 1997 Mercury prize just after we’d played the Montreux jazz festival. We were up against Radiohead, the Prodigy, the Spice Girls and the Chemical Brothers. Because we were so tired, we moaned all the way to the ceremony, and just scoffed all the free food and alcohol. Then Eddie Izzard said: “I think you’ve won it!” And all the cameras started moving towards our table. We were broke, so winning was the stuff of dreams. When I announced that I was donating the £20,000 cheque to the Sefton Park youth centre, my crew looked at me as if to say: “You’re doing what?” Dynamite MC, AKA Dominic Smith, vocals I met Roni at a club in Didcot, Oxfordshire, in 1995. It was one of my first shows and I was the only MC there. “Do you want me to stay on the mic,” I said, “or get off?” He told me to keep going. A month later someone said: “Remember that Roni guy? He’s trying to get hold of you.” I jumped on the train to Bristol and eventually moved up there. No disrespect to Gloucester, my home town, but Bristol was much more exciting. There were lots of clubs and parties – and Massive Attack, Tricky and Portishead were all inspiring each other. I’d grown up with fast music: house, rave and jungle. We took all that energy and put it into a melting pot on New Forms. The collective was just the right amount of chefs: DJ Krust was strings-oriented, DJ Suv brought science-fiction type soundscapes, DJ Die was good at cut-ups, scratches and bass lines, while Onallee was a wonderful singer and songwriter. I feature on Railing and Brown Paper Bag, which was just a working title until I went: “Step to the rhythm made out of brown paper!” It built from there. If it had been called anything else, the rap would have been totally different. The album title was about saying who we were and what we represented, but we had no idea it would have such impact. My strongest memories of the Mercury are the meal – monkfish – and meeting TV hypnotist Paul McKenna. I went: “Wow, I love your show!” And he went: “Never mind my show, tell me about your album!” It felt like we were flying the flag for the entire drum’n’bass scene. The Mercury statue is still in Roni’s front room. We went in as 100-1 outsider kids from the West Country and came out as champions. I wish I’d put a tenner on us. Roni Size/Reprazent play New Forms at the Bluedot festival, Macclesfield, 20 July, and tour until late August. • This article was amended on 17 July 2018 because an earlier version referred to DJ Krush.

The DJ told listeners he was “really tired” and ready to hand over the early morning slot after doing it for longer than he had expected. This week he became the second-longest serving breakfast show presenter in the station’s history. “Come September, it will be six years … I’ve decided it’s time for a change, time for a new show and, most importantly, it’s going to be time for a new wake-up time … preferably about 11.30am,” he said. Grimshaw will remain on Radio 1 and swap jobs with James, who presents the 4-7pm drivetime programme. James then appeared on the programme and said he felt nervous about announcing his new role as host. “I did not sleep one hour last night just thinking about it … it’s too much,” he told Grimshaw. James added that the hosting job would be a “big challenge” and he was “ready to give this a go”. Both presenters will work four days a week, as part of a plan to reinvent Radio 1’s schedule by running weekend programming from Friday to Sunday. Grimshaw was appointed in 2012 to replace the long-serving breakfast show host Chris Moyles, with a mission to reduce the average age of Radio 1’s audience amid fears the station was losing its relevance to young listeners. He inherited a programme with 7 million listeners a week but during his time in control of the programme, which coincided with the explosive growth of smartphones and social media, this at one point dipped to about 5 million. Radio 1 bosses point to the industry-wide decline in the overall number of radio listeners aged 15-24, instead highlighting the growth in the station’s following on Facebook and YouTube as evidence they are still relevant to younger audiences. James, who has been a Radio 1 presenter since 2007, was first considered as a potential candidate for the breakfast show job when Moyles stepped down. Since then the 32-year-old has substantially increased his profile, hosting the primetime BBC One music show Sounds Like Friday Night, writing a series of children’s books, and producing many successful viral videos. This year the presenter told the Guardian that, unlike Grimshaw, he was “phobic of the celebrity world”. He also said the station had struggled with its identity in recent years, as part of the attempt to attract younger listeners at all costs, suggesting this had now changed: “Radio 1 appreciates that if you get the mums and dads, then you have people like my niece and nephew who are eight years old, and I think it can start again like that.” James also co-presents the Tailenders cricket podcast for 5Live. This year he attempted to climb Mount Snowdon, Scafell Pike and Ben Nevis in the space of five days while cycling between each one, only to be be forced to call off the attempt due to extreme weather. He eventually resumed the challenge and raised more than £1m for Sport Relief."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2018/jun/01/with-abc-in-a-pickle-chairman-justin-milne-breaks-silence","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-01T01:37:55Z","webTitle":"With ABC in a pickle, chairman Justin Milne breaks silence | The Weekly Beast","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/jun/01/with-abc-in-a-pickle-chairman-justin-milne-breaks-silence","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2018/jun/01/with-abc-in-a-pickle-chairman-justin-milne-breaks-silence","fields":{"headline":"With ABC in a pickle, chairman Justin Milne breaks silence","bodyText":"It has been seven months since Michelle Guthrie unveiled the winners of her pet project, the Great Ideas Grant. The managing director created a new content fund by axing about 200 jobs, then asked staff to “think about reach, audience gaps, scalability and applying digital-first thinking” and put forward an idea. One of the winning pitches was ABC Life, a new website for health, work, personal finance, pets, family, sex, food, gardening, travel, fashion and creativity under one banner. Back in December ABC Life lead – yes that is his title – Scott Spark advertised for 18 new positions for the digital project, so it’s a sizeable operation. This at a time when hundreds of jobs were cut – the Senate was told last week that since 1 July 2014, 939 ABC employees had been made redundant. The lifestyle site hasn’t gone live yet but the team did share a video with staff to give them a taste of what they’ve been up to: pickling carrots and cucumbers. “One of the ways the team plans to engage new audiences is to give them new ways to use food, which traditionally may have been seen as complicated or time consuming. This video sits alongside other digital content about pickling, such as how it can help reduce food waste and the health benefits (and risks) of pickling. “ABC Life believes that Australians deserve informative and engaging content about things that matter to their lives (things like food) that is independent, and not about driving brand awareness of food companies or supermarket chains.” No one is arguing the ABC can’t do lifestyle content, after all Gardening Australia on TV and Life Matters on Radio National are classic ABC fare. But as the government continues to slash the ABC budget and resources are diverted into digital programming, priorities come into sharp focus. The question for ABC management to consider is whether it is wise to axe 22 newsroom jobs, cut The World Today and PM in half and take Australian Story off-air for eight weeks to make pickling videos, among other lifestyle content. Milne steps up It took a while but the ABC chairman, Justin Milne, finally went public in defence of the ABC, which has been under sustained attack from the Coalition, Pauline Hanson and News Corp. “Australians should not be fooled by the current battle being waged against public broadcasting,” Milne wrote in the Sydney Morning Herald on Wednesday. “Fringe political interests, populists and commercial media all have a shared interest in weakening the ABC and confining it to market failure activities.” The article came five days after Crikey’s Bernard Keane asked “where is Justin Milne?” in the face of unrelenting attacks on Emma Alberici and others. WIN-win for Sky There was big news this week from Sky News, which struck a deal with the regional TV broadcaster WIN to broadcast the pay TV channel on free-to-air television, in the form of a mix of live TV and program highlights. They were a little over the top claiming viewers would be able to “watch a dedicated 24/7 news channel on a free-to-air network for the first time” as the ABC News channel got there first. In return, Sky will have access to WIN’s regional news operation and a chance to promote a Foxtel subscription to a wider audience. But we couldn’t help wondering how those rightwing presenters who populate the evening shifts at Sky will fare under the restrictions of free-to-air TV. While you can say pretty much what you like on pay TV, broadcasters have to abide by the commercial TV industry code of practice when presenting news. The code has strict rules for impartiality, accuracy and fairness, presenting factual material accurately and ensuring “viewpoints included in the program are not misrepresented”. We can’t wait to see how Andrew Bolt, Peta Credlin and Paul Murray fare under those rules. Still on Sky, presenter Samantha Maiden remains on ice following complaints about her office behaviour. Public support from Laurie Oakes and Annabel Crabb does not appear to have changed the situation. Now the Queensland double act of former premiers Peter Beattie and Campbell Newman has been spiked. Beattie and Newman had a show on Monday nights on Sky, until Beattie pulled the plug due to the stress of his day job. “Beattie and Newman has ceased production following a request by Mr Beattie to reduce his hours at Sky News due a heavy schedule of other commitments,” a spokeswoman told Weekly Beast. Beattie has been under pressure to quit because of his role as NRL commissioner. Newman told Weekly Beast he remained a busy guest of other Sky shows, including Paul Murray Live, Outsiders, Bolt and Credlin. In case there weren’t enough ex-pollies on Sky, the former Northern Territory chief minister Adam Giles is now fronting a one-hour Sunday night discussion show. Quill complaint At its meeting this week the board of the Melbourne Press Club discussed criticism from News Corp about the Quill awards, which saw a combined team from Fairfax Media and the ABC win the coveted Gold Quill. The joint multi-platform entry had many authors: the Age’s Nick McKenzie, Richard Baker and Daniel Flitton, the Herald’s James Massola and Philip Dorling, and the ABC’s Chris Uhlmann and Sashka Koloff. For the managing director of editorial for News Corp’s Victoria-based Herald and Weekly Times, Peter Blunden, this was “totally inappropriate”. “I don’t think it is right that the MPC should allow two organisations to combine their resources – one of them using taxpayer funding to commercially benefit the other – and to put their combined work up for awards,” he told the Australian. “Our journalists have every right to feel that they don’t have to beat one other competitor – they have to beat two. I think it sends the wrong cultural signals … I want our journalists to be focused on producing the very best work they can for Australia’s top-selling newspaper, not worrying about what they can do for the ABC. That’s not a good culture; it’s not the culture I want.” The chief executive of the MPC, Mark Baker, told Weekly Beast a board sub-committee would consider Blunden’s concerns along with a number of other proposals relating to the management of the Quill Awards for Excellence in Victorian Journalism and report back later in the year. Fairfax’s dud deal Chris Janz, the managing director of Fairfax Media’s Metro Publishing division, had some good and some bad news for staff in his latest missive. While trying to convince them to accept a significantly downgraded employment deal, he told them they had “the best pay scale in the industry: a grade five Metro journalist earns 40% more than the equivalent industry award grade”. Janz, a digital native, also said the huge wave of Fairfax redundancies was over: “We are pleased to have moved out of the cycle of sweeping voluntary redundancy rounds.” The bad news: “In just six years, newspaper industry revenue has fallen from almost a quarter of the Australian advertising pie to just 8%.” ‘Newsworthy’ again The disappearance of two opinion pieces on Palestine from Fairfax this month may well be a stuff-up rather than a conspiracy, but the writers remain disappointed and perplexed. Israeli sociologist Na’ama Carlin and her friend, Palestinian academic Lana Tatour, were commissioned by the Age to write companion pieces for Nakba Day . But a few days prior to publication the pieces were pulled because they were “not newsworthy enough”, the Age told the women. Carlin told Weekly Beast she did not accept that excuse as they were very timely pieces. Then without warning they were published online where they remained for about 15 hours until an editor spiked them both. Fairfax editors maintain they were published online accidentally due to a technical glitch. A Fairfax Media spokesperson said: “Decisions were made in the normal course of the editing process to hold the stories and run other news content. The stories were unintentionally published online for a brief time. The stories may still get a run at some stage depending on news events.” Unhappy returns? After a break of a couple of years, SBS is bringing back Go Back to Where you Came From, with a significant twist. The show, produced by CJZ, is going to be a live version. With scheduled television under pressure from Netflix and other streaming services, the programs that attract bigger audiences are live events. Think sport, Stargazing and reality TV like The Voice. So CJZ producer Michael Cordell told Weekly Beast he had accepted the huge challenge of taking 50 Australians with “strong views on immigration and asylum seekers” to war-torn countries in a live broadcast. Can’t wait to see how that one works out."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/may/31/banking-royal-commission-suncorp-admits-to-failings-on-small-business-contracts","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-31T10:01:03Z","webTitle":"Banking royal commission: Suncorp admits to failings on small business contracts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/may/31/banking-royal-commission-suncorp-admits-to-failings-on-small-business-contracts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/may/31/banking-royal-commission-suncorp-admits-to-failings-on-small-business-contracts","fields":{"headline":"Banking royal commission: Suncorp admits to failings on small business contracts","bodyText":"Suncorp has admitted it has failed to complete a review of its standard small business contracts to see if they comply with new unfair contract laws, despite a request from the corporate regulator to do so in 2016. It also conceded it has failed to tell its small business customers that their contracts may be subject to the new laws and that their contracts may contain potentially non-compliant terms. The banking royal commission focused its attention on Thursday on small business contracts being offered by Australia’s banks. The commission was reminded that, in November 2016, the federal government had extended unfair contract terms provisions applying to consumers under Australian Consumer Law to cover “standard form” small business contracts, covering small business loans of up to $1m. The government had changed the law because Australia’s small businesses were being offered contracts by major banks on a “take it or leave it” basis – known as “standard form” contracts – with limited opportunity to negotiate the terms. Following the law change, the corporate regulator became concerned that Australia’s major banks were not doing enough to bring their small business contracts into compliance with the new law, so it began reviewing the contracts offered by the big four banks. On Thursday, the royal commission heard Suncorp had still not reviewed all of its small business loan contracts to see if they were complying with the new laws – despite it being two-and-a-half years since the laws were introduced. The commission heard the Australian Securities and Investments Commission had told Suncorp in late 2016 that some of its contract terms ought to be changed, and that Suncorp only made changes to some of its contract terms in May and August 2017. Steven Kluss, Suncorp’s executive general manager of lending, then told the commission that other clauses in Suncorp’s small business contracts could probably be improved. “Our intention is to make the changes but that’s not to say the existing clause that is there is unfair,” he said. The National Australia Bank also admitted it had no legal right to demand funds from the sale of a musical instrument importer’s home be used to pay his business loans. Witness Ross Dillon told the commission on Thursday he would not have sold his home and broodmare farm in the New South Wales Hunter Valley if he knew he would end up with nothing. NAB executive Ross McNaughton conceded NAB had no legal entitlement to use the proceeds of the 2015 sale of the property named Goanna Downs towards the loans for Dillon’s National Music business. That was only revealed when McNaughton appeared at the royal commission on Thursday. Senior counsel assisting the commission Michael Hodge QC asked: “Is it fair to say you now understand that NAB had no lawful entitlement to insist on the full proceeds of Goanna Downs being used to pay down the debts of National Music?” McNaughton said that was correct. The general manager of NAB’s strategic business services division said he had only realised that when reviewing his evidence for the royal commission. NAB held security over Goanna Downs for Dillon and his wife’s mortgage and personal borrowings, but not for National Music’s business facilities. Dillon told the inquiry he planned to use some of the money from selling Goanna Downs to reduce the business debts, but would not have gone ahead if he had realised “we weren’t going to get a penny”. He was surprised when the bank told him it would take all the funds from the sale. NAB’s barrister Wendy Harris QC spent some time questioning Dillon, including about his claim that he felt under pressure from the bank to sell the property. She suggested NAB in fact supported National Music through some pretty difficult times and continued to do so. Dillon said the bank had been amazing, with the exception of the bankers around the time of the Goanna Downs sale."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/may/31/newcastle-port-expansion-plans-scrapped-due-to-weak-demand-for-coal","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-31T07:28:02Z","webTitle":"Newcastle port expansion plans scrapped due to weak demand for coal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/may/31/newcastle-port-expansion-plans-scrapped-due-to-weak-demand-for-coal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/may/31/newcastle-port-expansion-plans-scrapped-due-to-weak-demand-for-coal","fields":{"headline":"Newcastle port expansion plans scrapped due to weak demand for coal","bodyText":"Plans to expand a coal port in Newcastle, New South Wales, have been scrapped by the developer because demand for coal has not increased enough to support the project. Port Waratah Coal Services said on Thursday it would allow its lease for the T4 terminal to lapse when it expired next year because the capacity of existing terminals was likely to be sufficient for future growth in coal exports. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon “With significant growth capacity available in the existing terminals, we do not expect that the conditions to support an investment of the large and long-term nature of Terminal 4 will be in place before the development approval lapses in September 2020,” the company’s chief executive, Hennie du Plooy, said. Port Waratah’s existing terminals, Carrington and Kooragang, exported 105m tonnes of coal in 2017 – out of a combined capacity of 145 tonnes – the company said. Green groups welcomed the news that the project would not proceed and said it was symptomatic of a larger trend away from fossil fuels. NSW Greens’ resources and energy spokesman, Jeremy Buckingham, said he hoped the decision by Port Waratah could serve as a catalyst to transition away from coal to renewables. “The cancellation of T4 at Newcastle Port is symptomatic of a global trend away from fossil fuels and towards clean, renewable energy,” he said. “Reality is catching up with the great lie that we can continue to export coal in an age of climate change.” Tim Buckley, director of energy finance studies at the Institute for Energy, Economics and Financial Analysis, said scrapping of the almost decade-long plan for the greenfield port development was caused by “the failure of thermal coal growth forecasts to materialise”. “Australia is accelerating its energy system transition, even without any plan from our federal or NSW state government,” he said. “This decision to let the lease lapse in 2020 is an important step to reduce the port’s fossil fuel stranded asset risk.” Port Waratah entered into a lease agreement to potentially construct a fourth coal terminal in 2009 and held an option to extend this for a further 10 years. “While Port Waratah will not build a fourth terminal, coal constitutes the bulk of Newcastle port volumes and will remain a big part of Newcastle’s future,” du Plooy said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/may/31/turnbull-pulls-live-export-bill-after-sussan-ley-signals-intent-to-back-labor-ban","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-31T03:08:19Z","webTitle":"Turnbull pulls live export bill after Sussan Ley signals intent to back Labor ban","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/may/31/turnbull-pulls-live-export-bill-after-sussan-ley-signals-intent-to-back-labor-ban","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/may/31/turnbull-pulls-live-export-bill-after-sussan-ley-signals-intent-to-back-labor-ban","fields":{"headline":"Turnbull pulls live export bill after Sussan Ley signals intent to back Labor ban","bodyText":"The Turnbull government has pulled a bill applying more regulation to the live sheep trade after the Liberal MP Sussan Ley signalled she would vote for a Labor amendment applying a ban on exports. The government was due to bring forward its legislation applying tougher regulations to the scandal-prone industry, but yanked the bill on Thursday morning after Ley signalled to government colleagues she would cross the floor. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon The Turnbull government has rejected a ban on live exports in favour of rules to increase space allocated to sheep on ships by 39%, improve ventilation and increase penalties for directors who flout the standards. Ley is pursuing a private member’s bill to ban live sheep exports in the northern summer from next year, and in five years totally ban the transport of sheep and lambs to the Middle East or to any routes through the Persian Gulf or Red Sea. The opposition spokesman on agriculture, Joel Fitzgibbon, telegraphed on Wednesday night that he intended to move amendments to the government bill mirroring the Ley private member’s bill. The procedural tactic would have allowed the Ley proposal to be debated without having to secure the numbers on the floor to bring on the private member’s bill. Government sources have told Guardian Australia Ley told government colleagues on Thursday morning she intended to vote for the Labor amendment if the bill reached the floor, given the alternative would have meant voting down her own bill. The bill was pulled on Thursday morning. It is understood the government was worried about numbers on the floor with several absences this week. Four government MPs are absent, as is Bob Katter, the Queensland crossbencher. After the legislation was pulled, the Nationals deputy leader, Bridget McKenzie, gave Ley an unsubtle public hint to pull her head in. Ley’s efforts with the private member’s bill are directed at trying to change the Liberal party policy on live sheep exports. Nationals have dug in to defend the trade. “There is a lot of product coming out of Sussan Ley’s seat in Farrer that goes to markets around the world – beautiful clean green produce – and anything that undermines our reputation as a trading nation … simply undermines the exporters in her own electorate,” McKenzie told Sky News. Fitzgibbon excoriated the withdrawal of the bill. “The actions taken today clearly show that Malcolm Turnbull is running scared that he does not have the confidence of his party to stop Labor’s amendment,” he said. “Yesterday I foreshadowed that Labor will move an amendment to the bill to incorporate a mirror copy of the Sussan Ley private member’s bill to phase out the live sheep export trade over five years. “This amendment to the bill would have brought the vote on quicker and given it a better chance of passing the House with a simple majority, reflecting the true will of the parliament: to phase out cruelty in the live sheep export trade. “After all the feigned anger over the Awassi Express incident, the prime minister is now putting his own political survival ahead of animal welfare standards.” The agriculture minister, David Littleproud, returned fire: “Labor said it would be bipartisan on live exports, but at the first opportunity it aims to create a pointless war and stop us penalising live exporters who do the wrong thing.” Ley’s private member’s bill is sponsored by Liberal colleagues Sarah Henderson and Jason Wood. Henderson is not in Canberra because she is unwell. Wood told Guardian Australia he would not have voted for the Labor amendment, and he criticised Fitzgibbon for “playing games”. The Victorian Liberal MP said he was talking to Littleproud about getting immediate improvements to animal welfare in live sheep shipments. “My big focus at the moment is working with the RSPCA to get independent vets on the ships,” Wood said on Thursday. “My goal is to end the cruelty and I want to work within the government to end the cruelty. I’m talking about getting independent vets on ships as soon as possible”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/live/2018/jun/23/belgium-v-tunisia-world-cup-2018-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-23T14:13:45Z","webTitle":"Belgium 5-2 Tunisia: World Cup 2018 – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2018/jun/23/belgium-v-tunisia-world-cup-2018-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2018/jun/23/belgium-v-tunisia-world-cup-2018-live","fields":{"headline":"Belgium 5-2 Tunisia: World Cup 2018 – as it happened","bodyText":"Anyway, that’s your lot here. Thanks for reading, and hope you enjoy the rest of the day’s football ... which continues with South Korea’s game against Mexico over here with Mr Baz. Bye! Romelu Lukaku now tops the Golden Boot standings. He joins Cristiano Ronaldo at the head of the race with four, though he’s got a far better shots-to-goal ratio, plus he’s not been on the pitch so long. Some big names already in the running for the prize first awarded to the legendary Italian striker Paolo Rossi in 1982. Here’s the match report ... with Stuart James’s match report from the Spartak Stadium in Moscow to follow. That was a fine performance by Belgium. A few question marks at the back, perhaps, but then who defends well these days? Going forward they look very formidable, and will pose England quite a few questions on Thursday night. Their status as one of the favourites for this World Cup has been revived after a slightly stodgy display against Panama. Over to England, then. But whatever happens tomorrow, Thursday’s showdown at the Kaliningrad Stadium promises to be a cracker. Roberto’s rated his players. Now it’s your turn. Get clicking! Roberto Martinez speaks! “It is not easy to score the amount of goals we have scored in the first two games. It is really good to see a team coming together, to fight so much for each other. And on top of it we have the talent and the quality. Tunisia made it an open game, and it made a game that had a lot of action in both boxes. We had to suffer in spells, but when we were in full flow we were sharp. Qualification in two games: you cannot ask for more from these players.” Well, that was fun. Belgium are as good as in the last 16 and Tunisia are out ... unless Panama record a result for the ages tomorrow lunchtime. Naguez dribbles towards the byline on the right. He pulls back for Khazri, who spins and squirts a consolation into the bottom left! 90 min +2: It’s the second of three added minutes. Batshuayi romps towards the Tunisian box. He’s got Tielemans to his right, but doesn’t return the favour, opting to loft a chip over Ben Mustapha instead. It’s not a good connection, and floats wide right. Hats off to Batshuayi, who has missed some sitters. But he’s kept on coming, and he’s got his reward here. Tielemans curls one in from the right. Batshuayi slides in, and guides it back across Ben Mustapha and into the bottom right! A reward for persistence ... and a very tidy finish. 89 min: The corner is a non-event. As I say, a sense that everyone just wants back to the hotel. 88 min: Meunier races down the right and wins a corner off Benalouane. 86 min: Mertens is replaced by Tielemans. 84 min: Belgium knock it about again, just because this is where we are now. “Vertonghen did, indeed, look groggy,” begins Mac Millings. “Is there a proper concussion protocol in place at this tournament? There have been a few nasty clashes of heads, and Fifa really needs to take concussion as seriously as US sports are (finally) doing. If they do, I think you might see a significant increase in concussion-based substitutions, and they might have to look at changing the sub rules - maybe four total, with a maximum of two being for tactical purposes.” A serious email from Millings?! Regular MBM readers will hope he hasn’t taken a knock to the head. 82 min: Batshuayi could easily have had a six-minute hat-trick. He’s got nowt. 81 min: What does Batshuayi have to do to score?! De Bruyne dribbles to the byline on the left, then pulls back. Batshuayi is six yards out - and pelts the ball straight at the keeper, who parries! Batshuayi gets to the rebound first, but his shot from a tight angle on the right balloons over via a deflection. The corner leads to naught. 79 min: An outrageous miss by Batshuayi! Carrasco cuts in from the left. His low shot is spilled by Ben Mustapha, and falls at the feet of Batshuayi ... who blasts a shot off the underside of the bar, down, out and away! That was a physics-defying nonsense! But also a preposterous miss. 78 min: And now a lull, with a slight sense that both teams would pick up the ball now and call it a day, if they could. 76 min: Another chance for Batshuayi. He’s released by Carrasco and rounds Ben Mustapha on the left. He scoops a shot towards the empty net, but there’s no oomph to the effort, allowing Meriah to hoick off the line. 75 min: De Bruyne slips a pass down the inside-left channel to release Batshuayi. Ben Mustapha comes racing out of his area and intercepts the ball with his chest. On the touchline, Roberto Martinez is claiming a hand ball, but the VAR folks aren’t seeing it. 73 min: Vertonghen’s back on, OK to continue. 72 min: Vertonghen and Sliti clash heads. Vertonghen looks a bit groggy. Play’s stopped as a result. 70 min: Boyata bowls over the up-for-it Sliti, just to the left of the Belgium box. The free kick eventually drops to the feet of Khaoui, 25 yards out: he balloons the ball miles over the bar. 68 min: No hat-trick for Hazard either: he’s replaced by Batshuayi. 67 min: The rain’s started again. It’s very pretty. Badri turns on a sixpence and sends a bobbler towards Courtois, who claims. 66 min: Sliti curls one into the Belgium box from the left. Boyata is forced to head behind for a corner. From the set piece, Sliti has a whack from the edge of the box. He doesn’t connect properly. The ball clanks off Alderweireld. Tunisia make a half-hearted shout for penalty but they don’t really believe in it. 64 min: It’s still a beautiful sunny day in Moscow ... but there’s a sudden shower of summer rain. Hazard glides in from the left and looks for the top right. Nope. And then the rain stops. 62 min: Carrasco, to the left of the D, tries a vicious curler into the top right. It’s not far away from taking the paint off the goalframe, but over and wide nonetheless. 61 min: Ben Youssef races down the right and hooks a low ball into the Belgium box. Badri and Khazri leave it for each other, and the chance to seriously trouble Courtois is gone. The scoring, you sense, hasn’t finished. 59 min: No hat-trick for Lukaku today. Two goals will have to do. Belgium’s main striker will get a rest ahead of the England game, not least because he’s got a sore foot. Mertens will move into his line-leading position; Fellaini is the man coming on. Tunisia meanwhile make their final change: Sassi is replaced by Sliti. 57 min: Carrasco is sent scampering into space down the left, courtesy of a Hazard dummy. Entering the area, he should shoot, but opts to cross instead. A waste. But it’s a corner! Which is also a waste. But Belgium can afford a minor mistake or two. 56 min: Sassi, 30 yards out down the inside-right channel, spots Courtois on walkabout, and sends a looping shot over the keeper and towards the top left. It’s not too far away. Had it been on target, Courtois was toast. 54 min: Maaloul crosses into the Belgian area for the remaining Ben Youssef, Fakhreddine, who heads harmlessly out of play for a goal kick. 53 min: Belgium stroke it around the back awhile, just because they can. Two of their players are on hat-tricks now. But this is surely it now. De Bruyne, from deep inside his own half, rakes down the middle and releases Hazard, who outstrips Benalouane. He takes a touch round Ben Mustapha and slots into the empty net. Another simple goal, but so crisply taken. 50 min: Tunisia are going for it all right. Badri has a whack from the left of the D and warms Courtois’ hands. 49 min: Khazri gently whips a pass down the left and nearly releases Badri. Not quite. Then Tunisia come again, Badri threading a pass through the middle for Khaoui. But Boyata hooks away just as the Tunisian midfielder prepares to pull the trigger. 47 min: But then Lukaku wins a corner down the right, chasing after a long pass, and Belgium take it short. De Bruyne fires low towards the near post, and Alderweireld nearly Total Footballs a flick into the net from close range. Just wide. No sense whatsoever that this match is going to end 3-1. The teams are back ... and we’re off again! Tunisia - who were kept waiting by Belgium - get the ball rolling once more. The half-time interval was 18 minutes long! Ah, they’ve all deserved the rest. Maaloul and Ben Youssef combine well down the right, but can’t quite open Belgium up. The Tunisians need two goals at least if they’re to have any chance of survival. They’ve restarted on the front foot. Half-time snack bar: That was a lot of fun. After a slow start to their World Cup, the Belgian golden generation look a serious proposition again. The free-scoring Lukaku gets another! The excellent Meunier glides in from the right, draws a couple of defenders, then dinks a pass through for Lukaku, down the inside-right. Lukaku draws Ben Mustapha and clips the ball over the keeper. Simple but beautiful. 45 min +3: Suddenly Belgium counter! Meunier skitters across the face of his own area, before dinking the ball away from trouble and to Hazard, in acres of space in the midfield. He races upfield, then slips wide to De Bruyne, who is clear down the inside right! Unselfishly, he crosses low for Lukaku, but the pass is an inch too far forward for his toe. No matter, though, because ... 45 min +2: It’s four minutes of added time in this stoppage-strewn firsts half. Tunisia push Belgium back, but not too far, and they’re not really threatening to penetrate. 45 min: Mertens lifts a pass down the left in the hope of releasing Hazard. But Naguez ushers the ball out of play for a goal kick. Hazard looks slightly frustrated, the result of Belgium’s fast start being checked, no doubt. 43 min: Maaloul dinks one in from the left. Khaoui takes it down and spins gracefully, before winning a corner off Boyata. The set piece goes straight down the throat of Courtois. But Tunisia have done extremely well to come back into this game. They’re asking Belgium plenty of questions. 41 min: Tunisia are forced into another substitution. Syam Ben Youssef has picked up a knock, and he’s carted off on the stretcher too. Benalouane replaces him. That’s half of Tunisia’s back line carried off, and we haven’t even reached the break. 39 min: De Bruyne has been relatively quiet. He tries to spring Lukaku free down the inside-left channel, but his pass forward is always going through to Ben Mustapha. Up the other end, Fakhreddine Ben Youssef chests down and attempts to Le Tissier a volley into the top right. It’s an admirable effort, but always going high and wide. 37 min: The first lull of the afternoon as players stop for a glug of water. These showmen deserve it. 35 min: Lukaku was down getting a bit of treatment back there. A bit of spray on the foot, and a slight worry for Belgium. 33 min: Meunier crosses low from the right. Ben Mustapha should claim easily, but nearly spills it at the feet of Mertens. This game of football is absurdly open, and what could possibly be wrong with that? I’m beginning to have a rough idea what the 1954 World Cup felt like. 32 min: Khazri steps in from the left and sends a powerful looper towards the top right. For a second, it looks like it might be foxing Courtois and heading into the corner, but the keeper does very well to gather. 31 min: Now Sassi drags a shot wide left from 20 yards. This is really fine entertainment! Here’s Hubert O’Hearn: “I guess Roberto Martinez heard that this is the lowest scoring World Cup since 2002 and said, hold Belgium’s greatest export. 9-8 anyone?” 30 min: Khazri tries for goal while wide on the right. It’s that sort of game. 29 min: Belgium look dangerous pretty much every time they go forward. Hazard slips a ball into the area from the left. Lukaku backheels it to Witsel, who can’t get a shot on target from just outside the area. 27 min: De Bruyne sends Lukaku free down the inside right. The striker should enter the box and get a shot away, but he takes a heavy touch. Instead he’s put off by the advancing Ben Mustapha, who ushers him wide right and out of play for a goal kick. Lukaku goes over after a slight brush from the keeper, but he’s barely fallen to the turf before he sportingly sticks a palm up to signal he’s not claiming for a penalty. That’s lovely to see. 25 min: Khazri bombs down the left and from the byline dinks a high-velocity rabona over the sliding Alderweireld. Courtois does very well to catch it without fuss or drama. 24 min: Bronn is replaced by Naguez. Here’s Colin Livingstone: “Good going forward, no idea how to defend. You can spot a Bobby Martinez team a mile off.” 23 min: This has been gloriously entertaining so far. But the momentum comes crashing to a sickening halt as the Tunisian goalscorer Bronn turns his knee in the turf. He’s in severe pain, and is carted off on a stretcher, minutes after the joy of scoring a goal in the World Cup finals. Sport can be so cruel. 21 min: Alderweireld races forward in the Total Football style, making ground down the inside-right channel. He’s given all the time he wants to size up a shot, and looks to thread one into the bottom left. He drags it wide of the left-hand post. 19 min: It’s so nearly 3-1. The ball comes into the Tunisian box from the Belgian right. Meunier’s deep cross is met by Carrasco, coming in from the other flank. He pearls a half-volley towards the right. Ben Mustapha parries. Mertens can’t convert the rebound. And breathe! Is there time to breathe? Tunisia hit back immediately! A free kick for Tunisia on the left. Khazri curls in. Bronn rises highest and glances one into the bottom right! That was pretty simple too. What a start to this game! The in-form Lukaku makes it two! He’s sent racing down the inside-left channel by Mertens. He takes a touch to his left, then slams a low shot into the bottom right through the legs of Syam Ben Youssef. Easy, easy. 14 min: Khazri and Vertonghen battle for a ball down the Tunisian right. Khazri wants a free kick, or maybe even a penalty, for a light brush on the face. He’s not getting it. Then Sassi puts in a late tackle in the midfield. He’d have gotten away with it, but, frustrated about the earlier non-decision, engages in trenchant debate with the ref, and is booked. 12 min: Hazard does extremely well to keep the ball in play, tight on the byline on the left. He pulls back for Witsel, who can’t quite get a shot away. Then another phase, and Lukaku is blazing down the right. He centres low for Hazard, who flicks tamely towards goal: he probably should have scored. 10 min: Skhiri, quarterbacking from deep, floats a pass down the inside-left channel in the hope of releasing Badri. It’s not a bad idea, and Badri’s not a million miles away from meeting the ball, but Courtois is out quickly to claim, no sweat. Tunisia have come back at Belgium, though. 8 min: That will settle Belgium, who were very nervous and sluggish in the first half against Panama earlier in the week. Khazri tries to get something going for Tunisia by way of response, but his pass down the right isn’t anticipated by Fakhreddine Ben Youssef. The VAR has a quick look at the penalty - the challenge was right on the line - but the decision stands. Hazard strokes the spot kick into the bottom left corner. Ben Mustapha didn’t even move. Easy. 5 min: Belgium triangulate in the pretty style. Suddenly Hazard bursts towards the Tunisian box down the inside-right channel. Syam Ben Youssef comes across, sticks a leg out, and upends his man. The ref points at the spot. 3 min: Meunier cuts in from the right and looks to thread a low shot into the bottom right. Ben Mustapha smothers well. It’s fair to say this has been an open start. 2 min: Badri goes on a very determined run down the left. He cuts inside and nearly makes space for a shot. It’s an excellent dribble, but he’s stopped by Vertonghen. Belgium punt it long, and Lukaku is first to a long ball down the inside-right channel. He tries to lift it over Ben Mustapha, but the keeper gets the better of him. And we’re off! Belgium get the ball rolling. A huge roar meets the kick-off. And Belgium are on the front foot quickly. Vertonghen tears down the right, flips the ball inside, and Hazard is fouled, 40 yards from goal. A chance for Belgium to line up on the edge of the box, and for De Bruyne to curl one onto someone’s noggin. But he gets the free kick hideously, uncharacteristically wrong, and punts the ball straight to Ben Mustapha, who gathers calmly. The teams are out! It’s a beautiful sunny day in Moscow. And there’s a Seven Nation Army fuelled atmosphere at the Otkritie Arena. Here, Belgium’s yellow kit is very natty. Though it’s not quite up there with their 1982 shirt ... but then what is? Anyway, we’ll be off in a minute. The national anthems: La Brabançonne exudes a gentle pageantry, and would sound good pouring quietly from a tinny speaker outside a cafe, as one perched on vintage cast-iron furniture sipping artisan wheat beer while drawing hard on a cigarette with no filter. ♭♮♯ Noble Belgium, O mother dear / To you we stretch our hearts and arms / With blood to spill for you, O fatherland! / We swear with one cry – You shall live! ♭♮♯ The Tunisian number, Ḥumāt al-Ḥimá, is equally easy on the ear. The lyrics are a bit more strident than the music, which is a bouncy, fun sound. ♭♮♯ O defenders of the homeland / Rally around to the glory of our time! /The blood surges in our veins / We die for the sake of our land! ♭♮♯ A sneak peek in the dressing rooms. This is the pennant Belgium will present to Tunisia before the game. Some nice wood panelling there, too, and sturdy lockers, the sort you’d find in a high-end spa and health club. I’ll be straight with you, I’m killing time. Here, if you squint hard enough, you’ll spot Belgium are playing in their second-choice yellow kit today. Meanwhile Tunisia will be playing in their second-choice red strip. Pre-match reading: If you haven’t read this magnificent piece by Simon Burnton yet, what are you waiting for? Be about your business! It’s a nostalgic breeze through England’s preparations at World Cups past, including the following wonderful snippet from 1958: The Tottenham manager, Bill Nicholson, had scouted England’s next opponents, Brazil, and under his instruction the second string imitated the Brazilians in a practice match, with Peter Broadbent taking his impersonation of Didi so far he spoke in broken English and cried “caramba!” in particularly heated moments. Belgium have named an unchanged, and Premier League heavy, side. Thibaut Courtois, Toby Alderweireld, Jan Vertonghen, Kevin De Bruyne, Romelu Lukaku and Eden Hazard will all be in action from the get-go, as they were against Panama. Tunisia make two changes to the team named against England. Ben Mustapha replaces the injured Mouez Hassen in goal, while striker Naim Sliti of Lille makes way for midfielder Saif-Eddine Kahoui. Belgium: Courtois, Alderweireld, Boyata, Vertonghen, Meunier, De Bruyne, Witsel, Carrasco, Mertens, Lukaku, Eden Hazard. Subs: Mignolet, Vermaelen, Kompany, Fellaini, Thorgan Hazard, Tielemans, Januzaj, Dembele, Batshuayi, Chadli, Dendoncker, Casteels. Tunisia: Ben Mustapha, Bronn, Syam Ben Youssef, Meriah, Maaloul, Khaoui, Skhiri, Sassi, Fakhreddine Ben Youssef, Khazri, Badri. Subs: Mathlouthi, Benalouane, Haddadi, Bedoui, Ben Amor, Khalil, Srarfi, Khalifa, Chaalali, Nagguez, Sliti. Referee: Jair Marrufo (USA). Welcome to our coverage of the Other Game in Group G. England take on Panama tomorrow, but first much-fancied Belgium face Tunisia in Moscow this afternoon. Belgium were disappointing in their opening match against Los Canaleros, a testament to how highly they’re regarded seeing they won 3-0 and scored one of the goals of the tournament so far. Having started that one in a rather sluggish manner, they’ll hope to be a little sharper today as they face a Tunisian team that gave England a proper game earlier in the week. Belgium will make it through to the last 16 if they win this one; Tunisia will be going home if they lose and Panama fail to pull of the mother of shocks tomorrow by beating England. Both teams need this; it promises to be a cracker. It’s on! Kick off: 1pm BST, 3pm at the Otkritie Arena in Moscow."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"stage/2018/jun/27/the-25-best-british-plays-since-jerusalem","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-27T05:00:30Z","webTitle":"Knockouts, nobles and nukes: the 25 best British plays since Jerusalem","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/jun/27/the-25-best-british-plays-since-jerusalem","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/jun/27/the-25-best-british-plays-since-jerusalem","fields":{"headline":"Knockouts, nobles and nukes: the 25 best British plays since Jerusalem","bodyText":"Enron (2009) Finance shot to the top of the theatrical agenda in the wake of free-market crises and capitalist corruption. What hit one about Lucy Prebble’s play, charting the rise and fall of a Texan energy company that ended with debts of $38bn, was the element of fantasy in the corporate world. “We’re not an energy company – we’re a powerhouse of ideas,” claimed Enron’s hubristic chief exec. Rupert Goold’s astonishing production heightened the Citizen Kane aspect of a play that beautifully blended political satire and multimedia spectacle. Off the Endz (2010) Bola Agbaje first attracted attention with the Olivier award-winning Gone Too Far!, which looked at sibling rivalry. This follow-up was an even richer play that showed a young, high-flying black couple caught in a pincer movement between economic recession and loyalty to a council estate mate just out of jail. As played by Ashley Walters, this last character became a charismatic fantasist tempting the couple with mad money-making schemes. Although Agbaje has been accused by some of stereotyping shiftless black males, it would be fairer to praise her for telling uncomfortable truths. Sucker Punch Few writers are better than Roy Williams at using sport as a political metaphor. He did it with football in Sing Yer Heart Out for the Lads. This time it was boxing, as we saw two black kids training in a south London gym in the 1980s under the tutelage of its Thatcherite owner. Seemingly liberated by success, they end up as pawns in the hands of white promoters for whom they are meal tickets. Daniel Kaluuya and Anthony Welsh were magnificent as the two fighters and Miriam Buether’s design turned the Royal Court into a boxing ring full of sweat and resin. Anne Boleyn Howard Brenton, after a long sojourn writing for TV’s Spooks, has turned out a lot of plays in recent years: none better than this one, which offered a radically revised view of its heroine who was seen as Protestant champion rather than sexual predator. Secret meetings with Biblical scholar William Tyndale led her to procure a copy of a book that persuaded the Tudor monarch that a king’s prime allegiance was to God rather than the pope. Staged with Henry VIII at Shakespeare’s Globe, Brenton’s emerged as much the more interesting play. London Road (2011) I’ve kept musical theatre out of my list but this verbatim piece, with book by Alecky Blythe and score by Adam Cork, was too outstandingly original to be overlooked. Comprising interviews with the residents of an Ipswich street that had witnessed the murder of five sex workers, it focused less on the horror of the situation than on the healing process. We saw a community reconstituting itself through floral competitions and quiz nights and, under Rufus Norris’s direction, Blythe and Cork brilliantly found a musical pattern in the fragmented rhythms of everyday speech. One Man, Two Guvnors Freely adapted by Richard Bean from a classic Goldoni play of 1746, this provided the funniest theatrical evening since Frayn’s Noises Off or Ayckbourn’s The Norman Conquests. It was also the making of James Corden who, as a failed skiffle player working simultaneously for a snooty toff and his disguised lover, showed a porpoise-like delicacy and profound geniality that has since served him well on American TV. Much of the evening’s joy was provided by Cal McCrystal’s physical comedy, which required an octogenarian waiter to serve a bowl of soup, fall backwards down a flight of stairs and bounce back like a rubber ball. Written on the Heart The 400th anniversary of the King James Bible in 2011 was marked by epic readings, modern updates and this fascinating play by David Edgar reminding us that the Bible is a product of its time and a composite of previous translations. Dramatically, the highlight was an imagined debate between Bishop Lancelot Andrewes and William Tyndale, a radical who wanted the scriptures rendered in a comprehensible vernacular. The moment I remember from this RSC production is when an aged cleric announced that “he who is without love and mercy shall never come to Christ”. This House (2012) James Graham has firmly established himself, in a tradition created by Hare and Edgar, as the liveliest recorder of our recent history. Following plays about the Suez crisis and Thatcher’s childhood, he turned to the perilous survival of the Labour government from 1974-79. This was a brilliant play about the daily process of politics with the government facing either a hung parliament or a wafer-thin majority. Although the play showed the sick and dying wheeled in to vote, it offered a surprising testament to the tenacity of parliamentary democracy. Red Velvet Half the battle in drama is finding the right subject. Lolita Chakrabarti hit on an excellent one in recalling the prejudice faced by the African American actor Ira Aldridge when he played Othello at Covent Garden in 1833. His presence caused dissent in the company, hostility in the press and shock in the audience when he passionately kissed Desdemona. The play also reminded us that Aldridge was a theatrical pioneer, and it was fascinating to see Adrian Lester (who was about to play Othello at the National) magically combining innovative realism with 19th-century gestural acting. Chimerica (2013) There may be a trade war between China and America, but US president Donald Trump has described Chinese leader Xi Jinping as “just great”. That odd love-hate relationship lends extra pertinency to Lucy Kirkwood’s epic play about the parallels and differences between the world’s rival superpowers. In America, she shows a photographer being acclaimed for his tireless pursuit of a supposedly exiled Tiananmen Square demonstrator; in Beijing, a man pays a price for protesting about the smog-induced death of a neighbour. Rather than scoring ideological points, Kirkwood wittily and energetically shows why Niall Ferguson coined the word “Chimerica” to describe two nations joined at the hip. Handbagged No one, except those involved, knows what really happened at the weekly meetings between the Queen and Thatcher in the 1980s, but it doesn’t stop people speculating. What was just one episode in Peter Morgan’s The Audience became the subject of Moira Buffini’s hilarious and oddly plausible play. Her thesis broadly is that, given the Queen’s attachment to the Commonwealth, there must have been dismay at her PM’s unwillingness to impose sanctions on apartheid South Africa and at her reluctance to accept majority rule in Zimbabwe. As in all modern plays about the monarchy – including those by Alan Bennett and Sue Townsend – the Queen came out on top. Visitors (2014) Barney Norris, then only in his mid-20s, displayed a mature understanding of old age in his debut play. Set in a farmhouse on the edge of Salisbury Plain, it showed an elderly married couple falling into disrepair. Instead of displaying the pity that is often close to contempt, Norris focused on the security of married love and the ailing couple’s delight in a shared past. With beautiful performances by Robin Soans and Linda Bassett, the play won all kinds of awards, evoked memories of the quiet compassion of David Storey and signalled a promise fulfilled by Norris’s next play, Eventide, and his debut novel, Five Rivers Met on a Wooded Plain. King Charles III Is it likely our future king would, within a month of assuming the throne, create a constitutional crisis by refusing royal assent to a parliamentary bill? Once you accepted the premise of Mike Bartlett’s play, it assumed an unstoppable momentum and acquired a tragic grandeur. That was partly because of Bartlett’s canny use of blank verse and evocation of Macbeth and Richard II. But it was also because of a magnificent performance by Tim Pigott-Smith, who sadly died after the play’s run but not before it had been recorded for TV. He invested Charles with a principled anxiety as he declared: “Without my voice and spirit, I am dust.” The James Plays “A king has no friends,” says James II in the central play of Rona Munro’s ambitious seven-and-a-half-hour trilogy, which reminded us of the inescapable solitude of monarchy. The great virtue of the trilogy, covering Scotland’s history from 1421 to 1488 under the rule of James I, II and III, was its vigorous, unsentimental portrait of a kingdom beset by fractious, feudal in-fighting: as Sofie Gråbøl’s sceptical Dane, marrying into the royal family, asked: “Who would want the job of ruling Scotland?” Jointly presented by the national theatres of Scotland and Great Britain, the trilogy once again showed a female dramatist defying gender stereotypes by displaying an appetite for the epic. Oppenheimer (2015) We are no longer surprised to see science on stage. This work by Tom Morton-Smith turned out to be the best play about nuclear physics since Michael Frayn’s Copenhagen. What it caught excellently were the contradictions of the father of the atomic bomb and leader of America’s Manhattan Project. In John Heffernan’s performance, he seemed cold-blooded in his ability to ditch former sexual partners and communist associates yet fervent in his development of the bombs to be dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. All plays about nuclear physics raise moral issues. Morton-Smith’s also created a flawed tragic hero. People, Places and Things Sometimes it is hard to separate the play and the performance. Denise Gough rightly won every award going for her portrayal of an actor, fuelled by drink and drugs, who breaks down during a performance of The Seagull and checks into a rehab clinic: it was a brilliant performance in which Gough caught the addict’s mix of vulnerability and obduracy. Credit also belongs to Duncan Macmillan for showing the irony of the heroine’s resistance to the kind of confessional techniques she would have employed as an actor. As well as a fine character study, his play offered a fierce critique of a chaotic society that produces multiple forms of addiction. The Moderate Soprano The Sunday Times critic Harold Hobson looked for rapturous, single moments in a play. I had a Hobsonian experience watching David Hare’s play about the foundation in 1934 of a country opera house at Glyndebourne in Sussex. When Roger Allam as John Christie launched into a speech saying that his dream was to offer audiences a glimpse of the sublime, I was moved by his highly unfashionable endorsement of the power of great art. The play also told us a lot about Christie’s devotion to his wife and Glyndebourne’s dependence on European refugee talent, but it was the ringing defence of opera’s potential for ecstasy that made it memorable. Escaped Alone (2016) “Posh tosh,” said the critic of the Daily Mail. I’d beg to differ. Like most of Caryl Churchill’s recent work, this one had a packed minimalism. It said a lot in 50 minutes. We listened raptly to the seemingly random chat of four women sitting in a sunlit garden: they dwelt lovingly on old times, broke into a rendering of a 1963 Crystals hit and yet relished the benefits of living today (“whole worlds in your pocket,” said one of mobile phones). Their talk, however, was punctuated by a series of monologues envisioning global catastrophe. The mundane and the apocalyptic sat side by side in a way that was characteristically Churchillian. Cyprus Avenue Every so often a play comes along that leaves you profoundly shaken; Edward Bond’s Saved was one, Sarah Kane’s Blasted another. David Ireland’s play was in the same league. It was a study of a Belfast loyalist, rivetingly played by Stephen Rea, who believed that the Protestant cause was being destroyed by “the Fenians” and that his five-year-old granddaughter had the same face as Gerry Adams. While Ireland’s play was about a man uncertain of his own identity, it also vividly demonstrated the madness of sectarian hatred. Oil Ella Hickson’s epic boldly pursued one woman’s trajectory through a span of almost two centuries. Starting as a Cornish farmer’s wife in 1889, she ended up in the same county in 2051 depending for survival on a Chinese visitor’s miracle of renewable energy. Along the way, Hickson tackled empire, the environment and, above all, mother-daughter relationships. She seemed to imply that women’s progress was accompanied by a growing loneliness and sense of estrangement from family. Oil is a play that gnaws at the memory. The Children Lucy Kirkwood is the only writer to get two entries in this selection. Deservedly so, because this three-character play raised a host of big issues. Set on a Norfolk farm following a nuclear catastrophe, it brought together two long-separated female scientists responsible for building the contaminating plant. In the intervening years, one had borne four children, the other none. This allowed Kirkwood to explore topics including whether parenthood increases a sense of social responsibility and how people in the future will react to the poisoned legacy of the present. A humane triumph. Consent (2017) “Let’s kill all the lawyers,” says Dick the Butcher in Shakespeare’s Henry VI Part Three. Nina Raine doesn’t go that far but she subjects them to fierce moral scrutiny in this probingly intelligent play. In particular, she asks if rape cases should be subject to point-scoring courtroom narratives and suggests that dealing with violent, dishonest people may have a corrupting effect on lawyers. Raine captures the clubbiness of the law and the sadness of a soured marriage while allowing the audience to make its own judgment. The Ferryman A box office hit even before it opened, Jez Butterworth’s play deserved the accolades heaped upon it. Combining the gangland politics of Mojo with the rural rituals of Jerusalem, this was a story about the power of unspoken love. Down on a farm in County Armagh in 1981, a reformed IRA activist could never quite articulate his feelings for his brother’s wife while two aunts were haunted by the loss of their loved ones. The political and the personal seamlessly intersected, but it was the power of private passions that fuelled this multilayered award winner. Barber Shop Chronicles Inua Ellams – poet, graphic artist and playwright – had the bright idea of setting this piece in six barber shops in two continents on a single day: as it happens the one in 2012 when Chelsea beat Barcelona in a Champions League semi-final. The beauty of the play lay in Ellams’ ability to see that, for African men, the barber’s is a mix of pub, political platform, social centre and soapbox. The range of subjects covered was astonishing, the language racy and vigorous, and Bijan Sheibani’s production was like a party the audience had been invited to join. Nine Night (2018) Like Winsome Pinnock’s pioneering Leave Taking, Natasha Gordon’s exhilarating debut play showed a family acknowledging its Jamaican past while living in the London present. The title referred to the Jamaican tradition of a nine-night funeral wake, but what was cheering about Gordon’s play was its suggestion that you can inhabit two worlds simultaneously. The family’s bright, young graduate was happy to suspend her rationalist scepticism while her aunt – joyously played by Cecilia Noble – took an active part in traditional rituals and still ensured she got home in time for EastEnders. Resentment at Britain’s historic hostility to immigrants was combined with Gordon’s fundamental faith in a twin cultural existence. • Jerusalem is at the Watermill, Bagnor, until 21 July."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jul/21/where-to-move-for-avoiding-traffic","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-07-21T06:59:29Z","webTitle":"Where to move for… avoiding traffic","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jul/21/where-to-move-for-avoiding-traffic","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jul/21/where-to-move-for-avoiding-traffic","fields":{"headline":"Where to move for… avoiding traffic","bodyText":"The age of the privately owned vehicle is O-V-E-R.

We have children and grandchildren. My ex-husband was a serial adulterer but this time I was so hurt and angry I had the strength to ask him to leave. Our marriage had not always been easy and we didn’t communicate well; I had often felt lonely. There was a lot of acrimony in the divorce proceedings. I shouldered the burden of sorting things out, including selling our home. I don’t feel I was being difficult – I wasn’t looking for any more than our finances to be halved, but he thought I was being controlling. I did survive moving house, divorce, the death of my father, but at great emotional cost. I was OK for a while but then last year my ex sent me a message saying he didn’t want never to speak to me again. I wasn’t ready to be his friend. I sent him a message saying I felt unable to speak to him at the moment, but I was OK and hoped that he was, too. He said he had only contacted me because one of our children had asked him to. Since then I have been questioning decisions I made, my own self-worth and generally feeling very low about everything. I seem to be incapable of making decisions. I worry about money and feel so lost sometimes. I had started to build a new social life and make new friends but, over the last year, have been withdrawing from people and not being as open to them. I don’t feel able to speak about my feelings. When you stopped putting up with your husband’s serial infidelity, I think he mistook you being “in control” with “being controlling”. They are not the same thing. Good for you for having the strength to get out, and I’m sorry to hear about your father. Your emotional landscape has indeed been rocky these last few years and this is bound to take its toll. We can cope with things in the short-term, because dealing with what’s right in front of us (funerals, divorce lawyers, estate agents) takes up our immediate, practical attention. The emotional fallout comes afterwards, when life becomes more normal. When people get together at a very young age, they can sometimes remain stuck, emotionally, where they were when they met. In some ways, you are still the teenager you were when you met your husband. You’ve been defined by your marriage for so long that it’s going to take time to rediscover who you are outside of it. This was a marriage in which you couldn’t communicate, so very probably thinking about how you feel, and being able to act on it, is a new freedom for you, which will take time to get used to. But you’ve shown courage and impressive resilience – have a little faith in yourself. Chris Mills, a psychotherapist who works with separating couples, said that what you did was “very brave, an act of great self-determination”, but he went on to say that “the less developed areas of your self-esteem haven’t caught up with you yet. You’re suffering from a lack of confidence and some delayed shock and you may be confusing missing the habit of being in a relationship with missing this particular relationship.” This is all entirely normal. Look how far you have come. Despite your wobble, you are resolute that you don’t want to speak to your ex – that’s amazing. What makes you feel good? We all have something that makes us feel better. For me routine is key, having things to do, and getting out of the house. There’s a saying “when you feel blue, go green” – when you feel down, go out. Obviously this is not right for all situations, but I am concerned you’re shutting yourself off and starting to withdraw. When we go out and mix with others we see our place in the world, and I feel that’s terrifically important. You say you’d started to make friends, can you go out with one of them? Have a change scene, do something that makes you feel good? Plan a weekly meet up? Is there someone you can trust whom you can tell how you feel? Mills felt it would be great if you could get some counselling – despite resources often being patchy, some GPs do have counsellors attached to the surgery or there may be free/low-price therapy in your area (otherwise see links below). I think even one or two sessions could be a great start to help you rediscover who you are, and that you matter to lots of people. bacp.co.uk; aft.org.uk; cruse.org.uk; bpc.org.uk Send your problem to annalisa.barbieri@mac.com.

The Ronderos – self-governing peasant patrols – are resuming their nightly rounds five months after the brutal killing of their lieutenant governor, Napoléon Tarrillo Astonitas. “During all the years I’ve lived here, the situation has never been this threatening. The murder of the lieutenant governor in this hamlet made us organise in order to protect ourselves,” says Humberto Gonzales Núñez, head of Rondas Campesinas of El Mirador. El Mirador and the surrounding hamlets remain deeply shaken by the murder last December, living in terror as invaders continue to seize their land within the Chaparrí ecological reserve, one of Peru’s most biodiverse forests. “This hurts so much –my husband was my only family,” Flor Vallejos, Tarrillo’s widow, says. “He was a lovely person. He liked to defend our environment, our lands, and our dry forest. The animals, he loved them.’’ Land invaders turned their attention to Chaparrí six years ago when plans to build La Montería reservoir dangled the promise of water resources in a desert-like environment – raising the possibility of agricultural expansion in the protected area. To date, 28 individuals opposing the plans have been threatened, and last year 10 cases of suspicious forest fires were reported in Chaparrí. According to the head of Peru’s supreme court, Duberlí Rodríguez, more than 1,000 hectares of the area have been affected by land grabbers – deforested, burned and illegally cultivated. The location of La Montería reservoir has been a controversial matter, since it is within the borders of the protected area, going against a resolution made by the environment ministry in 2011. The head of Peru’s congressional environmental commission, María Elena Foronda, says the reservoir project has not been approved by the authorities governing protected areas, forests and wildlife, nor the environment ministry. “There have simply been acts of corruption,” she adds. An organised criminal network has its hold on the area, says Mar Pérez Aguilera, coordinator for the activist group National Coordinator for Human Rights, which is currently helping to keep Vallejos in hiding. She recounts four cases of murder tied to land grabbing in the area so far: that of Tarrillo, and those of three police officers in Salas two years ago. But the crimes are rarely prosecuted, and the perpetrators seldom face legal consequences. “Impunity is a message of support,” says Pérez. “We know that very powerful people are involved in this case, and that is making everything more difficult.” The case of Chaparrí is legally complex. According to Rodríguez, invaders have also infiltrated the community’s group of legal representatives known as the Administrative Directive, enabling an influx of nearly 500 new members during the past six years. Many of them do not meet the normal criteria to join the group, he says. “It is the Administrative Directive itself that is promoting the disappearance of Chaparrí; they are enemies of the reserve,’’ Rodríguez says. Etlevina López Vásquez has been a community member for the majority of her life, and was also one of the founders of Chaparrí, but says she has found herself a target under the new authorities. She says she has been insulted, that her animals have been killed, and that the new members have tried to expel her from the community. “We have been very dedicated community members, but since the new directive came to power, the expulsions began, conflicts began, our voices were silenced – as if we did not exist,” she says. Tonight, López hears familiar voices among the barks of dogs while the Ronderos pass her hut. Halfway up the road the men all stiffen and throw each other anxious looks as headlights of an approaching car are spotted. Blowing on plastic whistles, they flank the vehicle as it slows to pull over. There is a sudden, collective sigh of relief – this time they know the driver, and wave him on."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/jun/22/working-class-concerns-ignored-in-brexit-debate","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-22T15:45:21Z","webTitle":"Working-class concerns ignored in Brexit debate | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jun/22/working-class-concerns-ignored-in-brexit-debate","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jun/22/working-class-concerns-ignored-in-brexit-debate","fields":{"headline":"Working-class concerns ignored in Brexit debate","bodyText":"Campaigners are marching on Saturday calling on the government to agree to a people’s vote on the final Brexit deal.

If disaffected Brexit voters still believe that many of their everyday woes are due to EU membership, rather than UK government policies and treatment of the less well-off, then why would they change their vote? A brief look at some of the main legislative areas over which our government has total control – pensions, taxation, monetary policy, social care, health and welfare, education and training – tells the story. These are the areas that are failing the working class, which by design benefit the already wealthy. This is the argument that needs to be made to the working-class Brexit voter. It needs to be made soon and on the doorstep. Susan Hunter Brockenhurst, Hampshire • Michel Barnier’s comments (GCHQ chief warns Europe of need for Brexit security deal, 19 June) are not particularly surprising given they fit within the strict interpretation of his mandate in the context of the UK’s declared red lines. As a non-EU country post-Brexit, the UK could not expect to have access to the European arrest warrant, Europol or key databases. But Mrs May has previously made clear that there is potentially some room for manoeuvre here, having stated that the ECJ would “have to be respected” in the event of formal cooperation along the lines of an internal security treaty. Barnier and his team may well be pushing a maximalist position as a starting point for discussion, but while the need to protect the legal integrity of the system is clear, there is the risk that their apparent lack of flexibility becomes problematic and risks damaging the prospects for some kind of deal on internal security which the UK seems willing to explore. If mechanisms can be created – or which already exist and which the UK will accept – to safeguard cooperation with the UK, then it makes sense to explore the possibilities. This is an area where an intervention by the member states may be necessary as it is clearly getting into areas of capital “P” politics – in this case security cooperation – for which they ultimately take responsibility and to which the UK’s contribution remains important. Dr Nicholas Wright Teaching fellow in EU politics, UCL • Larry Elliott , 21 June) makes some very interesting points. It is indeed true that the Labour party has not produced a common response to Brexit. In this respect it follows the British people as a whole. And indeed it is a problem that has to be addressed immediately. However, the general thesis Elliott advances (The right sees opportunity in a crisis. Why can’t the left?, 21 June) – that the chaos brought about by leaving the EU will have its positive dimensions to exploit – is not convincing. It seems to say the same thing as those who might suggest that we have to go through the second world war in order for the United Nations to be established. We have to be careful not to get fixated into a radical view of politics where positive change only comes about through conflict and social upheaval. We have to start from where we are and work with social and political forces that are to hand. There are better ways forward that seeking to destroy to create. We need to work with other European political parties who favour a reform of the EU, in particular those movements and parties that are opposed to austerity. Elliott’s left Brexit will please no one and get nowhere. Whereas getting our current negotiations with the EU on a more constructive path will allow an opportunity to advance public investment, counter austerity and give an opportunity to resist neoliberalism at a European level. What Elliott seems to forget is that socialists are also internationalists, and that our most reliable supporters in achieving socialist aims are to be found within the EU rather than outside it. The idea that we can go it alone and so establish “socialism in one country” seems to me to be wholly anachronistic. That is one experiment that has already been tried (perhaps excluding Cuba) and proved wrong. Within the EU we can democratically influence it to become a more active opponent and critic of neoliberalism. Outside it we will have no purchase on EU economic policy and so no significant impact on the global economic system. Howard Williams Cardiff • In the end Dominic Grieve, Nicky Morgan and all those other “would be rebels” let themselves and their country down (Report, 21 June). Party before country, self-interest before principle. The “meaningful vote” that could have saved Britain from the Brexit precipice was betrayed. History will not treat the pathetic lack of leadership in our current national politics kindly. I for one have finally lost confidence in our so-called “democratic” parliamentary system. There will be thousands of angry people in the march against Brexit in London on Saturday. People who’ve travelled from all over the UK to say “no” to Brexit. Britain is now more divided than ever. A reckoning will come eventually.

But analysts have said the country has neither the infrastructure nor the energy demand to warrant installing so much solar capacity in one go, saying the announcement reflects the scale of India’s ambition to become a renewable energy leader. It is one of several green power promises made by Delhi this month on the back of continually falling renewables prices, with implications for coal projects including the proposed Adani Group mine in Queensland, Australia. The Indian power minister RK Singh flagged the 100GW tender at an event in Delhi last week. While discussing a world record 10GW solar tender set to launch in July, Singh reportedly told the audience: “Now [we] will bring out a bid of one lakh megawatts which would also include solar manufacturing and storage.” One lakh refers to 100,000 in the south Asian numbering system, equivalent to 100GW. His office confirmed the plan to the Guardian but declined to provide further details other than that the tender would be launched “in the near future”. ‘Brilliant statement of intent’ The unscheduled announcement surprised some energy policy specialists who said it was unrealistic and unnecessary. “There are many, many operational constraints to the plan in terms of land availability, transmission connections, who’s going to buy and pay for those [transmission] towers, and so forth,” said Vinay Rustagi, the managing director of Bridge to India, a renewable energy consulting firm. “I don’t think a 100GW tender makes a lot of sense,” said Tim Buckley, a director at the pro-renewables Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, but adding he thought the plan was a “brilliant statement of intent”. Delhi announced this month it was raising its target for the amount of renewable energy capacity it plans to install by 2022 to more than 227GW. The previous target, already considered ambitious, was 175GW. About 70GW have been installed so far and another 40 are under construction or being put out to tender, according to government data from June. Buckley said on current trends India was unlikely to reach the 227GW target, but said it was setting an aspirational goal to attract investment and develop the local industry. “The idea is, aim for the moon and you’ll hit the top of the tree,” he said. There are constraints on how fast additional capacity can be added, not least the fact that India simply does not need much more power. “India is not a hugely starved country in terms of power supply,” said Rustagi. “The growth in demand on the whole is pretty stable at 4% to 5%, and there is already enough capacity being added to the system to cater to this incremental demand.” More than 200 million Indians still live without regular access to electricity. But Indians are among the lowest per capita users of electricity in the world, especially those being newly connected to the grid. “These are all relatively poor rural households with very little demand for power,” said Rustagi. “Even if all the 250 million-odd people without electricity got power in the next year, our analysis says power demand would grow by about an additional 1%.” He chalked up the government’s big energy promises to national polls looming next year. “The election is coming up in 2019 and they are facing various economic and industrial challenges,” he said. “I think it’s more a part of putting a very positive spin on messages.” Coal put in the shade At the beginning of the decade, India had planned to power its growth almost entirely using thermal coal, with about 600GW of coal power plant projects in the pipeline in 2010. Its plan spelled disaster for global efforts to keep warming below the two-degree target set by the Paris climate accords. But as the price of renewables has crashed, and the impact of fossil fuels on Indian air and water has become clearer, the country has sought to reinvent itself as a green energy leader. “We have missed the first and second industrial revolutions,” Singh said at an event in Delhi on Friday. “We caught up with the digital revolution, but we need to lead this revolution towards clean energy and renewable energy.” India has shelved or cancelled nearly 550 thermal coal projects in the past seven years, Buckley said. More projects are likely to be cancelled as the price of renewables continues to fall: a report released by Bloomberg New Energy Finance last week estimated the cost of solar and wind in India was now 50% cheaper than coal. Singh said on Friday coal would remain a part of India’s energy mix because it was “a backbone” to the intermittent power provided by renewables. But researchers say the proportion of energy the country derives from coal will keep falling – and that diminishing demand can easily be met by Indian mines, raising questions about the need for new projects such as the proposed Carmichael mine in the Galilee Basin of Queensland, Australia. “The incremental demand for thermal power in India is very little,” Rustagi said. “I don’t see how it makes sense to undertake a huge international project like [the Carmichael mine] … when we have enough domestic coal available.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/jul/02/the-unpunished-vice-life-reading-edmund-white-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-07-02T10:00:06Z","webTitle":"The Unpunished Vice: A Life of Reading by Edmund White – review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jul/02/the-unpunished-vice-life-reading-edmund-white-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/jul/02/the-unpunished-vice-life-reading-edmund-white-review","fields":{"headline":"The Unpunished Vice: A Life of Reading by Edmund White – review","bodyText":"I once knew – well, I was almost certain – that I was about to fall for a man just because I glimpsed a lovely old hardback of Richard Yates’s novel Revolutionary Road on his bookshelves. I know. Pathetic. But there it is. Though I don’t believe that reading inevitably makes people better – I mean kinder or more empathetic – it is a powerful thing to know that someone likes, perhaps even loves, the same books as you. You share a certain sensibility, and that is abidingly important. Also, they won’t die of boredom when you start going on about how you felt the first time you read Persuasion or the poems of Philip Larkin. Books are so intimate, somehow, and perhaps this is one reason why so many of the current glut of reading memoirs leave me cold. Even as they strain for this sense of disclosure – don’t you feel like this, too? they ask – their tone is proprietorial, hellbent on exceptionality (I love the Brontës even more than you). You would, I think, accept this from a lover, but not from a writer you’ve never met – unless, I will now add, that writer happens to be Edmund White, the tone of whose new book, The Unpunished Vice: A Life of Reading, quite often resembles the gentle whisper of a sweetheart. Ownership, you see, is not at all his style. In fact, he doesn’t claim always to understand the books that he loves most. “I’ve read it 10 times, though I’m none the wiser for it,” he writes of Anna Karenina, the novel he believes to be the greatest in all of literature. White’s book is a collection of essays, each connecting the seemingly thousands of books he has read – I find it impossible to imagine anyone better read than White, though with typical modesty he insists he knows lots of people who are – to his long writing life (the author of A Boy’s Own Story is now 78). This is done in loose fashion; like any passionate reader, he hops “from one lily pad to another”. Colette cosies up to Jean Cocteau, and Penelope Fitzgerald to Henry Green, and you must therefore concentrate quite hard, particularly in the matter of writers with whose work you are not familiar (in my case, these included two of his favourites, Jean Giono and Pierre Loti). But it’s wonderful, too: wisdom and a certain kind of tenderness are to be found on every page. White isn’t in the business of pressing books on the reader. He merely considers them, almost as if he were thinking out loud: why they work, what their particular qualities might be. Even so, you will doubtless still end up ordering, if you don’t own one already, a copy of Nothing by Henry Green, a novel he rereads every year. Green, he notes with quite brilliant concision, is a writer he initially esteemed for his apparent simplicity, but returns to over and over for his intricacy. He loves the slyness and drollery of this story of an egocentric couple, Jane Weatherby and John Pomfret, who had a youthful love affair and who are now manoeuvring to get back together and marry; he relishes the way everyone says the opposite of what they mean. He also knows just which bits to quote so as to convince that he is right. Here, for instance, is Jane lounging in her tub: “She settled back, like a giant peacock after a dust bath, sighing.” White is fabulous on Nabokov. He believes, and I agree with him, that in fiction we surely admire energy more than virtue, and Lolita is his favourite book: “Maybe because I’m a Europeanised American [White lived for a long time in Paris], I am appreciative of this supreme expression by an Americanised European.” He sticks up for Elizabeth Bowen and her sharp, epigrammatic style, believing her to have been unfairly eclipsed by Virginia Woolf and EM Forster; he admires the way that her descriptions of her characters “bristle” with movement. If you love Colette, as I have done since I was a teenager, you will treasure the seriousness with which he approaches her, his refusal to take her straightforwardness at face value. If she writes the same book again and again (it is about a bewitched man and an insecure female lover who fears her looks will fade soon), it’s nevertheless a very good one. He understands, unlike any man of my acquaintance, that love is her great subject. He doesn’t disbelieve her when she writes with, I think, perfect accuracy, that it (love) can be seen on a woman’s face. There are those who think (wrongly, stupidly) that we read only to see our reflection. But White prizes the unfamiliar, which is why, as a younger man, he was drawn to Japanese fiction (he particularly likes Junichiro Tanizaki and Yasunari Kawabata). Its stillness, its perverse eroticism, its affectionate observation of daily habits, and its acceptance of death had an effect not only on his writing, but on his sensibility, too, from the way he would set a table to his rituals for making tea. He doesn’t connect this directly to his sexuality, which made him feel so “other” as a teenager, but you have the sense that the two are certainly linked, and elsewhere, he’s always looking at gayness from without as well as within. As a gay man of a certain generation, he feels “amusingly historical” now, like Quentin Crisp or Elizabeth Arden. He had, he writes, to learn to be gay, just as he had to learn to be cultured. Reading and sex, then, cannot be separated in his mind, an alliance that goes all the way back to the books that first gave him hope there might be others like him (Thomas Mann’s Death in Venice), and to his schooldays, when he would press another boy’s groin with his knee in the library, the words rushing past his eyes all the while. Like I said, books are so intimate: our companions through the big stuff, and the small. • The Unpunished Vice: A Life of Reading by Edmund White is published by Bloomsbury (£18.99).

How, the chancellor asks himself, can he repeat the stunning, rabbit-out-of-a-hat moment when No 11’s previous incumbent, George Osborne, said in 2013 that the Canadian central banker who was heading the global post-crash clean-up operation was coming to help Britain’s laboured recovery? Carney is due to step down next June and has said the date is fixed in his diary after already extending his stay by a year to steer the Bank through Brexit and out the other side. It is a decision that has consolidated his reputation as one of the few senior policymakers taking measured decisions in the national interest rather than the narrow party interest that dominates parliament. So it’s a tall order finding a replacement. Formally, the process is not supposed to begin for a month. None the less, questions are already being asked about possible candidates. Before the financial crash, the list of contenders was usually drawn from internal candidates and technical knowledge was the most important item on their CV. In 2019 the appointment will be a politically charged affair that may call into question the independence of the central bank – not least because the winner will be seen by some as a Treasury patsy, willing to implement a policy of cheap money to offset almost perpetual austerity. Sarah Hewin, chief European economist at Standard Chartered, says the excitement of taking on a multi-layered job that marries monetary policy with a watchdog role over the entire financial services sector will prove attractive to many candidates. David Blanchflower, a member of the Bank’s rate-setting committee in the years around the financial crash, says Brexit uncertainty and political instability make it a poisoned chalice. It will take a large bag of money to get the best person, he says. “If you want to attract someone with a big reputation, how do you persuade them that they can make a difference when Brexit is still undermining investment and the government is at war with itself? If anything, the job looks like the best way to trash their reputation,” he says. “Still, if you really want an expert with bags of experience of all aspects of financial and monetary policy, Hammond could knock on Ben Bernanke’s door.” Bernanke is the former head of the US Federal Reserve who is credited with persuading George W Bush and Barack Obama to get the US economy back on its feet with trillions of dollars of government and central bank funds. These days Bernanke is a fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington and an adviser to fund manager Pimco and the $25bn Citadel hedge fund. Hewin says: “The environment will be very challenging, but any economist with a policy background would see it as a great time to be involved. So I don’t think it’s a deterrent.” The urge to find the best in the world will prey on Hammond’s mind, which is why the former head of India’s central bank, Raghuram Rajan, and the ex-boss of Mexico’s central bank, Agustín Carstens, are in the frame. Both have spent time on the committees of international agencies like the International Monetary Fund. Rajan was the IMF’s chief economist between 2003 and 2006. Carstens has just taken a job at the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) in Switzerland that puts him in a role as the central banker’s central banker. Rajan has ruled himself out several times and Carstens has only just arranged his desk furniture. But Carney refused Osborne’s overtures more than once before being tempted with a big relocation package and the prospect of running a central bank with more powers than any other in the world. Peter Dixon, chief economist at Commerzbank, reckons Hammond need look no further than one of Carney’s former deputies, Andrew Bailey, who now heads City watchdog,the Financial Conduct Authority. Bailey is a calm old-school banker who already knows the ropes inside Threadneedle Street, has emerged from several testing sessions with MPs unscathed and has the respect of market analysts, who believe he understands them. It makes him the obvious candidate, says Dixon: “Whoever takes over should be judged on the basis of their competence and not their reputation. Bailey has worked in all the main areas and is well respected.” Dixon warns against a repeat of the Football Association’s mistake when it reached out for the widely admired Fabio Capello to help win the 2010 World Cup. The former Juventus and Real Madrid manager’s reign is now considered one of the worst periods in English football history, though Roy Hodgson’s campaign in 2014 fared little better. Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, says Carney has proved to be worse for business that his reputation would suggest. He criticises the inconsistent message from a Bank of England over the last five years that has kept suggesting things will get better, and that on that basis interest rates must rise. It’s something the next governor must avoid, he says, because it makes business nervous and is a deterrent to investment. Supporters of Thiru’s view have labelled Carney an “unreliable boyfriend” – all promises and no action. Critics have also cited Carney’s willingness to join highly political projects – like the help to buy scheme, which artificially boosted the housing market – while refraining from open attacks on austerity, when he clearly believes the Treasury should be doing more to support the economy. Hammond is expected to want the same joined-at-the-hip relationship with his next governor, and for that he will look inside the current set-up. A foreigner with their own agenda might be a risk too far this time."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/jun/22/andy-murray-set-to-play-at-wimbledon-after-confirming-eastbourne-appearance","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-22T17:26:00Z","webTitle":"Andy Murray takes Eastbourne wildcard but is yet to make Wimbledon decision","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jun/22/andy-murray-set-to-play-at-wimbledon-after-confirming-eastbourne-appearance","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jun/22/andy-murray-set-to-play-at-wimbledon-after-confirming-eastbourne-appearance","fields":{"headline":"Andy Murray takes Eastbourne wildcard but is yet to make Wimbledon decision","bodyText":"Andy Murray took three days after his rousing comeback at Queen’s this week to commit to an extension of the journey at Eastbourne on Monday. Wimbledon the week after, however, remains a bridge to be crossed after further examination of his tennis, his hip and his natural caution. Given the former world No 1 is determined not to repeat the mistakes of the past year when he pulled out at the last minute in New York, Brisbane and Melbourne, he is yet to confirm whether he will play at the All England Club, where he has won two of his three majors, although the signs are promising. Murray is “looking forward to getting some more time on the grass courts”. However, after setbacks in his recovery and a couple of false starts since having surgery in Melbourne in January, he will not be rushed. After 11 months out of the game Murray, who turned 31 last month, wants to make the most of the time he has left. He last played in Eastbourne’s ATP 250 event when it was in Nottingham 12 years ago, and said: “I played Davis Cup [at Devonshire Park] in 2006 and I know the courts and facilities there are excellent. It was good to get back to competition at Queen’s this week and I’m hoping to build on that next week.” It is a decent field, with Murray, as a wildcard, likely to get any of Kyle Edmund, Denis Shapovalov, Diego Schwartzman or David Ferrer first up. Stan Wawrinka also has a wildcard. Despite his inborn pessimism, Murray has reason to be upbeat. He looked physically as strong as ever over three tough sets with Nick Kyrgios at Queen’s on Tuesday, hit the ball with his familiar crispness and good judgment, and battled through the inevitable fatigue towards the end, when he might even have won against an opponent eight years his junior. The key was always going to be how quickly and completely he recovered the day after. Radio silence fell over the Murray camp until Friday afternoon and it seems he is satisfied he can perform at a decent level over the best of three sets, while reserving judgment on whether or not he can translate that progress into a full campaign of five-setters over the Wimbledon fortnight. Kyrgios, meanwhile, is flying. The young gun-slinger who shoots with equal facility from the hip and the lip, has dealt more aces over the past week than Wyatt Earp, and he notched another 32 to put the defending champion, Feliciano López, out of the Fever-Tree Championships in an hour and 35 minutes in front of a packed Centre Court at Queen’s on a warm afternoon. The Australian’s 7-6 (5), 7-6 (3) victory set up a semi-final against the top seed and 2012 champion, Marin Cilic, who beat the fifth seed, Sam Querrey, 7-6 (3), 6-2. Kyrgios has hit 105 aces in four matches on grass in the past week, beginning the barrage with 23 over three sets against the world No 1, Roger Federer, in the Stuttgart semi-finals last Saturday – followed by free-point blizzards of 18 against Murray and 32 against Edmund. “I can’t remember a specific time where I’ve served at this level back to back,” Kyrgios said. “I didn’t expect to serve the way I did yesterday [against Edmund] but I just found my rhythm early again in this match. I felt like I had to. He was serving pretty good today. I wasn’t able to read or kind of lean towards a side when I was returning. I thought he served way better today than he did in Stuttgart when I played him last week.” The balls flew by as quickly as the points, few exchanges lasting more than a flurry of desperate shots, as the Spaniard tried to match Kyrgios for power serving, with 16 aces of his own. Kyrgios had to fight for everything and, after edging the first-set tie-break, saved three break points in the eighth game of the second set, one of them with a blinding second-serve ace. He aced again to save set point in the 12th game, and found another to force the tie-break. The prospect of a third set probably did not appeal to him – even though they had been playing for less than an hour and a half – and his trusty right arm got him home in style. “I feel good,” he said. “I’m managing my hip and doing a couple of hours of treatment on that every day. But my main focus is my elbow, which is feeling good. That’s the most important thing.” Novak Djokovic continued his ominously good run of form this week with a 7-5, 6-1 victory over the Frenchman Adrian Mannarino while Marin Cilic beat the American Sam Querrey 7-6 (3), 6-2. Dan Evans is still within a shout of making Wimbledon, having seen off Marcus Willis and Jack Findel-Hawkins in pre-qualifying. The 28-year-old will enter qualifying for the main draw at Wimbledon next week and will need a further three wins from Monday to earn his place at the All England Club. At Southlands College in Wimbledon, he first defeated Willis – one of his closest friends in tennis – 7-6 (4), 7-6 (4) in a high-quality second-round match. He then struggled to reach the same level against the world No 812 Findel-Hawkins, but passed the test of his conditioning to win 6-4, 3-6, 6-3."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/22/raised-by-wolves-brought-down-by-trunnions","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-22T15:41:57Z","webTitle":"Raised by Wolves – brought down by trunnions | Brief letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/22/raised-by-wolves-brought-down-by-trunnions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/22/raised-by-wolves-brought-down-by-trunnions","fields":{"headline":"Raised by Wolves – brought down by trunnions","bodyText":"We read that oil production is in “free fall” in “crisis-hit Venezuela” (Opec cuts – Oil cartel split amid pressure to raise supplies, 22 June).

The sorrow was too much to describe. She recalled her father’s “last kiss; his wild straining of my mother to his bosom; the solemn prayer to Heaven; the tears and sobs – the fearful anguish of broken hearts.” Americans have been shocked and saddened by the sight and sound of immigrant children being taken from their parents at the southern border. What we have witnessed is eerily similar to tactics used during other periods in US history, most notably, slavery. Enslaved children of all ages had vivid memories of family separations. Infants torn from their mother’s breast were put on the auction block. Some mothers tried to hide children under their clothing. Fathers held their children’s hands tight as tears streamed down their faces. Keckley’s memories haunted her for the rest of her life. Her mother faced insults from their enslaver, who coldly said: “Stop your nonsense … your husband is not the only slave that has been sold.” Scholars of slavery have uncovered this history, much of which is documented in a database I recently created of more than 8,000 enslaved people who were appraised and/or sold in the 18th- and 19th-century US. I found infants who were days old when they were auctioned off, without parents present. Families like that of Rueben and Sally, who were sold in Kentucky along with their six children, remind us that family separation and sale are not new concepts. Hoping to stay together, bystanders said Sally ran with their infant in her arms and their five small children just behind her and begged Reuben’s purchaser: “Buy me and my children with my husband.” That did not happen. Six children lost their parents that day just as thousands of children have lost theirs along the US-Mexico border. To be sure, the immigrants trying to cross the border are not enslaved. But they are being housed in a similar fashion and their children’s experience is quite similar to that of enslaved children who went through the horror of being torn away from their parents against their will. Some auctions contained stipulations to preserve families and advertised this in newspapers. At the Butler auction, one of the most recognized slave auctions in the US, held in Savannah, Georgia in the spring of 1859, advertisements claimed the enslaved “will be sold in families”. Until the sale, those being sold were kept at a racetrack and treated like “animals”, a term that echoes in the present. They referred to this period before the sale as “the weeping time”. Despite claims of unity, more than 400 people were sold at that auction and families were separated with no care for their humanity. Enslaved children at the auction and many others like it said they were “cried off” from their parents. These scenes had a lasting impact on their lives. Reflecting on his family separation experience around age five, Josiah Henson was traumatized as an adult. “I seem to see and hear my poor weeping mother now,” he said. Today, we hear the cries of a six-year-old girl who was taken to a “detention center”, pleading to see her aunt. In the background, children call out for their parents. They are moaning, crying, begging Border Patrol agents to find their families. One voice stood out: a child calling “Papa, Papa …” This child is a modern-day version of Keckley and Henson, except today, the parents have not been sold. They have been detained, charged and processed as criminals. The fate of their children remains uncertain.

Voting for favourite clue this month was close: of 17 nominated at least once the narrow winner was ‘One fixes eye on ball, one hit high, cover finally caught’ for SKRYER, from ‘Once at sea, I was off course by miles’ (ASWIM) in second place. The puzzle as a whole seems to have been of average difficulty, with no clues causing special problems. The clue word itself turned out to be a bit uninspiring, perhaps because of its rather limited meaning. This may have prompted a number of competitors to resort to cluing it in its French sense of ‘a female charmer’. I wasn’t keen on this approach, I’m afraid. It raises the spectre of all manner of foreign words spelt like English ones being clued in their place. I’ve learnt over the years that familiarity with international (or at least European) vocabulary is by no means as widespread as I’d assumed. More’s the pity, maybe, and another reason to dread Brexit, but there we are. The most popular approach by far was the use of anagrams involving ‘ruche’ and ‘seam’, often yielding perfectly respectable clues which nevertheless lacked that bit of extra inventiveness I’m always looking for. I sometimes feel like a schoolteacher marking exam papers and on the look-out for that extra element of individuality and flair which is usually easy to spot. This knack is difficult to analyse; I can only urge competitors anxious to improve their clue-writing skills to study quoted entries each month, and to bring rigorous self-criticism to bear on their own efforts."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"sport/2018/jun/22/danny-cipriani-fountain-of-energy-dream-england-south-africa","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-22T14:23:57Z","webTitle":"Steve Black: ‘Cipriani is a fountain of energy … the dream never left him’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jun/22/danny-cipriani-fountain-of-energy-dream-england-south-africa","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jun/22/danny-cipriani-fountain-of-energy-dream-england-south-africa","fields":{"headline":"Steve Black: ‘Cipriani is a fountain of energy … the dream never left him’","bodyText":"Steve Black’s pride is palpable. Danny Cipriani has just been handed his first England start for a decade against South Africa and the man he calls his “Super Dad” is beaming. “Danny has just stuck in there,” Black says. “He hasn’t become a broken man, he’s kept playing at the best of his ability and eventually he’s become irresistible.” Black, who worked with Jonny Wilkinson for nearly 20 years, has been fulfilling the same mentoring role with Cipriani since 2013. A former nightclub bouncer, now a professor of practice at Newcastle University Business School, he speaks to the returning England fly-half on an almost daily basis. He provides Cipriani with “a better view of life”, bringing clarity to a once cluttered mind, focus where previously there were too many distractions, contentment when before there was restlessness. “All I ever say to him is that all he can control is his personal standards,” Black says. “Behaviour can be infectious and contagious so I want his to be superb. He’s a fountain of energy and it’s important people see that about him.” Cipriani makes his fifth England start on Saturday – when he produced one of the most complete fly-half performances in living memory on his debut against Ireland in 2008, aged 20, he was destined for a truckload more. At first injury struck and more front-page headlines than back gave rise to a reputation that has been hard to shake. “We’ve worked very hard at that, day by day, week by week, to say, we really know who you are, your character is there, we know what it is,” Black says. “Sometimes these things don’t come to the forefront of people’s minds enough but he won community player of the year at Wasps, he visits hospitals and schools – he’s got a good heart. Sometimes in life we’re very good at helping other people and not great at letting other people help us. Danny has discovered that. He’s a great natural helper of other people but now he’s quite happy for other people to help him.” As proud as Black is that Cipriani has won his place back in the England side, he is equally pleased at how Eddie Jones’s perception has changed. It got to the stage where Martin Johnson seemed more likely to pick himself at fly-half than Cipriani while Stuart Lancaster was largely reluctant and overlooked him for the 2015 World Cup squad despite a fine cameo against France shortly beforehand. At first Jones was equally distrusting. “I’m sure Eddie can appreciate the effect Danny has on the mentality and the creativity of the squad,” Black says. “Contrary to some people’s belief, he’s a superb team man because he realises that as the star quarterback, if he’s not a great team man it will not work. You have to be quite unselfish in that position to bring out the best in others around you.” Black extols the virtues of kaizen, a Japanese philosophy of continuous improvement and as such, he does not see wasted talent or underachievement in Cipriani, rather someone who is still to reach their peak. “He’s a better player than he’s ever been but there’s no reason he can’t be getting better and better. Remember what I used to say about Jonny, right at the start, I used to say he’ll reach his best when he was 34 to 35 and judging by how he played at Toulon I would suggest he did. Danny certainly hasn’t got to his best yet. I would expect him reaching his best, and we’ve spoken about this a lot, in maybe three or four years’ time.” Saturday represents the chance to stake a claim for a place in next year’s World Cup squad – the driving force behind Cipriani’s decision to snub lucrative offers to play abroad during his long spell in the international wilderness. “He’s patriotic, he’s very proud to represent his country,” Black says. “Even though he wasn’t given a chance in the 2015 World Cup, the dream never left him.” While effusive in his praise for Black after his recall had been confirmed, Cipriani also stated he plans to be the “calmest man in the room” at Newlands. Where once he may have tried too hard to make things happen, Black expects to see a fly-half at ease with the task in hand. “He’ll not force it too much and if he does it’ll be a calculated risk once in a while. Great players make decisions and execute them well and if he were to ever step out of structured plans now, it would be to win or save the game. He sees things lots of other people don’t see but he can now mould that to what other people can see which is very special.” It is hard to escape the sense that Cipriani is the people’s choice as England fly-half. His unmistakable talent and the Prodigal Son narrative make for an irresistible combination – no bad thing according to Black. “He’s the type of lad who doesn’t mind being loved, it helps him enormously. Some people say they don’t need encouragement but I think we all need it really.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"society/2018/jun/22/nhs-investigative-body-to-examine-suspicious-deaths","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-22T17:50:34Z","webTitle":"New NHS body could stop families learning truth on patient deaths","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/22/nhs-investigative-body-to-examine-suspicious-deaths","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/jun/22/nhs-investigative-body-to-examine-suspicious-deaths","fields":{"headline":"New NHS body could stop families learning truth on patient deaths","bodyText":"A new body being set up to investigate suspicious deaths in the NHS will be so secretive it will block families from finding out the truth of what happened to their relatives, campaigners have said. The government says the Health Service Safety Investigations Body is designed to provide a “safe space” for doctors, nurses and other NHS staff to be open about what went wrong when a patient died or was harmed unnecessarily. The proposal for setting up the body is currently with a joint committee in the Houses of Parliament. Earlier this week the report into Gosport hospital, which found more than 450 older people had died after being given life-shortening opioids, found that many who worked in the hospital had tried to raise the alarm but their complaints had not gone any further. Campaigners have expressed concern that the investigative body will be prohibited from disclosing any information, even when it is neither personal nor damaging. It will be banned from revealing a hospital’s staffing or financial data that might have contributed to an untimely death. Maurice Frankel, the director of the Campaign for Freedom of Information, said all that relatives, patients, campaigners and even MPs would see was the final report. “It will introduce a new layer of secrecy into the NHS over and above anything that exists at the moment, which the investigators themselves will have no power to overcome,” he said. “If it is not published in the report, they will have no power to disclose it. We are going to see the shutters come down around the whole system of accident investigation in a way that is very unhealthy and it is going to damage people’s confidence in the system.” The Department of Health is modelling the body on the Department for Transport’s Air Accident Investigations Branch. Frankel pointed out that the last passenger death on a commercial airline in the UK was in 1999. There are an estimated 12,000 avoidable deaths and 24,000 serious incidents in the NHS each year. “The whole country is going to be affected by this. It will lead to suspicions of cover-ups and that suspicion will probably be justified,” he said. Families of older people who died in Gosport War Memorial hospital in the 1990s battled for 20 years to persuade officials to believe them and find out what happened. The report, from an expert panel that examined all the documentation it could access, concluded that 456 people died after being given life-shortening doses of opioid drugs on the wards over a period of 12 years. Jeremy Hunt said the scandal exposed the “blame culture” in the NHS. “The basic problem is that if you are a doctor or a nurse and you see something going wrong … the thing that families want, if they are bereaved or have a tragedy, is to know that the NHS isn’t going to make that mistake again,” the health secretary said on BBC radio. “We make it much too hard for doctors and nurses to do that. They are worried that there will be litigation, they will go up in front of the GMC [General Medical Council], or the NMC [Nursing and Midwifery Council].” Hunt added: “In some places they are worried they might get fired. So we do have to tackle that blame culture and turn that into a learning culture.” Frankel, however, said the secrecy of the investigatory body would not change the reluctance of doctors and nurses to admit fault, because the draft bill allows it to pass information to the police, the GMC or the NMC, which can end doctors’ and nurses’ careers. Writing in the Guardian, Peter Walsh, the chief executive of Action Against Medical Accidents, which supported the Gosport families in trying to get inquests held, criticised the new body. “It is hugely controversial, as it would introduce something it calls a ‘safe space’ in patient safety investigations. This is defined in the bill as a prohibition on sharing any information obtained in an investigation,” writes Walsh. That prohibition, he says, means even a patient who was the victim of an incident, would not be able to see the information. “Nor could they use any facts in the final published report to seek justice through the civil courts or tribunals. There doesn’t seem much candour in that. “This measure, if it is allowed to go ahead, would destroy any trust that patients or families could have in NHS investigations, and lead to a more adversarial culture where people turn to legal action and seek disciplinary action straight away.” A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “We are committed to improving patient safety in the NHS and supporting staff to speak up is a vital part of that. It’s clear from incident investigations in aviation and rail sectors that staff are more encouraged to speak up about concerns in a safe space.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/2018/jun/22/corrections-and-clarifications","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-22T20:00:37Z","webTitle":"Corrections and clarifications","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/jun/22/corrections-and-clarifications","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2018/jun/22/corrections-and-clarifications","fields":{"headline":"Corrections and clarifications","bodyText":"• The production of Travesties at Pitlochry Festival Theatre is not by the student theatre company Pigfoot, contrary to what it says in our listings in this week’s Guide.

It’s tempting to fill this entire article with Mayhew-Archer’s gags about his Parkinson’s. The fact that it takes him so long to fumble for his wallet that he never has to pay for a drink in a pub. Or the irritation that all his limbs get stiffer except for the one he’d occasionally like to get stiff. Immediately after his diagnosis, he decided he could either laugh or cry about Parkinson’s. He chose to laugh, and is now taking the one-man show he’s developed around the disease to the Edinburgh festival. Mayhew-Archer, who is 65 and has had a 40-year career writing hits such as The Vicar of Dibley and Mrs Brown’s Boys, was 58 when he was diagnosed. His friends had noticed he was walking more slowly and that his handwriting was getting more spidery – telltale symptoms of the disease – and a neurologist confirmed it. “I was relieved to find it was Parkinson’s and not a brain tumour,” he tells me, “and from the first moment I decided to see the funny side of it. I was writing jokes from the word go, and thinking that’s how I’m going to regard it. I didn’t realise I’d do it to quite this extent; that happened gradually. I thought it was important that somebody says something about Parkinson’s who has Parkinson’s. I wanted to show that people with Parkinson’s can do comedy.” In 2016 he took part in a Parkinson’s fundraiser at the Albert Hall – his first time performing on stage for almost 40 years. He enjoyed his couple of minutes of standup so much, he developed a longer routine for London’s Comedy Store, and now his stage show, which he’s been trying out in his home town of Abingdon. He doesn’t just talk about Parkinson’s, but about his life more generally and why comedy is important to him. He was an only child, brought up in the retirement mecca of Bexhill. His mother suffered from cancer all through his childhood and died when he was 20, but he says he and his family failed to confront or discuss it, so he turned his suppressed anger into comedy and into writing more generally – he wrote his first play when he was 18. Long after his mother’s death and during a difficult period professionally, he had counselling and discovered why comedy had appealed to him. “I realised the reason I’d been writing was to make myself laugh. That’s what has inspired me to write what I write now. I was in denial about my mother’s illness, and I’m determined not to be in denial about this. It’s about me learning about myself. I talk about quite personal things, and I find that audiences – particularly Parkinson’s audiences – respond. They find it very comforting and reassuring. I talk about bladder problems and all sorts, because it’s part of it and if we don’t talk about these things we don’t realise we all share the same problems. The blacker the joke, the greater the laugh.” Parkinson’s has taken over his professional life – in a good way. In 2016 he made a BBC documentary called Parkinson’s: The Funny Side, which cleverly knits together his comedy, a serious look at state-of-the-art treatments, and scenes from a ballet class in Oxford for Parkinson’s sufferers that has become central to his positive response to having the disease. It began as a 10-minute segment about the ballet class, but grew into a half-hour film that went on to win awards. He is now working on a romcom set in the ballet class. “I’ve been doing it for two and a half years,” he says, “but I’ve never been able to work out the third act. I quite like it being on hold. It’s like those things where you can imagine how wonderful something can be until you actually make it and it wasn’t quite as wonderful as you always hoped. It keeps me going. I’m turning what a lot of people would think was a complete disaster into a little anecdote that’s quite fun. You’d think wallowing in it would make me depressed, yet it’s the opposite. It makes me feel better because it’s giving me power over it. Or I think it’s giving me power. Obviously it’s going to win in the end, but I can try to delay it.” One day the romcom will be finished and the third act of Parkinson’s will have to be faced. Does he worry about what lies ahead? “I try not to think about it,” he says. “There’s no point. There are moments. I was saying to somebody the other day: ‘I’ve noticed recently that I have more difficulty getting out of the bath.’ On the other hand, I quite like being in the bath.” Parkinson’s has given him a greater sense of purpose than he’s ever felt before. “I remember thinking: this is my subject,” he says. Targets such as the month of shows at Edinburgh provide staging posts on what is proving an endlessly surprising and fulfilling journey. “I’ve no idea what the next target will be.” Comedic pause. “Just getting up.” And he laughs loudly, as he does often.

I always look forward to seeing education ministers trying to justify policies on that show. I saw you on there a short while ago and found myself wondering if you had watched your predecessors facing the questions before you. I have a feeling that the programme has proved something of a graveyard for you folks. Michael Gove waved his hands at Emily Thornberry while saying at her, “Yadda, yadda, yadda”, and he was removed from office for being “toxic”. Nicky Morgan, usually a confident and fluent person, seemed to freeze and was dropped not long after. And then Justine Greening seemed unwilling or unable to justify what she had been asked to say, and sure enough, she was soon gone too. Is it that you think the live audience is a sort of proxy parents’ evening, and trying to persuade us is much harder than chatting on the sofa with Andrew Marr? It was plain to see you struggling as you tried first to back the line on increased spending on education, and then you struggled even more when you had to explain why you were handing a £50m gift to grammar schools. The reasons for your difficulty are not hard to find. I hear directly from headteachers at conferences that they have less money to spend, that they are cutting teachers, teaching assistants, trips, extra-curricular classes, and even GCSE, A-level and BTech courses. But then – cognitive dissonance moment coming up – we listen to you and other ministers saying you’re spending more than ever. Can you clear this up: are you telling us that headteachers are lying, or do you think they have become overnight budget-busting spendthrifts, or do you think they can’t do sums? You see, as a parent, I’m trying to figure out how you can come on TV and tell people (headteachers) who say they have less, that really they have more. I’m not great at sums, but might it be to do with the kind of question I had to master for my 11-plus exam. My answers are in brackets. “It’s Christmas! You have £50 in your piggy bank to buy five presents, how much can you spend on each present? (£10). You discover you have a further £10 under your pillow, how much can you spend now? (£12) But then you remember that you have 10 friends, not 5. How much can you spend per person now? (£6).” That was the way we discovered that spending could go up but the amount per present could go down. I guess you think we are too stupid to figure this out. Then there’s your £50m gift to grammar schools. Your problem here is that there is no evidence from anywhere that grammar schools are the solution for educating everyone to the best of their abilities. And you do want to educate everyone, don’t you? Don’t you? One of the reasons for the downfall of the national grammar school system was that spending per pupil in grammar schools was much higher than on other schools (mostly secondary moderns). Many people thought that was unfair. And now, even as your government is spending less per pupil in real terms, you’re pumping extra money into grammar schools. If I can be topical for a moment: in the words of a famous football commentary: it’s deja vu all over again.

Steel drums rang out the hymn Amazing Grace as guests entered, and a joyous rendition of Jesus, hold my hand by the Windrush 70th Anniversary Choir, had the congregation clapping along. Many Windrush settlers applied to job adverts with the hope of finding long-term employment in the UK, having gained a type of citizenship under the British Nationality Act of 1948, but faced racism, discrimination and distrust. The congregation heard original testimonies. Some made them laugh (“Why is it so cold? Why is everything in tins?”), others were met in solemn silence as they heard of people being told “Blackies should be seen and not heard” and of the hurt caused by signs saying: “No dogs, no Irish, no blacks.” Under her breath, a guest said: “I remember that. It was awful.” But, with both the prime minister, Theresa May, and the home secretary, Sajid Javid, in attendance, there was a palpable recognition among those who gathered that the Windrush generation had suffered further recently. The government announced earlier this month that it would celebrate Windrush Day every 22 June. This announcement came weeks after the Guardian reported that members of the Windrush generation and their children had been wrongly detained and deported and others denied access to healthcare, work, housing benefits and pensions. On Tuesday, Amelia Gentleman won the prestigious Paul Foot award for the Guardian’s investigative and campaigning journalism for her reporting on the Windrush scandal. “It is alright for those of us that are here today, but there are people who went home to a funeral and were not let back into the UK,” said Gloria Whyte, 73, who came unaccompanied from Trinidad when she was 16. “It is an honour to be here, but they should be here with us. There is a sadness, too.” Addressing the congregation, the Rev Canon Joel Edwards referenced the scandal. “In recent months, the word Windrush has evoked a great deal of emotion and even anger across our political landscape,” he said. “In this service of thanksgiving, Windrush means more than migration.” He described how Windrush had “gifted” Britain with leaders in politics, trade unions, business, sport and culture – joking that Caribbean influence could also be seen in the national cuisine, including “rice and peas, jerk chicken and Levi Roots sauce in our supermarkets”. “Settling down hasn’t been plain sailing,” he said. “The children of Windrush have experienced over-representation in Britain’s prisons and mental health institutions. Knife crimes. Underachievement in education and the job market. “Settlement has meant racism, sometimes too much policing and not enough protection. And Stephen Lawrence.” But he added: “Windrush resilience arises, supremely.” The Rev Dr John Hall, the dean of Westminster, conducted the service in a robe decorated with images of aspects of black history in Britain since the arrival of Windrush. “We come to give thanks for the lives, commitment, and courage of those original settlers, to celebrate the rich diversity of multicultural Britain in our own day,” he said. Among the guests were Doreen Lawrence, mother of the murdered black teenager Stephen, and Floella Benjamin, the TV personality who became a peer, who was applauded as she jigged briefly in the nave. The Londonmayor, Sadiq Khan, attended the service, along with the shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott. Speaking after the ceremony, Dionne Gravesande, whose grandmother and parents came to Britain after the war from Guyana, said it was a day of mixed emotions. “We haven’t overcome racism. Too often our identity is still framed by the colour of our skin, by our differences rather than that which holds us together,” she said. “But I think today is a collective recognition that although we have a broken history, or future doesn’t have to be so broken.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/22/argentina-football-association-world-cup-defeat","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-22T14:06:11Z","webTitle":"As fighters, as entertainers, as a team, this Argentina project has failed | Marcela Mora y Araujo","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/22/argentina-football-association-world-cup-defeat","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/22/argentina-football-association-world-cup-defeat","fields":{"headline":"As fighters, as entertainers, as a team, this Argentina project has failed","bodyText":"On 21 June 1978 Argentina’s World Cup defeat of Peru went down in history as one of the most controversial games ever. The goalfest and intelligent football that unfolded on that cold night in Rosario, as the wonderful Mario Kempes found his feet on his home turf of yesteryear, were eclipsed by allegations which kept conspiracy theorists and investigative journalists busy for years. Argentina, aware they needed to win by at least four goals to progress in their home tournament, triumphed 6-0 amid rumours that an exchange of grain between the countries had been brokered in the dressing room. They went on to lift the trophy. On 22 June 1986 a single Argentina player managed to surpass all that by scoring two goals, one with his hand and the other a stunning solo run that still ranks as one the best in history. Those few minutes on the pitch shifted the focus for ever and opened the gateways for further volumes; poets, intellectuals, investigative journalists and conspiracy theorists would be occupied for 20 years more producing great works that only a muse of Maradonian proportions could inspire. Argentina went on to lift the World Cup again. Fast-forward to 21 June 2018. Argentina, having entered the World Cup with a small player widely regarded as the Goat – an unfortunate acronym for Greatest Of All Time – with the ghosts of these two tournaments weighing heavily on his shoulders, have all but disappeared. Ninety agonising minutes of a shambolic performance, featuring a completely absent and disconnected Lionel Messi and a terrible goalkeeping faux pas that sunk spirits on the pitch, opened the way for a worthy Croatia’s 3-0 win. The blame game and finger‑pointing started swiftly. Within an hour an audio file of Diego “Cholo” Simeone – purportedly having a private conversation with his Atlético Madrid assistant Germán “Mono” Burgos – was viral online. “But if you had to pick one for your team, who would you choose: Messi or Ronaldo?” his distinctive voice says.Jorge Sampaoli, who a year into the job has not fielded the same team twice, who has always proclaimed a love for a back three yet never until this fateful night deployed one, who has been repeating ad infinitum that what he was working towards was “connectivity” that would bring out the best Messi, had left the pitch insulted and insulting. “Smoke seller,” angry Argentina fans said.He assumed responsibility for the fiasco and said “the project failed” before, as if immediately aware that these words were digging a deeper grave, corrected himself: “The project of this game failed.” Minutes later a journalist confronted Sergio Agüero with a slight edit: “Sampaoli says the players didn’t adapt to the project.” Agüero looked startled. “He can say whatever he likes,” he uttered with a killer look in his eyes and walked off. By morning rumours of resignations and mutiny had been raised and denied several times. There is no sign the that Argentinian Football Association can steer the path to a brighter future. For the past four years it has talked of rebuilding, restructuring and reforming but all it has managed to do is repeat, relive and reinforce the worst traits and attitudes. Perhaps most damagingly, it opened bids for a youth training project and chose one that was not even part of the bidding contest. Until 15 years ago the country had boasted, for the better part of a century, some of the best and most progressive child and adolescent development traditions in world football. That has been obliterated. The squad that had to perform to the tune of that shambolic backdrop consisted mostly of the last standing warriors of a bygone generation, and a few novices whose first taste of representing the country was being thrown to the wolves without any sensible preparation. And Messi, whose block was total. It was clear as the national anthem played that something else was on Messi’s mind. He looked down and scratched his forehead, as if trying to remove something from his head. After that he was largely absent. The superlative Croatia midfielder Luka Modric was generous in the mixed zone: “Messi is an incredible player but in football you need help from the team. We were able to close down spaces and stop Mascherano and other players from passing to him. He is a great, great player but he can’t do everything alone.” Sampaoli also tried in vain to detract fault from Messi. “Yes, yes! Yes, I want Messi to do it!” one deranged pundit on Argentinian TV screamed at the camera, banging on the table. “You, Messi: I want you to do it! I’m asking you!” he continued. If football is escapism and the fans were hoping to forget the torrid times of rising unemployment and galloping devaluation for a few minutes, the project has most certainly failed. If football is a game of beauty and entertainment to be enjoyed by players and observers alike, the project has most certainly failed. It was painful to watch, not only for Argentinians, and those young men who took to the pitch were definitely not enjoying it. In fact, their suffering was palpable. If football is a war game, a strategic proposal to defeat an adversary through carefully rehearsed combat manoeuvres, a tactically weak and psychologically frail Argentina did not achieve this: the project has failed. It is as if the doors of perception have been opened and everything is finally presented before us as it is. A circus with bitter clowns, no safety net under the trapeze, a malnourished caged tiger and a knife-thrower who aims at the heart of his sidekick. The lady in the box is sawn in half and the chained man in the glass box of water is not even trying to break free."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/22/england-steve-holland-apologises-panama-world-cup-gareth-southgate","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-22T14:06:26Z","webTitle":"Gareth Southgate to confirm Panama line-up to England players on Saturday","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/22/england-steve-holland-apologises-panama-world-cup-gareth-southgate","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/22/england-steve-holland-apologises-panama-world-cup-gareth-southgate","fields":{"headline":"Gareth Southgate to confirm Panama line-up to England players on Saturday","bodyText":"The England assistant manager Steve Holland has apologised to the squad for inadvertently appearing to reveal Gareth Southgate’s proposed lineup for Sunday’s World Cup Group G fixture against Panama. Holland had been photographed walking on to the training pitch for Thursday’s session at Spartak Zelenogorsk’s stadium clutching a sheet of paper upon which seemed to be written the starting XI for the game in Nizhny Novgorod. On it, Southgate’s first-choice selection, which included Marcus Rashford and Ruben Loftus-Cheek, appeared to be detailed in formation with each player’s understudy listed underneath. Although the Football Association was apparently relaxed about the situation, Kyle Walker said that Holland had felt moved to address the squad before their session back in Zelenogorsk on Friday morning. “It was just before training, just before we went out and did our warm-up,” he said. “He gave his apologies and said it was the first time he had messed up in 20 years, which we had a bit of a laugh about because his refereeing skills are not great. It was a bit of banter we move on and are looking forward to the game now.” Rashford and Loftus-Cheek are, indeed, expected to start against Panama despite Southgate suggesting the football his side had played in Volgograd was “as good as anything in the tournament so far”. The manager will confirm his lineup at Saturday’s training session. “From the type of training we do they will have a good idea and, clearly, we had a team that played very well and won,” he said. “We’re not going to differ wildly to that. We’re waiting to see if Dele Alli will be fit [after a thigh strain], which is looking unlikely because he’s not trained with the team yet. But he’s progressing really well so we won’t rule that out just yet. “We obviously have competition for places, strength in depth, players that came off the bench and had an impact on the game the other day. I have to balance all those things out when I make a decision on the team. But to play with the freedom, the energy and the pace that we did [against Tunisia] was as good as anything I have seen in the tournament up to this point. The team performed as well as I can remember us playing with the ball in the first hour of the game. I don’t see us making too many changes to what we did.” Asked about the images of Holland’s team-sheet, Southgate said: “It doesn’t bother me in the slightest. There’s a squad of 23 names on the sheet, the next sheet has different players in different positions because we swap people in and swap people out. The stories are then run as they are. For me, no drama, but obviously any time we were to give the opposition the opportunity of having our team is a disadvantage to us and so, of course, our media has to decide whether they want to help the team or not. But, given that was just a squad list, it doesn’t make any difference really.” The manager is understood to have explained to Sterling why he will begin on the bench against Panama, though the forward may be back against Belgium on Thursday. Rashford will play alongside Harry Kane as Southgate seeks a more ruthless approach. “Marcus is enjoying his football and looks free in his mind,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jun/22/melania-trump-clothing-troll-donald","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-22T17:27:14Z","webTitle":"Is Melania Trump using fashion to troll her husband?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/22/melania-trump-clothing-troll-donald","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jun/22/melania-trump-clothing-troll-donald","fields":{"headline":"Is Melania Trump using fashion to troll her husband?","bodyText":"The internet is arm-deep in jacket-gate. Ever since Melania Trump wore the world’s most inappropriate jacket on her trip to a child detention center on Thursday, theories have been swirling as to the first lady’s motives. Donald Trump, naturally, tweeted his own explanation. Per Trump, Melania’s jacket “refers to the Fake News Media. Melania has learned how dishonest they are, and she truly no longer cares!”. While that may be what the president is telling himself, the internet has a number of other ideas, one of which is that Trump has learned how dishonest her husband is, and she truly no longer cares about what he thinks. Actor Kevin McHale, best known for his role in Glee, for example, was one of many people who voiced the theory Trump is trolling her husband. The idea that Trump’s jacket was aimed at the president is bolstered by the fact that while the first lady never says very much in public, she is very deliberate about her clothing and knows how to make a sartorial statement. Rather than wearing whatever her minions pick for her, Melania has said that she always wears “what I like and what is appropriate for the occasion”. There have also been a number of previous occasions in which the former model appears to have used her clothing to dress down her husband. The great pussy bow incident of 2016 In October 2016, Trump wore a Gucci pussy bow shirt to the second presidential debate. This was just two days after the 2005 Access Hollywood tapes in which Donald Trump talks about “grabbing women by the pussy” surfaced. Pussy bow blouses, a style of shirt with a floppy bow around the neck, were en vogue at the time so her choice of apparel wasn’t entirely inexplicable. Nevertheless, the internet immediately lost its shirt and began speculating as to whether Trump was making a subtle jab at her husband. Was this her way of being a nasty woman? The Hillary-esque white pantsuit It can be hard to keep track of all the presidential porn star scandals, I know, but please cast your mind back to early January when news broke that Trump had arranged a $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels, so she would keep quiet about an alleged sexual affair in 2006. Relations between the first lady and the president appeared to cool after that: she cancelled plans to travel with him to the World Economic Forum in Davos and there were rumours she was sleeping at a hotel. The first time Trump appeared in public with her husband after the Stormy scandal broke was the State of the Union address, and her choice of outfit caused quite a stir. The first lady’s decision to wear a cream Christian Dior pantsuit drew immediate comparisons with famous pantsuit aficionado Hillary Clinton, who had worn a similar style for the inauguration. The Democratic House minority leader, Nancy Pelosi, and other Democratic women also wore white pantsuits for Trump’s inauguration, as a statement of protest and a reference to the women’s suffrage movement, which is associated with the colour white. In light of this, many seemed to believe that Trump’s white wardrobe choice was designed to make her husband see red. Ultimately, however, no one knows for sure what Trump is thinking. Perhaps not even the first lady herself."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/jun/23/vandalism-or-art-graffiti-artists-deaths-reignite-debate-london","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-23T05:00:01Z","webTitle":"Vandalism or art?

Graffiti artists' deaths reignite debate","bodyText":"On the side of a railway bridge over Barrington Road in Brixton, south London, are the last three tags painted by Harrison Scott-Hood, 23, Alberto Fresneda Carrasco, 19, and Jack Gilbert, 23 – “Lover”, “Trip” and “‘Kbag”. They are likely to stay there for some time, as a poignant memorial to the three young men whose bodies were found 350 yards down the track on Monday morning. All three had been hit by a train. All week, graffiti artists – or “writers”, in the language of the subculture – from around the world having been paying tribute to the three men. An Instagram page has been collating pictures of their graffiti, as well as artistic tributes. At Loughborough Junction station – the stop closest to where the three died – graffiti writers were among the mourners who have contributed to a shrine, with spray cans nestled among bouquets, and messages sprayed on the wall. But there has also been criticism. A former Transport for London board member, Brian Cooke, who was recently suspended from the Conservative party, tweeted they were “common scum and criminals”. It was met with a furious response. But judging by the comment sections of popular news websites, he was by no means alone in his opinion. The tragedy has prompted a fresh debate over the artistic merit of writing on walls. Those who travel on trains in a city will be familiar with the graffiti that lines the tracks, executed with varying degrees of skill and creativity. Figures from British Transport Police show “graffiti-related crime” is on the rise across Britain, with 2,498 reported incidents in 2017, up from 1,413 in 2013. That rise is reflected in London, where there were 662 reported incidents in 2017, up 86% on 2013. The first quarter of 2018 had the highest number of reported graffiti crimes in London since 2013. But the statistics are limited. Graffiti is so ubiquitous on urban train lines that most goes unreported; it would be an impossible task for BTP officers to conduct audits to estimate its true scale. Network Rail said it spent about £3.5m a year removing graffiti, a figure that has not changed significantly in recent years but it did register a 28% rise in “trespass-related incidents” between 2014-15 and 2016-17. Deaths while walking the tracks are relatively rare, according to Joe Epstein, who runs the website LDNGraffiti. That is despite writers gaining and giving respect not simply for the technical skill and creativity of their pieces, but also the inaccessibility of the spot and the risks taken to reach it. “In graffiti, the harder the place is to reach the more recognition it will get,” he said. “There’s terms like ‘king spots’; there’s a term – it’s not very appropriate – but it’s called a ‘heaven spot’, which is essentially a location that’s so hard to get to and so risky you could potentially lose your life. When writers hit these spots, they are widely recognised.” The stretch of line where Lover, Trip and Kbag were struck is famous among graffiti writers in London, one told the Guardian, with some of the city’s oldest illegal works, dating back two decades or more. Elevated to a height of 65ft, the route leads into central London, increasing its visibility, via Brixton, a hub of London street culture. The three had travelled from north London to paint there. “With subcultural graffiti, a lot of people are like: ‘Ah, they’re marking their territory,’” said Theo Kindynis, a criminologist at Goldsmiths, University of London, whose work has focused on the scene. “But it’s never been about that. The highest accolade for a graffiti writer is going ‘all-city’, which is having tags on every line, in every postcode ... So wherever guys are from, they are going to want to come and paint in places where they otherwise wouldn’t usually go so that other writers from those areas see them up and it increases their subcultural cachet.” As the Mail Online pointed out this week, with its story on Lover’s £7,000-a-term public school education, those involved in graffiti range far from the common conception of teenagers from rough council estates. “They’re young men, but other than that it’s not a very homogeneous scene demographically,” said Kindynis. “You do get people from very fortunate backgrounds; people dating supermodels and this sort of thing; you get actors who are involved. But you have also got people that are in and out of jail, have had very difficult upbringings. It’s not like the really, really desperate hard-up kids that are doing this stuff because ultimately you’re not profiting from doing this ... It’s not the sort of really fringe parts of society that it’s made out to be, these people often have day jobs and whatever else.” Authorities are quick to brand graffiti as simple vandalism. But that tension is apparent within the “graff” scene itself, where artists prefer to be known as “writers” and talk about wanting to “claim space” and “do damage”, according to Simon Armstrong, who is currently researching a book on London graffiti. “They don’t really care what you or I might think, that’s less of a priority,” says Armstrong, the book buyer for the Tate galleries’ shops, who has observed the graffiti scene for more than two decades. Nonetheless, he says, for many young people it can be a route into successful careers. “There’s so many examples of graffiti artists who started out doing trains and now they are doing unbelievably amazing art,” he said. “Many of them are self-taught; not many of them went to art school, or they go later and do design courses.” The discrepancy between graffiti as both vandalism and art reached a zenith in 2010, when the then prime minister, David Cameron, visited Washington DC and presented Barack Obama with a canvas by Ben Eine. “That’s mad, because Eine was one of the hardest London writers,” Armstrong said. “His tag was everywhere and to be embraced in such a way is really quite peculiar.” And yet there are still those who insist graffiti has no artistic merit and the authorities take the investigation of graffiti on the railways seriously. According to a spokesman, the BTP regularly runs high-visibility patrols in hot spots to deter writers. This week, six officers were stationed at one point to police the tributes to Lover, Trip and Kbag. It is understood the force has recently reformed its vandalism squad. “In addition to these measures, we regularly meet with the rail industry to discuss preventative steps that can be taken to deter offending,” a spokesman said. “This includes the use of both overt and covert CCTV cameras, highly visible patrols of police and security staff, educating young people about the dangers of trespassing on to the rail network and introducing anti-graffiti technologies.” On Friday, an inquest at Southwark coroner’s court heard that Lover, Trip and Kbag were identified by their fingerprints. They suffered multiple injuries after being hit by a train just after 1am, and their bodies lay on the tracks for nearly seven hours before they were noticed. A Network Rail spokesperson said: “The railway is an extremely dangerous environment if not being used correctly. It’s full of obvious and hidden dangers, all of which can be lethal. Please, never walk down on to the tracks of the railway for any reason.” Friends of the families of the three men who died have set up a GoFundMe campaign to help with the cost of their funerals."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"film/2018/jun/24/he-good-liar-nicholas-searle--helen-mirren-ian-mckellen","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-24T04:59:18Z","webTitle":"Civil servant starts a new chapter at 60 as The Good Liar hits the big screen","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jun/24/he-good-liar-nicholas-searle--helen-mirren-ian-mckellen","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/jun/24/he-good-liar-nicholas-searle--helen-mirren-ian-mckellen","fields":{"headline":"Civil servant starts a new chapter at 60 as The Good Liar hits the big screen","bodyText":"When Nicholas Searle retired from the civil service, he pursued his dream of becoming a writer by taking an online course. He was taken aback when publishers snapped up his first novel and turned it into a bestseller in 2016. Now he has had the “surreal” experience of watching Sir Ian McKellen and Dame Helen Mirren bring his characters to life in a major Warner Bros film adaptation of that debut book. The Good Liar, a thriller full of twists and turns, tells the story of ageing conman Roy, who preys on a wealthy widow, Betty, after meeting her online. Searle, who describes himself as “60, but a baby in the writing business”, told the Observer that watching such a dream cast flesh out his characters has been extraordinary. “[They] came from the vacuum of my mind,” he said. “[Then] there they are, on the screen, as if in real life. It’s a rather surreal experience… It was reassuring, but quite a shock just how living and breathing on the screen Roy and Betty were.” “Perhaps it’s me as a star-struck author.” He added: “The performances are just so strong. They bring the whole thing to life. When one reads the screenplay, one sees the gaps, but one doesn’t realise quite how the actors and the director fill the gaps between the lines. That’s the absolute magic of acting. “Betty in the book appears at the beginning to be quite a light-hearted, almost ditzy character, but all the time – and this was my aim, at least – you’re conscious that there’s rather more to her... That’s exactly what Helen brings to the part.” The film is directed by Bill Condon, who worked with McKellen on Gods and Monsters and Mr Holmes. Searle said: “I’m absolutely flabbergasted, both with the two stars and to have such a strong director.” He began his novel on a course run by Curtis Brown, the leading literary agency. Once finished, he submitted it to the agency’s joint chief executive, Jonny Geller,whose authors include John le Carré. Geller responded to it immediately. Describing it as “absolutely brilliant”, he said: “I sold it to Penguin and around the world and it went on to sell 100,000 copies in paperback last year. So it did really well.” He added: “It’s about an elderly man who finds love on a website… A slightly oddball romance begins. Then you realise something’s just not right about this… There are loads of twists. It’s very clever.” It is all a world away from Searle’s previous career, which he will only describe as working “in the sphere of security and intelligence”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/live/2018/jun/23/england-v-south-africa-womens-t20-series-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-23T14:49:41Z","webTitle":"South Africa beat England in thrilling women's T20 international","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2018/jun/23/england-v-south-africa-womens-t20-series-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2018/jun/23/england-v-south-africa-womens-t20-series-live","fields":{"headline":"South Africa beat England in thrilling women's T20 international","bodyText":"Tremendous win. Make no mistake, the South Africans were down and out on Wednesday conceding a pair of world record scores. Their tour was on the cusp of turning into a complete disaster. To fight back as they did here demonstrates the stern stuff they are made of under Dane van Niekerk. They have won one of three games but are very much alive. It will more than likely be the case that if they can also turn the tables on New Zealand on Wednesday at Bristol they will qualify for the final. England have two hours to bounce back themselves before playing the rampaging New Zealanders. It was a sketchy performance from the get-go, highlighted by about half a dozen (if not more) dropped catches. So there we have it, a fantastic first rubber of our double header at Taunton. Thanks for your company. I’ll be back at about 5pm local time for that second fixture. Bye for now. 19.3 overs: South Africa 166-4 (Luus 63, du Preez 8) Target 161 Brunt has the ball in her hand for the final over and Sune Luus clips behind square for four! Brings up her half-century! Wyatt is so close to it but just beyond her reach. More importantly, she has taken the task to five from five balls. Four more! Luus is owning this, bisecting the gap at point and making absolutely no mistake. Scores level. WINS IT with a huge SIX! Four, four, SIX. What an innings! South Africa win a ripper! 19th over: South Africa 152-4 (Luus 49, du Preez 8) Target 161 du Preez goes straight down the ground from Shrubsole’s first ball and it just beats the diving Brunt at mid-off for a valuable boundary. Dropped! Next ball the former South African skipper gives a regulation chance to Sciver at midwicket and she has put it down. England have been abysmal in the field today. Sciver throws at the non-strikers’ end to make amends but only ends up hitting Shrubsole who is backing up. No damage done, she continues. The bowler, predictably, keeps her cool and bounces back with a couple of dots to Luus. Two balls to come. Katie George the sub fielder makes a magnificent diving stop! Would have been four. Keeps it to one. Last ball... single taken to mid-off and Brunt HITS! Upstairs they go and it is not out! What drama! All told: eight runs from the over leaving nine to win from the final six balls. 18th over: South Africa 144-4 (Luus 48, du Preez 1) Target 161 Two wickets from the over but only three runs as well. They need 17 from 12 balls, with six of those to be delivered from Brunt and and six from Shrubsole. “There aren’t two better bowlers in the world for that job,” says Charlotte Edwards on TV. Can Luus see it through? Straight through her! From round the wicket, skipped on with a bit of bounce and Tryon can’t make contact with an attempted cut shot. Two wickets in four balls. What a great scrap this has been. England won’t give up! You can’t come down the track, swing and miss with Sarah Taylor behind the stumps. Easy peasy for a ‘keeper of that quality. First ball of the over too. 17th over: South Africa 141-2 (Luus 47, van Niekerk 25) Target 161 This could be the over. van Niekerk is a smart cricketer and will fancy her chances against Gunn. That’s shown first up, smashing straight back over her head for four! Real stand and deliver stuff! A couple more with a shovel then another with a push. Luus’ turn and Gunn locates her leading edge... but it lands just over the bowlers’ head! DVN gets the strike back, makes room and creams the low full-toss through the point gap for another four 13 off the over and the Proteas are just about home. Right? 16th over: South Africa 128-2 (Luus 46, van Niekerk 13) Target 161 A couple of accurate dots from from Brunt to Luus to begin before she gets off strike to fine leg. How will DVN approach this against England’s attack-leader? Down the ground, straight, but Gunn cuts it off and keeps it to one. Luus can’t get the penultimate ball away past point, every scoreless ball prompting applause from the crowd now. Last ball: another dot, unable to beat midwicket! More applause. Just the two singles from it. 33 needed from 24 balls. Brunt has one of those four overs. Will DVN take down Gunn next up? 15th over: South Africa 126-2 (Luus 45, van Niekerk 12) Target 161 Luus powered through earlier on and is still doing a job turning the strike over more often than not. van Niekerk takes full advantage later in the over, picking up a Gunn half-tracker and smashing it into the gap at deep midwicket for four. They drop another fielder back for the final ball so she tries to go through cover instead but can’t thread it through. 14th over: South Africa 120-2 (Luus 44, van Niekerk 6) Target 161 That is where the skipper is such a fine player, getting down low for the reverse sweep. Four over singles, making eight from the Ecclestone over. 41 to go for South Africa. You can bet that DVN will try and knock these off quickly. 13th over: South Africa 112-2 (Luus 42, van Niekerk 1) Target 161 DVN is in career-best touch so she will back herself to finish this off. She is off the mark to third man. Good bit of fielding from Ecclestone later in the over, making a diving stop at mid off. Three runs and the vital wicket of Lee from the Shrubsole over. Just what they needed. And they do! First ball of Shrubsole’s new spell and Lee picks out Sciver trying to hit over the midwicket boundary again. Instead, she pops it straight down the fielder’s throat. England alive again! 12th over: South Africa 109-1 (Lee 68, Luus 40) Target 161 Have that! Lee goes big twice in a row over the ropes at midwicket! “If you don’t get her early this is the damage she can cause,” says Isa Guha on the telly. This is just about game over. Wow. Six sixes she has now clobbered over the legside field. 52 left to get in eight overs, that’s 6.5 an over. England need to get her right now. 11th over: South Africa 96-1 (Lee 55, Luus 40) Target 161 Sciver on and she cops the Lizelle treatment too, the opener getting down down low and lifting her over midwicket for her fourth six! That’s her half-century in just 29 balls. What an innings this is. Oh, she is DROPPED next ball! On the boundary at midwicket, Shrubsole has put her down. Oh dear, that should have been out. It was hit hard, but still. And it spills for four. 12 off the over; England floundering. 10th over: South Africa 84-1 (Lee 44, Luus 39) Target 161 Shot! Lee advancing at Hazell and punching a drive through cover that nearly goes the full journey. Into the gap, it is four. She goes again back over her head and doesn’t get anywhere near all of it but the England fielders at long-on and long-off are bisected. Highly frustrating for Heather Knight, I am sure. A couple of singles to the legside sweepers to finish. Halfway there and more than half the required runs already found. The hosts in strife. 9th over: South Africa 76-1 (Lee 37, Luus 37) Target 161 Teenage left-arm ortho Sophie Ecclestone has been spun around and bowling her second over from the broadcast end. She’s sliding down at Lee from round the wicket and doing it nicely, prompting another lbw shout. Lee responds to the probing line the only way she knows how, swiping her looooong over midwicket for six more! Ecclestone doesn’t respond well, allowing Lee to help herself to four more past short fine leg. Some nice work undone there, 13 off the over. 8th over: South Africa 62-1 (Lee 26, Luus 35) Target 161 Big shout for lbw by Hazell, turned down. England were convinced but the umpire wasn’t and Luus survives. Great over from the offspinner, who bounces back after copping some tap, just two singles off this one. 7th over: South Africa 60-1 (Lee 25, Luus 34) Target 161 Gunn on with her slow-medium seamers and drops a catch to begin. Luus the beneficiary of the chance, coming in the follow through low to her right. Responds by smacking her down the ground for four. Another drop! Lee this time, to backward point. Beaumont had to dive to her right and it is a good effort but not enough to drag it in. Ten off the over with reprieves for both. That stings. 6th over: South Africa 50-1 (Lee 24, Luus 25) Target 161 Brunt back for the final over of the power play. Luus striking the ball really nicely here but not to the boundary this time around. Lee can though! She whacks the final ball for six over midwicket! It brings up South Africa’s 50. Exactly what they needed to begin this chase. Should win from here. “It is definitely game on,” says Charlotte Edwards on commentary. 5th over: South Africa 39-1 (Lee 17, Luus 21) Target 161 Heading in the direction of game on? Two boundaries in the over for Luus off Hazell. The first a product of another Jones misfield, this time misreading the bounce on the square leg rope, then the other goes over Brunt’s head at deep midwicket. 13 from the over, all to Luus. 4th over: South Africa 26-1 (Lee 17, Luus 8) Target 161 That could have been a big moment, Ecclestone’s first ball prompting a miscue from Lee, landing just short of the sprawling Wyatt running in from the midwicket rope. Misfield from Jones at point allows the strike to rotate. The left-armer right on the money to begin but six were still taken from the over. Guru Josh coming in over the tannoy; great areas from the Cricket Ground DJ. That’s what I want to be when I grow up. 3rd over: South Africa 20-1 (Lee 14, Luus 5) Target 161 Luus is away, lifting Shrubsole for a boundary over backward square for South Africa’s third boundary in that direction of their chase so far. An important innings for the no. 3 who is badly out of form. 2nd over: South Africa 13-1 (Lee 12, Luus 0) Brunt also has her first ball send behind square by Lee, this time high and long and over the rope! Effortless! Lee tries to go again when the short ball comes but doesn’t get all of it. Looking forward to seeing the England spinners. Dani Hazell performs well in the subcontinent and this track hasn’t much pace left in it. 1st over: South Africa 6-1 (Lee 5, Luus 0) Earlier, Lee whipped Shrubsole’s first ball behind square for four - and there was a wide in there too - but she has the first wicket, which matters far more. Oh yes! Superb swing bowling! That’s come back a mile through the gate of the opener. It clips her pad on the way through to her pegs. Perfect start for the hosts. Players are back! Lee and Wolvaardt opening up for the Proteas. Shrubsole will take the new ball. She had a return of 4-2-8-0 the other night. Play! 20th over: England 160-5 (Knight 35, Jones 6) Great shot from Jones to start the final over, shovelling Kapp over short-fine leg for four first up. When Knight gets on strike the result is the same, bringing up the England 150 with a powerful cut shot into the gap then back down the ground she gets a couple more. This has turned into a handy cameo from the captain after a slow start. She tries to play the Sarah Taylor reverse standing sweep from the penultimate ball, but doesn’t make contact. Kapp loses her bundle from what should have been the last ball, giving Knight a full toss above waist height, deflected perfectly to the third man rope, also giving her a free hit! She gets two from it down the ground making 18 from the 20th over. They will be very happy with eight an over - both sides probably will, come to think of it. Back for the chase in 10 minutes. 19th over: England 142-5 (Knight 23, Jones 1) Jones off the mark first ball, keeping the strike for the final over. Earlier, the captain edged to the boundary for a third time. Ismail again unlucky. The captain drove over cover for back to back boundaries, albeit a shot that should have been stopped by Wolvaardt at deep mid wicket.11 off the over. Swing and a miss, losing her middle stump. Ismail deserved that. Another fine hand from Beaumont, backing up her three tons on the bounce with 71 from 59 balls. 18th over: England 131-4 (Beaumont 70, Knight 14) Up and over from Beaumont, not in complete control down the ground off Kapp but getting a couple. Makes better contact the second time around but is dropped on the rope! The pace taken off the ball means it goes for four and not six. Klaas was the fielder and is immediately swapped with Ismail, who is in the act next ball when Beaumont goes in that direction once more, preventing the ball from crossing the line with a committed stop. Nine from it. The opener keeps the strike. 17th over: England 122-4 (Beaumont 61, Knight 14) Ismail to Beaumont, the latter trying to clear the front leg to hit long but is only able to knock her down the ground for one. Better from Knight, timing a cross-bat whack with perfection behind the square leg umpire for four. Wasn’t that short but her footwork was perfect to hit it where she wanted to. Four other singles, the seamer accurate with a string of shorter balls. 16th over: England 114-4 (Beaumont 59, Knight 8) Foot down now, Beaumont striking a boundary to begin then Knight registering her first four too from the outside edge. Tammy gets another chance to conclude the over and pulls hard behind square to the rope to make 14 from the over. Mali finishes with 2/39 from her four overs. 15th over: England 100-4 (Beaumont 50, Knight 3) van Niekerk again, now round the wicket. Misfield with Beaumont reversing, the pair able to get back for a couple. Both she and Knight pick out the sweepers for the rest of the over, which is enough for Beaumont to reach her half-century. What a marvellous run she is having. Three tons on the spin and another important hand here. Reached the mark in 47 balls with five boundaries. England’s 100 up with that stroke as well. 14th over: England 95-4 (Beaumont 47, Knight 1) Just as it was in the previous Mali set, before she took a wicket Beaumont ramped her for four. Such a high degree of difficulty but she makes it look easy and almost conventional. The skipper, Knight, is out there with her now, off the mark with a single. That was Lee’s first stumping for South Africa, the TV says. “Not entirely surprising,” adds Mark Butcher. Fair. That’s better! Great take from Lee who takes a ball up to the stumps off the seamer Mali and whips the bails off with ease. She’s had a shocker with the gloves over the last few weeks but that will help restore her confidence. Mali has two. 13th over: England 88-3 (Beaumont 41, Brunt 6) Brunt nearly in strife running to the danger end after a Beaumont single but gets back in time. Another useful over from DVN, going for just the five singles. They will be happy with that. South Africa in a decent enough position if they can keep their act together for the final seven overs. 12th over: England 83-3 (Beaumont 38, Brunt 4) Before the wicket came the ramp, Beaumont getting down low and executing the shot with perfection. She has been joined by Brunt, again elevated up the list. She was awesome on Wednesday and away with a boundary first ball again, albeit off the outside half of the bat down to the third man rope. It wasn’t far away from Ismail’s outstretched hands but it has been that kind of day for South Africa in the field, unlucky not to have a couple more. A play and a miss to finish. So, ten runs off the over and the wicket of Sciver. Nicely bowled, though. Nice change of pace, Sciver picking the wrong ball to try and plonk over the rope at long-on. Straightforward chance taken by Klaas. Well bowled. 11th over: England 73-2 (Beaumont 32, Sciver 16) Tammy Beaumont now moving up the gears, timing DVN through the offside for her third boundary. It’s a used pitch so it looks a touch harder for batting than it was on Wednesday. A few singles to go with the boundary, seven from it. England, Mark Butcher says, should get 150. Feels right. 10th over: England 66-2 (Beaumont 26, Sciver 15) Sciver down the ground from Mali’s first ball, gets two. Nice stop from Ismail, who looks to be fielding in a pair of Wayfarer shades! I thought it was compulsory for cricketers to wear eye-jackets straight from 1998? Back in the middle, Sciver is dropped! On the circle at mid-on with a leaping attempt with one hand, ala Peter Taylor. Not to be. Runs in the smaller denominations around the field from all bar one delivery. 9th over: England 58-2 (Beaumont 23, Sciver 10) It’ll be spin again from the broadcast end, Dane van Niekerk bringing herself on. She’s one wicket away from having 1000 runs and 50 scalps in T20Is, Lottie Edwards tells us on TV. The leggie beats Sciver’s edge, the hard-hitting right hander responding by moving around in the crease. That prompts a legside wide but on the whole it is another good over, just five coming from it. 8th over: England 53-2 (Beaumont 22, Sciver 9) Ismail cuts Beaumont in half, playing a false stroke across the line without any footwork. She’s lucky not to lose her off-stump. They run through for a bye, that delivery also too good for Lee. Sciver is clever, taking a quick single to midwicket. Beaumont again, who charges but Ismail sees her coming and drops in a bouncer! Great wheels! “That’s superb bowling,” says Charlotte Edwards, former England captain. A slow one to finish to complete a lovely set that went for only three runs. 7th over: England 50-2 (Beaumont 21, Sciver 8) Ntozakhe again, so she will bowl her four overs straight off the top. Beaumont clever to begin, using what pace there is on the ball to deflect a couple to third man. Another drop? I think it is. Lee the culprit once again behind the pegs, unable to glove an inside edge. In response, Beaumont whips wonderfully through midwicket for a couple more. “She’s in the form of her life,” says Izzy Westbury on the telly. Too right. Sciver lashes the final ball through cover, which would be four if not for an excellent Tryon give on the rope. Given she missed the previous game with a hand injury, that’s brave stuff from the all-rounder. It brings up England’s 50. 6th over: England 43-2 (Beaumont 17, Sciver 5) Sciver off the mark with a single and Beaumont gives the all-rounder the strike back with one of her own. She belted 33 in a hurry on Wednesday during happy hour but hasn’t made a major contribution so far this summer. The lovely cover drive she plays from the last ball of the set will help with that, bisecting the field to finish the power play. Shot. First ball, Ismail in the book! Very similar to the first dismissal, Taylor unable to keep a flay through the off-side down, hitting high on the bat and landing with du Preez just behind point. 5th over: England 37-1 (Beaumont 16, Taylor 20) Another boundary to begin, Beaumont down the ground just beating the long-on, pushing her into double figures. She is shooting for four international tons in a row in this innings, it is worth remembering. The pair get on their bike thereafter, taking Ntozakhe through the legside thrice. Nearly another chance to finish, Beaumont just clearing the pint-sized spinner. Her she only been a couple of inches taller. Not to be. 4th over: England 29-1 (Beaumont 9, Taylor 19) Much better from Beaumont, getting to the pitch and smacking Kapp through cover to brgin. Trademark Tammy. To keep up appearances when she gets her chance, some Trademark Sarah Taylor as well, clipping Kapp through midwicket with a minimum of fuss. She is lethal through there. The number three makes it three fours in the over with a crisp cut behind point to finish. That’s better. She’s away. 3rd over: England 16-1 (Beaumont 4, Taylor 11) Great effort from Chloe Tryon, diving to her right at mid-off to a lofted from from Beaumont but she can’t take the catch. Next ball, missed stumping off Taylor! Oh that’s a shocker. Both England players fortunate but Lizelle Lee has had a nightmare there with the gloves. Her keeping on this tour has been terrible and it could cost them big time here. 2nd over: England 13-1 (Beaumont 2, Taylor 10) Taylor didn’t get a bat the other day, shuffled down the order for the boshers after the massive start. She gets a couple to fine leg after a misfield from Ntozakhe. Then a boundary from another misfield - an even worse one - from the same fielder! Urgh! She had the perfect start picking up Wyatt but has now given the danger right-hander a start. She capitalises on it, smashing the last ball of the Kapp over through midwicket to make it back to back fours. “Are Dani Wyatt and Tammy Beaumont the shortest opening partnership in history?” asls Peter Oxenbury from “a very sunny Taunton.” Sadly, it was short in length as well as height today for the two of them. To be fair, both have ample credit in the bank. What a start for South Africa! Spin has done it! Extra bounce from Ntozakhe created a false stroke, Wyatt slicing a cut to the former captain du Preez at backward point who makes no mistake. Just what the Proteas needed after these two put on 147 on Wednesday. 1st over: England 2-1 (Beaumont 1, Taylor 0) Glad to hear Jerusalem is getting a blast. They didn’t used to play it before women’s internationals so the Barmy Army would instead. To be fair, it was their thing to begin with. If this is your jam, I wrote an essay on its cricket origins a couple of years ago. And with that, they players are on the field. Beaumont and Wyatt to open for England after their 147-run stand on Wednesday. The spinner Ntozakhe will be bowling the first over from our end for the visitors. PLAY! Neglected to mention that you can, and should, keep me company throughout the course of this double-header. I’ll be with you from start to end. Do you agree with Gilchrist, is Taylor the best stumper in the game? Are you at Taunton today folloing the OBO from the stands? Email me, tweet me - you know the drill. Adam Gilchrist on TMS the other night at Durham declared that Sarah Taylor is the best wicketkeeper on the planet. Too right she is. Our dear friend Vish had a bit of fun with her legside stumpings last week but putting some to music. Hopefully, she’ll get a bat today as well. We’re about ten minutes away from the start, by the way. England: Danni Wyatt, Tammy Beaumont, Nat Sciver, Katherine Brunt, Heather Knight (c), Sarah Taylor (+), Amy Jones, Jenny Gunn, Anya Shrubsole, Danielle Hazell, Sophie Ecclestone. South Africa: Lizelle Lee (+), Laura Wolvaardt, Dane van Niekerk(c), Mignon du Preez, Sune Luus, Shabnim Ismail, Marizanne Kapp, Chloe Tryon, Masabata Klaas, Raisibe Ntozakhe, Zintle Mali. No surprises there. They are unchanged from Wednesday. One late change for South Africa, Lackay out sick. Tryon is back. Full teams shortly. A bit more on #ShowUp. For the T20 women’s international double header, England hosting South Africa then New Zealand. They flogged the Proteas by a record margin at the same venue on Wednesday after knocking together a World Record 250-3, so the form speaks for itself. Some great news off the top: we have a sell out. A couple of hundred tickets are on the gate for walkups, but it will be full. Better still, today is the #ShowUp day - a campaign from Sky Sports and the Women’s Sport Trust to encourage people to attend women’s sport through the summer. A perfect day to pack the ground. We are ten minutes away from the toss in the first fixture. Unclear how the teams will change from the other night but I doubt England will tinker with their winning XI. Between times, take a look at this fantastic ECB mini-doco on Katherine Brunt that they released yesterday. Wonderful stuff from one of the best competitors in the game."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/23/south-korea-mexico-world-cup-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-23T16:57:01Z","webTitle":"Mexico hold off South Korea as Hernández brings up his 50","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/23/south-korea-mexico-world-cup-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/23/south-korea-mexico-world-cup-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Mexico hold off South Korea as Hernández brings up his 50","bodyText":"Mexico must secure a point in their final group stage match against Sweden to ensure they reach the last 16 for a seventh straight World Cup after they eased to victory over South Korea in Rostov. Having shocked the world champions, Germany, in their opening Group F game, Mexico secured a 2-1 win as Carlos Vela tucked home a first-half penalty before Javier Hernández clinched the points with his 50th international goal. South Korea, who pulled a goal back in stoppage time through Son Heung‑min, are all but out after enduring a second narrow defeat. But after Germany’s late victory over Sweden, Mexico face a nervous showdown in Ekaterinburg on Wednesday as they bid to get past the last 16 for the first time since hosting the finals in 1986. “We came to Russia with a lot of criticism but we’re working hard and have a lot of talent. We have humility but we beat Germany and South Korea and now we have to play against Sweden and stay cool and calm,” Hernández said. “We cannot afford to get caught up in all this, we have to continue our job and stay humble. Of course we should enjoy this but tomorrow we start working again,” he added after he equalled Luis Hernández’s record of four goals at World Cup finals for Mexico. South Korea were guilty of committing a number of fouls throughout the match, leading the Mexico coach, Juan Carlos Osorio, to complain his players had not been given enough protection. “Usually, I don’t like to talk about referees but there was something I didn’t like and that was that there were 24 fouls against us,” said Osorio. “It’s very easy to analyse who committed them. For the good of football, I hope they take the necessary precautions and measures.” Osorio, who is hoping to break Mexico’s run of six successive last-16 World Cup eliminations, said he spent a lot of time making sure complacency did not creep in after their win over Germany. “What often happens against teams with less history is that the human being tends to relax but we dedicated all week to making sure we did not let that happen and fortunately the message didn’t get lost among all the praise the team has received,” he said. “Football is about opinions, it’s very subjective and it changes all the time. The analysis is more about the result so the most appropriate thing for us is to keep preparing and not get carried out. We must prepare for the next game as if it is the last and get as far in the World Cup as we can.”. Mexico needed only 26 minutes to take the lead after Hirving Lozano initially failed to turn home a low cross. They were awarded a penalty as Jang Hyun-soo was penalised for handball – referee Milorad Mazic not needing to use VAR to point to the spot. Vela stepped up and coolly sent Cho Hyun-woo the wrong way to mark his 70th cap with the opening goal. The second half began more equally but it was Cho who was once again called into action just before the hour, neatly tipping a deflected Andrés Guardado effort behind for a corner. Vela angled a curling strike just over the bar before Hernández made sure of the win with a landmark goal. With time running out, Son scored South Korea’s first goal of the finals and it was one worth waiting for as the Tottenham forward bent a 20-yard strike out of the reach of Ochoa and into the corner – but it proved too little, too late. Juan Carlos Osorio’s side now face a final group game against Sweden in Ekaterinburg on Wednesday, while South Korea take on Germany in Kazan."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/jun/23/john-mcenroe-serena-williams-wimbledon-andy-murray","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-23T21:30:08Z","webTitle":"John McEnroe insists Serena Williams should be seeded at Wimbledon","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jun/23/john-mcenroe-serena-williams-wimbledon-andy-murray","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jun/23/john-mcenroe-serena-williams-wimbledon-andy-murray","fields":{"headline":"John McEnroe insists Serena Williams should be seeded at Wimbledon","bodyText":"The wise burghers of Wimbledon are treading delicately through a few moral minefields before the 150th championships, which begin on Monday week, but John McEnroe is adamant about one thing: the seven-times champion Serena Williams should be seeded. The tournament seedings committee, on which the former champion sits, will decide on Tuesday whether Williams – ranked 183 in the world as she continues her comeback after having her first child last September – should be included among the top 32 entrants in the women’s singles draw. Asked where he would rank his 36-year-old compatriot at Wimbledon, McEnroe said: “Somewhere between one and 10 – one and 16 at the worst.” But, despite flashes of enlightenment, the All England Club is a tough establishment nut to crack. Last week they denied Dan Evans a wildcard – in the main draw and qualifying – even though his ban for taking cocaine last year ended in April, since when he has won 20 of 24 matches, 14 on grass, the most by any British player this summer. After coming through a pre-qualifying tournament, Evans needs three more wins at Roehampton this coming week to confront his doubters at Wimbledon. There remains the small matter of the unfortunate fixture clash on Sunday 15 July, when the men’s final bumps up against the World Cup final in Russia. The BBC is understood to be lobbying behind the scenes for Wimbledon to bring forward its starting time an hour to 1pm, to lessen the impact on ratings for the football, which starts at 4pm. The response has been muted but common sense may yet prevail. Meanwhile, McEnroe is going in to bat for Williams. “I don’t think there would be a player that would complain, especially the top ones, if she was one of the top eight. Why in the world would they want to play her in the first, second, third round? Nor should they, in my opinion.” The core issue has been whether Williams or any player should be seeded when returning to the Tour after pregnancy. On Saturday Katrina Adams, the president and chair of the United States Tennis Association, told the New York Times that such players should not be “penalised” for starting a family. As for the argument that seeding Williams might be unfair to the player edged out of the top 32 – which the British No 1, Jo Konta, thinks ought to be considered – McEnroe says: “What’s her name? No offence. You’re talking about Serena.” McEnroe said the first day Williams played in the French Open last month, ratings on NBC were “50% more than a year ago”. He added: “It’s like Tiger Woods when he came back. All of a sudden it’s top of the ratings. Forget the fact that she has won 23 majors and what she brings to the table. I’m sorry, I apologise to the 32nd player in the world. That’s just the way it goes sometimes. I just don’t think it’s right to think that way.” Elsewhere, Andy Murray, who gave Nick Kyrgios three tough sets in his first match in 342 days in the first round of the Fever-Tree Championships on Tuesday, will decide about Wimbledon after he has played at Eastbourne – where he has drawn Stan Wawrinka in the first round, with the winner playing Kyle Edmund. That’s one tough draw. At Queen’s on Saturday, Kyrgios added 16 aces to the 82 he had served this week but lost concentration in the tie-breaks as Marin Cilic went through to his fourth final, winning 7-6 (3), 7-6 (4) in an hour and 26 minutes. “I was a little more composed in these situations,” the No 1 seed said. Cilic plays Novak Djokovic, who looked strangely out of sorts but found enough to beat Jérémy Chardy, 7-6 (5), 6-4. “I was very pleased to go through to the finals. Every tournament I am hoping I can play the way I know I can play.” It was a low-key reaction after playing some brilliant tennis. It should be an excellent final. In Halle, a below-par Roger Federer had to fight hard to win his 20th match in a row on grass, beating the world No 109, Denis Kudla, 7-6 (1), 7-5. He goes for his décima in Sunday’s final against Borna Coric, who got a walkover from the injured Roberto Bautista Agut. The world No 1 has struggled for rhythm this week but will surely turn up at Wimbledon in good shape to defend his title."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jun/23/highland-fury-trump-rival-drives-golf-course-plan","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-23T18:00:03Z","webTitle":"Highland fury as Trump rival drives golf course plan forward","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/23/highland-fury-trump-rival-drives-golf-course-plan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jun/23/highland-fury-trump-rival-drives-golf-course-plan","fields":{"headline":"Highland fury as Trump rival drives golf course plan forward","bodyText":"On a stretch of Scotland’s north-east coast, two historic acts of Highland pillage, separated by ages, are linked across golden sands. The village of Embo in Sutherland lies in the shadow of the grander cathedral town of Dornoch but its beach is known globally for the unique ecosystem its dunes support. Now, a planning decision by Highland council has left many of the 1,200 animal and insect species to be found in this corner of Scotland facing an uncertain future. High on Ben Bhraggrie overlooking this place stands the 200ft statue of George Granville Leveson-Gower, the first Duke of Sutherland and the most ruthless perpetrator of the Highland clearances which harrowed this place two centuries ago. Some now fear another harrowing is imminent. Councillors last week chose to defy the objections of just about every Scottish environmental and natural history agency by giving consent to a multimillion-pound golf development which may damage this site. Coul Links is the dream of US billionaire Mike Keiser, who owns an assortment of America’s finest golf courses and is, in the high stakes game for ascendancy in the luxury golf sector, Donald Trump’s main rival. In a curious twist to this clash of US corporate titans, the coastline of Scotland has become its battleground. Trump already owns two links developments in Aberdeenshire and Ayrshire. He too had to overcome environmental objections about damage to another unique system of sand dunes. An early-morning hike across these sands and the dunes behind them delivers rich rewards. As oystercatchers inspect the board of fare left by a receding tide, a colony of sand martins dip and weave among the dunes that define this expanse. Andrew Mackay is one of the activists leading a brawny fightback against the golf development. “It’s just so unnecessary,” he says. “They could still have a beautiful and unique golf course just a few hundred yards behind these dunes.” The development, he feels, is a desecration. “This area is a site deemed to be of unique scientific and cultural significance by three UK and global agencies. All manner of birds, insects and animals will be affected and many endangered; all for the flimsy promise of some jobs that can’t be guaranteed.” Once you’ve seen this place it’s difficult not to be persuaded by the objectors’ arguments. These shapes have been formed by natural forces over millions of years. They are a special gift to Scotland bequeathed by nature and it seems unthinkable that they are soon to be nipped and tucked into a manicured confection on the whim of corporate America. Keiser’s plans are accompanied by the usual accoutrements of these types of projects: hundreds of jobs and a boost to the local economy. Trump’s golf resort at the Menie estate in Aberdeenshire carried the same guarantees, yet four years later they have yet to materialise. And it’s not as though Scotland needs more golf courses. There are already seven within a 20-minute drive of this place. The final decision on the development now rests with the Scottish government, who may yet choose to call in the project and ultimately to jettison it. Environmentalists feel Holyrood owes them one. Five years ago it overruled the decision of the local authority and granted planning consent to Trump’s resort. That decision was reached by a government headed by Alex Salmond, a golf enthusiast. His successor Nicola Sturgeon does not play golf and she is also considering another independence referendum. For this she will require the support of every Scottish Green MSP. One of then, John Finnie, who represents this area, has been a vocal opponent of the golf course. Matters could become very interesting if he were to make the issue the price of his support. The managers of the Coul Links proposal are adamant that they can overcome all environmental objections and insist that protection of flora and fauna will form a key part of their strategy. The US businessman Todd Warnock, who is involved in the development, said: “After more than three years of thorough consideration of the project, we are excited to win such overwhelming support from the committee. The development has been comprehensively and fairly assessed by the two statutory bodies as well as the competent planning authority and we now look forward to bringing to Scotland the economic benefits of such a prestigious golf course.” In Embo, Andrew Mackay was having none of it. “They say that only a small part of this site will be altered. But that’s like painting a moustache on the Mona Lisa and saying that only a small area has been affected.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/24/turkey-elections-muharrem-ince-threat-to-president-erdogan","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-24T07:14:21Z","webTitle":"Voters rally behind Erdoğan’s rival as Turkey goes to the polls","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/24/turkey-elections-muharrem-ince-threat-to-president-erdogan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/24/turkey-elections-muharrem-ince-threat-to-president-erdogan","fields":{"headline":"Voters rally behind Erdoğan’s rival as Turkey goes to the polls","bodyText":"Hundreds of thousands of Turkish voters turned out on to the streets and squares of Istanbul on Saturday for a final day of rallies ahead of crucial presidential and parliamentary elections taking place on Sunday. In a remarkable display of his growing popularity, opposition candidate Muharrem İnce drew at least a million people to a rally in the Maltepe district of the city, where he urged voters to end 16 years of rule by President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and his Justice and Development (AK) party. “We will embrace everyone,” he said, as supporters in festive mood sang anthems and waved red-and-white Turkish flags. “Turkey’s hopes will be revived. This is going to be a united Turkey.” İnce, the candidate of the secularist opposition party known as CHP, has emerged as the most charismatic challenger to Erdoğan, and may push the president into a second-round contest. An affable physics teacher and veteran CHP MP from the city of Yalova, he has criss-crossed the country marshalling votes and seeking a united front against the incumbent. He has pledged to roll back presidential powers, restore the rule of law in Turkey and end prosecutions of dissidents and journalists. But Erdoğan, 64, who has ruled the country since 2002, first as prime minister then as president, has persevered in his usual bombastic style, ending his campaign yesterday with no fewer than five rallies. In Istanbul’s Esenyurt district, he told tens of thousands of supporters Turkey would go on “to achieve what others cannot imagine”, if they re-elected him once again. Erdoğan called snap elections in April, a year and a half ahead of schedule, despite repeated denials by his party that such a plan was under consideration. He said regional instability made early elections imperative. But critics said Erdoğan was hoping to preempt an economic slump that had already been hinted at with the collapse of the Turkish lira against the dollar and a widening foreign trade deficit, and to limit and weaken the possible field of rivals. Whoever wins the presidential election will assume extraordinary new powers, narrowly approved in a referendum last year that was marred with allegations of fraud. Those include the ability to appoint the cabinet and unelected vice-presidents, as well as senior judges, the power to issue decrees with the force of law and with limited parliamentary oversight. In the parliamentary race, the AK party has formed an alliance with the nationalist party, the MHP, led by the septuagenarian Devlet Bahçeli. It faces an opposition grand coalition that includes the secularists of the CHP, the nationalists of the Iyi party led by Meral Akşener, and the Saadet party’s Islamists. The pro-Kurdish HDP is running independently without being part of a coalition but has indicated it would back the opposition candidate that makes it to the second round against Erdoğan. The result of this dynamic campaign has been a far more interesting race than predicted when the snap polls were called, and has raised the distinct possibility that Erdoğan’s AK party may lose its parliamentary majority, even if the president is still the favourite to win. Public opinion polls are notoriously unreliable in Turkey. Nevertheless on average they appear to show Erdoğan securing a comfortable victory in the first round of the presidentials, but without an outright majority. A much tighter race is predicted between him and İnce in a second round on 8 July. Erdoğan faces a varied and convincing line-up of opponents, but İnce has proved the most threatening. In a month and a half he held 107 rallies in 65 cities, a whirlwind campaign that energised an opposition movement that few predicted would mount a credible challenge against Erdoğan. Last week he drew crowds of hundreds of thousands in the secular bastion of İzmir and in the capital, Ankara. He promised to end the state of emergency in place since the 2016 coup attempt, to continue “without mercy” the fight against terror groups, and to “unite Turkey”. İnce has broached many red lines for hardline secularists, visiting the imprisoned HDP leader Selahattin Demirtaş and demanding his release, as well as backing a parliamentary debate on resolving the Kurdish issue. He has also signalled his own religious piety and is a regular attendant at weekly Friday prayers, in a nod to Erdoğan’s religious base that is suspicious of secularists. At the end of his rally yesterday, he brought his headscarfed mother onto the stage, to loud cheers from supporters bearing flags of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the secular founder of the republic who abolished the Islamic caliphate. “Headscarf or not, man or woman, partisan or not, we will not discriminate against anyone,” he said. “You can wear your headscarf wherever you want.” İnce has sought to position himself as a democrat and populist, vowing to close down the opulent presidential palace in Ankara and turn it into an education centre, to end the state of emergency within two days of his victory, to restore the independence of the judiciary and to continue with determination the fight against terror groups. In a nativist nod, he pledged to restore diplomatic relations with the regime of Bashar al-Assad in Syria, in order to pave the way for the return of Syrian refugees to their country. There are more than 3 million displaced Syrians in Turkey.Some will support Erdogan for his crushing of the separatist insurgency in the Kurdish region, and his success in pushing the militants away from the Turkish border with Syria. Others are unnerved by his alliance with nationalists and their hardline approach to the Kurdish issue, as well as his recent military foray into Syria’s Kurdish region of Afrin. Hundreds of HDP cadres, including MPs and the former chiefs of the party, mayors and activists have been detained in a wide-ranging crackdown, and many Kurdish news outlets have been shut down in the interim. Erdogan appears to be concerned over the loss of votes to the HDP. In a video recorded surreptitiously during a meeting with prospective voters, he urged them to do “special work” to limit the HDP’s performance, in what was interpreted by some as a call urging fraud or intimidation. The assault on human rights has been a backdrop for much of Turkish politics over the last two years, since a traumatic coup attempt in 2016 in which 250 people were killed and more than 2,000 wounded. The government instituted a state of emergency and pursued members of the movement of Fethullah Gulen, an exiled preacher and former ally of Erdogan, whose followers are widely believed to have orchestrated the failed putsch."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"fashion/2018/jun/24/ten-ways-to-make-fashion-greener","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-24T05:00:22Z","webTitle":"Ten ways to make fashion greener","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/jun/24/ten-ways-to-make-fashion-greener","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2018/jun/24/ten-ways-to-make-fashion-greener","fields":{"headline":"Ten ways to make fashion greener","bodyText":"To forecast the fashion of the future is a perilous business. Many years ago I road-tested compostable clothes for this newspaper. The corn-starch separates promised much: they potentially allowed us a guilt-free way of consuming fashion at a frenetic pace without the nagging thought of them festering in landfill for eternity. Unfortunately the garments I dutifully wore all day – praying that they would not begin composting while I was on the tube – never caught on. Surprising, that. But this time, I’m back with bigger, bolder predictions, and for once I have some firepower. On Friday, the parliamentary environmental audit committee, led by Mary Creagh, announced it would investigate the social and environmental impact of disposable “fast fashion”. The aim is to remodel the industry and make it sustainable. This sort of spotlight makes a difference. Despite a rise in awareness of the social and ecological injustices contained in the consume-and-chuck-it cycle that governs the way we dress, substantive change has been slow. We currently produce 100 billion new pieces of clothing each year, mainly from virgin resources. And, according to a recent report from environmental NGO Stand.Earth the fashion industry is responsible for 8% of global climate pollution. If the garment business were a nation, it would be the fourth largest climate polluter on Earth. So the committee has quite a task ahead of it. Here are my hopeful suggestions for what your wardrobe might look like in a decade’s time if fashion’s sustainable revolution succeeds. 1. Fibres will be fruity Our wardrobes are dominated by cotton, a thirsty crop saturated in pesticides, and polyester, which is derived from petroleum. These will be displaced by so-called “wealth from waste” fibres, including “banana sylk” (from the stems of banana plants) and fruit “leathers”, especially from pineapple. The Spanish brand Piñatex has already brought the latter to market; a square metre of pineapple leather uses 480 waste pineapple leaves and is half the cost of traditional cow leather (and, its proponents claim, comes at a fraction of the environmental cost of raising livestock). 2. You’ll be carrying a bag made from fermented yeast Modern Meadow, based in New Jersey in the US, has caused a stir by applying sugar feedstock to yeast cells that have been engineered to create collagen. It is then pressed into sheets and tanned (in an eco-friendly process) to create cow-less leather. This clever bio-leather will become available commercially in 2020 but small sample pieces have sent the fashion pack into a frenzy with their low-emission, animal-friendly realism. Meanwhile, on the west coast, Bolt Threads is perfecting the art of brewing silk from yeast cells. 3. Colours will be more natural Expect an increasing number of brands to ditch toxic chemical dyes and switch to those that siphon pigments from plants, sugar molasses and micro-organisms, to eliminate heavy metals, acids and solvents. According to trials, these techniques also use a 10th of the water of conventional dyeing. If you’re a fan of a lairy colour palette, don’t worry. These next-generation dyes also include the wilder tints of nature, not just porridge-hued neutrals. 4. Your washing machine could be regulated by law The clothing industry has migrated towards petroleum-derived synthetics, but these have been shown to shed microfibres (fragments of plastic under 5mm), which potentially spell disaster for aquatic environments. Already, California’s state assembly has pushed for a law that clothing containing 50% polyester must carry a label warning of microfibre shedding and advising that garments should be hand-washed. If washing machine filters and fine-mesh laundry bags are shown to help contain microfibres during machine washes, expect these to become mandatory. 5. A wool cardigan will be prized like a Birkin bag When you want to slip into something special, you’ll be wearing organic cotton and wool. Naturals will be prized and precious fabrics, to be cared for, protected and handed down as heirlooms. (They’ll also be prized for not shedding microfibres.) A new appraisal of naturals will favour regenerative wool growing: keeping sustainable sized flocks of sheep and goats on grassland, it is claimed, helps to sequester carbon, restore watersheds and benefit wildlife habitats. 6. You’ll work out in silk and your jumpers won’t shrink If you’re trying to map this brave new textile culture, it’s wise to follow the patents and the investment, and they seem to be pointing to Silk Inc, backed by six UK patents covering 75 chemical formulations. A process of creating silk protein in water has been shown to change silk from water-repellent to water-wicking (essential for sportswear). It can also be used to coat cashmere or nylon to make wool and other materials shrink-resistant. 7. You’ll print your own outfit ... First you’ll 3D scan your body; then, for a precise fit, you’ll buy a file with your preferred design and 3D-print or 3D-knit your clothes at home or at a designated store. Designers such as Danit Peleg are already pioneering this approach, which takes wasted stock and excess production out of the equation. A 3D-printed Peleg design was worn by Olympian snowboarder Amy Purdy at the Rio Paralympic opening ceremony to great fanfare. Last year Peleg produced the world’s first fully customisable and personalisable 3D-printed garment for sale online. Admittedly, pieces took 100 hours to print, but advances in printing technology mean this process should be up to speed in a decade. 8. ... and be your own rag trader A big chunk of your wardrobe will probably be refurbished or remanufactured by your favourite brands. “Recommerce” is already taking off: outdoor brand Patagonia has teamed up with online reseller Yerdle and gently launched the website Worn Wear. You return your pre-worn clothes to a shop, where you get credit. They are processed (and waterlessly washed), reinvigorated and sold online at a lower cost than new. At the moment we can’t get a grip on our fashion consumption: a survey by the fashion recycling app reGAIN found that 27% of Londoners chucked unwanted clothes straight in the bin. Imagine if that were reversed and there were such a global demand for your spent threads that you were contacted daily by an organisation asking if you’d finished with your trousers. It’s going to happen. 9. Self-mending clothes At Penn State University in the US, squid teeth proteins have been turned into liquid and used to coat materials. When torn, the textile can be repaired by placing the two ripped edges together. It’s seamless, glue-free and threadless – just add warm water. The minuscule volumes of the proteins currently being produced are slated for medical applications, but in a decade this could have branched out to apparel, meaning you can throw away your needle and thread (if you are one of the few that still bothers to make do and mend, that is). 10. Someone else will own your clothes In the UK, an estimated £30bn of clothes hang unworn in bulging wardrobes. The case for sharing just got real: last week Armarium, the US luxury fashion-hire company, joined forces with Browns, the upmarket clothier, to take hiring and sharing up a notch. At the moment, this is a rarefied rental service for people who could comfortably afford to buy from upmarket designers outright. But it’s just the beginning."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jun/23/trump-press-secretary-sarah-sanders-ejected-virginia-restaurant-red-hen-lexington","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-23T20:08:23Z","webTitle":"Trump press secretary Sarah Sanders ejected from Virginia restaurant","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/23/trump-press-secretary-sarah-sanders-ejected-virginia-restaurant-red-hen-lexington","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jun/23/trump-press-secretary-sarah-sanders-ejected-virginia-restaurant-red-hen-lexington","fields":{"headline":"Trump press secretary Sarah Sanders ejected from Virginia restaurant","bodyText":"The White House press secretary, Sarah Sanders, claimed on Saturday that she was thrown out of a restaurant because she works for Donald Trump. Social media erupted, with some lavishing praise on the Red Hen restaurant in Lexington, Virginia, for taking a moral stand. Others sympathetic to the president urged a customer boycott. “Last night I was told by the owner of Red Hen in Lexington, VA to leave because I work for POTUS and I politely left,” Sanders posted on Twitter. “Her actions say far more about her than about me.” The press secretary added: “I always do my best to treat people, including those I disagree with, respectfully and will continue to do so.” Her father, Mike Huckabee, a former governor of Arkansas, candidate for the Republican presidential nomination and strong Trump supporter, responded to her tweet by writing: “Bigotry. On the menu at Red Hen Restaurant in Lexington VA. Or you can ask for the ‘Hate Plate’. And appetizers are ‘small plates for small minds’.” The Red Hen did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Saturday but Stephanie Wilkinson, the owner, told the Washington Post Sanders had already been served when she approached the press secretary and asked her to step outside. “I was babbling a little, but I got my point across in a polite and direct fashion,” Wilkinson said. “I explained that the restaurant has certain standards that I feel it has to uphold, such as honesty and compassion and cooperation. I said, ‘I’d like to ask you to leave.’” Sanders, Wilkinson said, replied: “That’s fine. I’ll go.” The press secretary walked out and others at her table followed. Wilkinson said: “They offered to pay. I said, ‘No. It’s on the house.’” The restaurant owner expressed no regrets, telling the Post: “I would have done the same thing again. We just felt there are moments in time when people need to live their convictions. This appeared to be one.” Members of the Trump administration are facing a fierce backlash over the policy that has seen more than 2,300 children separated from their parents at the southern border and tarnished America’s reputation around the world. Sanders’ banishment comes after Stephen Miller, a senior White House adviser responsible for its “zero-tolerance” immigration policy, and Kirstjen Nielsen, the cabinet member responsible for enforcing it, were reportedly heckled and hounded out of Mexican restaurants in Washington. Sanders has been notably reluctant to answer questions on the issue. Monday’s White House press briefing was delayed by four hours so Nielsen could fly back from New Orleans to face reporters instead. There were no briefings over the next four days, which is highly unusual. That did not spare Sanders the wrath of restaurant staff. Jaike Foley-Schultz, who claimed he was a waiter at the restaurant, wrote on Facebook: “I just served Sarah Huckabee Sanders for a total of two minutes before my owner kicked her out along with seven of her other family members.” Brennan Gilmore, executive director of the progressive group Clean Virginia, tweeted a photo of a handwritten note apparently from the restaurant that includes: “86 – Sara Huckabee Sanders.” The number “86” is industry slang for “throw out”. Supporters and opponents of the administration swung into action with reviews on the restaurant’s Facebook and Yelp pages. Some gave it one star, others awarded it five. Twitter users traded blows over whether the incident was comparable to the case of a Colorado baker who refused to make a wedding cake for a gay couple, which went all the way to the supreme court. Michael McNamara Sr posted on the Red Hen’s Facebook page: “Better not speak while you’re there because if the staff disagrees with you they will toss you out. Why bother with the hassle? Plenty of real restaurants who serve everyone.” Sapphire Cianfriglia wrote: “I appreciate how you decided to take a moral standing against an administration that is essentially emulating Nazi Germany (locking up children, letting white supremacists march freely in the streets, etc).” The Trump administration is not the first to get an icy reception on the Washington foodie scene. Former defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld once took his family to Buck’s Fishing &amp; Camping, only for co-owner and chef Carole Greenwood to declare that she would not serve “a war criminal”. Sanders has been reported to be planning to leave the White House, although she denied that was so."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/24/tide-turning-brexit-will-of-people-boris-johnson","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-24T05:00:22Z","webTitle":"Enough already: in the national interest, we must stop a hard Brexit | Will Hutton","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/24/tide-turning-brexit-will-of-people-boris-johnson","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/24/tide-turning-brexit-will-of-people-boris-johnson","fields":{"headline":"Enough already: in the national interest, we must stop a hard Brexit","bodyText":"It is barely disguised civil war. Brexit politicians and their powerful press are leading our country into the deepest of economic and political mires. “Fuck business” was reportedly Boris Johnson’s reaction to Airbus’s warning that it would have to disinvest from Britain unless there was a deal in which Britain continued its membership of the EU’s air safety certification system, single market, customs union and respected the jurisdiction of the European court of justice. Airbus’s customers need to know that every component in its planes conforms to the highest safety standards, which are set by the EU. Equally, it must strain for maximum production efficiency, fighting for every last order against Boeing; parts cannot be delayed for days, even hours, subject to time-consuming customs checks. As matters stood, warned its chief operating officer, Tom Williams, none of this could be assured: there was no clarity about Britain’s economic and trading regime after the transition period in 2020. His concerns are amply justified. Johnson’s reaction, and the parrot squawk that it is all part of Project Fear and safely to be ignored, is evidence enough. In the 21st century, it takes a continent to build a plane and the continent has to have shared trade rules, common regulatory standards and accepted adjudication processes. But Brexiters are as ignorant and locked into a pre-modern mindset as they are powerful. Theresa May presides over a government that insiders privately acknowledge is so divided that it is “ beyond salvation”. Britain is drifting towards being outside our continent’s trade and regulatory framework. An Airbus move would be a devastating blow to jobs and manufacturing. It employs 14,000 directly and 100,000 indirectly. The wing factory in Brexit-voting north Wales employs 6,000: its workers, like those in Sunderland working for Nissan, were blinded by an avalanche of propaganda into voting for their own poverty. Nor is Airbus alone. Days earlier, Erik Nordkamp, chair of a trade association of 10 US pharmaceutical companies based in Britain, reported that 86% of life science executives responded, in a survey, that Brexit uncertainty was imperilling investment. Our traditional dominance in the life sciences, warned Nordkamp, was under threat. As in air safety, so it is in medicine. The EU’s European Medicines Agency, now moving from Britain to Holland, sets the continent’s drug standards. Again, it takes a continent to research, prototype, safety-test and launch a drug. Outside that trade and regulatory framework, and with a NHS too cash-strapped to order new drugs, another British economic flagship is set to sink. The car industry will join its ranks. Revitalised by foreign direct investment, the UK car industry is part of a continental-wide system of production in which we disproportionately share the higher value work. BMW, maker of the Mini, warns of how a hard Brexit will force it into expensive, wasteful mitigating measures; Tata has already announced it is moving production of the Discovery Land Rover to Slovakia, while John Neill, CEO of Unipart, declares that Brexit is a fatal threat to the car industry. And our space industry, aiming to grow to £40bn by 2030, is about to be severely wounded by being excluded from the EU Galileo collaboration. All of this leaves the Brexiters unmoved. Johnson, Rees-Mogg and Farage think the further emasculation of British industry, in true Thatcherite style, is a price worth paying for the glittering prospect of an “independent” trade policy. But with whom, pray? Only India, the US and China are economies of any size outside the EU’s network of trade deals with 88 countries. None is gagging to do a kindly compensatory deal with Britain as a trade war looms. And to sell what, precisely, that cannot be sold now? It becomes ever clearer what a fabulous deal Britain had with the EU. We were at the centre of a free trade, rules-based order that spanned nearly half the world’s countries – and worth up to a £1,000 a year for the average family in lower prices, estimated the consultancy Oliver Wyman. Through the EU, British concepts of regulation became world standards – from medicine to mobile phone frequencies – allowing companies such as Vodafone to grow to global dominance. Inward investment boomed, compensating for our own endemic economic weaknesses. The EU pulled up our standards – from workers’ rights to clean air. Britain’s initiatives on trade, finance and security had real weight, backed as they were by the power of the EU. We could lay claim to being a world economic and political power. The EU was a win/win – the result of the noble cause of bringing our continent closer together. Yet British politics is transfixed. Faragists control the Tory party, fucking business, employment and jobs as if the rules of the economic game were as they were in 1850. Meanwhile, Corbynites control the Labour party, ruining the economy no less effectively by fantasising about bespoke deals that it claims it can negotiate better than the Tories, according to which Britain can share the benefits of being part of our continent’s trade and regulatory system while being independent. In and out simultaneously. But no club anywhere works like that, as nearly every member of the parliamentary Labour party knows. It is political guff. An increasing number of MPs on both sides, trooping through the lobbies, voting for policies they know are either impossible or against the national interest, believe the only way of breaking the logjam is a second people’s vote. Which is why yesterday I joined the march for just that: when tens of thousands freely give up their time to make common cause over a great purpose, politicians should listen. Opinion is shifting in the country and the discredited leaders of Brexit could not pull off the same combination of deceit and mendacity again. The danger is not the divisiveness of another vote; it is that it will only be the lived consequences of Brexit that make voters realise they were duped. But by then it will be too late to get back the lost factories, laboratories and headquarters. Democracy and our prosperity demand a second vote – now. • Will Hutton is an Observer columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/2018/jun/23/scottish-independence-supporters-march-bannockburn","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-23T21:57:55Z","webTitle":"Scottish independence supporters march to Bannockburn","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jun/23/scottish-independence-supporters-march-bannockburn","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jun/23/scottish-independence-supporters-march-bannockburn","fields":{"headline":"Scottish independence supporters march to Bannockburn","bodyText":"Thousands of Scottish independence supporters have marched from Stirling to Bannockburn.

Last week, the Observer published evidence that suggested Leave.EU co-ordinated its social media messaging with the Kremlin, including re-tweeting attacks against journalists and MPs by the Russian embassy. But shocking new evidence includes emails from the same period in which Banks and Andy Wigmore, Leave.EU’s press spokesman and Banks’s business partner, appear to discuss hunting for “personal stuff” to use against Ian Katz, who was editor of the BBC’s Newsnight at the time. On 24 October, Newsnight broadcast a report on Banks by the journalist John Sweeney. The question of his finances and the source of his donations to the Leave.EU campaign has been a subject of speculation since the referendum and is being investigated by the Electoral Commission. Seven days before the broadcast, after the BBC submitted a set of questions to Banks, evidence seen suggests an employee emailed Banks and Wigmore with research on Katz’s background – and that Wigmore replied: “We need personal stuff like girlfriends, if he’s in debt all the stuff a private investigator can find. That’s how we should retaliate.” The documents suggest Banks responded: “Agreed. Have a chat with Patrick and let’s get motoring on.” When asked about the allegations, Wigmore told the Observer: “You will be aware that we have reported you, the Guardian, the Observer, Peter Jukes Bi-Line Media [sic] and Chris Wylie to the police under the Computer Misuse Act 1990. “The police have also been given evidence and tape recordings of inducements and threats made to the original source of the stolen emails and how our emails were later then accessed in full cooperation of other third parties that the police have been informed of.” Banks is a director of a private security company, Precision Risk and Intelligence, which he founded with a former South African policeman. It is not known if Banks instructed a private investigator - and if he did, whether he instructed that firm - to try to obtain private information about Katz – now director of programmes at Channel 4. Before his appearance at the select committee for the Department of Culture, Media and Sport on 12 June, Banks told the Observer that he had carried out “oppo research” on the MPs on the committee. He said: “We’ve got all sorts of interesting details. One of them is paid £50,000 a year by the Countryside Alliance just to talk about squirrels.” During the committee hearing, Ian Lucas asked Banks a question about his insurance company and he replied: “Are you the MP that got drunk in the House of Commons and harassed a woman and got drunk on a karaoke evening?” Lucas replied that he wasn’t. He told the Observer that he wasn’t shocked by the personal attacks though he found them disturbing. “They go for you. It’s to intimidate you. They are bullies. And they go for you when you get them in a corner. The allegations about their meetings and business dealings with the Russians are extremely serious and they are lashing out.” The Observer has also obtained evidence, from a subject access request, that Banks’s Leave.EU team put out inflammatory social media messages about “rebel” MPs last autumn despite a warning from an employee that they might be “too menacing post-Jo Cox”. The emails suggest Banks appeared to ignore the message and told him to do it anyway. On 13 December, after a crucial vote on the EU withdrawal bill, Banks emailed a Leave.EU employee and asked him to get a list of Tory MPs who had voted for the amendment to target them and “hit them locally”. Banks asked him to “also look at each Tory MP rebel and see what we can find about them re expenses scandal and any other interests”. The employee emailed back: “Is saying there must be consequences for their actions too menacing post-Jo Cox?” Banks replied: “No we need to push deselection by local branch target chairman etc”. Several of the MPs targeted, including Anna Soubry, had previously reported death threats to the police after being targeted by the Daily Mail, Daily Telegraph and others including Leave.EU of being a “traitor”. A pro-Brexit MP has said parliament needs to “urgently” investigate whether Russia has infiltrated the British electoral system. Bob Seely, an expert on Russian hybrid warfare, said: “I support the government but we must take a longer-term view. We know Russia has made alliances on the hard left and the hard right all across Europe. And it’s very concerning that the leaders of Leave.EU have been so dishonest about these links.” Banks’s MEP, Molly Scott Cato, said she had written to Sajid Javid, the home secretary, demanding to know what had been done to investigate collusion between the Russian security services and the Brexit campaign, in particular what MI5 knows and what information should be made public."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/jun/24/social-housing-no-longer-option-young-families","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-24T06:00:18Z","webTitle":"Social housing is a vanishing option for families who cannot afford to buy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/24/social-housing-no-longer-option-young-families","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/jun/24/social-housing-no-longer-option-young-families","fields":{"headline":"Social housing is a vanishing option for families who cannot afford to buy","bodyText":"Struggling young families have seen their access to social housing fall as fast as their chances of buying a home, according to new analysis of the housing crisis. The shrinking stock of social housing has seen the share of young families who live in it fall by around a third over the past 20 years, with 400,000 fewer living in council and housing association homes. It comes despite the rising need for low-cost homes. The latest research, carried out by the Resolution Foundation, highlights another aspect of the intergenerational divide. It found that the decline in social renting by young families has coincided with rising levels of “housing stress”, as the proportion of families spending more than a third of their disposable income on housing costs rises across the population. About one in 10 low and middle-income families now face housing stress. However, younger families in the bottom half of the income distribution have been hit with the sharpest increases, with one in five households headed by an under 35-year-old being forced to pay what many regard as an unaffordable amount for their home. The fall in access to home ownership for the young – as a result of rising prices and stagnant wages – has become a major issue for the government, with senior Tories desperate to see purchasing a house become a possibility once again for new families. The research shows that poorer young families also lack the option of social housing. The share of young people in the bottom half of the income distribution living in social rented accommodation has fallen as fast as home ownership. Both fell by more than 10 percentage points between 1996 and 2016. This is partly as a result of the Right to Buy policy, which saw those in council houses allowed to buy their home at a discount. It has meant that older occupiers of social housing had access to properties and were helped into home ownership. A depleted stock of social housing has never been replenished, leaving the young increasingly reliant on private rentals that come with high costs and insecure tenancies. In fact, the research finds that for many young adults their best hope of living in social housing is to stay in their parents’ home, as part of the so-called “boomerang generation”. The share of social rented households where adult children continue to live with their parents has risen from 5% in 1996 to 7% today; it is now larger than the share of owner-occupied homes where adult children still reside (6%). There are hopes that a long-term decline in social housing is beginning to turn around. Last year ministers vowed to build more homes for social rent, backed by the promise of £2bn of support. Lindsay Judge, senior policy analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said: “Britain has a proud history of providing social housing. But the sector has been in decline for decades and is too often ignored in national debates about housing. “It’s welcome that the government has finally recognised the need for social housing and that we are talking about the sector again after the tragedy of Grenfell last year. But there needs to be a lasting shift that sees Britain’s social housing providers rise to the challenge of providing the homes that so many young families in particular need.” Prime minister Theresa May has made housing a priority of her domestic agenda, but there are concerns on Tory benches that Brexit has led to a lack of action in other areas. A government-backed commission has concluded that action is needed to speed up the rate of housebuilding. The review by former cabinet minister Oliver Letwin, to be published tomorrow, finds that thousands more British bricklayers need to be trained to help meet building targets. It suggests that a shortage of British bricklayers will have a “significant biting constraint” on government plans to boost the number of new homes built from 220,000 a year to 300,000. It also concludes that housebuilders are limiting the number of newly-built homes released to prevent a glut on the market hitting prices. Letwin says developers could increase the choice of design, size and tenure of new homes without impacting on the local market and therefore speed up the rate at which houses are built and sold."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/23/ruben-loftus-cheek-england-world-cup-panama","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-23T21:30:07Z","webTitle":"Ruben Loftus-Cheek’s long road from stilted quality to England starter","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/23/ruben-loftus-cheek-england-world-cup-panama","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/23/ruben-loftus-cheek-england-world-cup-panama","fields":{"headline":"Ruben Loftus-Cheek’s long road from stilted quality to England starter","bodyText":"Early afternoon in mid-September on the main youth-team pitch at Chelsea’s Cobham training ground, just behind the academy building, and Leroy Sané senses an opportunity. The German is clad in the colours of Schalke, his team level and in the ascendancy half an hour into a Uefa Youth League group game, as he collects from a marauding left-back, cuts back inside Charlie Colkett and prepares to spit away a shot from just inside the penalty area. What happens over the next 15 seconds had Michael Ballack, on a rare visit to old haunts, gawping in amazement. Ruben Loftus-Cheek, loitering at Sané’s back, forces his body between opponent and ball, takes a touch to shield it from another rival, then bursts between two more panicked markers and away. Sven Köhler’s attempt to block is batted aside. Paul Stieber, dragged in-field, is bypassed with ease now that the Chelsea midfielder has built up a head of steam. Others might have over‑elaborated given the run has taken out more than half the opposition but, instead, there is a pass played calmly to Charly Musonda on the flank. One cross and a Dominic Solanke finish later, Chelsea were in front. Ballack, from his vantage point in the small stand, apparently turned to his entourage to exclaim: “Who the hell is that kid?” He should probably have known given Loftus‑Cheek, who will make his first World Cup start against Panama in Nizhny Novgorod on Sunday, has been earning rave reviews at Chelsea since the age of eight. At the academy in Cobham, the England midfielder’s progress to Russia is a source of huge pride. The 22-year-old has long been considered the great hope of a polished youth system, the one who would finally make a mark with the club at senior level. Hearing himself consistently described as such convinced him not to seek first-team football on loan elsewhere in the belief his chance was close, and, with opportunities rarely forthcoming, arguably stymied his development. All it took was eight games as a starter on a season-long stay at Crystal Palace to prompt Gareth Southgate, for whom he had scored three goals in four games as the under-21s claimed the Toulon Tournament in 2016, to call up Loftus-Cheek to the senior squad. The positive impression made in his debut against Germany in November was enough to convince the management he would be an asset at the World Cup. A 10-minute cameo against Tunisia last Monday and Dele Alli’s strained thigh have now thrust him into the side. “My goal simply was to have an impact, to try to make a contribution and help the team win,” he said. “I wasn’t thinking: ‘I want to play well so I start the next game.’ But every kid’s dream is to play in the World Cup. Watching at home with your parents when you’re 10 years old, you never think you’ll be there in the future. Even just to get on for 10 minutes … you don’t realise out on the pitch but, afterwards, you take it all in. I’m delighted and, whatever’s next, I feel ready.” No one doubts that, not least because his journey to this point, from Sunday morning football with Springfield FC via Chelsea’s development school in Catford, has been far from straightforward. A player of relatively average height as a child grew rapidly in his teens, “gaining all this muscle and my bones couldn’t cope”, enduring spells of fatigue and dizziness that, at times, left him fretting over whether his body would handle the sport. At 14 he missed almost an entire season with glandular fever, but there were constant niggling injuries too, hampering progress, stoking the self-doubt. The back problems still occasionally flare up even now, with Loftus-Cheek, 6ft 4in and 14st, following a strict fitness programme that relies heavily on yoga. The ability showcased against Schalke, all fearsome power, deceptive pace but wonderfully soft feet, still marked him out and, once he grew into his body, opportunity beckoned. At 16, there had been the distraction of a high-profile dispute between prospective agents over his signature before the signing of a lucrative professional deal at Stamford Bridge, with mind‑boggling figures divulged and debated in the public domain. It took a close-knit family to ensure the problem did not become more disruptive but Loftus-Cheek’s potential made deflecting interest from clubs such as Manchester City and Barcelona a priority. Chelsea paid to keep him from their clutches. Not that the opportunities followed. José Mourinho had first met him when Loftus-Cheek was in the under-9s, as published on the player’s Instagram account, and recognised his lavish talent. The youngster’s physicality marked him out as a Mourinho-style player and, three months after that burst of pace and power against Schalke’s youth team, he was training regularly with the seniors and selected in the match-day squad for a Champions League group match against Sporting Lisbon in December 2014. Mourinho, by then in his second spell at the club, nominated the youngster to conduct the pre-match press conference, something he dealt with admirably. The teenager had been thrust on to a pedestal, the whole occasion dressed up as a celebration of the academy, only for the manager to offer the player seven minutes at the end of a dead rubber the following night. He would play one minute of senior football up to his full debut, once the title had already been secured, in mid-May. The anticlimax of it all was palpable. The manager was not done. A lacklustre 27-minute display in a post-season friendly against Sydney FC in front of 83,598 at the ANZ Stadium a few weeks later was branded unacceptable by Mourinho. The public dressing-down was brutal. “Ruben was saying he had a pain in his back but what I was feeling was that he only had this pain when Sydney had the ball,” he said. “So, with Ruben, it’s one step back in terms of my relationship with him. If he doesn’t know what it means to play for me and Chelsea, it’s one step back. “Ruben has to learn that, at 19, you have to run three times as much as the other guys and you have to play to your limits. You don’t have to play like a superstar with the ball at your feet because this is not the under-18s. That competition is too easy for him. He’s too good for it, but I don’t accept that a player, when we don’t have the ball, doesn’t press, doesn’t have intensity and is waiting for other people to recover the ball. I don’t accept that of superstars, so why should I accept it in a 19-year‑old kid? He has to learn what it takes to play for us.” The tactic was presumably designed to drive the youngster on but Loftus-Cheek would play eight minutes in the Premier League as Mourinho’s tenure unravelled spectacularly in the autumn. “Mourinho held him back,” Loftus‑Cheek’s father, Trevor Loftus, said last year. “Everyone behind the scenes was asking: ‘Why isn’t he playing?’ If Ruben was playing for Mauricio Pochettino, he’d have 70, 80, 90 first-team appearances by now.” There would be six substitute appearances in the title winning campaign under Antonio Conte, who saw raw quality but had tried using him as a second striker behind Diego Costa in pre-season – hardly ideal for a midfielder who had never played with his back to goal – and no role at all in his 3-4-3. He learned from his senior teammates in training, as he had since being partnered as a 14-year-old with Didier Drogba in a one‑on‑one drill, but, as a member of the first-team squad, he played next to no under-23s football, which left him starved of game-time. Then, last summer, Crystal Palace came calling. At Selhurst Park, Loftus-Cheek toughened up. That year on loan provided him with life experience at senior level, from how to cope with being dropped or substituted, to adapting psychologically to setbacks on the pitch. He did not experience a win until his 10th match at the club, by which time he had already graduated into the England senior setup. He benefited from Roy Hodgson’s coaching at Beckenham but it was the game-time he had craved and from which he truly gained. The youngster was a sponge, soaking up knowledge from the coaching staff and the knack of streetwise football from his teammates, over the course of a campaign that resulted in 24 Premier League appearances, a tally that would have been more impressive had he not suffered that three-month mid‑season hiatus with ankle trouble. “He doesn’t have any weaknesses,” said Hodgson. “He has all the qualities – pace, power, touch, awareness – that you need in a central midfielder.” He discovered how to win with a team that was not challenging for silverware and learned first-hand the uglier aspects – opponents’ kicks, on-field goading or attempts to unsettle – of the senior game. Contrast his initial outings, when he offered flashes of his quality, with the consistent excellence delivered over his past six starts. He bullied opponents in that run-in as the team sprinted into mid-table. Palace’s coaching staff marvelled at how “cold” he was in training, particularly with finishing that has only occasionally been glimpsed on the competitive stage. “Since I was a young kid, I have always been calm on the ball,” he said. “That comes down to awareness as well. When you have good awareness and you know what’s going on around you, you don’t need to panic. There is no point. It just makes things worse. You have to stay calm, cool and collected.” He will return to Chelsea far more mentally resilient and with a World Cup finals under his belt. Loftus‑Cheek spent his day off touring St Petersburg’s Hermitage museum of art and culture with four teammates, but his focus was already fixing upon Panama. The tyro who barged through Schalke all those years ago, leaving Sané in his wake, has a dream to realise in Russia."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/jun/24/james-henry-pullen-inmate-inventor-and-modelmaker-extraordinaire","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-24T13:04:50Z","webTitle":"James Henry Pullen, inmate, inventor and modelmaker extraordinaire","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jun/24/james-henry-pullen-inmate-inventor-and-modelmaker-extraordinaire","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/jun/24/james-henry-pullen-inmate-inventor-and-modelmaker-extraordinaire","fields":{"headline":"James Henry Pullen, inmate, inventor and modelmaker extraordinaire","bodyText":"In 1878, James Henry Pullen, a man who did not speak until he was seven and barely spoke a comprehensible word for the rest of his life, drew his own autobiography. At a glance, it could be an account of the long, successful career of an eminent architect or engineer, full of drawings of beautiful ship models and handsomely equipped workshops. In fact, Pullen spent all but his earliest years in mental hospitals, but as a new exhibition reveals, gradually became modestly famous as one of the strangest geniuses of the 19th century. Some of his dazzling models, beautifully made and full of wit and invention, have been restored down to the last pinhead-sized rivet for the first exhibition on his life and work, at Watts Gallery at Compton, near Guildford in Surrey. His state barge for Queen Victoria, intended as a floating office from which she could rule the empire, gleams again, drawn forward by ivory angels despite the attempts of a brass-tongued demon to haul it back. Inside the tiny circular windows, useful objects including a sceptre and ivory documents the size of fingernails lie waiting for her on a desk, with minature blinds ready to be drawn to shade her privacy. Kirsten Tambling, the joint curator of the exhibition, has borrowed surviving examples of Pullen’s work from the Langdon Down museum – based on the collection of John Langdon Down, who before founding his own hospital was medical director of Earlswood, the asylum where Pullen lived from the age of 15. Tambling has studied the scanty medical records for Pullen, and says it is impossible to determine what mental disability he suffered from, if any. He was described as an “idiot” – a catch-all term – but later medical notes described him as “intelligent but very deaf” and one queried “is he an idiot?”. He and his brother, who also spent periods in mental hospitals, were among seven survivors of the 13 children of working-class parents, who were first cousins. Pullen’s autobiography portrays his mother as a remote figure, handing him over to an asylum for children at the age of seven apparently without a backward glance. When he was moved to the newly built Earlswood in Surrey, one scene shows him in tears of despair. He spent the rest of his life there but was highly regarded, paid a salary for designing and building furniture for the asylum, and provided with an excellent workshop for which he designed a mobile bench that could be raised into better light. Although Pullen would never get any further than the pubs nearest the asylum where he sold tiepins and brooches for the price of a few pints, his beautiful boats sailed much further. He even met the Prince of Wales, who sent him ivory and precious timber as materials. The state barge and his magnificent model ship named Princess Alexandra in honour of the royal wedding of 1863 – launched on the pond in the asylum gardens in front of invited patrons and locals as well as the hospital brass band and all the residents – were exhibited at the 1867 Paris Exposition Universelle. Journalists came to Earlswood to see his creations and interview him: one article, headlined “The genius of Earlswood asylum” said: “He certainly has many gifts which one would hardly expect to find in such a quarter.” Although his circle was so narrow, Tambling said he clearly had access to newspapers and journals, and was very interested in developments in shipping, steam power and electricity. One of his more bizarre models, a circular vessel with a forest of little sails, may have been designed for the practical task of clearing sludge from canals. The exhibition also features a recreation of one of his most famous inventions, worked on for years, a mechanical giant that starred at Earlswood fetes, its pulleys and levers inside the body driving moving arms – one brandishing a scimitar – mouth and eyes, some form of rocket that poured out smoke, and a bellows powering a blaring voice that was banned after it terrified visiting children. Tambling finds one photograph of Pullen in a grand uniform particularly poignant. Apparently he alarmed the authorities by announcing that he intended to marry a woman he met on one of his outings. They had the uniform made and told him he could not be appointed an admiral if he married and left: he accepted the brass-buttoned uniform and lived on in the asylum until his death in 1916. “We have no idea who she was – but could he really have left and lived happily in the real world after so long in an institution?” Tambling wonders. “And if he had, would the wonderful inventions have stopped?” James Henry Pullen: Inmate – Inventor – Genius, at Watts Gallery, Compton, Surrey until 28 October 2019."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jun/23/investigation-into-central-london-pub-blaze-under-way","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-23T11:01:55Z","webTitle":"Fire breaks out at Somers Town Coffee House pub in Euston","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/23/investigation-into-central-london-pub-blaze-under-way","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jun/23/investigation-into-central-london-pub-blaze-under-way","fields":{"headline":"Fire breaks out at Somers Town Coffee House pub in Euston","bodyText":"An investigation is under way into the cause of a fire at a popular pub in central London.

It was Manuel Valls, France’s socialist interior minister in 2013, justifying the policy that Salvini now demands – the mass expulsion of Roma from their camps. The Roma, Valls claimed, “have lifestyles that are very different from ours and are clearly in confrontation” with French values. The Roma are Europe’s most unwanted people. Some 10 to 12 million Roma live across the continent. They have been here for more than a millennium – and have been ostracised and suppressed throughout that time. One in four Roma is thought to have perished in the Holocaust. Today, they remain one of the few peoples whose demonisation and persecution is accepted in polite society. Across the political spectrum, politicians parade their prejudices, depicting Roma as thieves, beggars and child snatchers, as social threats. In most European countries, Roma are the most despised social group. France is often criticised for its antipathy towards Islam. But whereas less than a third of the French population dislike Muslims, almost two-thirds have an unfavourable view of the Roma. So do four in five Italians, two-thirds of Greeks and Hungarians and almost half of Spaniards and Britons. The Roma may be Europe’s largest minority group, but they are socially isolated and have no powerful figures to lobby on their behalf. That makes them easy scapegoats. It also makes it easy to ignore the hostility towards them. The silence is as shameful as the bigotry. • Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/24/salvadorans-deported-from-us-facing-violence-fleeing-poverty","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-24T04:59:17Z","webTitle":"‘Our country is not a safe place’: why Salvadorans will still head for the US","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/24/salvadorans-deported-from-us-facing-violence-fleeing-poverty","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/24/salvadorans-deported-from-us-facing-violence-fleeing-poverty","fields":{"headline":"‘Our country is not a safe place’: why Salvadorans will still head for the US","bodyText":"Outside the migrants’ attention centre in San Salvador, 19-year-old Berenice Cruz’s eyes dart around nervously before she whispers that she had fled El Salvador “because of the crime”. Nearly all her family in the east of the country belong to a gang, she says, but she refuses to get involved. The gang threatened to kill her, so she attempted the perilous journey to Reno, Nevada, in the US, where an aunt lives and where sanctuary lies. She failed. “If I go back to where I live, they’ll kill me,” she says, shortly after arriving back in her home country from a detention centre in McAllen, Texas, where she was held after crossing the border. She is one of 11,748 Salvadorans deported from the US and Mexico since the start of 2018. Migrants have been under relentless attack since Donald Trump began his run for office. The US authorities’ policy of separating children from their families in the name of a “zero tolerance” immigration strategy sparked outrage last week from Washington DC to San Salvador, and Trump was eventually forced to back down with an executive order which critics say still does not go far enough. But his policy continues to ignore the difficult realities of thousands of migrants fleeing violence and misery in the so-called Northern Triangle, the Central American countries of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras plagued by corruption, gang crime and impunity. “They declare [El Salvador] the most violent country in the world, but then say they won’t give us refuge, asylum, or any kind of protection for reasons of violence,” said Aquiles Magaña, secretary of the National Council for the Protection and Development of Migrant People, known as Conmigrantes, criticising Trump’s “drastic change” in asylum policies as hostile, racist and contradictory. El Salvador’s murder rate fell last year compared with 2015 and 2016, but it was still soaring at more than 10 homicides a day on average in 2017 in a country of six million. It remains one of the deadliest countries in the world outside war zones. Turf wars between rival gangs drive violence and perpetuate inequality and insecurity. These gangs were born in Los Angeles and transported to the streets of El Salvador amid mass deportations in the mid-1990s of migrants who fled the country’s 12-year civil war. Unsurprisingly, nine out of 10 families with children in El Salvador hope to migrate in the future. Iris Martinez, 40, left El Salvador two weeks ago, intending to escape gang intimidation after witnessing a murder two years ago. “I always received threats,” she says after getting off a bus of 35 deportees held in Mexico. She plans to make the trek again, this time with documents to request asylum, to be reunited with one of her three children who is already in the US. Cases like Martinez’s face even greater uncertainty after the US attorney general, Jeff Sessions, ordered immigration judges earlier this month to deny asylum in most instances of gang and domestic violence. On a recent Friday afternoon, 93 deportees arrived in El Salvador from the US. Some had lived there for years or decades. Others were caught immediately on crossing the border. Once in El Salvador, the deportees were greeted with a smile from government workers, an orange juice and a sandwich before being interviewed by officials and heading off with all their belongings in a small red drawstring bag. But returning to their home districts is not so easy. The near unanimous consensus among deportees at the centre is that Trump’s policies will not stop migrants from heading north. “Prosecuting asylum seekers for crossing the border, detaining families seeking protection and limiting the standards to win asylum are cruel and inhumane and ignore the conditions that are leading many central American women, children and families to flee their communities in search of safety,” said Adriana Beltrán, of the Washington Office on Latin America. According to 2016 government statistics, nearly three-quarters of deported adults cited economic factors as their reason for leaving the country, where more than a third of the population lives in poverty. Reasons for deported children were split almost evenly between economic motives, insecurity and family reunification. Tessie Borden, spokeswoman for a Los Angeles-based organisation, Clergy and Laity United for Economic Justice, challenged rigid distinctions that cast economic reasons for migration as less valid than security concerns. “These factors are all connected,” she said. “The kind of lives these people live are not lives in which they have many options to begin with.” Josué, 18, another returnee to El Salvador, went to the US with his mother when he was seven, seeking “a better future”. He says he plans to try to cross the border again as soon as possible, hoping to make it in time for the birth of his second child in July. He is more worried about being in El Salvador than about Trump’s immigration policies. “This is not a safe place,” he says, switching from Spanish to English. “Being young here is a crime.” Youth are particularly vulnerable to gang threats and violence, which are the driving forces of their displacement in El Salvador, according to a report from the human rights organisation Cristosal. Beltran said: “Many victims of violence find no protection from the authorities,” she said. “In fact, many fear the police as much as the criminals.” Another young man, Enrique Valle, 29, recently returned to El Salvador from Los Angeles. He calls his country “beautiful” but says “there are some places where you can’t go, especially as a young man.” Valle’s father was murdered by gang members six years ago when he missed the extortion payment for his bakery. Extortion is widespread in El Salvador, affecting nine out of 10 small businesses, according to the National Council of Small Business of El Salvador. Facing gang threats, Valle fled. In El Salvador, he says, there’s no future for him – or the two-year-old son he left in Los Angeles. Spending more than a few days with his only brother in their home district plagued by warring gangs is too dangerous, so Valle will head north again shortly. “I don’t know if I’ll be able to cross again,” he said. “But I’m going to try again for my son and my mother. You can’t live here with the way the situation is.” Reporting for this article was funded in part by a fellowship from the International Women’s Media Foundation"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/24/players-tribune-website-gives-world-cup-stars-their-voice-sterling-lukaku","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-24T05:03:17Z","webTitle":"Football fans flock to Players’ Tribune, the site that gives stars their voice","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/24/players-tribune-website-gives-world-cup-stars-their-voice-sterling-lukaku","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/24/players-tribune-website-gives-world-cup-stars-their-voice-sterling-lukaku","fields":{"headline":"Football fans flock to Players’ Tribune, the site that gives stars their voice","bodyText":"Several unlikely stars have emerged during the World Cup, from inflatable unicorns to Japanese and Senegalese fans cleaning up after games. Last week brought a fresh contender: an American website better known for its baseball coverage. The Players’ Tribune has attracted unprecedented British visitors in the past few days with a succession of personal testimonies from some of the world’s football stars. This weekend a long piece written by, and signed by, England forward Raheem Sterlinghas won praise for its honesty and for its explicit rebuke to traditional media’s unfair representation of his life. “There’s a perception in certain parts of the media that I love ‘bling’. I love diamonds. I love to show off,” Sterling wrote. “I really don’t understand where that comes from.” The article chronicled the death of his father and the sacrifices made by his mother to allow him to train as a young footballer. “If you grew up the same way I grew up, don’t listen to what certain tabloids want to tell you,” he said. “They just want to steal your joy. They just want to pull you down. I’m telling you right now, England is still a place where a naughty boy who comes from nothing can live his dream.” Last week Romelu Lukaku, the Belgium and Manchester United striker, told of his impoverished childhood in Antwerp in a piece which prompted a similar reaction. “One of the things that seemed to resonate with readers in the Lukaku piece is the image of him sitting in the kitchen at six years old, seeing his mother pouring water into the carton of milk to make it last the week,” Sean Conboy, the site’s executive editor, said. “A lot of people can empathise with that image, even if you don’t care about Manchester United or Belgium, or even care about football at all. We’re trying to tell human stories, not necessarily just football stories.” The site, founded in 2014 by the former New York Yankees baseball star Derek Jeter, styles itself “The Voice of the Game” and says its aim is to give athletes “a platform to connect directly with their fans, in their own words”. “My goal is for the site to ultimately transform how athletes and newsmakers share information, bringing fans closer than ever to the games they love,” Jeter, who played shortstop for the Yankees for 20 years, has pledged. His site’s key aim, he has always claimed, provides sports competitors with a way to speak directly to their fans. From offices in New York, the Tribune also offers sports commentary, videos and podcasts. In America some of the site’s more headline-making journalism has included a piece by Major League San Francisco Giants famous outfielder Andrew McCutchen on baseball’s relationship with poverty and an influential piece on race and gender in women’s sports by three of New York Liberty’s female basketball players. Yet there has been criticism from the New York Times, among other newspapers, over how the articles are produced. Conboy said that some players approach the site with ideas, or a rough draft, while others talk to a camera to see what happens. The site’s editors “put together a draft in the athlete’s own words” and the player revises it. “They have full approval, of course. They get to make sure everything is exactly how they want it,” Conboy said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/live/2018/jun/23/corea-mexico-en-vivo-en-espanol-mundial-rusia-2018","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-23T17:12:23Z","webTitle":"Corea del Sur 1-2 México en vivo y en español – como ocurió minuto a minuto","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2018/jun/23/corea-mexico-en-vivo-en-espanol-mundial-rusia-2018","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2018/jun/23/corea-mexico-en-vivo-en-espanol-mundial-rusia-2018","fields":{"headline":"Corea del Sur 1-2 México en vivo y en español – como ocurió minuto a minuto","bodyText":"Gracias a tod@s por pegarse a este blog hoy. Ya sé que me prefieren y que a Andrés Cantor lo dejan calentado el banco. México no dejó nada por desear y se perfila para salir primero del grupo saliendo con dos goles de un partido peleado aunque hayan sostenido la pelota. 20 infracciones, 20 patadas duras se aguanto el Tri. Todavía les queda Suecia por delante. De hecho, ahora juegan los suecos. Si quieren seguir el partido en Inglés, acá les dejo el link. ¡Saludos! Voten al jugador del partido! Para mí la figura del partido es obvia ... El Chuky Lozano. Ahora voten ustedes. Gracias por acompañarme hoy. YA NO RUEDA MÁS. México suma 6 puntos y aseguró los cuartos. La porra canta Cielito Lindo con toda. IMAGINEMOSNOS COSAS CHINGONAS Min 90 + 5 Ahora tiene que aguantar el Tri. LA REVENTÓ con la zurda al ángulo opuesto. Min 89 Va a ganar México. Ya no da para mas. Si a nosotros no nos creían cuando dijimos que México haría gran torneo, quizás ahora si. Esto dijo Oscar de la Hoya al respecto ... Les dije que el Tecatito entraba a la cancha con onda Slim Shady. Min 85 En Corea salió Kim Min-woo por Hong Chul. Ya juegan con 2 atrás. Para que se relajen les dejo otra de nuestra serie. Graham Parker compara como los medios mexicanos e ingleses tratan a los jugadores de sus selecciones respectivas. Min 82 Corea empieza a mostrar las garras, pero muy tarde. Se le va el tiempo. Álvarez cae acalambrado, Lee, el 10, lo ayuda a elongar. Se viene un cambio mas de Corea. Min 80 Codazo a Javier Hernández del recién ingresado Jung. El árbitro Mazic le muestra el cartón amarillo. AY YAI YAI YAI ... la porra alegre canta Cielito Lindo Min 78 Un error de los centrales Mexicanos lo dejó tendido a Memo que se comió una patada. Los cambios – Vela por Gio dos Santos Moon Seon-min por Jun Woo-young. Un defensor por un mediocampista en ataque. Min 75 La quizo en el area Corea, pero se notan caídos animicamente. Tiraron un par de centros, el último termino dormido en las manos de Memo, Se van a hacer dos cambios. Ya te los digo. Min 70 El público ovaciona a Lozano que se va de la cancha por el Tecatito Corona, que entra con ... teñido de rubio. Amarilla para el recién ingresado Lee. Así festejo Hernández. Min 67 Después de un par de jugadas decepcionantes del Chucky, logró jugar bien el pase al Chícharo. La jugada empezó desde atrás con un quite de Herrera. Entra Rafa Márquez por Guardado a contraer el mediocampo. No podría haber llegado en mejor momento ese cambio para el Tri. Min 65 Se vienen dos cambios. Va a entrar Rafa Marquez. En Corea sale Ju Se-jong por el 10 Lee Seung-woo. Lee Yong salió pintado de amarillo por pisarle el tobillo izquierdo para Lozano. Entró un saludo desde San Antonio Sam López dice – Muchas velas santas se están quemando en los altares. Espero que Carlos V, Chicharito, y los otros muchachos también están encendidos. ¡Viva México! Min 60 Se hizo de ida y vuelta el partido. Lozano quiere el gol pero se queda en el amague, pero no esta fino. UUUUUUUU - Evitó el 2 a cero el joven Cho. Sacó una zurda de Guardado envenenada que entraba al ángulo por arriba. UUUUU – Min 53 Mano de Salcedo que no va al VAR. Le pega en la mano el disparo de Moon. Se juega de la esquina y la maneja tranquilamente memo Min 51 Otra jugada de Vela con Lozano que la manda por arriba del travesaño. Ya perdió el pudor el Chuky, pero le falta concentración. Min 50 Corea empezó con la pelota pero no pudo mantener el ritmo. La lleva México con Layún. El técnico coreano ya esta hablando con un suplente, según Andrés Cantor. Y tiene razón el profe. Corea va a tener que arriesgar más para ganar. Así reaccionaron los hinchas Coreanos en Seoul al gol de Vela. Se viene ... se viene. Ya empieza el segundo tiempo pero guarden este artículo de nuestra serie. En Alaska donde casi la mitad de los 40,000 latinos son mexicanos, el aliento se oye. (En Inglés) Sus equipos se enfrentan pero ellos lo viven juntos. Analísis Estamos viendo lo esperado. El Tri haciéndose dueño de la pelota y lo Tigres atrás defendiendo las bandas. El combo de Vela y Chucky tiene preocupada a linea defensiva. El problema esta en la previsibilidad del juego por las bandas. Para mí debería avanzar un poco más Guardado porque al Hernández le esta costando jugar de espalda. Yá sabíamos que la zurda de Son era la potencia Coreana. Yá le gano una vez a Gallardo en el pique. Si no se cuida México en jugar con los centrales tan avanzados, van a terminar con uno en la canasta. Termina el tiempo con un tiro libre de Layún. Moon Seon-min vá tirando patadas. Para que se entretengan en el entretiempo, Aquí les dejo una mas del maestro Raúl Vilchis (@elvilchisolalde) donde nos cuenta del efecto político que puede tener una victoria mundialista del Tri. No me extrañen tanto. Min 43 Excelente encarando entre trés el Chuky Lozano. La lleva pegada a su zurda, corta para adentro pero termina la acción con un tiro pasadísimo. Ahora a ver si Corea termina la mitad con algo mas que angustia. Min 42 En el último tramo del primer tiempo se ve perdida la selección Coreana. A Son lo tiene jugando cómo Ronaldo, picando de punta, a ver si hace magia. Ya van 9 infracciones de Corea y 3 de México. Min 39 Otra larga desde atrás para Son, que lo mató en el pique a Héctor Moreno. Ochoa la saca en la última linea. Min 36 Se lo ve muy solo a Son. Lo encuentra a Ki Sung-yueng, pero no pueden connectar más de 4 pases. Se nota el desgaste del equipo Coreano. México los esta logrando mover para abrir espacios. Gran partido de Carlos Vela hasta ahora, aunque a Andrés Cantor le parezca que se queda en lo físico. Para los bilingües que se aburrieron de mi, acá les dejo el análisis de mis colegas ingleses de todos los equipos y jugadores del torneo. Ellos eligieron al Chicharito cómo el jugador clave del Tri. Min 32 Quedó tendido Lee Yong y frena el juego. El Tri la mueve del medio para atrás. Juega Guardado con Memo y la juega con Moreno. Y así por las bandas con Layún. Paran todos a tomar agua. Min 31 Se acomodó Son un tiro libre afuera del area pero la mando al estacionamieno. El gríto de Vela UUUUUUU -- SE LA PERDIÓ LAYÚN. Se metió en el area solo Vela, el hombre del momento, se la dejo dormida al 7 que la mando por arriba. De penal, abre el marcador Carlos Vela de zurda Min 24 Penal para México - Jung defiende con las manos en alto y el arbitro pita. OUUUUU -- ¡La saca Ochoa! el tiro De esquina termina por arriba del area. Min 22 ¡Les dije! Quedó solo adelante contra dos Son, recorta con la zurda pero la paró con el cuerpo el central. Faitelson sigue haciendo la contra … Min 19 México es local. Se escuchan los oles. Están llegando al area de Cho Hyun-woo, pero Moon Seon-min lo tiene controlado a Hernández. Min 15 Los de Osorio juegan cómo lo hizo Alemania, con los laterales adelantados. Ojo con la contra. Otro Tiro de esquina para México. La pelota queda muerta en las manos de Cho Hyun-woo. Lozano defiende la banda entera. Min 13 Del otro lado, quedo tendido el Chucky Lozano que se tiró con todo el cuerpo a defender. Con un toque más ... OUUUUUU -- Min 12 Llega la primera clara del Tri. Hernández gana en el aire pero el cabezaso se le va desviado. Min 10 Ya van dos tiros de esquina para México. Que no nos extrañe que no puedan ganarle en el aire a Corea como lo hizo con facilidad Suecia. Andrés Cantor habla de la temperatura en la cancha. ¿Alguno se imaginaba 35 grados centígrado en Rusia? Min 7 Cómo pensábamos, México elige sostener la pelota y meterse en el area de Corea. El Tri un tiro de esquina, que termino en una contra Coreana que cortó Lozano ... que quedó jugando como lateral. Min 5 Está compacto el equip Coreano, según Andrés Canto. Estoy de acuerdo. Pero ya cometieron 3 infracciones. México esta mas tranquilo. Un centro del Layún del lado izquierdo de afuera del area, no terminó en nada. La despejó el central Coreano. México vuelve con la pelota. Min 2 Despues de un primer minuto despelotado de Corea, México maneja la pelota con calma. Y el Chuky se ganó una patada al tobillo. !Y YA RUEDA El BALÓN! Ok ... solo faltan 3 minutos. Tranquilos, le dice Javier a los 35.000 mexicanos presentes en Rostov del Don. Desde adentro de la cancha ... Curiosidades Coreanas Si creían que iba a contarles de los Cafés llenos de gatos tiernos en Seoul se equivocaron, mal! Esto es un liveblog serio. Fútbol y solamente fútbol. Pero si existen y si podes tomarte un té de macha y acariciar a cuatro gatos al mismo tiempo. Si eso buscaban, a lo mejor les guste más este video de 15 minutos que mi liveblog. Perdónenme por decepcionarlos. Ok volviendo al fútbol … Si Corea llega a peder este partido, al delantero Son Heung-Min, una clave de la selección Coreana y súper suplente de Tottenham Hotspur, le quedaría solamente una oportunidad para salvarse del servicio militar (En Inglés). Desde 1957, en Corea el es obligatorio para todos los hombres entrenarse con las fuerzas armadas por dos años, una repercusión de la incógnita de sus vecinos al norte. La mayoría lo hacen entre los 18 y 22 años, pero Son, estaba ocupado rompiéndola en la Bundesliga con el Bayern Leverkusen. La única manera de que el gobierno perdone a un futbolista es que gane alguna medalla. Si no ganan los próximos dos partidos, tendrá que llevarse el oro en los Asian Games en Indonesia en Agosto. En 2012, Park Chu-young, que había firmado un contrato con el Arsenal, anunció que pensaba posponer su servicio militar por 10 años. Sus abogados encontraran una laguna en la ley creada por su residencia de tres años en Francia como jugador de Mónaco. Estallo polémica en Corea y tal fue la protesta que Park regresó a casa a disculparse. Ademas de poner su carera futbolista en pausa, significa cortarse el pelo y vivir con menos de $100 al mes por los dos años. Tendrá Son un plan secreto a lo Park? Para que calmen los nervios antes del partido les dejo un articulo por Raúl Vilchis (@elvilchisolalde) que nos suma contexto, explicando como el Tri impacta la vida diaria mexicana. Es de nuestra serie, México: el equipo de Norteamérica. No juzguen! Todos los blogs se dan el gusto de autopublicidad. Análisis del partido Ya lo vieron, ya lo escucharon – “Imaginemonos cosas chingonas,” le implora el Chicharito Hernández al periodista mexicano, David Faitelson en un video que se viralizó en las redes esta semana. Hoy es el lema de todos los hinchas del Tri. El Economista y HuffPo.mx publicaron artículos haciendo eco al sentimiento del delantero. ¿Quedara para la historia el canto de ’¡Si se puede!’? Quizás la soberbia argentina me ciega y me olvido de pensar con un poco de humildad, pero a mí siempre me pareció que esa frase mostraba que los mexicanos dudaban de si mismos. La del Chícharo, vas más allá de lo posible, y nos pide que dejemos el escepticismo de lado. La entrevista fue antes del inicio del torneo. Si hubiéramos prestado mejor atención y sabido que el Tri entraba con esa actitud, le hubiéramos tenido más fé antes del partido contra Alemania. Yo mismo me los imaginaba reculando y esperando con los 11 abajo. Me dejaron en ridículo. Salieron jugando de igual a igual a una velocidad furiosa. Hoy es el día para convencer a todos. Para que hasta Faitelson deje la mala saña y se imagine a su selección jugarse un puesto en la semi-final del mundial. Estoy de acuerdo con Kevin Baxter del LA Times, que dice tiene que la selección debe olvidarse de la gloria del último partido y volver al planeta tierra porque Corea viene con todo. Sin duda el profe Juan Carlos Osorio hizo el plan y les dejo un nuevo esquema a sus jugadores. ¿Podrán hacer bien la tarea esta tarde? Corea confía en la combinación de sus jugadores en el tercio delantero en un probable 4-4-2. Aunque no tengan delanteros de calidad mundial, sus centrocampistas ofensivos y extremos llegaron al torneo en buena forma. Hablo de Son Heung-min (Tottenham), Kwon Chang-hoon (Dijon), Lee Jae-sung (Jeonbuk) y Hwang Hee-chan (Red Bull Salsburgo). Ahí se encuentra el peligro con los Tigres. Si México opta por jugar tocando, manteniendo la posesión y con linea alta, la dupla de Andrés Guardado y el Zorillo Herrera tendrán que marcar fuerte a este hombre en el medio, y sus pases filtrados a ‘Sonny’, como le dicen los fieles del norte de Londres. Sí no, les va a pasar lo mismo que le paso a Alemania. Un gol de contraataque puede sentenciar todo. Para Corea es una final, y Son mas que nadie, se ve obligado a ganar.

Or perhaps it’s just that hope hasn’t been drained out of migrant families? Yet. Schools in deprived areas with a high intake of white, working-class children tend to receive poor Ofsted assessments, while those with a high proportion of migrant children fare significantly better. Amanda Spielman, the chief inspector of schools in England, puts this down in part to white, working-class communities suffering the “full brunt of economic dislocation in recent years and, as a result, can lack the aspiration and drive seen in many migrant communities”. Which sounds about right, except that nothing about this seems recent. The very problem is that it’s ingrained. It seems farcical to pit poor “indigenous” kids against poor migrant kids (they’d have plenty in common – poverty, for one thing). It also barely needs stating that most migrant children would be dealing with many challenges that make their achievements all the more impressive. However, there’s one factor that migrant children might not have to contend with – the generation above them (maybe even two or three generations) being systemically ground down by entrenched lack of opportunity and the prevailing atmosphere of demotivation that this generates. This could produce two markedly different environments in otherwise economically similar homes. The migrant family (still full of hope about opportunities in Britain) sends the child off to school with the incentivising message: “Work hard, and you’ll get somewhere.” Then there’s the other family, the end product of generations that have seen industry collapse, communities devastated, higher education monetised, apprenticeships disappear. Where are they supposed to find the will or the energy to say to their children: “Work hard and you’ll get somewhere”? Could they be blamed for thinking that it’s a lie? With this in mind, it’s a miracle that so many disadvantaged families continue to encourage and support their children at school. If some don’t, the reason seems to be rather more complex than “poor Britons don’t give a toss about their kids’ schooling”, when the vast majority do. Far from being uncaring and indifferent, these parents, like their parents before them, could simply be exhausted and demotivated, not to mention ashamed and embarrassed. After all, these are communities that have been practically gaslit by a society that, for all the glaring inequality, has the gall to tell them that it’s all their own fault they didn’t get anywhere. The result is a deeply embedded hopelessness that migrant families, for all their other challenges, have yet to experience or, indeed, pass on as a toxic inter-generational inheritance. Put bluntly, it could be that deep-rooted despair and cynicism about life chances in the UK hasn’t managed to kick the spirit out of migrants yet. Well done to migrant children for doing well at school; let’s hope that it isn’t bred out of them. You’re right, Barry Manilow, we did know and it made us love you all the more Is the semi-closeted gay man a thing of the past? Barry Manilow has said that, even though he didn’t officially come out for years, “everyone knew”. (The news “broke” with his wedding to Garry Kief in 2015). I know a bit about Bazzer, perhaps a bit too much (my mother was president of the Rutland branch of the Barry Manilow Fan Club. True). He was the living embodiment of the semi-closeted gay man. Not out of the closet, but not fully in either; even the delirious, knicker-throwing, Copacabana-ing housewives at his concerts would probably have been shocked had the “Manilove” (that dared not speak its name) turned out to be straight. What Manilow doesn’t say is how for years he tried to keep the gay issue away from his “brand”. But was this so surprising, considering the era when he started out? Manilow would have been terrified of alienating straight fans, but also criticised for not being properly out. It’s great that, these days, Manilow gets to live openly. For others, the semi-closeted syndrome probably isn’t completely over, even in the supposedly enlightened west. However, not coming out in the past wasn’t a failure, rather a tragic part of social history. Melania Trump, if you want to send out a message, just leave him The jury is still out on the meaning of Melania Trump’s “I really don’t care, do u?” jacket. Was it just a crass fashion choice (from an experienced model who knows the power of clothing) or more than that? While President Trump claimed that it was Melania’s comment on fake news, this seems the least likely theory of the bunch. Certainly, it would be interesting if Melania was rebelling – against her husband, against his “tender age” policy of separating migrant children from their parents, against his whole regime. It would be wonderful if images of Flotus (the first lady of the United States) in a cheap Zara jacket managed to discredit the Trump administration more than millions of outraged liberal tweets. However, even if Melania were rebelling, are such stunts enough? Granted, she managed to get the world’s attention. (Where media coverage is concerned, Melania seems to be finally realising that trying to ride the tiger is more dignified than clinging on desperately.) However, some of this global attention must alight on the fact that, mutinying or not, she’s still Mrs Trump. Even the culpable Ivanka has no choice about being his daughter. Melania willingly remains Trump’s wife, when she could be something so much better – his ex-wife. I’ve always felt that it was sexist nonsense to suggest there should be any more onus on Trump’s womenfolk to calm and humanise the White House Greystoke than on, say, those lion-shooting, putty-faced sons of his. It’s unfair to blame Melania for what Trump does – only Trump is responsible for what Trump does – but Melania does need to answer for Melania. And, right now, Melania remains with a man who thought nothing of separating distressed children from their parents and placing them in cages. Even if the slogan was Melania’s way of rebelling, a jacket is not enough. • Barbara Ellen is an Observer columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/23/uk-hides-arms-trade-saudi-arabia--yemen","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-23T14:47:35Z","webTitle":"UK ‘hides extent of arms sales to Saudi Arabia’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/23/uk-hides-arms-trade-saudi-arabia--yemen","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/23/uk-hides-arms-trade-saudi-arabia--yemen","fields":{"headline":"UK ‘hides extent of arms sales to Saudi Arabia’","bodyText":"Hundreds of millions of pounds worth of British-made missiles and bombs have been sold to Saudi Arabia for use in Yemen under an opaque licensing system that makes tracking arms sales more difficult. The disclosure has prompted accusations that the government is trying to mask the true extent of British-made arms exports to Saudi, a claim denied by the Department for International Trade. Britain’s role in selling weapons to the Saudis is attracting controversy amid the kingdom’s operations in Yemen, where thousands of people have died and millions have been displaced in a proxy war. Human rights groups allege that the Saudi-led coalition backing the country’s government has been targeting civilian infrastructure and buildings, something that would constitute a war crime. Iran-backed Houthi rebels fighting the Saudi-led coalition have also been accused of committing war crimes against civilians in the key port city of Hodeidah, now the scene of heavy fighting and where there are fears of an unprecedented humanitarian crisis. Britain has consistently said that it keeps all arms exports under close scrutiny and that licensing is made on a case-by-case basis. But now a freedom of information request reveals that for the last five years, Britain has been selling Storm Shadow and Brimstone air-to-surface missiles and Paveway IV bombs to the Saudis under what are known as Open Individual Export Licences (OIELs), which the government says are for the export of “less sensitive goods”. Unlike specific licences, OIELs allow an unlimited number of consignments over a fixed period, typically between three and five years. There is no obligation to publish the total value of the licence after it expires. “Open licences remove the need for the seller to obtain prior approval for each export,” said Andrew Smith of Campaign Against Arms Trade, which submitted the FOI. “It’s an opaque system which has been used to shift extremely sensitive weaponry to the Saudi regime.” The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, which uses open sources to measure the quantities of arms exported each year, estimates that, since 2013, around 100 British-made Storm Shadow missiles worth £80m, 2,400 Paveway IV bombs worth £150m, and 1,000 Brimstone missiles worth £100m have been sold to Saudi Arabia. “Open licences issued in the years before Saudi Arabia intervened in Yemen’s civil war are still being used for the export of hundreds of millions of pounds of bombs today. If it were not for this Observer report neither parliament nor the committee tasked with scrutinising arms exports, on which I sit, would have any idea that these weapons are being sent,” said Labour MP Lloyd Russell-Moyle, who sits on the Commons committee on arms export controls. In 2015, the process for issuing OIELs was updated, with a view to encouraging their greater use. The committee strongly criticised the move, claiming it would “inescapably reduce the transparency” of Britain’s arms exports. But the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, which at the time was responsible for the Export Control Organisation, the agency that oversees the sale of military exports,insisted that the policy applied to the export of “less sensitive goods to less sensitive destinations.” The government has confirmed that all three weapon systems have been used in Yemen, where Human Rights Watch has linked British-licensed Paveway IV bombs to attacks on civilian targets. In December 2016, Sky News examined an attack site where part of a Storm Shadow missile with UK markings was found. The government insists that it operates one of the most robust arms export control regimes in the world with all export licence applications assessed on a case-by-case basis against the Consolidated EU and National Arms Export Licensing Criteria. But this claim was challenged by the arms trade campaigner, Smith. “By the government’s own admission it is trying to encourage more companies to use this type of licence,” he said. “If permission is not needed before a specific export of missiles or bombs takes place, then how can it claim to operate a case-by-case system?” A Department for International Trade spokesperson said claims that OIELs allowed Britain to export arms without close scrutiny were “completely untrue”. “The export of Paveway IV bombs, Storm Shadow missiles and Brimstone air to surface missiles are made under a longstanding government-to-government defence cooperation programme between the UK and Saudi Arabia,” the spokesman explained. “OIELs are not a simple or quick option for exporters and the application process can take several months. Terms and conditions for use will vary depending on the goods and export destinations. Holders of OIELs are subject to audit by DIT compliance inspectors.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/24/world-cup-team-so-far-cristiano-ronaldo","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-24T06:30:19Z","webTitle":"Group stage XI: Ronaldo?

No question. The team of the World Cup so far","bodyText":"Alireza Beiranvand, Iran goalkeeper Standing at 1.93 metres (6ft 4in) Beiranvand commands his box well while showing the reflexes and strong hands to make improbable saves, such as the one that denied Hakim Ziyech against Morocco or the double-stop from a Sergio Busquets shot against Spain. The only time the ball has beaten him was not from a shot, but a ricochet off Diego Costa. Group stage performance rating 8 Moussa Wagué, Senegal right-back Left-back was a problem position for Senegal before the tournament but their manager, Aliou Cissé, solved the puzzle against Poland by moving the erstwhile right-back, Youssouf Sabaly, to the left and entrusting their right-back slot to Wagué, an inexperienced 19-year-old. The teenager justified that decision with an immaculate performance, helping his country to a famous win. Rating 6 Manuel Akanji, Switzerland centre-half A powerful and composed bulwark in the heart of Switzerland’s defence, the 22-year-old ensured Gabriel Jesus barely featured when the Swiss held Brazil. Aleksandar Mitrovic did his utmost to avoid him when the Swiss played Serbia: the striker bullied Switzerland’s other centre-back, Fabian Schär, but came off second best whenever Akanji was close to him. Rating 7 Maya Yoshida, Japan centre-half Outstanding in the win over Colombia, who were reduced to 10 men but still exerted plenty of pressure, which Yoshida helped to repel, negating any aerial threat from the South Americans. He was also a menace when he went forward for set pieces. An honourable mention must also go to Croatia’s Dejan Lovren. Rating 7 Jesús Gallardo, Mexico left-back Mexico’s lightning counter-attacks against Germany were joyous to behold and Gallardo was often involved, combining slickly down the left with the goalscorer, Hirving Lozano. His attacking potency does not come at the expense of defensive stability. Rating 7 Héctor Herrera, Mexico midfielder Herrera called the shots in the win over Germany. An all-rounder, he was the conduit of attacks thanks to his precise passing and also the leader in defence, making more tackles than anyone against the defending champions, combining the roles well by setting up the goal after hustling the ball from Sami Khedira. Rating 7 Ivan Rakitic, Croatia midfielder An artful and industrious linchpin for Croatia, he deservedly rounded off the scoring during the dismantling of Argentina, having previously starred in the win over Nigeria. His determination, imagination and technique help make his side solid while enabling their attacks to flow. Rating 9 Nordin Amrabat, Morocco midfielder The Watford player should not have featured against Portugal after being knocked out in a collision while playing at right-back during the narrow defeat to Iran. But he started, all the same, even throwing away his protective head wear as if it was holding him back, and showed his versatility – not to mention his strength and skill – by excelling in a more attacking role when moved further forward, tormenting the left‑back, Raphaël Guerreiro, from start to finish. Rating 7 Luka Modric, Croatia midfielder His precise and nimble scheming is perhaps Croatia’s greatest weapon, a key part of what makes them genuine contenders. His goal against Argentina, following a penalty in the win over Nigeria, was one of the best of the tournament so far. Rating 9 Aleksandr Golovin, Russia midfielder A month after his 22nd birthday the elegant midfielder has been confirmed as a national treasure in Russia, his creative skills being instrumental to the hosts’ early surprise successes at this tournament. He has made things happen around him without ever being predictable and played at a level that suggests he will be moving on shortly from CSKA Moscow. Rating 8 Cristiano Ronaldo, Portugal forward His hat-trick against Spain had an element of luck but, then again, is it really a coincidence that the normally flawless David de Gea made an uncharacteristic mistake while attempting to save a shot from Ronaldo? Or that Morocco’s usually tight defence disintegrated when Ronaldo dived in for the winning goal. He makes his own luck and, at 34, still sets the standard for all others.

Hayley Hughes, from Liverpool, has achieved fame and notoriety beyond the show’s traditional audience for not knowing what Brexit means, before asking on the reality TV series whether it will lead to fewer trees in the UK. But her appearance on Daily Politics had more to do with the fact that, for those in Westminster not preoccupied with the World Cup, a not insignificant proportion of the political class is obsessed with another summer knockout tournament: the grafting, coupling up and mugging off of a group of suntanned under-30s in a villa in Mallorca. This obsession is not confined to Westminster: this year’s Love Island is bringing in record audiences for ITV2. Its opening programme was watched by a peak of 3.4 million viewers, surpassing the audience for last year’s final by a million and making it the highest-ever for the channel. It is becoming such a hit that people are starting to look for hidden meanings behind its popularity. Love Island has turned into a Rorschach test, revealing to the viewer what they want to see, only maybe with a splodge of Fake Bake fake tan instead of an inkblot. Sir Michael Wilshaw, the former head of Ofsted, sees the Bafta-winning series as an “appalling” indictment of England’s education system. He may have been talking about Hughes’s comments about Brexit, although who can blame her for not really knowing what’s going on when the negotiations have been so tortuous? He may have watched long enough to hear Hughes confuse the concept of a city, county and country, and wonder whether Spain is part of the UK. Or perhaps he couldn’t follow what Dani, the daughter of actor Danny Dyer, meant when she said: “He mugged you off but you mugged him off harder.” But then Sir Michael would also have to admit he knows Alex is an A&amp;E doctor and Zara is a policy adviser at the Department for Education. For feminist MPs such as Jess Phillips, Lucy Powell and Stella Creasy, some of Love Island’s biggest fans in Westminster, there are plenty of moments of female empowerment, most notably when Adam, the villa love rat, is called out twice by his partner Rosie for his philandering. It was after the second of these confrontations, when Adam smirked at Rosie for getting upset and blamed her for his bad behaviour, that Women’s Aid issued a statement highlighting emotionally abusive behaviour and gaslighting. Rosie’s parting shot to Adam – “Enjoy the next bombshell that walks in because this one’s done” – won her an army of female fans. Adam’s bad behaviour was uncomfortable to watch yet this was not, as some have suggested, the producers normalising emotional abuse, but, rather, them exposing it. Everyone, including Rosie, could see what it was. For the audience, Adam is the No 1 hate figure who will be voted out at the next opportunity. No one can possibly claim that Love Island holds a mirror up to our society, unless that society is largely white, heterosexual and does two hours in the gym every morning with 36kg kettlebells. If it is anything, it is the walking, talking version of the Instagram influencer class. There are problems with a format that hothouses sexual attraction, often at the expense of real people’s feelings. While the islanders have devoted many hours to finding Alex a woman to couple up with, nobody in the villa seemed to care that Samira, the only black woman on the show, was also without a romantic partner – until she was chosen by newcomer Sam. One of the contestants, Niall, had to leave the show for personal reasons within days of arriving in the villa. There are psychologists, as well as first aiders, on standby. But we shouldn’t overanalyse Love Island as an excuse to watch it. Maybe the inkblot is just an inkblot. Anyone can pretend to be only interested in watching Inspector Montalbano on BBC Four. It’s harder to openly admit that the highlight of your evening is someone sitting up from their sunlounger to declare: “I’ve got a text!” or to wonder why Dani dries her eyelashes with a hairdryer. Maybe it is best to treat Love Island like a holiday romance: don’t take it too seriously, just enjoy it while it lasts."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/23/steve-hiltons-silence-speaks-volumes-about-hollow-men-on-the-right","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-23T20:15:32Z","webTitle":"Steve Hilton’s silence speaks volumes about the hollow men of the right | Nick Cohen","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/23/steve-hiltons-silence-speaks-volumes-about-hollow-men-on-the-right","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/23/steve-hiltons-silence-speaks-volumes-about-hollow-men-on-the-right","fields":{"headline":"Steve Hilton’s silence speaks volumes about the hollow men of the right","bodyText":"TS Eliot didn’t get it quite right. The world doesn’t end with a whimper but a giggle, which reveals that cruelty and lies can pass unchallenged. What was once outrageous is now just a joke at the expense of humourless moralists who don’t understand how obsolete their scruples have become. The laughter comes loudest from the “left behind”. Not the working class, but the left-behind elite who attach themselves to far rightwing (and on occasion far leftwing) movements because they boil with resentment that they no longer have or were never offered the status they took to be their entitlement. Donald Trump, Rupert Murdoch and, to an extent, Boris Johnson are examples that walk among us. As are so many rightwing “contrarian” journalists who show their independence of mind by never contradicting their readers’ prejudices. The origins of their bitterness are wholly obscure to outsiders: how can Murdoch, for example, believe a British establishment that fell at his feet has “slighted him”? But the psychic wounds are real enough in their minds and allow them, however deceitfully, to connect with the humiliations of their base. If today’s radical rightwing movements are filled with sore losers – nervous members of the left-behind white working and middle classes, who see immigration destroying their culture and economic stagnation destroying their security – they are led by sore winners. Unlike the 20th-century fascist movements, the leaders of the “alt-right” were either born to wealth, as Trump, Murdoch and Johnson were, or, like Hungary’s Viktor Orbán and Putin, have been in power so long they have nothing to feel insecure about. Their privilege ensures that laughter in the form of the sneer of the victor and the snigger of the abuser comes naturally. If you’re from the old world, nothing could be less funny than the overmighty state tearing immigrant children from their parents and locking them in cages. The imprisonments were not a bureaucratic error but the result of a deliberate act by the Trump administration to create a “hostile environment”, as British conservatives would put it. Migrants would not think of coming to America if they knew that child snatchers would circle their kids. Such premeditated inhumanity demands honest reporting so that everyone, especially its supporters, understands the moral consequences. If you want to see the authentic mentality of fascism old and new, watch the clip of Trump ideologue Ann Coulter asserting on Murdoch’s Fox News that the stolen toddlers sobbing “Daddy! Daddy!” were “child actors”. Lies bind a political or religious tribe together. Fox News viewers and perhaps Coulter herself might know what she is saying is not true. By acting as if they believe outrageous falsehoods, they announce they are so dedicated to the conservative cause they will believe anything its propagandists produce and so determined to insult Latinos they will endorse any lie told about them. The reaction of Fox’s host was more telling than standard self-deceit. Steve Hilton, a privately educated Englishman, considered challenging Coulter. He mumbled a few words as if he were about to protest. But then he pulled himself together and did something as shocking as the oppression Trump had enforced and the calumnies Coulter had advanced: the little creep giggled, made a lame joke, then called for the ad break. Any competent surgeon could locate Hilton’s wound. He was once at the centre of power. He helped draft David Cameron’s modernising conservatism and was all for caring about the environment and using the internet to empower citizens. His thought was largely vacuous: Hilton was against big bureaucracies and in favour of children being free to enjoy “wholesome play” (I haven’t made this up). He was banal, but his was not the banality of evil. His career fell apart in 2012. Cameron lost patience with him and he left Downing Street. The former Tory guru, who was once the centre of attention, had joined the left-behind elite. If he was known, he was known because of his wife, a successful Silicon Valley executive – and not all men are happy with being upstaged by their partners. Once a somebody, Hilton was a nobody. He did what yesterday’s men have always done and jumped on the next big thing, which in the case of rightwing politics was the Trump movement. A job at Fox followed and the nobody was a somebody again. I’ve saved the best for last. Hilton is the child of Hungarian refugees who fled communist oppression and found a safe home in Britain. Now he can do nothing but stretch his mouth into an inane grin when the bureaucracy he once abhorred cages the children of today’s refugees and his fellow conservatives slander its victims as actors. The far right’s laughter recalls Sartre’s comment in 1944 that antisemites amuse themselves and “delight in acting in bad faith”. The calculation that embracing Trump is the smart career move recalls Dorothy Thompson’s warning in her 1941 essay, Who goes Nazi?, to watch out for the man who has risen beyond his real abilities and “whose sole measure of value” is success. If the Nazis were a minority movement, it would not attract him. “As a movement likely to attain power, it would.” Not that Hilton or even Murdoch have found power by attaching themselves to Trump. If Hilton had spoken out, Fox News viewers would have turned on him. I have heard wistful liberal Republicans say if only Murdoch and his sons would tell Fox to drop Trump, American conservatism could crawl out of its sewer. They do not understand how deep the rot has set. If the Murdoch family tried to change course, Fox would lose its audience, as surely as Republican politicians who challenged Trump have lost their seats. The iron law of autocracy is that the strongman rules and his courtiers, however grand, obey. All they can do is to fix a smile on their sagging faces and giggle. • Nick Cohen is an Observer columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/live/2018/jun/24/world-cup-2018-reaction-to-germanys-win-and-england-buildup-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-24T11:04:31Z","webTitle":"Sterling to start for England and reaction to Germany's win: World Cup 2018 – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2018/jun/24/world-cup-2018-reaction-to-germanys-win-and-england-buildup-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2018/jun/24/world-cup-2018-reaction-to-germanys-win-and-england-buildup-live","fields":{"headline":"Sterling to start for England and reaction to Germany's win: World Cup 2018 – as it happened","bodyText":"Those confirmed teams, and the launch of Rob Smyth’s England v Panama live coverage, with the match kicking off at 1pm BST concludes this blog for the day. Thanks for joining us. We’ll be back tomorrow. England team confirmed: Pickford, Walker, Stones, Maguire, Lingard, Henderson, Trippier, Young, Loftus-Cheek, Sterling, Kane. Panama meanwhile: Penedo, Murillo, Roman Torres, Escobar, Davis, Barcenas, Cooper, Gomez, Godoy, Jose Luis Rodriguez, Perez. Tom H emails in on that tiebreaker scenario. God forbid this happens, there will be panic, but Tom might just have cleaned up. “From our understanding: if two or more teams are level on points and have identical records, they are separated using fair play points and beyond that, the drawing of lots. If you look at the tie-breaker rules carefully, before the fair play comes into effect, there are the following three tests: 1. Greatest number of points obtained in the group matches between the teams concerned 2. Goal difference resulting from the group matches between the teams concerned 3. Greater number of goals scored in all group matches between the teams concerned That phrase “between the teams concerned’ is pretty important. What it says is to discount the results against teams NOT concerned. In this case, that’s South Korea. You end up with a table between the three teams (Germany, Sweden, Mexico), all with the same points and the same goal difference….. but in this scenario, Mexico will have scored one less goal against the “other teams concerned” than Sweden or Germany, meaning they will miss out on progression to the next round. However, if the results are at 2-1 instead of 1-0, then it will go to the fairplay situation. I could be wrong on this..... but that’s my read.” Niall Mullen emails in. “Has anyone thought of playing Rashford and Sterling? They are both more dangerous players than Lingard. Alternatively play all 3 with Sterling in the number 10 position. He was pretty good there the times he did it for Liverpool.” My recollection is of Sterling not being much cop in that position four years ago, which is not to say he can’t do it now but Southgate appears to favour twinned attacking midfielders rather than attackers. And isn’t Sterling’s role off the striker - Harry Kane - anyway? Our man Barney Ronay has made his predictions and he’s sticking to them. A question from Argha: “What happens in Group F if Germany beats S.Korea 1-0 and Sweden beat Mexico 1-0? Germany, Sweden and Mexico would then have identical points, goal difference,goals scored and goals conceded.” From our understanding: if two or more teams are level on points and have identical records, they are separated using fair play points and beyond that, the drawing of lots. The first scenario could be bad for Germany after Jerome Boateng’s mystery red card against Sweden while lots drawing bring back memories of the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup. TS Ahmad has emailed in: “Any news on the Argentinian coach’s status? I so want to hear he be sacked before the final game with Nigeria, though that won’t solve the quality midfield that Argentina lacks.” There is much talk of a rebellion in the ranks, with Lionel Messi leading the insurrection against Jorge Sampaoli, and wanting him sacked. However, this appears to have failed. Sacking the coach with a game still to play, and possibly the rest of the tournament would have franked any of the shenanigans that Spain served up on the eve of Russia 2018. And would have been great fun. But TS makes a great point; who can make Enzo Perez a better player? And overnight? Argentina have the chance to be the France 2010 of this tournament and there may be time yet. Familiar problems being blamed for South Korea’s woes. After losing to Mexico on Saturday, and pointless, they must beat Germany to have a chance to make the last 16. Shin Tae-yong might as well be Gareth Southgate or a Scotland manager when saying this. We have systemic problems. We must think how we can improve our domestic league and work with young players. We lack experience and that doesn’t come overnight. Michael Cosgrove emails in. “No player gets to pull on an England shirt without having spent years working hard for it and, for some, being regularly forced to confront and overcome adversity in the form of injuries and a lack of games, and that’s why I’m extremely pleased to see Ruben Loftus-Cheek’s name on today’s team list. As Dominic Fifield’s piece reveals, the lad has had more than his fair share of challenges to overcome, including Mourhino’s lack of faith in him, so I hope he has a great game and goes on to become a regular fixture because if anyone deserves a break for once it’s him.” Michael makes a fair point, and one well made. Loftus-Cheek, like many from Chelsea’s farm of talent, has had a tough ride beyond winning the FA Youth Cup. When being asked about Loftus-Cheek in the build-up to Chelsea’s 2016-17 season (and how did that go?), Mourinho said this: “You need ten minutes. In ten minutes you can show me if you are ready or if you are not ready.” A tough school, and Loftus-Cheek’s ten minutes didn’t work out. He needed a couple of years and some rather more pastoral care. Let’s not forget today’s other games. At 4pm BST, we have Japan v Senegal, a match in which our minute-by-minute coverage comes in both English and Japanese, with, unless there’s been a huge mistake on the rota, Paul Doyle doing the former and Ben Mabley doing the latter. Ben’s MBM on Japan’s first game, their defeat of Colombia has been capturing some local attention in the Asahi Shimbun. Away from plucky England, to France, who are safely into the last 16 with performances that would probably have had UK TV’s Team GB-inspired tub-thumping, chest-beating punditry posse in raptures. The real truth, of course, is that France have been no good so far, and Paul Pogba is getting a bit doomy. It might be my last World Cup. I’m realistic, we don’t know if I’ll be called up, maybe other players will be better than me. I hope I’ll play more. I’ve already had the chance to play two, some can only dream to play one. Good morning, world. And thanks to Scott and Jonathan. Ok, then. This is the time, this is the hour, this is this. Or, actually, what should be an easy win for England or else the chumminess of Camp Repino will descend into rancour far worse than the contents of Steve Holland’s notebook caused. Anyway, that’s your lot from me. I’m passing you into the loving arms of John Brewin. He’s all yours, dear reader. From Cold Blow Lane to Central America. Sid Lowe meets Gary Stempel, the man from Millwall who helped guide the minnows of Panama to World Cup glory. Four years is a long time in football. Just ask Joachim Löw José Pekerman. The Colombia manager was a hero after Brazil 2014 ... now, after a shock opening defeat to Japan, not so much. Carl Worswick tells the sorry tale. New-fangled radio dept. Max Rushden and Barry Glendenning discuss Germany’s Houdini act, John Guidetti’s presence of mind, and Belgium’s five-star performance on the latest edition of World Cup Football Daily. Dejan Lovren is fond of telling it the way he sees it. And the big Croatia defender reckons his teammate Luka Modric should be in the running for the world’s best player of the year award - but he’s likely to miss out because he doesn’t play for one of the traditional international superpowers. “Modric would probably be getting more attention than he is right now if he was a German or Spanish player he would maybe even be a Ballon D’Or winner,” Lovren says. “Because we are a smaller country, he does get less attention than he deserves.” The Serbian FA are on a rolling boil. They’re not happy with referee Felix Brych’s officiating during their dramatic 2-1 loss to Switzerland, and have accordingly whined to Fifa in the official style. We have submitted seven video recordings clearly showing Brych’s tendency to make decisions against our national team. The footage reveals Brych’s double standards in brandishing yellow cards, as he was quick to book our key players while he didn’t do the same in similar situations at the other end. The most glaring poor decision was not awarding Serbia a penalty for a foul on Aleksandar Mitrovic with the score 1-1, and awarding the spot kick could have turned the match our way. The whole world saw the penalty except Brych and it should have gone to VAR analysis. We are wondering why Serbia is the only team in the World Cup where the match official chose to ignore controversial situations at it raises the legitimate question whether the VAR is being used selectively. Two observations: (a) Where’s the dignity? (b) VAR: a modern success story. News at Ten: In case you missed the earlier dispatch from our man in Russia, Dominic Fifield, here’s the big team news ahead of England’s match against Panama this lunchtime. Raheem Sterling is to retain his place in the England lineup for this afternoon’s Group G game against Panama, with Gareth Southgate set to make a solitary change - Ruben Loftus-Cheek for the injured Dele Alli - for the matchin Nizhny Novgorod. While Steve Holland’s training notes, photographed at an open session on Thursday, had appeared to indicate Marcus Rashford might get the nod up front alongside Harry Kane, Sterling will partner the captain against the side ranked 55 in the world. The Manchester City forward is aiming to score his first goal for his country since October 2015, 21 caps ago, as England seek to secure qualification from the section. Ashley Young has again been preferred to Danny Rose at left wing-back, while Loftus-Cheek will make his first World Cup start as Alli continues his rehabilitation from a thigh strain. The Spurs midfielder is hopeful of proving his fitness ahead of Thursday’s final group game against Belgium in Kaliningrad. Paul MacInnes processed Germany’s jaw-dropping feat of escapology last night with a mixture of awe and wonder. Here’s his take on the current state of the still-reigning world champions. There are many questions about this team that remain unanswered. In short, here are a few: the form of Jérôme Boateng, the positions occupied by their full-backs, the wild variations in tempo, the apparent lack of an effective number nine. But all of them seem less significant than the fact that Germany remain Germany and they’re still in the World Cup. Peru striker Jefferson Farfan has been hospitalised after a clash of heads with one of the squad’s goalkeepers in training. The Peruvian FA reports that initial results have been “favourable for the player” but he’ll remain in the hospital for monitoring. Peru are already out after losses to Denmark and France. They still have a match against Australia to come in Sochi. Wilson’s got his chalkboard out. A typically wonderful column, in which tactics guru Jonathan gets to the heart of the goalscoring problem blighting this World Cup. The pattern has been clear for at least three decades and is predictable and natural. The lack of time available to coaches mean that they, naturally, make a priority of defensive structures over attacking ones: while an under-drilled attack can always conjure a goal from nothing, an under-drilled defence will always concede. Besides, defensive principles are relatively universal; much less adaptation is required than for attacks that can vary wildly. Just because. Enjoy. Football fans witnessed the spectacular Scarlet Sails festivities in St Petersburg last night. The tradition celebrates the end of the school year, as a ship with scarlet sails serenely glides towards the Winter Palace. Fans of Brazil, Costa Rica, Argentina and Nigeria lined the banks to enjoy the spectacle, which also included a firework display. I wonder what Lieutenant Commander Tommy Woodrooffe would have made of this? That’s All Right Then dept. And it’s more on world champions Germany cavorting with glee at the end of their dramatic win over Sweden. The Swedes weren’t too happy with the reaction on the German bench at the time, but in typically easy-going Scandinavian style, all is now forgiven. Yay! Sweden substitute Pontus Jansson lost his temper with the Germans, but has now calmed down: “Some of them celebrated in a disrespectful way. There was a lot of feelings, we had just let in a goal and lost the game, so it was pretty sour. Maybe there was unnecessary anger from me, but they apologised afterwards so it’s just a case of accepting it. There were a lot of feelings in the heat of the moment.” Just in case you missed the earlier breaking news ... in scenes that would put John le Carré to shame, our man in Russia, Dominic Fifield, has been peering through binoculars at scraps of paper in order to decode England’s line-up against Panama. And here’s what he’s found out! Raheem Sterling is to retain his place in the England lineup for this afternoon’s Group G game against Panama, with Gareth Southgate set to make a solitary change - Ruben Loftus-Cheek for the injured Dele Alli - for the matchin Nizhny Novgorod. While Steve Holland’s training notes, photographed at an open session on Thursday, had appeared to indicate Marcus Rashford might get the nod up front alongside Harry Kane, Sterling will partner the captain against the side ranked 55 in the world.

The Spurs midfielder is hopeful of proving his fitness ahead of Thursday’s final group game against Belgium in Kaliningrad. Apropos of nothing ... The latest World Cup dispatch from the Observer’s award-winning diarist David Hills. And it’s been a great week for Sepp Blatter, Mo Salah, and ITV’s Sam Matterface. Paul Doyle has cast his expert eye over the World Cup so far, and rustled up an XI to take on all comers. Cristiano Ronaldo, Luka Modric, Moussa Wagué, Nordin Amrabat, Alireza Beiranvand ... this is your moment. While we’re on the subject of Raheem Sterling ... the Manchester City winger, having taken an unreasonable amount of flak from clowns, responded eloquently in the Players’ Tribune recently. Here’s more on the US site, which is better known for its baseball coverage. So Gareth Southgate opts to keep faith with the brilliant Raheem Sterling, instead of replacing him with the brilliant Marcus Rashford. It wasn’t a bad dilemma to have, was it? Here’s Daniel Taylor on the cautious optimism in the England camp. BREAKING NEWS. Here’s how England will be lining up this afternoon against Panama, courtesy of our man Dominic Fifield. Raheem Sterling is to retain his place in the England lineup for this afternoon’s Group G game against Panama, with Gareth Southgate set to make a solitary change - Ruben Loftus-Cheek for the injured Dele Alli - for the matchin Nizhny Novgorod. While Steve Holland’s training notes, photographed at an open session on Thursday, had appeared to indicate Marcus Rashford might get the nod up front alongside Harry Kane, Sterling will partner the captain against the side ranked 55 in the world.

The Spurs midfielder is hopeful of proving his fitness ahead of Thursday’s final group game against Belgium in Kaliningrad. So, good old Germany, eh. But they’re not resting on their laurels. Despite that victory over the Swedes, they’re planning to make some more changes for their final must-win group game over South Korea. “My players were tired at the end of the game and Marco Reus had cramps as early as 10 minutes before the end,” says Joachim Loew. “Jerome Boateng is suspended and Sebastian Rudy broke his nose. We will need a couple of days to recover. Rudy could potentially play on Wednesday but we will need to wait and see. Mats Hummels is likely to play and if he does then we have another option in defence.” Thanks to Jonathan. Swedish fatalism, anyone? Speaking of that cuppa, I can hear the kettle boiling, which must mean Scott Murray is due any second now. As always, thank you for your company and engagement. I’ll see you again here soon. “Morning Jonathan!” Morning David Penney (not the David Penney we established yesterday, but still a David Penney). “Stir-fry this in your mind-wok! Brazil’s success in every World Cup over the past 25 years has been directly proportional to the quality and form of their No. 9 at the time. Discuss.” Over to you dear reader. I’m off for a cup of tea soon, so I’ll leave you lot to figure out if Mr Penney is onto something or not. Allegations of doping continue to bubble beneath the surface of the World Cup. The Mail on Sunday has today published a story suggesting a Fifa cover-up. The Russian team doctor is unperturbed. Have you selected your all-time England XI yet? Viv Anderson has. While the circulation of what may prove to be England’s XI has caused conniptions in some quarters, Panama coach Hernán Darío Gómez doesn’t know what all the fuss is about. It doesn’t give me or afford me any advantage. Each and every coach needs to make sure they’re 100% prepared and ready regardless of the opposition. It doesn’t matter who plays, because if one doesn’t play the other is just as good.” Northern Ireland manager Michael O’Neill believes England will overcome Panama but warns they must be aware of the passion the Central Americans will bring to the contest. They are well organised, they get men behind the ball, but beyond that, they play with a great pride; this is a massive thing for them. When we played, the ground was virtually sold out, there were fireworks before the game, kids on the pitch and all sorts going on. You quickly realised what a big moment this is for them, to be in the World Cup. So they’ll play with a great passion. You saw that in the first half against Belgium. It was obvious from the start that these guys would defend for their lives and it took a bit of brilliance to open that game up. Belgium had huffed and puffed a little bit.” If long-lens cameras are to be believed Ruben Loftus-Cheek is due a World Cup start. Dominic Fifield has filed this lovely profile of a young man who once made an admiring Michael Ballack ask “Who the hell is that kid?” There are concerns England’s cool-climate training base could leave them unprepared for the heatwave facing them in Nizhny Novgorod. As dawn breaks over Blighty, time to turn some attention to England’s clash with Panama later today. Seth Levine wants a right to reply on the VAR debate. “With respect to @cricketingview’s, err, view, the clue to the suitability of the “probable cause” test in American criminal law is in the title. The “clear and obvious error” test makes perfect sense if used for overturning a decision. It makes no sense as a referral test. I’d be quite happy with a “probable cause” type referral system, as the on-field referee would not then run to the screen with the knowledge that the VAR has already deemed there to be a clear and obvious error.” There’s further explanation over @cricketingview’s Twitter page, expanding on their post below. I think we might park VAR for a while. On the subject of wine, the pod described the shorts on Meixco’s away kit as burgundy. There was then a comment that not many kits contain burgundy (Northampton Town highlighted as exception). Which got me thinking about the high-profile clubs with claret in their colours and how claret and burgundy are near-enough the same product (come at me sommeliers!). It struck me as a curio that the minor differences between a pinot noir grape and a cabernet sauvignon grape could have repercussions in the world of football. Mark Pulham has a suggestion that Fifa has so-far avoided engaging with, presumably to ensure the on-field referee remains the sole arbiter of the contest.. “Treat it like cricket appeals - one per side per game. No more histrionics / false claiming (for fear of triggering a lost appeal). No more diving / lying (the other side will appeal). No more howlers. No more suspicion of ref or FIFA bias.” “If the trigger for a VAR referral is a ‘clear and obvious error’,” asks Seth Levine, “why do they bother reverting to the on-field referee at all? That’s not a paradox - it’s just a really poorly defined test. It makes sense for the on-field referee to check if he’s not sure, but every “check” called for by the VAR is, by definition, the result of a clear and obvious error (in the view of the VAR).” Indeed. It remains very much a work in progress. As someone who lived through the A-League trial it was clear the system was still some way off where it needed to be. That said, it has operated far more efficiently in Russia than it has in Australia. Matt Le Tissier can see the upside. Some background to the Xhaka and Shaqiri situation: Meanwhile, the animosity between Switzerland and Serbia rumbles on, with Fifa now getting involved. How’s the round of 16 shaping up after yesterday’s games? Likes this: Belgium’s win may have come at a cost with key players collecting knocks. Although the battle to top Group G is far from the most fierce at Russia 2018 thanks to the wildcard that is Group H. Roberto Martinez was pragmatic about the situation in his post-match press conference. The answer is very clear. If we could have seven days to prepare the game and then have seven days for the next game I would say carry on with the same starting XI. The reality now is that we are qualified, and in a tournament like the World Cup you’re only as good as the 23 players in your squad. There’ll be opportunities to give minutes to other players who deserve them. We need to assess the three injury concerns.” Back to the task in hand, and Belgium’s muscular dismissal of Tunisia, featuring braces from Romelu Lukaku and Eden Hazard. Andrew Benton (see earlier) may have given me a bum steer. That’ll teach me to trust Google Translate as a sub-editing tool. And for the avoidance of controversy, I shall amend the previous post. The combination of results in Group F leaves us with the tantalising prospect of three sides on equal points at the end of the phase. With the final group matches kicking off simultaneously I’m looking forward to a scenario where groups of players are huddled over pieces of paper like cricket captains studying Duckworth-Lewis permutations. Raul Vilchis celebrates Mexico’s tactical versatility after El Tri shifted from a counterattacking to a possession-based strategy between their clashes with Germany and South Korea. As jubilant Mexican fans broke out into renditions of “Cielito Lindo” in the stands, the Mexican players were able to thwart South Korea’s well-ordered defensive line with tactical discipline that drove the action to the sides of the field. The Mexicans knew how to create depth in their plays towards the goal by widening out their placement on the pitch.” In other Group F action Mexico impressed once again as they defeated perhaps the most disappointing side in Russia so far, South Korea. Javier Hernandez bagged his 50th international goal in the process while Hirving Lozano increased the rate of inflation to his transfer fee. Peter Rist has a VAR question. “Something I don’t understand about how VAR is bering used is: when the head VAR guy contacts the on-field ref suggesting he look at something, should the ref automatically check or not? I don’t understand why the German ref in the Swiss/Serbia game did nothing when Mitrovic was Tag-teamed in the penalty area, or when Sweden had a clear penalty shout yesterday, the ref did nothing.” My understanding is once the VAR instructs the on-field ref to review an incident then that is what occurs. In incidents like the ones described above my presumption is the VAR decided there was no clear and obvious error worth the on-field referee’s time reconsidering. Frustrating, I know. Somebody just reminded me of this glorious piece of Toni-related creativity as a counterweight to the Kroos supremacy. Although I’m not sure it qualifies as Tony Wilson was Tony with a y, and I’m not even sure Toni Kroos is an Anthony Kroos (can anyone confirm?). Regardless, I’ll take any excuse to share this marvellous clip. “’Squeaky-bum time’ is apparently ‘krånglig bumtid’ in Swedish. Seems the squeaking continues for these two.” Lovely stuff from Andrew Benton who opens the email floodgates in superb fashion. The pod point out that with just 75 seconds of injury time remaining John Guidetti shoots tamely at Manuel Neuer from a low percentage angle when he could easily have bled more time from the clock by running the ball into the corner. It brought to mind similar fateful incidents. What other brain freezes deserve a place in this hall of shame? Unsurprisingly, Germany’s comeback (only the second of Russia 2018 so far) dominates the latest World Cup Daily. This is worth listening to all the way to the end in order to savour Barry and Max’s haunting duet of the Home &amp; Away theme tune. Do last night’s heroics (not to mention the 2014 World Cup winner’s medal, four Champions League titles, four Club World Cups etc etc) make Toni Kroos the world’s preeminent Toni? Surely he’s knocked Braxton, Basil, and &amp; Guy into a cocked hat. There were handbags after the final whistle at the Fisht Stadium with Sweden’s coaching staff unhappy with their German counterparts. “Some of the group leaders of their team celebrated by running in our direction, rubbing it into our faces by making gestures,” Janne Anderson said. “That really got me annoyed and angry. We had fought it out for 90 minutes and at the end you should shake hands. So I was very angry with that. People behaved in ways that you do not do,” the Sweden manager added. “You should leave your opponents to feel sad. You do not act in the way they did. We reacted very strongly.” Heiliger Strohsack! How close we came to the most ignominious German exit from Russia since Eurovision 2009. Die Mannschaft, seconds from a fateful draw only for Toni Kroos to welly in one of the all-time World Cup winners. After the heart-stopping action of day ten, the passage of time compels us to contemplate day eleven. By close of business we will have digested 32 of the 64 matches scheduled for Russia 2018. The halfway point, if you like, of a tournament that has yet to reveal a decisive hand. Over the next few hours we’re going to look back on yesterday’s action and the wins for Germany, Mexico and Belgium, before turning our attention to England’s expected stroll against Panama and a massive night for Group H, the most open in the draw. There’s also no shortage of news to catch up on, including the aftershocks from Switzerland’s controversial victory over Serbia. As happy as I am to treat this shift as a stream of consciousness, it is much more fun for me and everyone concerned if you bombard me with emails and tweets to break up my ramblings. Send emails to jonathan.howcroft.freelance@guardian.co.uk and tweets to @JPHowcroft. For now though, where else could we begin but that outrageous German escape act? David Hytner had the pleasure of rewriting his match report in a matter of seconds following Kroos’ late scorcher.

The federal agriculture department announced on Friday it had suspended the live export licence of Perth-based Emanuel Exports pending the outcome of a review into the company’s response to a show cause notice, issued as part of a broader investigation into its animal welfare record. The Emanuel Exports director, Nicholas Daws, has said the company will “cooperate fully with the department in its review”. Depending on the outcome of that review, it is likely that the two biggest live sheep exporters in Australia will not be operating over the Middle Eastern summer. Livestock Shipping Services (LSS) announced this week that it had suspended its Australian sheep export business during the high summer — from July to September — because new animal welfare requirements imposed by the federal government following the McCarthy review meant fewer sheep could be exported on each ship, which made the trade uneconomic. The WA Farmers Federation said it supported the investigation into Emanuel but that the cumulative impact of the licence suspension and LSS’s decision would be felt by farmers. Speaking to reporters in Perth on Saturday, McGowan said he supported moves by regulators to enforce high standards of animal welfare in the live export system but emphasised that the licence cancellation was a federal government decision. Asked if he was aware of concerns raised by the farming lobby, McGowan said: “I am, they should make sure that they work to put in place high standards and if they have any concerns take them up with the federal government.” The WA government is also conducting a separate investigation into Emanuel under its own animal welfare laws and this week executed a search warrant to obtain the conditions of its export licence, among other documents. The federal agriculture minister, David Littleproud, has criticised WA’s decision to pursue its investigation while a federal investigation is under way, saying “it would be deeply, deeply disappointing if an active federal investigation was compromised by a political stunt”. The WA agriculture minister, Alannah MacTiernan, has repeatedly said that the state investigation, which began in February, was not a stunt but an attempt to enforce animal welfare standards in the absence of federal government action. She has also consistently maintained that WA has capacity in its sheep meat abattoirs to process animals that would otherwise have been exported. About 600,000 sheep were exported from Australia, primarily WA, from June to September last year. In a statement on Saturday, MacTiernan said she welcomed the suspension of Emanuel’s export licence and that it “vindicates the work we have been doing to find alternative markets to supply during the Middle Eastern high summer.” “It was always going to be unsustainable to allow ships to go to the Middle East in the northern high summer months,” she said. “The federal government’s decision reflects that reality. “We again extend our offer to work cooperatively with the federal government in our respective investigations into animal welfare issues relating to live sheep exports as well as in finding other ways of providing sheep meat to the Middle East”. Emanuel has been subject to public criticism since the release of footage of showing apparent animal welfare violations. The footage was centred around a voyage of the Awassi Express in August 2017, on which 2,400 sheep died. The company has been subject to a number of reportable mortality investigations — mandatory public reviews by the federal department that are conducted on any live export voyage on which more than 2% of sheep died — in the past decade."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/jun/20/wasps-bath-toulouse-leinster-heineken-champions-cup-draw-rugby-union","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-20T16:09:43Z","webTitle":"Wasps, Bath, Toulouse and Leinster in Champions Cup pool of death","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jun/20/wasps-bath-toulouse-leinster-heineken-champions-cup-draw-rugby-union","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jun/20/wasps-bath-toulouse-leinster-heineken-champions-cup-draw-rugby-union","fields":{"headline":"Wasps, Bath, Toulouse and Leinster in Champions Cup pool of death","bodyText":"Leinster, the defending champions, have been drawn against Wasps, Bath and Toulouse in next season’s Heineken Champions Cup in a pool that boasts a collective 11 previous titles. Leinster clinched their fourth European crown in Bilbao in May and have been pitted against Toulouse, also four-times winners, as well as the Premiership duo, who have three titles between them, in Pool One of the rebranded competition. Saracens, who relinquished the trophy last season having won it for the previous two campaigns, have been handed a kinder draw with Glasgow Warriors, Lyon and Cardiff Blues – the current Challenge Cup champions – in Pool Three. Newcastle face a difficult task on their return to Europe’s elite competition with Toulon, the three-times winners, Vern Cotter’s Montpellier and Edinburgh in Pool Five. The Falcons last took part in the 2004-05, when they reached the quarter-finals, but make a timely return in the same season that Newcastle’s St James’ Park hosts the final for the first time. In Pool Two Exeter and Gloucester, another English side making a return to the competition, have been paired together along with the Top 14 champions Castres and Munster. And in Pool Four Leicester have been drawn against last season’s runners-up Racing 92 for the third straight season with the Pro14 duo Ulster and Scarlets joining them. In the Challenge Cup Paddy Jackson will make a swift return to Ireland with Perpignan after the newly promoted French side were drawn in the same pool as Connacht. Jackson signed for Perpignan earlier this month after his contract with Ulster and the Ireland Rugby Football Union was terminated following his acquittal of rape and sexual assault charges in March. Northampton have been handed a difficult-looking draw alongside the French side and three-times Champions Cup runners-up Clermont Auvergne as well as the Dragons and Timisoara Saracens. Bristol have announced the signing of the former Australia captain and flanker George Smith on a six-month deal. Smith, who turns 38 in July, will join the newly promoted side as injury cover from the Queensland Reds for his second spell in the Premiership, having enjoyed a successful 2015-16 season with Wasps. With 111 caps for the Wallabies, Smith brings plenty of experience to Pat Lam’s side and joins Charles Piutau and John Afoa as high-profile arrivals over the summer. Smith’s return to England could also benefit Eddie Jones’s struggling national side. While at Wasps Smith was seconded by Jones – who gave the flanker his first Australia cap – to conduct specialist breakdown coaching sessions prior to the 2016 Six Nations before England went on to claim the grand slam."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"money/2018/jun/23/tommy-poppers-tristan-verran-teaching-performing","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-23T06:00:05Z","webTitle":"‘I don’t need things.

I have two suitcases with everything in’","bodyText":"I lead a very different life now to that of my 20s and 30s, when I used to run bars and club nights and I over-consumed. Sex, parties, drugs, alcohol and cigarettes – you name it, I exhausted it all. I must have spent about £100 a week on cigarettes alone. Everything changed after I was seriously assaulted and ended up in hospital. That was the turning point. I’m not blaming myself, but I would have handled the situation better if I hadn’t been so drunk. After that, I completely changed my life. Now I don’t smoke, do drugs or drink alcohol. The amount of money it has saved is phenomenal – I didn’t realise how much I was spending on my excesses. Now I work as a lecturer and tutor, teaching English and preparing students for exams. I absolutely love my job. I spend half the year in Margate, where I moved to last year, and the other in Asia, teaching in places such as Thailand, Laos and Taiwan. My income varies depending on the contract – some months I might earn £1,000, others £2,000. I am poor, but all these things are relative, and I work with people in Asia who are a lot poorer. I’ve learnt to be frugal. In Margate I live in houseshares, which cost about £400 a month including bills. I cycle to work. Most of my income goes on food – I spend about £40 to £80 a week. I eat a lot, maybe four to five meals a day. I buy fresh fruit and vegetables, and I follow mostly a vegan diet. I’ll eat out twice a week, say brunch or dinner, but it only comes to about £20 as I don’t drink. When I’m working in Asia, the university will usually pay for my flights and accommodation so I’m able to save. I do have about £24,000 of student loans to pay back, which I accumulated as a mature student during my English literature and creative writing degree. I do worry about money – it’s in the back of my mind. Although I always try to have about £500 in savings, I don’t like the fact that I don’t have a pension or my own house. But I don’t wake up thinking about it. Also, because I’m not a big spender and I’m not in debt (other than my student loan), I don’t feel the trappings of that life. Many people get trapped in the idea that to enjoy life, you have to have certain things … a house, a good job, a car, nice clothes. I disassociate myself from all that. I’m single, don’t have a family or my own house. Although that might not sound positive, it has an affirmative impact on the way I see the world. I feel very OK with that – I don’t need things. A very strong part of my philosophy is to lead a minimal life. I have two suitcases with everything in. Songwriting and performing as Tommy Poppers is my love, my passion and my catharsis. I cherish my two ukuleles which I can take everywhere with me. I have patrons and sponsors who help me record my music and pay for music videos, which cost about £1,000 a time. I sometimes perform locally at places such as the Tom Thumb Theatre, and at bars in Asia, but I don’t make money. It’s a zero-sum game. Due to a pre-existing health condition, I’m saving for stem cell treatment. I can’t get it on the NHS, but in Bangkok it’s about £6,000. It might sound depressing, but I’m looking to save money for assisted end of life, which will cost about £4,000 to £6,000. Choosing when you want to die is a personal choice, and it’s liberating. I’m also quite realistic that I don’t have that many working years left, I don’t have a pension, and I don’t think the state pension will exist [in the future]. As for now, I lead an incredibly rich life. I’ve travelled the world, have lots of friends, and I spend a lot of my free time helping out at Margate Pride. Wherever I live in the world I’m always involved in the community and voluntary projects. I’ve learnt that I don’t need a house full of stuff to make me happy. I just need my ukulele and a sailor suit.

Mental health tribunals determine whether people detained under the Mental Health Act stay in hospital or return to the community. Since 2012, over 9,000 people have been discharged as a result of a mental health tribunal. We believe the Tribunal Procedure Committee (TPC) proposals will damage the fairness of tribunals, potentially undermine human rights, and lead to longer detentions. Pre-hearing examinations are valued by tribunal judges and patients alike, as they give detained people an important opportunity to be heard. Abolishing them only serves as another way to cut people out of their own care. Giving tribunals the power to take decisions in more circumstances without an oral hearing will only penalise the most vulnerable people. This could lead to the indefinite detention of older people, people who are severely mentally ill, or people with learning disabilities. The independent review of the Mental Health Act will cover mental health tribunals in its final report this year.

Then one night, in a restaurant on the Black Sea, the discussion turned to England’s plans for the World Cup and changing the entire shape of the side. By that stage, the two men masterminding England’s World Cup campaign were using their time in Russia to look at potential training bases. “We hadn’t qualified, of course, but without taking liberties we were looking at what might be a good place and experiencing the different climates,” Holland recalls of the conversations that led to England employing their current 3–3–2–2 formation. “We spent about four weeks on the road in Russia, the two of us. We went back to watch the under-21s when the England games were on and then came back for the Confederations Cup. We spent a lot of time on a plane but it really gave us the opportunity to speak about what we had learned over the year.” More than anything, the two men started bouncing ideas off one another about moving away from the system their predecessors had used. And this, ultimately, is why England are operating in a newly designed formation with wing‑backs, three central defenders and no orthodox wingers. “When we took over initially I probably don’t need to remind you of the circumstances,” Holland says, taking up the story. “The previous game was Sam [Allardyce] as manager and the qualification game – Slovakia away, playing 10 men – when we got the late [Adam Lallana] goal. The game before that was Iceland in Euro 2016 [under Roy Hodgson]. So Gareth’s first game is: three managers in three games with England, off the back of Iceland and all that still very much in the air. We had two or three days to work and we were in to the qualifiers. “Gareth’s an intelligent guy and recognised early on that it wasn’t a time for revolution. It was a time for making decisions that would get results in the short term, to secure qualification. Roy’s system was 4–3–3. Sam had also used 4–3–3 in his one game, We went from that to 4–2–3–1 with a No 10 rather than a pivot. And the plan, in the short term, was to get a bit more support to the forwards and hope that was good enough to get us through.” England qualified without losing a game. Yet neither Southgate nor his number two was entirely satisfied. Southgate had played in a three‑man England defence under Terry Venables and Glenn Hoddle. Holland had coached at Chelsea when Antonio Conte’s team won the Premier League with three at the back. And that night, dining in Sochi, the decision was made that it would be England’s best chance, too. “We looked at the Terry Venables Euro 96 team, with Steve McManaman and Darren Anderton as wing-backs and Gary Neville in the back three, and the balance of midfield,” Holland says. “We even went back to Bobby Robson, who started with one way of playing in Italia 90 then went to a back three. But rather than it being something he [Southgate] remembered from the past, the process was: what gives us the best chance of not conceding many goals? What gives us the best chance of having more control of the game with the ball? They were the two factors. “We watched the matches in the Confederations Cup – Germany, Portugal, Mexico, Chile, some good teams – and tried to envisage how we would look against that kind of opposition. We made some decisions and one of those was a back three. We felt we would be better, with and without the ball, with a back three. “I spent a year with Antonio when Chelsea won the league with a 3–4–3, with [César] Azpilicueta, a full-back, in a back three, Gary Cahill on the left and David Luiz, as it was then, in the middle. The first time we’d tried it [3-4-3] with England, in the friendly against Germany [in March 2017], we lost the game, but it was a more than reasonable performance. So the next stage was how to get the midfield balance right. We had good forwards and if we played [3–3–2–2] we could get two on the pitch, rather than one. The only criterion, after that, was: ‘Do we have the wing‑backs?’ And the wing‑backs are the least of our problems: we have all sorts of different types of wing‑backs. So it made sense.” The idea is for Kieran Tripper and Ashley Young to act as auxiliary wingers rather than orthodox full-backs, with Jordan Henderson operating as the pivot and the two attacking midfielders to provide support for Harry Kane and Raheem Sterling. That role went to Jesse Lingard and Dele Alli against Tunisia. However, Ruben Loftus‑Cheek is set to play in Sunday’s game against Panama because of Alli’s thigh injury. “The game against Holland in March was the first time you would have seen us play with two offensive ‘No 8s’ rather than a [Jake] Livermore, for example, who’s a good player but more defence‑minded,” Holland says. “Nigeria was the first time we tried Dele there – the balance of him running forward, the positions Jesse was taking up and Raheem dropping short. That created problems for our opponent. So was it vindication? Probably not, because we could see signs it was coming. But what is interesting is in our last four matches, the opposition has changed at half-time to cope with us three times. “Holland changed at half-time and actually changed again in the second half. Nigeria changed at half‑time. And there was a change [from Tunisia] at half-time. That’s usually a good sign, if the opponent is having a problem coping with what we’re trying to do.” The new system is set up to be adventurous, in keeping with the “attack the tournament” motto of the squad here in Repino. But is everyone entirely comfortable with it? Kyle Walker, for one, has said he regards himself as an attacking right-back rather than, as Southgate has been using him, a third centre-half. “I’d look at that differently,” Holland argues. “We’ve watched Manchester City a lot this year and Kyle hasn’t played like he did for Tottenham the previous three years. He hasn’t spent all his time 30 to 40 metres down the touchline. He’s been controlling defensive counterattacks. I’m not sure whether we’re arguing about 20 metres here or there, but we’re not asking him to play behind the [opposition] forward. He’s more or less playing where he has for his club all year and been a champion.” For Holland, these are the moments that vindicate why he became Southgate’s assistant on a full-time basis, leaving Chelsea – a club he describes as “brilliant for me … the most exciting in the world, never a dull moment – not always good, unfortunately”. But he also takes the point that Harry Kane’s teammates cannot always rely on the captain to score the goals. “The team is hitting a good level of performance. It’s making more chances, looking more dangerous and what it isn’t doing is finishing games off. It could have been three or four [against Tunisia] at half-time. So what is that? “If you look at the England team, where are our goals? We’ve been so dependent on Harry … he’s the one player that has the track record at this level that you can bank on. “After that, where are our goals? Dele has goals for Tottenham but hasn’t yet managed to do that consistently [for England]. Raheem has goals [for Manchester City] but hasn’t quite transferred that to international level. Jesse has taken time to get goals for Manchester United. He got into great positions [against Tunisia]. Have we better scoring options in that position? I’m not sure we have. We’re going with the players we think have the potential but they’re young men with not many caps. It might just take a bit of time.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jun/21/iced-coffee-environment-plastic-straws-almond-milk","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-21T15:18:07Z","webTitle":"Iced coffee is ruining the environment  – and your body","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/21/iced-coffee-environment-plastic-straws-almond-milk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/21/iced-coffee-environment-plastic-straws-almond-milk","fields":{"headline":"Iced coffee is ruining the environment  – and your body","bodyText":"It’s iced coffee season – and this year, the coolest accessory to beat the heat and consume your caffeine conscientiously may well be an eco-friendly stainless steel straw. The single-use plastic straw, you’ve probably noticed, has become increasingly socially unacceptable. A number of cities around the world have banned or are considering banning the straws, and more and more companies are starting to phase them out. McDonald’s, for example, announced that it will stop using using plastic straws in its British restaurants next year and Ikea also recently committed to removing all single-use plastic products from its stores and restaurants by 2020. When multinationals like McDonalds turn away from straws, you know the movement has gone mainstream. Perhaps you’re shrugging smugly because you’ve already stocked up on metal or paper straws: good for you! However, I’m afraid you can’t lay your conscience to rest that easily. Here’s an unappetizing breakdown of the other evils lurking in your iced coffee. We recommend instead drinking water from a free-flowing stream with your bare hands, but if you simply must enjoy the perks of summer there are a few things you can do to reduce the harm you’re doing to the environment: Drink your coffee black or try Ripple, a pea-based milk alternative that is more sustainable than most nut milks. Carry a reusable cup and straw – a lot of places will give you discounts if you do. When possible, buy ethically sourced coffee – fairly-traded coffee from companies that pay their taxes.

The group has today put forward a “Charter for Parks”which calls on ministers in England, Wales and Scotland to make it a legal requirement for all parks and green spaces to be maintained and managed to a “good standard.” It also calls on them “to recognise the right of every citizen to have access within walking distance to a good-quality public green space.” Dave Morris, Chair of the National Federation of Parks and Green Spaces, said “time was running out” for the UK’s parks. “Budget cuts to staffing and maintenance are leaving them vulnerable to neglect and deterioration, or even sell offs. Many people think local councils are legally responsible for maintaining local parks and open spaces but unfortunately, unlike waste collection, that’s not the case yet.” He said the charter called on politicians “to take action to ensure these essential and highly-popular public resources are properly funded, managed, maintained, and protected for current and future generations.” He added: “As the voice of the movement of more than 6,000 local Friends of Parks Groups throughout the UK we recognise the immense contribution that these community volunteers are playing. Now it’s time for government to show an equal commitment to act. The public will not forgive political leaders who let the sun set on the UK’s parks.” In 2017 an inquiry into the future of parks by MPs found that they were at a “tipping point”, and in 2016 a separate study from the Heritage Lottery Fund found the UK’s parks risked falling into disrepair and neglect as a result of budget cuts. While 90% of families with children aged under five had used their local park at least once in the past month, the study said, 92% of park managers had had their budgets cut and 95% were facing further reductions. Helen Griffiths, chief executive of Fields in Trust, one of the groups supporting the new charter, said its research proved parks and green spaces “have proven physical and mental health benefits.” “These are valuable places; places where we can all move, breathe, run and play. We need to champion and support these precious spaces by protecting them for people to enjoy in perpetuity. Because once lost, they are lost forever.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development/2018/jun/21/quitting-un-human-rights-council-puts-us-on-wrong-side-of-history-activists","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-21T12:28:36Z","webTitle":"Quitting UN human rights council puts US 'on wrong side of history' – activists","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/jun/21/quitting-un-human-rights-council-puts-us-on-wrong-side-of-history-activists","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2018/jun/21/quitting-un-human-rights-council-puts-us-on-wrong-side-of-history-activists","fields":{"headline":"Quitting UN human rights council puts US 'on wrong side of history' – activists","bodyText":"The Trump administration’s decision to withdraw from the UN human rights council puts the US on the wrong side of history and should be urgently reversed, activists have said. The council needed reform, said campaigners, but remained a vital force for accountability and justice in a “post-rights world”. Washington’s withdrawal, in protest against what it sees as bias and hypocrisy over Israel’s treatment of Palestinians, is the latest US rejection of multilateral engagement after it pulled out of the Paris climate agreement and the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. Jan Egeland, the secretary general of the Norwegian Refugee Council, said that the case for human rights and the rule of international law had “lost two captains”. He said the European Union without the “moral force of the UK” would be weaker following Brexit, and expressed bewilderment over Donald Trump’s policy of separating immigrant children from their parents at the Mexican border, which was reversed on Wednesday following a huge backlash. “The US was supposed to be a moral leader. We’ve lost the captain on this team, of the battle for values,” said Egeland. Citing the 1951 refugee convention, created in response to the millions of Europeans who fled violence during the second world war, Egeland said: “We need to remind ourselves when Europe was full to the brim of our own refugees, we told the world we need the right to asylum. Now we are facing a new sort of crisis and this time other people are knocking on our doors and saying: ‘We need asylum.’” The US has been a leader in terms of refugee quotas, he said, taking in on average 100,000 a year from camps under President Barack Obama. Last September, Trump slashed the cap on admitting refugees to 45,000, far fewer than the average of about 85,000 over the past decade. “The truly moral leaders are Germany – and Sweden of late – and they have experienced populist backlash,” said Egeland. “We need to reassess.” Rights groups including Human Rights Campaign, Care International and Freedom House, said the US pullout from the UN human rights council would “make it more difficult to advance human rights priorities and aid victims of abuse around the world”. Nikki Haley, the US ambassador to the UN, blamed campaigners for contributing to the pullout by playing a “deconstructive role”. In a scathing letter to human rights watchdogs, Haley criticised opposition to US attempts to drive through a general assembly vote on reform last month. “You put yourself on the side of Russia and China, and opposite the United States, on a key human rights issue,” she wrote. “You should know that your efforts to block negotiations and thwart reform were a contributing factor in the US decision to withdraw from the council.” Human rights groups branded as “ridiculous” suggestions that they were trying to undermine reform or work with Russia. Polly Truscott, foreign affairs adviser for Amnesty UK, said it was feared that changes proposed by the US in the general assembly vote would have been subjected to hostile amendments and encountered significant opposition, weakening rather than strengthening the council. Suggestions for reform of the council by rights groups were incremental, she said, and consensus based. “We’ve been working with many member states to improve the human rights council” said Truscott. “Now the US is throwing the baby out with the bathwater.” Salil Shetty, Amnesty International’s secretary general, said: “The US should urgently reverse this decision, which places it squarely on the wrong side of history. It is wilfully choosing to undermine the human rights of all people everywhere, and their struggles for justice.” Christina Bennett, head of humanitarian policy at the Overseas Development Institute, said it was a vital time for the respect of human rights. “I would say from the research we have done, we are not just in a post-rights world but a post-rules era,” said Bennett. “We are seeing flagrant disregard for international humanitarian law. In Yemen, parties in the conflict are denying aid convoys and cutting off aid lifelines. The bombing of hospitals and aid convoys in both Yemen and Syria violates the letter and spirit of the law.” Research on asylum seekers has revealed a “ripple effect” when countries seen as human rights leaders shirk their responsibilities, she said, noting that Kenya, Jordan and Indonesia were among countries that had been hosting refugees for decades, but “were now saying European governments – the architects of the refugee convention – are practising double standards”. Bennett cited Kenya, where the government has threatened to close Dadaab, one of the world’s largest refugee settlements. Kevin Watkins, chief executive of Save the Children UK, said: “There’s a legitimate argument to be made that the UN Human rights council needs reform to shift its focus and depoliticise its treatment of human rights cases. Many people would accept that. “What we have to acknowledge is that the council has produced some profoundly important and impartial reviews of human rights violations around the world, from South Sudan to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Withdrawal is never the best strategy for important reform. This is the moment to defend multilateralism and universalism, not withdraw from it.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jun/20/kakigori-a-sweet-fun-and-obama-approved-shaved-ice-dessert","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-20T16:22:03Z","webTitle":"Kakigōri: a sweet, fun and Obama-approved shaved ice dessert","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/20/kakigori-a-sweet-fun-and-obama-approved-shaved-ice-dessert","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/20/kakigori-a-sweet-fun-and-obama-approved-shaved-ice-dessert","fields":{"headline":"Kakigōri: a sweet, fun and Obama-approved shaved ice dessert","bodyText":"Come summer, the challenge is to find something cold, yet new. Sculpting shaved ice is both job and hobby for Mauricio Faria, the 28-year-old manager of Soho’s Honi Poké. “I like to make little mountains with the ice, to build it up, carve a winding road round the edge and then drizzle mango puree round it.” Faria shows me how, dragging his finger gingerly over a 15cm-high pile of shaved ice in a plastic pot. “It’s like the yellow brick road,” he says. “I can also make Christmas trees.” Honi Poké specialises in poké bowls, a Hawaiian speciality, but has also started selling shaved ice, which is another. The poké attracts a queue round the block most lunchtimes but its kakigōri, the Japanese name for the shaved ice dessert (which originated in Japan), is new. It’s more of a sleeper hit; they sell around 10 a day at the moment, which leaves plenty of time for practice. Faria builds his mini Hepworths three times a day. “It’s all about ratios,” he says. “You want enough puree but you don’t want to drown it, and you don’t want it to melt.” The ice is shaved using a “Hatsuyuki” machine (which means “first snow” in Japanese). A block of ice is placed inside and locked into place; then a handle is pulled and shaved ice falls out from a funnel at the front. You can change the sizing on a micro scale. The ice is then packed into a mound by gloved hands and different purees are added. I try mango and guanabana; elsewhere they add sprinkles or condensed milk. Finished, it looks like a work of art and it has many, many draws. I mainly like its amphibiousness – it’s both ice and dessert, like eating a drink, wet and cold, sweet and fun. Also, if you ever wondered what 44 calories tasted like (I haven’t), then this is it. The sizing is the most crucial thing. Powder hounds, who ski on Okushiga Kogen’s slopes, will note the granular differences. The bigger the shards, the less purchase the puree has on the ice. The challenge is to get as much as you can into the bowl. It’s messy, but it’s catching on: another London Japanese restaurant, Sosharu, sells a version that comes with sweetened red beans. It is thought shaved ice arrived on the Hawaiian islands in the 1800s, via sugar plantation workers from Japan. There, it dates back to the royal families of the Heian period. Barack Obama is a big fan. His annual Island Snow shave ice, which he has on holiday in Kailua, has become a paparazzi tradition (apparently, he has it with melon, cherry and lime). And snow cones have been big in the US for decades. Kakigōri is very much shaved ice that is designed for photographing, but it also trolls the fool who tries to shoot it and eat it before it melts. “I like to lose myself in it,” says Faria. “To turn my back to the crowds and just ... It’s like pottery.” He smiles: “We’ve all seen Ghost.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jun/20/donald-trump-pledges-to-end-family-separations-by-executive-order","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-20T19:29:30Z","webTitle":"Donald Trump signs executive order to end family separations","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/20/donald-trump-pledges-to-end-family-separations-by-executive-order","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jun/20/donald-trump-pledges-to-end-family-separations-by-executive-order","fields":{"headline":"Donald Trump signs executive order to end family separations","bodyText":"Donald Trump on Wednesday signed an executive order to “keep families together” amid extraordinary public condemnation over his practice of separating children from their parents at the southern border. “I consider it to be a very important executive order,” Trump said during the signing ceremony in the Oval Office, flanked by Vice-President Mike Pence and the homeland security secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen. “It’s about keeping families together while at the same time being sure that we have a very powerful, very strong border, and border security will be equal if not greater than previously.” He added: “I didn’t like the sight or the feeling of families being separated.” However, the text of the executive order makes clear that a hardline approach to immigration enforcement will continue. The order instructs government officials to continue its “zero-tolerance” enforcement policy of criminal prosecution for every immigrant who crosses the border illegally, but says that officials will seek to “maintain family unity” by detaining parents and children together instead of separating them while their legal cases wind through a severely backlogged immigration court system. The language leaves room for exceptions, however, noting that “alien families” would be detained together “where appropriate and consistent with law and available resources”. The president’s action also directs the attorney general, Jeff Sessions, to go to court to ask for a modification to a 1997 court settlement, known as Flores, which currently prohibits the detention of migrant children for more than 20 days. A successful legal battle could see parents held with their children in detention until proceedings have been completed. If the court denies the request, the order will almost certainly face legal challenges from immigration activists who represent families that are detained in the facilities. “They are substituting jailing children with their families for separating children from their parents and that is not any sort of solution to family separation,” said Kate Voigt, an associate director of government relations at the American Immigration Lawyers Association. “The zero tolerance policy remains in effect and that is the root of the family separation crisis created by the Trump administration.” The signing of the order marked a sudden reversal for Trump, who only hours earlier had insisted that the law demanded children be separated from their parents. He claimed that only Congress could resolve that. On Monday, Nielsen told reporters: “Congress and the courts created this problem, and Congress alone can fix it. Until then, we will enforce every law we have on the books to defend the sovereignty and security of the United States.” But as television news channels continued to show distressing images of children in detention and a chorus of Republicans called on the president to act, Trump abruptly changed course. More than 2,300 children have been taken from their parents at the border since the beginning of May. For days, Trump has attempted to deflect responsibility for the policy by inaccurately laying blame on Democrats and demanding Congress act. But top administration officials, including Sessions, and White House chief of staff, John Kelly, have said this policy is necessary to deter migrants from attempting to enter the country illegally. “The dilemma is that if you’re weak, as some people would like you to be, if you’re really, really pathetically weak, the country’s going to be overrun with millions of people,” Trump said. “And if you’re strong, then you don’t have any heart. That’s a tough dilemma. Perhaps I’d rather be strong but that’s a tough dilemma.” At a mass plea hearing in a federal magistrates court in McAllen, Texas, at about the time of Trump’s announcement, 74 migrants, mostly from Central America, sat in a packed-out courtroom. Each was charged with illegal entry misdemeanor, the vast majority never having committed a crime in the US. Before Judge J Scott Hacker, lawyers informed the court that 24 of the defendants were parents who had been separated from their children by US authorities after being apprehended near the border. As most of the men and women were sentenced to time served, Óscar Rox-Flores, a Guatemalan migrant apprehended with his daughter two days ago, spoke before the judge. “In my case I am here with my daughter,” he said. “I want to be deported with her so we can both go home together.” Judge Hacker was able to offer no assurances. “I don’t have an answer that question,” he said. “Hopefully there are procedures in place.” The Trump administration faced withering criticism over photographs, video and recordings of young children crying for their parents as they wait in metal cages at Customs and Border Protection (CBP) processing centers. More than 2,300 children have been separated from their parents under the “zero-tolerance” enforcement policy, a practice critics have called cruel and inhumane. The crackdown subjected all migrants who crossed the border illegally to criminal prosecution. When parents were taken to detention, children were reclassified as “unaccompanied minors” and sent to government-run facilities. Lawmakers on Capitol Hill were deeply shaken by the public backlash, producing near-unanimous agreement that the practice must end. But Congress remains sharply divided on a path forward and, as of Wednesday, had no plan to stop family separations appeared to have enough support to pass. The House speaker, Paul Ryan, said the lower chamber would vote on Thursday on a sweeping immigration bill that the authors say would end family separations by keeping children with their parents in detention. “We don’t think families should be separated, period,” Ryan said at a press conference. “We’ve seen the videos. We’ve heard the audio.” Leaders were trying to rally support for a “compromise” measure that was negotiated by moderate and conservative Republicans. It would provide $25bn for Trump’s border wall and offer a pathway to citizenship for young undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers. But uncertainty remained about the bill’s chances of passage. In the Senate, Republicans are taking a different approach. They are trying to craft a narrowly tailored bill that would only address family separations. Senator Marco Rubio, a Republican from Florida, said an executive order was the “fastest” way to address the situation at the border but argued that legislation was still necessary to codify the change. “It would be ideal if we could back that up by passing a law that does it so there wouldn’t be a court uncertainty,” Rubio said, noting that the president’s action takes away some urgency to pass legislation. Several senators said the order would probably violate longstanding court settlements that place constraints on the treatment of children in federal custody. Those decisions prevented Barack Obama from holding families together in detention facilities at the height of the migrant crisis two years ago. With five months before the midterm elections, Republicans were facing a spiraling political crisis. Public opinion polls show that a wide majority of Americans oppose the separations.It emerged overnight that Trump administration officials was sending babies and young children to at least three “tender age” shelters in southern Texas."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/jun/20/shetland-scallop-fishery-retains-eco-label-despite-dredging-protests","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-20T16:34:18Z","webTitle":"Shetland scallop fishery retains eco label despite dredging protests","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jun/20/shetland-scallop-fishery-retains-eco-label-despite-dredging-protests","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/jun/20/shetland-scallop-fishery-retains-eco-label-despite-dredging-protests","fields":{"headline":"Shetland scallop fishery retains eco label despite dredging protests","bodyText":"A scallop fishery in Shetland has retained its coveted eco label after an independent review rejected allegations that it damaged the marine environment. The marine conservation charity Open Seas and the National Trust for Scotland protested that the fishery’s use of dredging gear to harvest scallops caused unjustifiable damage to the seabed and other marine species. They formally objected to a recommendation late last year that the Marine Stewardship Council should again award a marine sustainability mark to the fishery, five years after the scallops were first accredited. After a six-month review process, an independent adjudicator has rejected their complaints and upheld the original decision to renew label, which allows the fishery to charge a premium price for its produce. The Shetland Shellfish Management Organisation (SSMO) said it had worked hard to ensure its scallops fishery was sustainable, and this was supported by scientific evidence. “This is a unique, well-regulated and well-managed fishery which has a minimal impact on the marine environment around these islands that we all treasure,” said Carole Laignel, the SSMO’s inshore fisheries coordinator. Shetlanders were delighted when they won eco labels in 2012 for three shellfish –scallops, brown crab and velvet crab. They lost the label for velvet crab last year because the creature’s population was no longer at sustainable levels. The SSMO is now implementing a recovery strategy. Scallop-dredging remains highly controversial. Conservationists argue that the heavy gear used to rake the seabed kills coral-like species such as maerl, sponges and rare horse mussels, and captures other marine species. The adjudicator ruled any damage caused by dredging in Shetland was so minor that it did not have a significant effect on the wider area, which would recover in time. About 24 fishermen currently dredge for scallops in Shetland, mostly using small vessels shorter than 10 metres long, landing 750 tonnes of scallops in 2015. Open Seas said it was pleased some of its factual complaints about errors in the original certification recommendation had been upheld and that some areas it had identified were now being closed to dredging. Phil Taylor, its head of policy, said it still did not accept the fishery was sustainable. “It’s sad to see that MSC has certified scallop dredging on an odd, weak and technocratic definition of sustainability and are out of step with what the average consumer expects of sustainable seafood,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/jul/03/intensive-chicken-mega-farms-feed-uk-poultry-industry-head-richard-griffiths","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-07-03T06:00:30Z","webTitle":"Chicken mega-farms are how we'll feed the UK, says poultry industry head","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jul/03/intensive-chicken-mega-farms-feed-uk-poultry-industry-head-richard-griffiths","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/jul/03/intensive-chicken-mega-farms-feed-uk-poultry-industry-head-richard-griffiths","fields":{"headline":"Chicken mega-farms are how we'll feed the UK, says poultry industry head","bodyText":"Britain will need to build more mega-farms to keep it supplied with chicken, according to the head of the UK’s influential poultry lobby. But the biggest threat to UK consumers, he believes, comes from cheap imported meat – “chlorinated chicken” – produced to lower standards as a result of post-Brexit trade deals. Most Brits eat chicken twice a week. As a result Britain’s poultry sector is among the largest in Europe, contributing more than £3bn to the economy annually and directly employing more than 37,000 people. Between 2011 and 2017 the sector saw a 27% jump in the number of poultry farms holding 40,000 or more birds, and most of Britain’s intensive farms overall – 86% – are dedicated to rearing poultry. “Larger farms are probably the most efficient way to go in terms of technology, resources, impact,” Richard Griffiths, chief executive of the British Poultry Council (BPC), told the Guardian. He believes that ultimately such farms are “the way that we’re going to feed the country.” But what about animal welfare issues? Pressure groups such as Compassion In World Farming say the spread of “mega-farms” is “cruel and unnecessary” and that farming birds intensively indoors is inherently bad for welfare. Griffiths believes that this is not the case. “Indoor reared birds, on any size of farm, are in a controlled environment that provides good welfare. We operate under science-based legislation, the requirements of which are delivered by professional farmers and vets with high levels of training and experience.” If consumers want free range chicken, it is available, he says. “For consumers who want to emphasise one or two parts of the production chain then an extensive choice is available across the country, and it is this variety of indoor and free-range that is a strength of British poultry meat production.” The poultry industry has reduced antibiotic use: figures published last month show a dramatic reduction of 82% overall since 2012, which has been praised by government regulators. It was the first livestock sector in the UK to begin collecting its own antibiotic usage data in 2011, according to Griffiths. “It started with questioning whether the practices we were using were the right ones. And that also coincided with a greater interest in farm health and welfare. We were involved with some big work on farm welfare with government at the time. Those two coincided with the mindset of – let’s try to reduce, let’s try to use less. In any given situation, do we have to use antibiotics?” But antibiotic-free poultry production – as some companies in the US are championing – is not currently on the table, he believes. “I don’t think that’s possible, and anybody who says it is, is naive.” Following recent suggestions by the US trade representative that the UK’s animal welfare and food safety standards were “unnecessary and restrict trade”, Griffiths hit back, saying such claims were “insulting”. “British poultry producers don’t dip their chicken carcasses in chlorine as we do not believe in ‘cleaning up at the end’ or taking any shortcuts when it comes to producing safe food,” he said. “Using chemicals to disinfect food at the end of a production process can hide a multitude of sins, but what it can’t hide is the need for their use in the first place.” On a practical level, Griffiths said that, were cheap imports allowed to come in, the UK poultry sector could ultimately lose production capacity, with farms and slaughterhouses potentially forced to close. “My fear is that once we lose capacity it’s never coming back,” he said. Some campaigners fear US meat imports could lead to a “race to the bottom” as UK producers seek to compete with cheaper products, with potential moves to lower standards and increasing pressure to ease UK regulations. Griffiths says he believes this isn’t likely, and said the UK poultry industry is united: “I think we’ve nailed our colours to the mast on this. There’s a lot of political talk about improving standards, but maintaining and improving standards is the mentality that we have. We’re not going to drop standards.” A longer version of this interview can be read here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2018/jun/22/the-truth-about-gaming-disorder-from-fortnite-to-world-of-warcraft","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-22T16:00:37Z","webTitle":"The truth about gaming disorder, from Fortnite to World of Warcraft","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jun/22/the-truth-about-gaming-disorder-from-fortnite-to-world-of-warcraft","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/jun/22/the-truth-about-gaming-disorder-from-fortnite-to-world-of-warcraft","fields":{"headline":"The truth about gaming disorder, from Fortnite to World of Warcraft","bodyText":"Gaming disorder may be a newly recognised condition, but disordered gaming is anything but new. In 2010, a Korean couple was arrested for fatal child neglect spurred by an obsession with Prius Online. Five years earlier, another Korean man collapsed and died after a 50-hour session playing StarCraft in an internet cafe. In the west, World of Warcraft, released in 2004, was one of the first games to trigger addiction narratives in the mainstream press, with the game blamed for causing college students to drop out of university and others losing careers and families. What’s changed this time round is partially a matter of scale. World of Warcraft peaked in 2010, six years after launch, with 12 million subscribers worldwide. Fortnite, released less than a year ago, has more than 10 times that at 125 million. Even if nothing else had changed, 10 times the players probably means 10 times the stories of a disordered relationship with the game. The game’s free-to-play nature – it charges for cosmetic upgrades but anyone can download and play without spending a penny – means that a far greater proportion of those players are young compared with previous gaming phenomena. Not only are there more young people – who are not great at setting boundaries – but there is also more visibility of all types of play: an eight-hour gaming session that might be guiltily shrugged off by an 18-year-old student in a university town can prompt concern for that same student’s parents if they are just a year younger and living at home. But while Fortnite may have become the poster child for this latest run of gaming addiction stories, it is a mild example of the form. Games in Fortnite are short, typically running 20 to 30 minutes and the rewards for playing a lot are minimal, and cosmetic only. That’s substantially less demanding than more “hardcore” games, including World of Warcraft itself, which can require hours of continuous play and offers substantial in-game rewards, which can only be achieved by those who put in the requisite commitment. Similarly, Fortnite forgoes one of the more malign innovations the gaming industry has hit upon over the past few years, the loot box. Other games don’t offer rewards in a conventional manner: instead, players earn or buy loot boxes, sticker packs, and the like, which contain a chance at receiving the item they truly want, and a much bigger chance of receiving almost nothing. The unpredictable rewards this generates can be incredibly compelling, for exactly the same reason a slot machine sucks people in. Epic Games, the maker of Fortnite, has passed over other popular money-spinners in the gaming space. There’s no energy system, demanding money for continued access; there are no timers, offering the option to skip the countdown for cash; there is no possibility of paying to win, using real funds to buy digital advantages. Instead, the company seems to have taken a simpler tack: build a fun game, monetise it smartly and hope to make more profit from 100 million happy players than a million exploited ones. That cuts to the core of the debate around gaming disorder. If the poster child for the condition can be linked to that dubious term despite avoiding the exploitative techniques that have been adopted by its peers, what are games supposed to do to protect players from themselves? Can entertainment just be too entertaining for its own good?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/jun/22/from-vibrators-to-gay-kisses-how-bollywood-embraced-the-taboo","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-22T06:00:22Z","webTitle":"From vibrators to gay kisses, how Bollywood embraced the taboo","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jun/22/from-vibrators-to-gay-kisses-how-bollywood-embraced-the-taboo","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/jun/22/from-vibrators-to-gay-kisses-how-bollywood-embraced-the-taboo","fields":{"headline":"From vibrators to gay kisses, how Bollywood embraced the taboo","bodyText":"This is the summer the vibrator arrives in Bollywood. No woman in the 105-year history of the Hindi film industry has ever pleasured herself. But this month, in the blockbuster Veere Di Wedding and Netflix’s Lust Stories, no fewer than three women are featured in onanistic embrace. It is one sign of the rapid change under way in India’s most prolific cultural industry. The past decade has seen Bollywood’s first gay kiss, a hit film about sanitary towels and the industry’s highest-ever grossing film – about the lives of two female wrestlers. “It is a great time for Bollywood,” says Swara Bhaskar, one of the stars of Veere Di Wedding, a raucous comedy about four women who reunite for one of their number’s nuptials. “I think the industry is going through fast and interesting change.” Mainstream stars, such as Akshay Kumar, best known for playing pugilistic action heroes, are wading into social issues without fear of alienating their audiences. Earlier this year, Kumar produced and starred in Padman, a film based on the life of an activist who pioneered a low-cost menstrual pad aimed at improving the health of poor women. “I know [menstruation] is a taboo,” says Kumar. “A lot of times when I go to my social media, there are many who applaud, but one or two who say: ‘I can’t believe you’re talking about sanitary pads and vaginas so openly.’ But this is reality,” he says. “This is where you and I are born from, and we have to make sure it is healthy.” In its heyday, in the 1950s and 1960s, Bollywood seemed to exist separately from the fledgling nation around it. “In the earlier years, we accepted cinema in Bombay as a spectacle, an adventure journey into wonderland,” says Sanjoy Mukhopadhyay, a professor in film studies at Javadpur University. “It was always rich boy meets poor girl, or the other way around, but with Indian elements, such as expressive song or dance.” By 1975, India’s fractious politics had started filtering into Hindi cinema. That year, the then prime minister, Indira Gandhi, declared a national state of emergency, ruling by decree, imposing censorship and imprisoning thousands of activists. The biggest films of the year, Deewaar and Sholay, featured morally ambiguous anti-heroes struggling against a corrupt society around them. “These new kinds of heroes allowed us, the ordinary commoner, to feel anger at the injustice in the country,” Mukhopadhyay says. Free-market reforms in 1991 opened India to the world. Incomes rose, and foreign films, television shows and brands flooded in. This gave rise to a new wave of films such as Hero No 1, set in glamorous European locations and featuring characters who switched between Hindi and English, reflecting a generation of middle-class Indians who “were increasingly becoming global citizens”, Mukhopadhyay says. The film critic Anna MM Vetticad credits the national outpouring of anger that followed the 2012 rape and murder of the Delhi student Jyoti Singh for the recent surge in women-centric cinema. “The industry is gradually – too slowly, I say – waking up to the largely untapped market of women with the money to buy tickets and a desire to see films they can relate to.” Yet India remains a conservative country. The masturbation scene in Veere Di Wedding prompted a small but fiery backlash. The Indian censorship board also ordered the purple vibrator Bhaskar’s character uses to be blurred. “We have a culture of silence around female desire and sexuality which is pretty pervasive,” Bhaskar says. The same week the film was released, censors also banned Love, Simon, an American romantic comedy about two teenage boys who fall in love. “The censor board still sees itself as a kind of moral guardian,” says Alankrita Shrivastava, a Mumbai-based director. She fought the board last year to release her film, Lipstick Under My Burkha, about the experiences, including sexual, of four small-town Indian women. Censors initially banned the film on grounds it was “too lady-oriented” and included “audio pornography”, but the decision was overturned on appeal. “The female point of view is still not so welcome in popular culture,” Shrivastava says. “In the case of my film, I think it was also a class issue. It gave you the point of view of women who are not so economically well off, and that’s still seen as transgressive.” Rising chauvinism across India about religion and caste is also putting pressure on film-makers. Padmaavat, a film about a mythical Rajput queen starring Deepika Padukone, was dogged by rumours it depicted a love scene between the queen and a Muslim conqueror. Angry members of Rajput caste groups rioted in cities and threatened to mutilate Padukone if the film was released. It was finally premiered under heavy security, becoming one of the highest-grossing films of 2018. But it has made stars such as Kumar wary. “About history, people are very sensitive,” he says. “So it’s better to avoid these things … You have to be careful of people’s sentiments.” Bollywood is the most commercial of India’s film industries and the most averse to risk. But the box office success of films such as Padman and Veere Di Wedding are showing that audiences are “not as prudish as we assumed them to be”, says Bhaskar. The next frontier for Hindi cinema would be an unflinching look at the caste system, she says. “I don’t think that commercial Bollywood has looked at caste in an any kind of depth. We’ve so far only chosen to celebrate caste in very parochial and unthinking ways.” More film-makers could also take their cameras outside cities and tell the stories of the rural and poor communities that make up the majority of the country, adds Mukhopadhyay. “There are still too few films about people who ride the metro, or work in the fish market, or take their tea in a roadside stall,” he says."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2018/jun/22/pusha-ts-whitney-houston-homage-work-of-art-or-moral-atrocity","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-22T12:00:27Z","webTitle":"Pusha T’s Whitney Houston homage: work of art or moral atrocity?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jun/22/pusha-ts-whitney-houston-homage-work-of-art-or-moral-atrocity","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/jun/22/pusha-ts-whitney-houston-homage-work-of-art-or-moral-atrocity","fields":{"headline":"Pusha T’s Whitney Houston homage: work of art or moral atrocity?","bodyText":"“Everything Ye say cause a new debate,” raps Kanye West on Pusha T’s album Daytona. In the run-up to its release, West caused shock by crossing moral lines. Talking to Trump was bad enough, but tweeting in praise of him was incendiary. Then saying: “When you hear about slavery for 400 years ... for 400 years? That sounds like a choice,” took him into new realms of jaw-dropping. By comparison, a row over Daytona’s artwork, chosen by West, may seem trivial. A sleazily fascinating image, we see a bathroom where luxury and squalor dance towards a death foretold. Heading for disaster, an addict’s mess is scattered around the sink’s gold taps. What powerful artist staged this scene? No one, actually: it was a picture of Whitney Houston’s bathroom, taken by a member of her family in 2006. Houston drowned six years later, with her cocaine use and heart disease listed by the coroner as contributory factors. Her estate expressed its “disappointment” at the photo’s use. But what exactly did West and Pusha T do wrong? The image makes a classic album cover, one of the greats, because it is so suggestive of infinite corruption – and because it’s a perfect match for Daytona’s trenchant portrait of modern life. This viscerally poetic album is about drugs and money, money and drugs. The Houston estate is saddened that “no one is exempt from the harsh realities of the world”, but revealing those harsh realities is what good art does, and Daytona is very good art. So far, so what? This is not the first time an album cover has caused controversy. Yet something is different. Today’s political climate means that moral criticism is no longer confined to conservatives. What happens to pop’s immoral allure in an age of absolutes? Can art still cross ethical lines? When West, newly toxified by his outrageous outbursts, tweeted that he admired gun-control activist Emma González, she repudiated his support. Well, who would want the support of one of the world’s most famous rappers, who apparently has the president’s ear? Cultural politics is no longer about building alliances but defining differences. West seems immune to this need to look righteous, but elsewhere in pop there is an unseemly rush to goodness and a fight over who possesses virtue. Madonna was accused of comparing herself with Martin Luther King and Nelson Mandela after posting pictures of them in the style of her Rebel Heart album cover to Instagram in 2015. You could argue she’s been a liberator, too. Nicki Minaj shared an image of Princess Diana to announce her album Queen, although its actual cover is a lot less pious in its semi-nude splendour. Will inspirational anthems be the music of the reformed future? We’ll have to round up all the rappers first."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2018/jun/20/mays-delay-over-trump-visit-backfires-as-us-eu-divide-grows","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-20T17:21:09Z","webTitle":"May's delay over Trump visit backfires as US-EU divide grows","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jun/20/mays-delay-over-trump-visit-backfires-as-us-eu-divide-grows","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jun/20/mays-delay-over-trump-visit-backfires-as-us-eu-divide-grows","fields":{"headline":"May's delay over Trump visit backfires as US-EU divide grows","bodyText":"If Theresa May thought her favoured weapon – delay – would somehow ensure Donald Trump’s visit to the UK next month would be less controversial than if it had occurred last year, she appears to have miscalculated. Six months ago the president was plausibly an unpredictable nationalist constrained by the senior Republicans surrounding him. He had quit the UN’s climate change agreement but otherwise his foreign policy was largely a complaint that America had to pick up Europe’s tab. The crisis in transatlantic relations was uncomfortable but containable. In May’s cabinet, the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, held sway, arguing that post-Brexit Britain had to remain close to a country with which it had a natural affinity, and anyway Trump’s re-election could not be discounted. The UK had no option but to ride, and if possible tame, the Trump tiger. The perennial role as America’s ambassador to Europe remained viable. But in the second year of Trump’s presidency that assessment looks shakier. The adults have left the room and Trump 2.0 presents May with uncomfortable choices she would prefer to avoid. The two latest episodes – the US withdrawal from the UN human rights council and the sight of child immigrants in cages on the US border – are connected only by timing and the outrage they engender. The withdrawal from the rights council was long planned, and the US dislike of its perceived anti-Israeli bias is shared by the UK. Aware of the imminent US decision, Johnson travelled to Geneva on Monday to voice his concern to the council directly, not endorsing the US move but showing some sympathy. The predominant UK diplomatic view is that the council, for all its faults, is one of the few institutions where tyrants and authoritarians are held to account. The true beneficiary of a US withdrawal is not Israel but the Gulf kingdoms. On the issue of the caging of children, May, faced with a direct question in the Commons, had no option but to condemn, even though she knew it would hardly ingratiate her with a president who bears grudges and who finds her cold. Slowly her disagreements with Trump are totting up. On the Iranian nuclear deal, trade, recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and even on the climate change deal, the UK chose the side of Brussels rather than Washington. In the words of the Foreign Office permanent secretary, Sir Simon McDonald, “when people might have thought the UK, outside or on the way out of the EU, might have chosen Uncle Sam over Uncle Jean-Claude, we have lined up very solidly with the European side of the Atlantic.” All these divisions have so far been managed in a low-key way, with the Foreign Office voicing regret rather than anger. But the fear for the UK is that it is not just on policy that Europe and the US are divided, but on respect for what some Europeans most cherish: the liberal world order. The evidence for that divide mounts up: the “special place in hell” reserved for Canada’s Justin Trudeau, a North Korean dictator afforded a handshake, the tearing up of a bland G7 communique welcoming free trade, and the German chancellor – at a time of maximum political vulnerability – insulted over crime and migration, feeding a narrative dictated by the German extreme right. Even in leaving the human rights council, the US ambassador to the UN, Nikki Hayley, could not restrain herself from lambasting the failure of European leaders to call out the council more in public. Nor are these policy disputes with Europe being left at the level of rhetoric. Active measures are being taken. US state department officials are dispatched to the capitals of Trump’s selective allies in Europe – Rome, Warsaw and Budapest – to undermine European unity over the Iran nuclear deal, or to Frankfurt to underline to any German bank with US ties that they will face secondary sanctions if they continue to trade in Iran. Every country lobbies for its own interests, but Trump, in the eyes of Paris and Berlin, seems to be going a step further. Rather than being indifferent to the EU’s survival, he appears to revel in the weakening of mainstream Europe’s leaders. All the alliances, trading relationships and international institutions that have characterised the US-led order for 70 years, including Nato, are now on notice. That leaves May stranded and UK foreign policy experts in introspective mood. The Foreign Office recognises that outside the EU, the UK as a medium-sized power will need multilateralism more than ever."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/aug/13/council-pension-funds-major-investors-tobacco-companies","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-08-13T05:00:23Z","webTitle":"Council pension funds are major investors in tobacco companies","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/13/council-pension-funds-major-investors-tobacco-companies","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/aug/13/council-pension-funds-major-investors-tobacco-companies","fields":{"headline":"Council pension funds are major investors in tobacco companies","bodyText":"More than £1.7bn has been directly invested in tobacco company stocks by healthcare providers, fire authorities and schools via UK council pension funds, the Guardian can reveal. Council retirement schemes in the UK are major investors in firms including British American Tobacco, Imperial Brands and Philip Morris, according to data compiled from more than 100 freedom of information requests. Several councils said that their pension trustees could not dispose of their tobacco stocks because of a legal obligation to maximise retirement income. However, anti-smoking campaigners said this argument “no longer has any credibility”. Government guidelines say trustees can take ethical, social or environmental concerns into account, as long as the fund’s finances do not suffer. And several investment professionals contested the idea that selling tobacco stocks would crimp returns, pointing to the long-term risks threatening the industry. The schemes, which manage £211bn between them, have £1.7bn of direct tobacco investments, as well as a further £1.1bn via pooled investments, where money is grouped with other clients’ cash as part of larger funds managed. Council pension fund trustees have no control over pooled funds, a common type of investment that makes up around 40% of the UK’s £3.5tn in institutional assets. The council pension funds received dividend income of around £63m, according to FOI requests, although in practice the figure is likely to be higher because some councils provided incomplete information. West Yorkshire Pension Fund is the largest direct investor in tobacco, with £284m held in major purveyors of cigarettes, including £180m in British American Tobacco. It did not disclose its passive investments in the industry. Public Health England’s figures showed that the region’s biggest cities, Bradford and Leeds, have above-average levels of smoking-related mortality, estimated respectively at 350 and 332 deaths per 100,000 of the population over 35 in 2014-16. The average rate for England is 272. West Yorkshire Pension Fund manages the retirement money of staff working for dozens of schools, the West Yorkshire fire authority and local leisure organisations. Lothian Pension Fund is the second biggest tobacco investor with £110m of holdings. Its rate of smoking-related deaths is even higher, at 392 per 100,000 of the population. Liverpool has one of the highest levels of smoking-attributable deaths, with 442 per 100,000 population. But the Merseyside Pension Fund remains an avid tobacco investor, with £64m of holdings in the industry, the eighth most out of more than 100 pension funds surveyed. Employers in its scheme – and that of the East Riding of Yorkshire, which has £69m in tobacco securities – include City Healthcare Partnership. The organisation provides cancer screening, end-of-life care for cancer sufferers and stopping smoking services. A spokesperson explained that only a few of its staff are in these schemes because they were recruited from the council and kept their council-administered pensions. Nottinghamshire pension fund has £95m of direct investments in tobacco and its scheme members include Nottinghamshire Fire Safety, which is owned by the local fire authority. Smoking was the cause of more than a third of house fire fatalities in 2016/17, according to figures from the Home Office. Hampshire, which has £77m of direct holdings, said it was legally bound “to invest fund monies to achieve the best possible financial return, and does not restrict investment managers from choosing certain stocks”. Nottinghamshire council said it preferred a “strategy of engagement” with companies on matters of environmental, social and governance issues. But experts questioned whether it was even possible to engage with tobacco companies on smoking-related harm, while analysis suggested funds can still perform well without tobacco investments. The MSCI World Tobacco Index, which tracks the industry’s investment returns compared with other industries, showed that global stocks have matched or outperformed tobacco in four of the past six years. A separate study by financial data analysis firm FTSE Russell showed that over the past 10 years returns from a portfolio tracking the FTSE Developed Index would have been very little different if it had excluded tobacco stocks. Several local authority funds, including the Greater Manchester Pension Fund, the UK’s largest local authority scheme, which manages more than £20bn of assets, have already taken the decision to exit tobacco for ethical and social reasons, as have some of the world’s largest fund managers. Helena Viñes Fiestas, the head of sustainability at BNP Paribas Asset Management, which has moved to disinvest in tobacco investment, said there was no conflict between ethics and financial returns given a recent downturn in tobacco firms’ fortunes. “We believe this industry is at a crossroads and where it provided reliable returns, now uncertainty has come in,” she said. “There are other companies within the consumer staples [sector] that are performing really well that you can replace tobacco with.” Tobacco firms count on emerging economies for much of their growth as smoking rates decline in wealthier economies. Viñes Fiestas said tobacco’s prospects were limited by tightening regulation in the developing world, partly due to the World Health Organization’s framework convention on tobacco control. Viñes Fiestas added that there was no point in councils promising to engage with tobacco companies on ethical issues. “The problem is the product itself and there’s no responsible way of using it.” Fund managers holding $3.8tn of assets last year called for an end to tobacco investment and sold their own holdings. Deborah Arnott, the chief executive of health charity Action on Smoking and Health, said: “Local authority pension funds usually argue they invest in tobacco because they have a legal duty to get the best deal for their pensioners. “But this argument, which was always dubious, no longer has any credibility at all, as tobacco stocks are turning into a bad investment financially as well as morally. Local authority pension funds need to follow the lead taken by Greater Manchester, do their sums and get out of tobacco.” The combined annual cost of smoking-related illness to the NHS is estimated at more than £3bn, while the overall societal cost could be as high as £12.9bn, according to anti-smoking health group ASH. The Tobacco Manufacturers’ Association said its members paid £9.5bn of excise duty in 2016."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/20/ruben-loftus-cheek-england-chelsea","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-20T21:30:04Z","webTitle":"England’s Ruben Loftus-Cheek wants bigger Chelsea role or may leave","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/20/ruben-loftus-cheek-england-chelsea","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/20/ruben-loftus-cheek-england-chelsea","fields":{"headline":"England’s Ruben Loftus-Cheek wants bigger Chelsea role or may leave","bodyText":"Ruben Loftus-Cheek will demand regular first-team football next season if he is to stay at Chelsea, with the England midfielder, who is in line to start against Panama, not prepared to revert to a bit-part role at his club. Loftus-Cheek is likely to replace the injured Dele Alli in Sunday’s Group G fixture in Nizhny Novgorod – while the latter is in rehabilitation from a minor thigh strain – having impressed in a 10-minute cameo against Tunisia on Monday. His focus remains solely on the World Cup but, on the team’s return from Russia, the 22-year-old will seek assurances from Chelsea that he will feature regularly. Loftus-Cheek has made six Premier League starts for the club since his senior debut in December 2014 and featured only from the bench in the 2016-17 title win, making six substitute appearances. That lack of opportunity convinced him to seek out a loan move to Crystal Palace last term. He made 21 league starts for the Selhurst Park side – despite enduring a three-month hiatus as he recovered from an ankle problem – and he broke into the England setup on the back of that fine form. Chelsea are edging ever closer to appointing Maurizio Sarri as their new head coach, with Antonio Conte expecting to leave the club after two seasons, and Loftus-Cheek will report back for training towards the end of July hoping to make an impression on the new man in charge. “That’s the key for me next season regarding where I end up: I want to play,” he said. “I want to play as much as I can. And even this past season I didn’t play as much as I would have liked, because of the injuries and stuff, so I still feel I need a proper season of playing, wherever it is. “I do understand Chelsea are a big club and there is always pressure on managers to win games and trophies. So I understand they might not be willing to take a chance on someone at a bigger club. “Ever since I was in the Chelsea academy, I’ve had that awareness that people were saying I would be the first one to break through since John Terry. I believed I could but the opportunities didn’t quite come for me. It’s hard to keep training at your best but I made sure I did for when the time came, or when I did get opportunities like at Palace. We’ll see what happens. I’m confident in my ability and that I can do well, wherever it is. But I’m not thinking about whether I’m going to play at Chelsea right now. I’m only focused on the tournament.” Gareth Southgate is apparently reluctant to make too many changes against Panama from the team who impressed, particularly in the first half, in Volgograd, though Loftus-Cheek is expected to fill the void left by Alli. Loftus-Cheek’s muscular energy and poise on the ball unsettled tiring opponents late on against Tunisia and he forced England’s corner from which Harry Kane scored the stoppage-time winner. All five of his caps have been gained since last November, though he worked extensively with Southgate in the under-21s. “I like playing on the big stage, so making my debut at Wembley against Germany, the world champions, just made me really excited,” added Loftus-Cheek, who has taken on a personal fitness programme, including yoga, to ease the back problems that had also threatened to hamper his development. “I knew Gareth from the under-21s but senior football is a step up. You have to prove yourself at the highest club level to have a chance of getting called up. I have done that.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"society/2018/jun/20/high-time-that-we-relaxed-the-rules-on-cannabis-use","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-20T16:49:35Z","webTitle":"High time that we relaxed the rules on cannabis use | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/20/high-time-that-we-relaxed-the-rules-on-cannabis-use","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/jun/20/high-time-that-we-relaxed-the-rules-on-cannabis-use","fields":{"headline":"High time that we relaxed the rules on cannabis use","bodyText":"One of the wisdoms of our healthcare system is its evidence-based approach to the use of medicines, which also helps make rational decisions on health economics (Javid announces review into use of medicinal cannabis, 20 June). However, the evidence we aspire to is high-quality, randomised controlled trials of medicines in large groups. Cannabis has been used beneficially by so many people to alleviate symptoms, but not in a reported and controlled way, so the level of evidence is that of anecdotal reports, which constitutes low-level evidence. Its legal status makes it difficult for manufacturers to conduct trials and some potential medicines have not reached the market, partly due to insufficient numbers and partly because clearly it doesn’t work for everyone. Pharmacogenetics and the myriad active ingredients of herbal cannabis can account for some of these differences. It would seem the most sensible and efficient way forward would be to allow exceptional use medicinally where a person can be seen to benefit and a doctor who knows them is willing to prescribe. The regulators and legal guardians of our safety must continue to work in our best interests, but surely shouldn’t be too frightened to allow exceptions where it’s in a person’s best interests. All medicines can be dangerous when used incorrectly and cannabis is less dangerous than many. Margaret Gibbs Bromley, Kent • William Hague wants to legalise recreational cannabis.

The National Audit Office released a damning report last week into the ever-delayed universal credit, finding, among other failings, that it might actually cost more than the previous system of benefits it replaces. Current running costs are at £699 a claim – about £500 more than the government’s long-term ambition. This is ineptitude soaked in hypocrisy. While the feckless poor can go to food banks and be told it’s because they’re “not best able to manage their finances”, ministers can waste billions of pounds of public money with impunity. What’s happening with universal credit echoes what’s happening elsewhere in the social security system. Across the board social security is in crisis, with sweeping so-called reforms not only causing misery, but also wasting a fortune. Ministers spend more than half a billion and counting outsourcing on disability assessments to private firms, while claimants with disabilities become housebound and hungry after losing their benefits. As of this month, the successful appeal rate is now at a record high of 70% for both flagship disability benefits. The government’s response? Rewarding its providers by extending their contracts for another two years. Meanwhile, a combination of a chronic shortage of social housing is seeing private landlords pocket vast sums of public money for temporary accommodation while more than 1 million renters are teetering on eviction. It means the finances of local government – already on a knife-edge – are mopping up the result of high rents and squeezed wages as rising homelessness pushes people into crisis. A vast removal of state support has taken place over the past decade, much of it under the guise of prudent management of a so-called bloated “welfare” bill. And yet, from David Cameron to May, the government has been the one guilty of a brazen waste of taxpayers’ money. It is the ultimate betrayal underneath the austerity lie: create a narrative that says it is benefit claimants who are bleeding the public purse dry, and then throw away billions of pounds engineering ever-counterproductive ways to cut their support. Be it for housing, low wages, parenting or ill-health, safety nets work because they pay for themselves in multiple ways: in-work “top-up” benefits enable low-income workers or young parents to stay in employment and pay into the economy; while anything from disability benefits to child tax credits help nurture healthy citizens, ultimately taking the burden off the NHS, police and child social care. Remove them and not only do families suffer; the other parts of society take the pressure. This week, the MS Society found benefit cuts are costing the NHS at least an additional £7.7m a year in GP and A&amp;E services for people with MS, alone. These are disabled people who used to maintain their health with the support of social security, but, after losing their benefits, are having to turn up to hospitals for emergency help. When a social security system is in disarray, maximising the value of the welfare state becomes ever more difficult. Rightwing politicians talk of so-called “welfare dependency” when, in fact, it is poorly constructed social security systems such as universal credit that prevent families flourishing. Withhold the benefits a low-paid care assistant needs to help her pay her rent to avoid eviction, and you’re pushing a secure person into crisis, meaning she will ultimately need more support from the state. Take away wheelchair users’ mobility vehicles, and they’ve lost their transport to get to work or even engage in society. The government claims its “welfare reform” is intended to “make work pay”, but their policies have just made it harder for workers to make ends meet while penalising those, such as chronically ill people, who are in need of a safety net through no fault of their own. We are repeatedly told it’s the left that is irresponsible with budgets. That there is “no magic money tree”. That somehow one of the richest nations on Earth can’t afford a safety net that adequately helps people when they are starving or in ill health. In reality, the Conservatives are overseeing one of the most economically illiterate social programmes in living memory. Universal credit stands out because of the sheer scale of its failing, but it is not a lone error in an otherwise workable system. Rather, it is reflective of a decade in which ministers have crowed over “welfare savings” at the expense of human beings’ lives – and have actually cost the public more in the process. Britain’s broken welfare state is increasingly a costly lesson: zealot ideology and incompetence can be dangerous traits for a government but, together, they are a disaster. • Frances Ryan is a regular Guardian contributor"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"culture/2018/jun/22/what-to-see-this-week-in-the-uk","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-22T08:00:23Z","webTitle":"What to see this week in the UK","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/jun/22/what-to-see-this-week-in-the-uk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2018/jun/22/what-to-see-this-week-in-the-uk","fields":{"headline":"What to see this week in the UK","bodyText":"Five of the best ... films Arcadia (12A) (Paul Wright, 2017, UK) 78 mins Ah, the English countryside! Flowers, fields, fairies, morris dancers, fox hunts, pagan rituals, burning cows, naked revelry, environmental destruction, riots, horror … This fascinating essay film collages archive and movie footage into a grand hymn to rural Britain, mixing the traditional “green and pleasant” with darker, earthier tones. Hereditary (15) (Ari Aster, 2018, US) 127 mins This brilliantly crafted domestic horror really gets under your skin, with its building atmosphere of dread, trauma and grief – plus the occasional horrific shock. Toni Collette and Gabriel Byrne lead a family who seem to have never known happiness. Bad luck? Something in the bloodline? It all comes to a head in a memorably bonkers climax. The Ciambra (15) (Jonas Carpignano, 2017, Ita/Bra/Ger/Fra/Swe/US) 118 mins This fine realist drama feels almost like a documentary, portraying a poor, harmonious, semi-criminal Romani community in southern Italy with extraordinary intimacy and authenticity. A story gradually emerges: teenage son Pio (Pio Amato) must take on responsibility for his family when his male elders are all jailed. This accelerated coming of age presents him with some tough choices. The Happy Prince (15) (Rupert Everett, 2018, Ger/Bel/UK/Ita) 105 mins Rupert Everett ditches his trademark dashingness to portray Oscar Wilde in his latter years: bloated, destitute, ravaged by prison and the general trashing of his reputation. There are still flashes of wit and humour as the timeline flashes from his Parisian deathbed back to happier memories, and if Everett doesn’t entirely distinguish himself as a director, he at least gives the performance of his career. Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom (12A) (JA Bayona, 2018, US/Spa) 128 mins As crowd-pleasing blockbusters go, this ticks all the boxes. And even if there’s a sense of familiarity, it offers new tricks.

This one-off London show might seem low key in a few years’ time. Royal Albert Hall, SW7, Thursday 28 June Shamir Since the release of his 2015 breakthrough album Ratchet, Las Vegas troubadour Shamir has knocked out three more (plus an EP), finding himself in a creative sweet spot after ditching that debut’s postmodern disco in favour of a mix of lo-fi indie and 60s girl-group harmonies. If you’re not fully up to date on his discography, don’t panic, there’s still time.

Bloomberg SPACE, London Mithraeum, EC4, to 12 January Alison Wilding Unexpected, subtle complexities of colour, texture and shape give life to Wilding’s abstract art. This survey of one of Britain’s best contemporary sculptors features truly poetic meetings of materials: natural and industrial, ancient and new. Her imagination is introspective and playful, yet serious. A proper artist. De La Warr Pavilion, Bexhill-on-Sea, Saturday 23 June to 16 September A Slice Through the World: Contemporary Artists’ Drawings Drawing’s not dead. In fact, the oldest art is flourishing in an age of omnipresent cameras. More than 30,000 years ago, people were sketching on cave walls with charcoal. In the 21st century, a wide variety of artists are drawing in all kinds of media. Karl Haendel, Ian Kiaer, Kathy Prendergast and Lucy Skaer are among the artists here who prove the pencil’s enduring power.

Victoria &amp; Albert Museum, SW7, to 4 November Alex Prager The unhealthily strong colours of Alex Prager’s staged photographs cry out that something is wrong. People show off perfect bodies on a crowded beach. They pose so ostentatiously, it is all a bright shining lie.

Theatre Royal Bath, Saturday 23 June to 7 July; touring to 28 July The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie It is hard to dispel from your mind Maggie Smith in the 1969 film of Muriel Spark’s novel. However, Lia Williams makes the part her own with a soft growl of a voice, slinky frocks and a wedge of ginger curls, suggesting a more deluded and predatory teacher, while making the most of Spark’s one-liners in this new David Harrower adaptation. Donmar Warehouse, WC2, to 28 July Translations The late Irish playwright Brian Friel had no shortage of successful plays (Dancing at Lughnasa, Philadelphia, Here I Come!) but this has the added stamp of approval of being an A-level text. Set in a Donegal schoolroom in 1833, this modern classic about language and colonisation follows British officers as they anglicise Irish place names. There’s a love story across the divide, too. National Theatre: Olivier, SE1, to 11 August Jerusalem It is no surprise that one of Jez Butterworth’s most successful plays has rarely been revived since it premiered in 2009. The colossus of Mark Rylance’s performance (Tony and Olivier awards) looms so large over the central role of Johnny “Rooster” Byron – a grizzled, larger-than-life, debauched Pied Piper of a man – that it’s a brave chap who tackles it. Jasper Britton is the man here in this rollicking piece about the state of Middle England. West Berkshire Playhouse: The Watermill, Newbury, to 21 July The Moderate Soprano Last week to catch David Hare’s surprising play about the birth of an English artistic institution, Glyndebourne.

The answer Comey gives is unexpectedly swift and direct. “Yes, actually. Mostly because people say that to me all the time. So I hear that quite a bit.” And what does he do with that thought? “It’s very painful. And I sometimes wonder, if I could go back in time, would I do something deeply unprincipled? I wouldn’t. All it does is make it painful, [because] I think Donald Trump is doing – and will do – great damage to my country. But that just adds to the pain.” It has been 13 months since Trump fired Comey from the job he loved, as director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. (Comey only learned he had been sacked as he was addressing FBI agents in Los Angeles, when the news flashed across TV screens at the back of the room.) Out of office he might be, but he is rarely out of the news. When he and I met this week – in Berlin, as Comey promotes European editions of his well-reviewed and bestselling memoir, A Higher Loyalty – the former FBI director was dealing with the fallout of last week’s report by the inspector general of the Justice Department into the two pivotal decisions Comey took in 2016, decisions that seemed first to save the candidacy of Hillary Clinton and then to bury it. In July of that year, Comey stepped forward to announce that a year-long investigation into Clinton’s use of email was over and that the candidate would face no charges. Republicans denounced him as a Democrat stooge. But then, in late October and less than two weeks before election day, Comey revealed that the FBI had reopened the email investigation and that Clinton was once again under suspicion. Republicans now rushed to praise Comey as a man of great integrity, the polls promptly narrowed and, on 8 November, Trump won the presidency. The report backed Comey on the decision not to prosecute Clinton, but it faults the way he broke from standard FBI procedures in making those July and October disclosures himself, rather than deferring to his bosses at the Department of Justice. The inspector general brands Comey’s failure to inform Justice that he was going to make a public statement in July 2016 “extraordinary and insubordinate”. Surely for a fastidious servant of the law like Comey – such a boy scout that he once felt compelled to tell a colleague that a gift of a necktie was, in fact, a “re-gift” of an unwanted present from his brother-in-law – that kind of condemnation hit hard? “Look, the term insubordination when I first saw it threw me. I’m like: ‘What?’ But in a way, he’s right. That if you define insubordination in that I intentionally deprived my superior of information that they would otherwise have wanted, yeah, that’s true. And I did it because I thought it was the thing that I had to do. Once I stepped back from it I realised, yeah, it’s actually a fair description.” It’s a typical Comey answer: emotionally self-aware; self-critical; striving to be fair and to see his opponent’s point of view; insistent on logic and, after all that, still convinced of his own ultimate moral rectitude. His certainty on that score is conveyed as much through his demeanour as his words. In the hotel room set aside for interviews, surrounded by multiple editions of his book waiting to be signed, he looks relaxed in loose jacket and no tie – “He’s dressing as a writer,” his German publicist suggests – and if guilt and angst are gnawing away, there is no outward sign of it. Instead he speaks as a man who wrestled hard with the decisions he had to make, and has wrestled with them in the months since, but has declared himself the winner. He is not tortured by regret. As he says of last week’s report: “I don’t feel chastened by it. Initial reaction was defensive, I think, a little bit. It’s painful to see yourself criticised like that but, in the end, I’m at peace with it.” What of the revelation that he himself had used a private Gmail account to do some of his FBI work, a disclosure that brought a three-word tweet – and viral rebuke – from Hillary Clinton: “But my emails”? Didn’t that make him a hypocrite? Not at all, he says. “I worried throughout the investigation that Hillary Clinton didn’t understand what her own investigation was about,” he says, risking condescension to explain that the issue was never what kind of email she was using – “I could [not] care less that she was using her own server or Gmail or AOL” or whatever – but rather “the mishandling of classified information”. For his own part, he says he used Gmail only when working at home on public texts, speeches and the like, which he would then send to his official FBI account. “There’s no accusation whatsoever that I used my Gmail account to discuss classified topics.” How did he react to the inspector general’s discovery that two FBI agents were texting each other about the campaign, one reassuring the other not to worry about a Trump victory because “We’ll stop it”? Comey says he was “stunned when I heard that stuff”. He had no idea the two agents involved were talking that way, or that they were in a relationship with each other. Had he known, he says he would have removed them immediately from their role in “any sensitive investigation”. He is puzzled, he adds, because the agent who wrote “We’ll stop it” also helped Comey draft the October disclosure statement that damaged Clinton so badly. “If he was in Hillary Clinton’s camp, why was he doing that? This is the thing that the Trump people have trouble explaining. If the FBI was a Clinton tool, why didn’t we disclose the Russia investigation?” It’s a good question. Given that Comey was, as last week’s report makes clear, happy to break FBI protocols in the Clinton case, why didn’t he break them to reveal before election day that the Bureau was looking into possible links between Russia and the Trump campaign? Then at least he could rest easy, knowing he had hurt both Clinton and Trump equally. “It never even came into a conversation,” he says. “People tend to talk about it like there was an investigation of Hillary and there was an investigation of Donald.” But that wasn’t true, not then. “The candidate was not the subject” of the investigation, he explains. Nor even was the Trump campaign. All it was, at that stage, says Comey, was a preliminary investigation of four individuals. To reveal that a probe was under way would have damaged the investigation. Besides, “I don’t know what you could responsibly have told the American people that wouldn’t have been tremendously unfair to a candidate who was not being investigated.” I’m about to move on, but there’s something else that bothers me. In the book, Comey says he made his October statement in part because he feared that, if he didn’t, and Clinton won, there would be a cloud cast over the legitimacy of her presidency. Americans would feel they had not been in full possession of the facts when they voted for her. But wasn’t that hugely naive? Wouldn’t the Republicans and their conservative media outriders have branded President Hillary as illegitimate from day one whatever Comey had done, just as they had with her husband and Barack Obama? “Of course, the Republicans and Fox News – any Democrat as president they’re going to attack. But it’s an order of magnitude different if the basis of the attack on the FBI is that we concealed [the facts] from the American people and thereby engineered her election as president of the United States … Even without the Fox News voices, a reasonable American, I think, would be stunned” to learn that the FBI had reopened the email probe and not let on. Some of Comey’s detractors believe his motives were much less high-minded, that he kept inserting himself into the 2016 campaign not solely to maintain the integrity of the FBI, but for his own self-preservation. The inspector general hints at that when he writes that Comey based his decisions on “what he believed was in the FBI’s institutional interests and would enable him to continue to effectively lead the FBI as its director”. So: did ego play a part? “The honest answer is I don’t think so, in part because I knew how much this was going to suck for me. And I knew by choosing especially to speak that it was going to be bad for me personally. I think that’s a pretty good indication that it wasn’t about protecting myself. The knowledge that I was screwed, I think, is a pretty good indicator that wasn’t the case.” It’s now his predecessor as FBI director who is in the frame, as the world awaits Robert Mueller’s report into collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. Comey warns Trump’s opponents not to get their hopes up. For one thing, he says, we don’t know what Mueller will find. The truth might not be the “particular set of facts” people want it to be. (I ask if, based on what he knows, it is plausible that Russia actively meddled in the Brexit referendum. Intriguingly, he answers: “I think it’s plausible and consistent with their recent behaviour in the United States and a longstanding pattern. But I don’t know enough and if I knew, I couldn’t say it anyway. So I can’t talk about that.”) For another, it is “entirely possible” that even if the facts against Trump are damning, he won’t be impeached or removed because Republicans control both houses of Congress. He sets out instead his alternative hope, which he acknowledges some might find odd. “I almost hope that the American people are not relieved of their obligation to go to the polls in 2020 and decide what the values of the American president should be.” He worries that impeachment would short-circuit a necessary process, and would at the same time “risk driving a division into our country that would be long lasting … If it’s outsourced [to Congress], it’ll feed a narrative that there was a coup by the deep state and blah, blah, blah.” Better that Americans get rid of Trump themselves, at the ballot box. But will they? “I’m optimistic that, as the conversation continues in our country, which I’m trying to be part of for the next two and a half years, the sleeping giant will be awakened. I think of America as a bell curve. There’s wingnuts at either end and then the great lump in the middle is everybody else. And they’re busy and distracted and that giant, that lump, only awakens every so often in America. And I think the giant is stirring. I think the giant is stirred by images of children.” He has brought us to the infants and babies separated from their parents at the US border. For him, those images have recalled the internment of Japanese-Americans during the second world war, but also pictures of black children being bitten by police dogs in Birmingham, Alabama during the civil rights struggles in the 1960s. “The giant awakened in our country in 1963 and 1964 and that changed our country. Martin Luther King wrote to that giant in Letter from Birmingham Jail, basically saying: ‘You busy, moderate people need to get in the game.’ And that happens every so often in American history. Again, I could be convincing myself of this, but I think the giant is awakening. “When you stare at children crying, being taken away from their mothers, it forces your eyes above statutes and numbers, to: ‘What kind of people are we, for God’s sakes?’ That’s a lifting of the national eyes that is powerful and potentially the kind of inflection point that I’m talking about. That’s the kind of thing that awakens the giant.” I ask about Trump’s threat to pardon himself and everyone else linked to the Russia scandal. Is the rule of law in danger in America? I expect him to equivocate, or to tell me I’m getting carried away. But his answer is clear. “Yes. Yes. Not in the long run, because we will recover. But if we’re not attuned to the damage that’s being done to it right now, the recovery will take longer.” He cites Trump’s demands that political opponents, including Comey, be locked up – uncharted territory for a US president. Still, Comey clings to the view that, in the end, America will right itself. There have been low points before, he says. “In the 1920s, one third of our congress were members of the Ku Klux Klan. Joe McCarthy reigned in America from 1950 to 1954.” But America recovered. Is Trump in that category, along with McCarthyism and the Klan? “I think he should be understood as channelling the forces of reaction to change in the United States.” Is he as great a menace? “We’ll only be able to judge in hindsight, I suppose, but certainly not if the giant awakens and we resist the temptation to become numb to the norm-destroying behaviours.” Comey promises to be active between now and the 2020 election, writing and speaking, perhaps even backing political candidates. He is no longer a registered Republican; he is now an independent. Would he run himself? That “is not something I’m ever going to do,” he declares. He says that he’d be a “crappy candidate”. He would hate asking people for money; he would baulk at saying contradictory things to different audiences; if an opponent made a good point in a debate, he would say so. You never know, I say: those very qualities might be appealing to voters. “The other thing is, I’m actually a bit of an introvert. I don’t get energy from public engagement. I don’t crave affirmation, crave attention. You’ve got to have a little bit of that in you.” Our time is nearly up. In our last minute together, I say that, if I were in his shoes, I would spend every waking hour scouring polling data and the like, searching for evidence that it wasn’t my fault that Hillary Clinton lost. I would need that. He wasn’t like that in the immediate aftermath of the election, he says. “I was just trying to block it out at the time. I think I felt a certain sense of numbness. Since then, I’ve actually delegated all that to my wife – she was a strong Hillary Clinton supporter – because she’s very keen to find evidence that it wasn’t me. She would very much like to find some definitive study that it wasn’t me.” And has she found it? “Not yet.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/jun/28/stoya-philosophy-pussycats-porn-interview","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-28T11:47:36Z","webTitle":"Stoya: 'I thought female sexuality was an OK thing?'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jun/28/stoya-philosophy-pussycats-porn-interview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/jun/28/stoya-philosophy-pussycats-porn-interview","fields":{"headline":"Stoya: 'I thought female sexuality was an OK thing?'","bodyText":"Dubbed “the pop star of porn” by Village Voice, Stoya is an award-winning performer in adult films, a director, a podcast host and, among other credits I don’t have space to list, an all-round entrepreneur. She’s both a vocal defender of the porn industry and one of its most nuanced commentators. “When I first considered performing in a hardcore pornographic video, I also thought about what sort of career doors would close once I’d had sex in front of a camera,” she mused recently in the New York Times. “Being a schoolteacher came to mind, but that was fine, since I didn’t want the responsibility of shaping young minds. And yet thanks to this country’s non-functional sex education system and the ubiquitous access to porn by anyone with an internet connection, I have that responsibility anyway.” So her first collection of essays and articles is Philosophy, Pussycats and Porn, an eclectic mix of biographical vignettes and reflections that covers subjects from religious iconography to technology, but often circles back to sexuality, patriarchy and identity. “When you spend 12 years with your entire job being sexuality,” she tells me, down the phone from New York, “you start to find all sorts of odd little angles that people aren’t really talking about.” Stoya began writing when she grew tired of what she calls “parachute journalists” – those who report on subjects they know little about – “getting it so incredibly wrong with porn”. Tired of her own words being truncated in interviews, she realised she could simply write the articles herself. And she has a clean, functional prose style, punctuated by understated wit and insightful digressions, the latter a nod to her grandmother’s conversational style (her nom de plume is also a nod to her grandmother’s Serbian surname). She frequently performs an intellectual hopscotch from topic to topic. In one essay, she goes from a burlesque troupe to a Soviet variety of Kinsey report, before arriving at the question: “Do the political systems of a population change the dynamics of group sex?” She casually drops one-liners that could be essays in themselves. One such line is in the essay Squicks and Squees: “the semantics of sex”. “We don’t have serious adult language for serious adult discussions of sexuality,” she says. This is a problem because, as she puts it, “language informs perception ... We have specialised clinical words, like penis, cervix, digital penetration. And we have ‘locker room’ language … but we don’t have words in the middle.” Even the term “pornography”, as Stoya pointed out in her 2014 contribution to the academic journal Porn Studies, is slippery: it’s applied to a “broad spectrum of aesthetics, sexual acts and target audiences”. Not to mention a variety of media. “For porn to be of any positive use in the world, we need to start defining what exactly it is,” she says. Even the distinction between sex and porn is not as clear as we think, as she writes in Graphic Depictions, Scene 01, “because all partnered sex involves observation of some kind, though not necessarily visual”. The distinction between reality and realism is recognised in literary or film criticism, but less so with pornography (despite the fascinating attempts of a few notable academics). “We’re able to look at a battle between Marvel superheroes and go: ‘This is a fantasy. This is fiction,’” she says. And what is and isn’t porn is a debate with real consequences. In one essay, she recalls being asked by a photographer for the dividing line between nude modelling and porn. She instead catalogues the day-to-day impact that being classed as a pornographer – rather than a model – will have: being refused a PayPal account; getting a hard time from banks; being unable to get a business loan. “It’s only really porn,” she writes, “when you wake up in the middle of the night worrying about a spelling error on the 2257 age verification documents … when you dread some kind of cop busting in demanding to see that paperwork.” Half the time, when trying to rent an apartment in New York, Stoya will be turned away once the landlord learns of her line of work. The rest of the time, she’s asked to pay a year’s rent upfront. “Fortunately, I’m able to do that,” she says. Others can’t, which forces them into less than favourable living conditions. “In the US, discrimination laws are tied up with whether the identity [in question] is a choice or not. So sex workers are not protected because we made a choice to go into it,” she says. Stoya is sometimes referred to as a feminist icon of “alt porn”: a contentious term for material that differs from mainstream tastes. But she doesn’t think her pornographic work is specifically feminist; in fact, she claims it would be “pink, sparkly washing to try to pretend that it is”. Especially when she could list many other women making actively feminist porn. Women such as Erika Lust, Ovidie, Madison Young, or the late Candida Royalle. “My relationship with feminism is a little fraught because there’s a certain, very loud, segment of feminism that hates heterosexuality, or heterosexual behaviour, hates sex work, hates porn,” she says. She has some sympathy for the second-wave feminists that are often aggressively against her pornographic work. “Those women had to fight so hard that I can understand how they’ve ended up with rigid thinking,” she continues. “But, especially as a young woman, it was a real headfuck. Like: ‘You can be anything you want to be, except fuck you for wanting to be that.’ I thought female sexuality was an OK thing? And maybe something beautiful to embrace? ‘Oh, but only within these very narrow areas where it’s considered OK.’” Stoya is, in her words, “obsessed” with the French writer and intellectual Georges Bataille. She has engaged with his novella Story of the Eye (a challenging masterpiece of surrealist erotica) in almost every way possible: she’s filmed a partial, pornographic adaptation of it; wrote its first four chapters on a dress, that, over the course of two years, she stained with her bodily fluids and sent to the transgressive writer Supervert (a gesture it’s likely Bataille would have loved); and delivered a two-hour lecture on it as part of her erotic book club. Story of the Eye is troubling in many ways: the narrator uses “rape” and “fuck” interchangeably, and with the help of his teen lover, drives a 16-year-old girl to suicide and also has sex with enucleated eye of a dead priest. “Bataille is totally problematic,” Stoya says. (She thinks most things produced under patriarchy are - and isn’t sure if our understanding of sexuality can be “completely divorced” from it). “But there are things about the primal level of attraction in sex that he captures so beautifully, and the shared delusion that puppy love or instant attraction can be. The shared delusion that lovers can create in the bedroom when they’re, for instance, engaging with role-play. Discussing these things openly, dealing with it with nuance, detail and specifics – I think that is useful for having healthier sexual relationships and better sex.” No matter how highly sexualised his writing was, Bataille is still taken seriously by academics. Stoya wants them to examine porn in the same way – the kind that isn’t lacquered with a literary sheen. “We need the academics who spent decades studying patriarchy and its effects to come in and give us some actual critique,” she says. “Sitting on the other side of the fence screaming about how we’re ruining all men is not functional.” Porn isn’t going anywhere; as Stoya says, paraphrasing an argument from sex educator Annie Sprinkle: “The answer is not to get rid of porn, it’s to make better porn.” And if academics don’t heed her call, Stoya may take matters into her own hands. “Maybe that should be my second book,” she jokes.

For a number of international brands, however, he is turning out to be a nightmare. The Mexican defender is appearing at his fifth World Cup this summer at the age of 39. Thought by many to be his country’s best ever player, he helped seal a glorious upset victory against Germany on Sunday. Arriving from the bench with 15 minutes remaining, at full time he was quickly escorted off again, just in case he was caught next to a sponsor’s logo. For nearly a year, Márquez has been on a US treasury department blacklist, accused of being a front for a Mexican drug lord. Márquez denies the accusation and has not been charged with any offence. He has, however, had all his assets in the US, and Mexican assets with ties to American companies, frozen. If that feels like a drastic measure for Márquez, spare a thought for the poor US corporations who have forked out big dollar to be World Cup sponsors. If they knowingly engage with Márquez during the tournament, the US government could pursue fines of up to $10m (£7.5m) against a company and prison sentences against individuals. In effect, sponsors are now employing a World Cup boycott, only against one man. Márquez’s training strip has been shorn of any adverts and Fifa has advised that if the player is interviewed after a game, he can’t stand in front of those mandatory Perspex boards covered in logos. According to the New York Times, there is even a plan for what should happen were Márquez to win a man of the match award, given that the prize is sponsored by the none-more-American Budweiser beer. Iran have also fallen foul of a boycott, with Nike saying it couldn’t supply the team’s players with football boots because of US sanctions against the country. The World Cup has a long history of boycotts. In 1934, inaugural winners Uruguay refused to defend their title in Italy in protest at how few European sides had turned out four years before. England also refused to play that year, although not in solidarity: the FA simply claimed the standard wasn’t good enough. Despite the track record, this World Cup does feel different. That Russia should be hosting the tournament at all has long been contentious, and the defining image of the opening match was Vladimir Putin and Saudi Arabia’s crown prince Mohammed bin Salman enjoying convivial banter either side of Fifa president Gianni Infantino. The diplomatic measures taken around Márquez are another reminder of how the world’s greatest sporting event is just another political football."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jun/20/uk-regional-airports-will-be-hit-hard-by-heathrows-third-runway","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-20T16:49:19Z","webTitle":"UK regional airports will be hit hard by Heathrow’s third runway | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/20/uk-regional-airports-will-be-hit-hard-by-heathrows-third-runway","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jun/20/uk-regional-airports-will-be-hit-hard-by-heathrows-third-runway","fields":{"headline":"UK regional airports will be hit hard by Heathrow’s third runway","bodyText":"According to the government’s own figures, the impact of Heathrow expansion on UK regional airports will be alarmingly negative. By as early as 2030, a third runway at Heathrow will mean 20,258 fewer direct international flights at Manchester each year; 17,100 fewer at Birmingham; 4,449 fewer at Leeds Bradford; 2,700 fewer in Scotland; 1,400 fewer at Doncaster Sheffield airport; and that as many as 17 million of the 43 million extra passengers projected to pass through Heathrow’s lucrative shopping malls will have been be drawn from growth at regional airports (Caroline Lucas interview, 16 June). And there’s no letup in the projections: by 2050 there will be 162,000 fewer direct international flights each year at regional airports, if parliament permits Heathrow to build a third runway. The sole offer to the regions is the poultice of possible “connectivity” to an increasingly monopolistic Heathrow, but this possibility appears to be diminishing in a world where customers opt for direct point-to-point international flights, rather than transfer at hubs, and such domestic flights require taxpayer subsidy. In the last year alone, the number of “regional connectivity” flights from Heathrow has fallen. So regional MPs should look beyond the corporate sales puff of Heathrow, as touted by ministers, and consult the actual detail of the government’s airports national policy statement, before allowing a third runway at Heathrow to further entrench the geographical economic divide in our country. Their regions need them to vote no to a third runway at Heathrow. Paul McGuinness Chair, No 3rd Runway Coalition • Caroline Lucas’s comments (Saturday interview, Weekend, 16 June) on the “arms race” between European airports were novel and persuasive. Could someone explain why if a) we need an airport for business with maximum connections and capacity and b) two-thirds of Heathrow flights are to leisure destinations, Heathrow cannot reallocate existing slots to increase business capacity while leisure slots are distributed closer to tourists’ homes? Is the whole enterprise driven by BA’s desire to run all of its flights from a single airport? Answers please!

Since the start of April, landlords have been prohibited from renting out “sub-standard” houses and flats, which, in this context, means those that don’t meet minimum energy-efficiency requirements. However, Guardian Money has been shown an example of a flat being listed on a letting agent website where the energy efficiency “score” appears to have been fraudulently changed to allow it to be advertised. The reader who brought the listing to our attention says the property – a one-bedroom flat in west London – has had its energy efficiency rating “miraculously increased” from 23 on the official certificate to 40 on the agent’s website. Landlords can be fined up to £4,000 if they let a sub-standard property in breach of the regulations, and can be “named and shamed” on a public register. But when Money tried to search the register, we could not find details of a single landlord issued with a penalty. These new rules relate to the energy performance certificate (EPC) that outlines the energy performance of a property, from A (most efficient) to G (least efficient), and recommends improvements that could be made. Virtually all homes sold, rented out or built since 2008, have to have an EPC, which must be available to a prospective buyer or tenant. Since 1 April, landlords have been banned from granting a tenancy to a new or existing tenant if the property has an EPC rating of band F (a score of 21-38) or G (1-20). The government says F- and G-rated properties waste energy, impose unnecessary costs on tenants and the wider economy, and contribute to avoidable greenhouse gas emissions. So how many of these sub-standard properties are out there? According to letting agent body Arla Propertymark, it’s as many as 300,000. However, there is a rather large elephant in the room in the form of an exemption that many landlords can use to get out of doing the work. Under the rules, landlords of F- and G-rated properties are only required to make the necessary improvements where this can be done at “no cost” to themselves. In other words, the ban doesn’t apply if the landlord has been unable to access third-party funding – for example, Green Deal finance or a local authority grant – to cover the costs. However, the government has proposed making changes to this. The reader who contacted us says his daughter will soon be leaving the west London flat, which has an EPC at the low end of the F range (23). However, the letting agent is advertising it on its website with an score of 40 – putting it in the E band. The reader says he is certain no improvements have been carried out – and, as his daughter lives there, he should probably know. He adds that the letting agent is “using fraudulent EPC information”. The man says he has not raised the issue as he does not want to jeopardise the return of his daughter’s deposit. His advice to others is: “Don’t just take the word of the agent that the EPC is what they say it is.” There is an easy way for anyone looking to rent or buy – or is simply a nosy neighbour – to check the EPC of any property. Go to epcregister.com, click on “retrieve report using property address” and type in the postcode or address, and you can then view the EPC for that property (if it hasn’t been sold or rented out in the last decade, it may not be on the system). If the EPC rating of the flat highlighted by the Money reader has been deliberately changed to allow it to be rented out again, the local authority could impose a penalty of up to £4,000 and publish details of the breach on a publicly accessible part of what’s known as the “PRS exemptions register”. The public can search this register (at prsregister.beis.gov.uk) for penalty notices – but when Money looked this week, we couldn’t get it to throw up details of a single landlord that had been punished, no matter what we keyed in."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jun/20/bob-higgins-told-alleged-abuse-victim-he-loved-him-court-hears","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-20T15:37:37Z","webTitle":"Bob Higgins told alleged abuse victim he loved him, court hears","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/20/bob-higgins-told-alleged-abuse-victim-he-loved-him-court-hears","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jun/20/bob-higgins-told-alleged-abuse-victim-he-loved-him-court-hears","fields":{"headline":"Bob Higgins told alleged abuse victim he loved him, court hears","bodyText":"A former youth football coach accused of sexually abusing a string of schoolboy players told one alleged victim he loved him and got down on his knees to beg him not to leave his club, a jury has heard. Billy Seymour, a former professional footballer, claimed Bob Higgins was upset and angry when he told him he was going to leave Southampton to train at the Football Association’s centre of excellence at Lilleshall in Shropshire. In a police interview shown to the jury, Seymour said: “He broke down crying and said ‘I love you’, and got down on his knees. I ran away from him. It was horrible to see a grown man on his knees, crying.” Seymour said he could not wait to get to Lilleshall. “I felt safe, it was my sanctuary,” he told Salisbury crown court. Higgins has been accused of being a “predatory paedophile” who abused boys over 25 years. He denies 50 charges of indecent assault involving 24 complainants. The court has been told Seymour stood out as being the boy most affected by the abuse he allegedly suffered. Seymour, who has waived his right to anonymity, said he was spotted by Higgins when he was 12. Clubs including Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur were interested in signing him, but Seymour said he was won over by Higgins’ charisma. “Bob Higgins was renowned as a fantastic coach,” he said. “His sessions were second to none. I was sucked in. I didn’t want to go anywhere else. I couldn’t wait to get to his sessions.” Seymour said he received “preferential treatment” from Higgins. “It was quite overpowering how he took a shine to me. I thought it was for football reasons.” Higgins would give him gifts including tracksuits and bottles of the same aftershave he wore, and take him to football matches, sometimes getting him a seat in the directors’ box. Seymour said: “I had a lot of love for him at that time.” The former professional said Higgins drove him to night-time training sessions across southern England and London. Seymour said Higgins would play the Whitney Houston song The Greatest Love Of All in the car and tell him: “This is the most beautiful song, it reminds me of you so much. There’s something about you Billy I haven’t seen in any lads before.” Higgins would allegedly tell Seymour to rest his head in his lap as he drove, and stroke the back of his neck. Higgins would allegedly touch his own groin area at the same time. Seymour said Higgins began to invite him to stay at his bungalow. He claimed the coach would kiss him and touch his nipples as they shared a sofa. “It was a horrible feeling,” Seymour said. “He would put his hands down my shorts and stroke me.” Higgins would allegedly tell him: “This is a beautiful thing. I’m going to make you a star.” Seymour said Higgins began to invite him into his bed. “He wanted me to cuddle him. Most mornings, he would ask me to get into bed with him,” he said. After one alleged incident at Higgins’s house, Seymour said he ran outside. He said: “I felt like my head was going to explode, like I was going to puke, vomit. My head was pounding, I was sweating, I just had to run out of the house, I was frightened, scared, I was panic-stricken, it was blind panic, I didn’t know what to do, I didn’t know where to run.” The former footballer said Higgins once summoned him into his cabin as they travelled on a ferry to a football tournament in Sweden. “He had just got out of the shower. He was in a dressing gown. He asked me to sit on his lap. He was putting my hands down my shorts and stroking my groin area,” Seymour said.

Or whatever the groovy name for it is now. In the street, in the park, on the bus. It’s just there while the government, in its own alternative reality, argues over the legislation of cannabis oil for severely ill people. Even William Hague, hardly a Cheech &amp; Chong devotee, argues for the legalisation of cannabis, full stop. Current drugs policy, as he said, is “inappropriate, ineffective and utterly out of date”. I agree, even though I know skunk-induced psychosis is real. All of drugs policy and much drugs education is totally out of whack with what is actually happening. This is prescription drugs, mainly Xanax, which are easy to buy. Many parents and schools have only just cottoned on to this subculture, though it is years old. It makes grim sense. If you are awkward, depressed, stressed, and want to take the edge off and zone out, especially when you are drinking, Xanax does the job. Call it self-medication. Still I see the boys and girls posing with gun fingers and “bars” or “bricks”, as Xanax tablets are known, on Instagram. A whole subgenre of music goes with all this. This old lady isn’t claiming to be au fait with it but I spent some time searching it out after realising how prevalent it is. Some is silly teen nihilism. “I wake up/ I throw up/ I feel like I’m dead”. And some of its slurry disconnection is entrancing. Cole Bennett, who directs many of the videos, is mega talent. The numbing dislocation of violence and misogyny is shocking. But what’s new is the emo/depressed side. The absolute fascination with short, painful lives. Always the brutality acted out on the bodies of “bitches”. They are choked, drowned, guns put in mouths. “I put bricks on a bitch, 30 xans off her tits” as XXXTentacion slurred. He is dead now, shot at 20 in what looks like a robbery. Many of his teenage fans are in mourning. It’s a death of one of theirs. This is not music their parents know about. The cool people who listen to the same stuff as their kids? They exist but some stuff is not for them. Even in the world of Spotify and child-friendly festivals and the Young Fathers, it’s not to be. I don’t want it to be. For XXXTentacion made songs about depression and suicide and admired Kurt Cobain. Whisper it softly: Cobain wore dresses and was something of a feminist. XXXTentacion symbolised male violence and brutality, and had been charged with aggravated battery and witness tampering, yet was praised in death by Kanye West, who thanked him “for existing”. So again the gooey sentimentality happens with these hard men. XXXTentacion was a troubled soul. Louis Theroux spoke of his “personal demons”. Maybe “demons” here is code for the alleged beating up and imprisoning his pregnant girlfriend for so long she needed surgery to keep an eye. Maybe “demons” is a word for allegedly holding a woman’s head underwater repeatedly until she almost drowns. Maybe “demons” is a word for allegedly torturing a woman by asking whether she wants a barbecue fork or a wire brush inside her. The alleged threat to kill the “jit” , the baby she was carrying. So this brutal and brutalised young man is dead. Darkness was all he knew, maybe. The face tattoos show he wasn’t exactly going to conform. Lil Peep died last November from a suspected overdose of prescription drugs. Again the kids mourned. Another tormented genius has gone. New drugs and new music, perhaps. But the same old story. The torments are actually carried out on the broken bodies of women and gay men. “Troubled” masculinity kicks down, always down.

They get words. They ran away because they know they don’t have the numbers,” said one senior leaver. Yet the desperate contortions of the government – including the cruel spectacle of one seriously ill Labour MP being wheeled through the voting lobby in a wheelchair because of the intransigence of Tory whips – told a different story. Whatever the bullish Brexiters say, May and her lieutenants in the whips’ office clearly believed they were staring at the prospect of defeat. And the narrow margin of victory – a majority of just 16 – kept the flame of resistance alive in the hearts of remain-minded MPs. They hope once the debate moves out of this procedural cul-de-sac, and onto substantive issues, Tory rebels will be more likely to hold their nerve. The government has promised to bring customs and trade bills back to the Commons before the July recess, and several crucial amendments, including on keeping open the option of a customs union, have a string of Conservative signatories. And while the Brexiters may have been crowing, Wednesday’s victory was not the hoped for decisive trouncing of the rebels. They believe May is too beholden to the rebels; and too inclined to use the prospect of parliamentary defeat as a justification for sliding towards an ever-softer Brexit. The chief whip, Julian Smith, attends the Brexit subcommittee, in which the prime minister’s deadlocked cabinet is trying to thrash out the government’s next move – so that when called upon, he can opine about about what will and won’t make it through this bitterly divided hung parliament. No decisive answer to that question emerged from Wednesday’s shenanigans. As for the prime minister herself, her heavily dented authority has taken yet another dink. She avoided defeat – but only after an undignified last-minute scramble. Number 10’s effort to get on the front foot at the weekend by announcing a spending splurge on the NHS has been largely overtaken by the row about which taxes would rise to pay for it. And many of the big Brexit questions – not least what customs arrangements the UK hopes to have with the EU27 – still remain unsettled, pending a (second) cabinet Chequers awayday next month. With the withdrawal bill now on the statute books, there are dark mutterings that Brexiters could chuck May overboard; but in this fractious parliament, there could be many more grinding days like this to come before the job of Brexit is complete. Even the most gung-ho leavers may be wise to bide their time."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/jun/26/stath-lets-flats-humour-in-the-housing-crisis","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-26T08:00:27Z","webTitle":"‘It’s a lovely flat, there’s no willies’: Stath Lets Flats finds humour in the housing crisis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jun/26/stath-lets-flats-humour-in-the-housing-crisis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jun/26/stath-lets-flats-humour-in-the-housing-crisis","fields":{"headline":"‘It’s a lovely flat, there’s no willies’: Stath Lets Flats finds humour in the housing crisis","bodyText":"“Oh blimey hell, there’s a man in the bathroom. I can see his willy!” says an estate agent to two horrified-looking women, as he takes a peek into the bathroom and pulls the door closed. “Only joking,” he deadpans. “It’s a lovely flat, there’s no willies.” This isn’t the sort of patter salespeople usually give potential customers, but then Stath isn’t your average salesperson. The title character of the debut TV sitcom from comedian Jamie Demetriou is a well-meaning but wholly inappropriate property seller from north London via Cyprus. Think David Brent, had he been brought up on afternoon repeats of Location, Location, Location and was generally a bit more hopeless. Played by Demetriou himself, Stath is a classic comedy trope – the deluded but lovable hero – knowingly updated for 2018. And Michael &amp; Eagle, the family business he is desperate to take over, isn’t a dysfunctional bar (a la It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia) or a dysfunctional hotel (like Fawlty Towers) but a dysfunctional letting agency, marketing overpriced dives for the post-post-recession age (“Spacious with a cooling draft, £1,750pcm”, reads one on-screen caption). “When we started shooting, we had people looking at the fake listings in the window [of the shop],” recalls the show’s director, Tom Kingsley. “The art department had made it just a little bit too cheap, like £600 a month for a two-bed. We added an extra £1,000 to every listing, but still people kept wanting to come in.” Kingsley describes the show’s opening episode – in which we meet Stath, sister Sophie (Natasia Demetriou, real-life sister of Jamie), their father Vasos (Christos Stergioglou, best known for Greek drama Dogtooth) and colleagues including mild-mannered Al (Alastair Roberts) – as “a super-fast shot of energy … but when it settles into its rhythm it becomes more contemplative.” While the plot initially focuses on Stath’s incompetence, the five episodes that follow encompass more serious and moving themes that don’t feel incongruous in the age of the sadcom, among them Stath’s insecurity at his position within the company and a tense relationship with Foxtons-a-like rivals Smethwicks. While not a mockumentary in the conventional sense, it captures the energy of the genre, centred on the office where Vasos spends his days shouting “bean” (bin) at an automated council complaints hotline and asking Sophie to do the “steeks” (ie put up the “To Let” boards). Elsewhere, Apprentice contestant-esque Carole (Katy Wix) tries to assert her authority over Stath while Marcus (the late Alex Beckett) tries to ingratiate himself with him by wearing a matching diamond ear stud. Although not an employee, the beautifully gormless Sophie is a key part of the comedy; a singer who can’t hold a tune and a dancer with negative levels of coordination. Natasia, who appears alongside her and Jamie’s comedy contemporaries Liam Williams and Ellie White in the show, summarises the offbeat chats between Stath and Sophie as offcuts from their upbringing. “It’s like me and Jamie on a Saturday morning in the living room, eating Coco Pops and watching SM:TV Live … they’re who we would be if we lost all awareness and social anxiety.” With a team that includes Friday Night Dinner creator Robert Popper and producers Roughcut (The Office, People Just Do Nothing) it was always going to be funny, but there’s something about the near-telepathic sibling chemistry that even the best actors can’t imitate, and which may make Stath appeal to fans of This Country, too. Besides this, Stath Lets Flats feels like the perfect parable for the fractured Brexit age we find ourselves in: a loving portrayal of London’s Greek-Cypriot community around Green Lanes, featuring a protagonist whose outsider status also figures as part of his vulnerability (Stath winces when Smethwicks boss Julian, played by Cardinal Burns’ Dustin Demri-Burns, does an impression of him as a fresh-off-the-boat teen, complete with cod-European accent). “We grew up in north London and there are so many multicultural communities,” says Demetriou. “I hope it’s a story showing that type of inner-city situation where there are people from all walks of life. They’re all idiots in the same way but in different ways, too.” Stath Lets Flats starts on Wednesday 27 June, 10pm, Channel 4"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/20/portugal-morocco-world-cup-group-b-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-20T13:54:31Z","webTitle":"Cristiano Ronaldo strikes again for Portugal to send Morocco out","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/20/portugal-morocco-world-cup-group-b-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/20/portugal-morocco-world-cup-group-b-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Cristiano Ronaldo strikes again for Portugal to send Morocco out","bodyText":"Fernando Santos had wanted to see more from Portugal’s supporting cast but as long as he has Cristiano Ronaldo it is probably not essential. Ronaldo did what Ronaldo does. He got into dangerous areas, he scored and he was decisive. It did not matter that this was not a vintage performance, nor that Portugal were often made to chase the ball. They got the job done and they have one foot in the second round. Ronaldo’s goal came early and, after his hat-trick in the 3-3 draw with Spain, he is leading the running for the Golden Boot. Ronaldo is now Europe’s all-time leading scorer at international level with 85 goals, having surpassed Ferenc Puskas. Iran’s Ali Daei, with 109, is the only player in world football to have outscored him. “Cristiano is like a port wine,” Santos said. “He knows how to refine his capacity and age at his best. He is constantly evolving, contradictorily to the other players. What he does now is not what he did three or four years ago, and not what he will be doing in a few years from now.” What Morocco would have given for some of Ronaldo’s cutting edge. They had none and that is why their first World Cup since 1998 is over, which is a shame because there was much to like about Hervé Renard’s team. Driven by Nordin Amrabat and Hakim Ziyech, the wide midfielders, they boldly carried the fight to a counterattacking opponent and wove plenty of eye-catching patterns. But when the chances came, all of them in the second half, they blew each one. Ronaldo is all about end product. Morocco are not. “Those who know how to play in the penalty box – and the most gifted players – make all the difference,” Renard said, which summed it up. Ronaldo’s bravery has never been in question and the goal came when he plunged into a header as the boot of Karim El Ahmadi wafted about his ears. Portugal had worked a short corner routine, allowing João Moutinho to whip in the outswinger, and Ronaldo’s connection was true, unlike Morocco’s marking. It was unusual for Renard’s team to be so loose. Renard was upset that Pepe’s challenge on Khalid Boutaïb towards the near post went unchecked. “The first foul came from Boutaïb,” Santos retorted. “If not a goal, it would have to be a penalty.” Morocco were in the last-chance saloon after their 1-0 defeat by Iran but remained determined to play their high-tempo passing game, heavy on movement and pace in wide areas. They looked slick and they got in behind the Portugal defence. Amrabat was a symbol of their spirit. Having been concussed in the Iran game five days earlier, he played wearing head protection but he cast it aside in the early stages. “He’s a warrior,” Renard said. Fifa is sure to be unimpressed: its protocols suggest a minimum of six days between a concussion and returning to play. Amrabat shouted for a penalty in the 26th minute, having wriggled past Raphaël Guerreiro. They were grabbing at each other before Amrabat went down but neither the referee, Mark Geiger, nor his VAR team were moved to act. Guerreiro could be seen to inspect a set of scratch marks across his side after the incident. Renard wanted to know why a pitch-side review was not carried out and he and his players complained when José Fonte cleaned out Boutaïb in an aerial challenge inside the area shortly afterwards. Again, no censure. Mehdi Benatia could not react at the far post to convert a flick-on in first-half stoppage time but Portugal had the clearer chances before the interval. Following a surging run by Guerreiro, Ronaldo dragged narrowly wide of the far post; Ronaldo also played in Gonçalo Guedes, who was denied by Munir El Kajoui Mohamedi. There was needle between Benatia and Ronaldo, which first sparked when the Juventus defender went through the back of the Portugal forward on 26 minutes, treading on his foot in the process. Benatia was booked for another tackle from behind on him later in the first half. Morocco continued to push after the break and Santos was sufficiently concerned to change from 4-4-2 to 4-5-1. “I’m not happy with my team’s performance,” he said. “We couldn’t really have the ball and create pressure. We need more possession. For Morocco, it is perhaps an unfair result but if you make a goal, you win.” Morocco had their openings and only a wonderful diving save by Rui Patrício, the new Wolves signing, kept out Younès Belhanda’s flicked header. Twice Benatia made smart moves inside the area only to shoot wildly, while Ziyech cut inside and saw Pepe deflect his effort over the crossbar. It was not all perfect from Ronaldo. He blasted two free-kicks from the edge of the area into the wall and he skied horribly after running on to an inviting chance. There was also the moment towards the end when he initiated contact inside the area and went down. He was lucky not to be booked. But, yet again, Ronaldo had found the way to win."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"technology/2018/jun/20/eu-votes-for-copyright-law-that-would-make-internet-a-tool-for-control","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-20T11:49:59Z","webTitle":"EU votes for copyright law that would make internet a 'tool for control'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jun/20/eu-votes-for-copyright-law-that-would-make-internet-a-tool-for-control","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/jun/20/eu-votes-for-copyright-law-that-would-make-internet-a-tool-for-control","fields":{"headline":"EU votes for copyright law that would make internet a 'tool for control'","bodyText":"A European parliament committee has voted for legislation that internet pioneers fear will turn the web into “a tool for surveillance and control”. In a key vote on a draft law to overhaul EU copyright rules, the parliament’s legal affairs committee on Wednesday voted for measures that would require the likes of Google and Microsoft to install filters to prevent users from uploading copyrighted materials. The MEPs voted narrowly for the provision, despite warnings from some of the biggest names in the internet, and civil liberties campaigners, that the law would damage freedom of expression, while entrenching the power of the biggest companies and loading costs on to European startups. The plans still have to be agreed with representatives from the EU’s 28 governments before becoming law, but the vote reduces the chances of serious changes. Opponents of the law vowed to fight on when the legislation comes before all MEPs for a final vote. “I will challenge this outcome and request a vote in the European parliament next month,” said the Green MEP Julia Reda, who has been leading opposition to the law. “We can still overturn this result and preserve the free internet.” First proposed by the European commission in 2016, the law attempts to update EU copyright laws for the age of Facebook and Google, with the aim of ensuring that authors, artists and journalists are “paid fairly” for their work. Critics fear the measures would stifle freedom of expression by curtailing internet users’ ability to share content. Some lawmakers say even memes would be affected, as users would be required to take their own meme photos and give permission for others to use them. One of the most controversial provisions, article 13, would require platforms, such as Google and Microsoft, to install filters. It was adopted by the committee by 15 votes to 10. Earlier in June, an open letter signed by 70 of the biggest names of the internet, including the creator of the world wide web, Tim Berners-Lee, and the Wikipedia founder, Jimmy Wales, argued that article 13 would take “an unprecedented step towards the transformation of the internet from an open platform for sharing and innovation, into a tool for the automated surveillance and control of its users”. “The damage that this may do to the free and open internet as we know it is hard to predict, but in our opinions could be substantial,” the letter said. Addressed to MEPs, the internet pioneers argued that the cost would fall heavily on European tech companies, as the big platforms, which are exclusively American, could afford the costs of compliance. Internet experts are also worried about another provision adopted on Wednesday that would force internet platforms, such as Google, to pay publishers for showing snippets of news stories. Reda argues that the “link tax” would drastically curtail internet users from sharing news stories and even holiday photos on the internet. Under the proposals, “such snippets would require licensing, including even short and purely factual headlines like ‘Angela Merkel meets Theresa May’”, she wrote ahead of the vote. Earlier this year, a group of 169 European academics specialising in intellectual property urged MEPs to reject the “misguided” plans, which they said would “likely impede the free flow of information that is of vital importance to democracy”. Scores of academics have since added their names to the letter, which also says the proposals would be likely to harm journalists, photographers and many “non-institutional creators and producers of news”, including freelancers. The UN’s special rapporteur on freedom of expression, David Kaye, has also raised concerns about “prepublication censorship”, with automatic filters being unable to detect fair comment, satire, criticism and parody. In a rare feat, the law has united consumer and tech lobbies in opposition. Monique Goyens, the director general of the European Consumer Organisation, said MEPs had failed to find a solution to benefit consumers and creators. “The internet as we know it will change when platforms will need to systematically filter content that users want to upload. The internet will change from a place where consumers can enjoy sharing creations and ideas to an environment that is restricted and controlled.” Meanwhile, Digital Europe said the “unworkable liability regime [for] content filtering will damage rather than aid the online and creative market”. Tech companies also fear the new law will fragment the EU’s online single market, because national governments would decide how “link taxes” would work in their country. “If the main ambition of the commission and parliament was to create a non-fragmented digital single market where innovation in the creative sector can flourish, then this result is a complete failure,” said Cecilia Bonefeld-Dahl, the organisation’s director-general. Axel Voss, the centre-right MEP who is steering the proposal through parliament, rejected the criticism. “No one is and no one will ever filter the internet,” he said in a statement, while defending the central idea. “These platforms make a considerable profit on the works uploaded by its users, so they can’t simply hide behind the argument that it is the users who are uploading, while the platform is making money from it.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2018/jun/20/bbc-vows-to-increase-diversity-of-senior-management-by-2020","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-20T10:11:28Z","webTitle":"BBC vows to increase diversity of senior management by 2020","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/jun/20/bbc-vows-to-increase-diversity-of-senior-management-by-2020","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2018/jun/20/bbc-vows-to-increase-diversity-of-senior-management-by-2020","fields":{"headline":"BBC vows to increase diversity of senior management by 2020","bodyText":"The BBC has pledged that at least two of its senior management team will be from a black, Asian or other minority ethnic (BAME) background by 2020, as part of a drive to tackle the lack of diversity at the top of the corporation. Currently, just one of the 15 members of director general Tony Hall’sexecutive committee responsible for running the BBC is from a BAME background – the director of strategy, Gautam Rangarajan. The new policy also extends to the senior leadership teams responsible for running the corporation’s divisions, such as radio and education, news and current and affairs, content (TV), and design and engineering. In addition, shortlists for all senior roles at the BBC will have to include at least one BAME member, a similar system to the Rooney rule introduced in American football. The BBC has adopted the policies following recommendations from an internal report on career progression and culture for BAME staff at the corporation, which was published on Wednesday. “They are a range of proposals which we believe will transform the BBC,” said Hall. “This is now a real chance to accelerate change in an unparalleled way. Today’s report is a huge step forward.” The issue of the BBC’s lack of diversity first made headlines in 2001 when Greg Dyke, then the director general, famously described the corporation as “hideously white”. Last year, Sharon White, the chief executive of the BBC’s new regulator, Ofcom, criticised the corporation for failing to lead the way in having a diverse workforce. A report last year by Ofcom found that women, minority ethnic groups and disabled people are all under-represented by broadcasters in the UK. The BBC failed to lead in any of the areas covered by the regulator’s diversity statistics. The BBC has said that by 2020 it wants half of its workforce to be women, 8% disabled people, 8% lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender people, and 15% to be from a BAME background. The corporation will also tackle further issues highlighted by the report, including its divisions with less than 10% BAME representation, and “below par” employee survey results including in radio, newsrooms, newsgathering, English regions and the BBC World Service. “This is an excellent report based on an unprecedented level of engagement from staff,” said Hall. “By better reflecting the broader population we will make better programmes that reflect the lives, interests and concerns of everyone. The proposals build on our existing initiatives, which have been making a difference. This is a great opportunity. We will grasp it.” Sir Lenny Henry, the actor and comedian, has led calls for Ofcom to force the BBC to increase the diversity of its workforce by setting quotas for on-screen and off-screen staff. The BBC’s initiatives to tackle on-air issues include a £2.1m diversity development fund to support and accelerate on-air projects with diverse content or talent."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business-to-business/2018/jul/03/bengaluru-whats-next-for-indias-tech-capital","type":"article","sectionId":"business-to-business","sectionName":"Business to business","webPublicationDate":"2018-07-03T09:44:45Z","webTitle":"Bengaluru: what's next for India's tech capital?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business-to-business/2018/jul/03/bengaluru-whats-next-for-indias-tech-capital","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business-to-business/2018/jul/03/bengaluru-whats-next-for-indias-tech-capital","fields":{"headline":"Bengaluru: what's next for India's tech capital?","bodyText":"There are two things that the streets of Bengaluru are full of: bars and software developers. Take a seat at your watering hole of choice, and it won’t be long before you hear murmurs of startups, VCs and funding at a neighbouring table. This is where the entrepreneurs of Bengaluru (known as Bangalore until November 2014) come to meet – in the coffee shops, bars and restaurants of one of India’s most buzzing cities. “The tech scene and entrepreneurial spirit in Bengaluru are booming,” says Niketh Sabbineni, a local tech entrepreneur who sold his company, Bookpad, to Yahoo in 2014. Although from the Indian city of Hyderabad, he and his cofounders moved to Bengaluru straight out of college in search of three things: access to entrepreneurs, talent and venture capital. They’re not alone in choosing it as a base to launch a business. In 2017, the World Economic Forum named it the world’s most dynamic city, based on factors including innovation and technology. (This year it was overtaken by Hyderabad, whose state government has implemented a number of strategies to encourage tech entrepreneurship in the city.) In May, Walmart beat Amazon to buy out Flipkart, an Indian e-commerce platform based in Bengaluru, for £12bn. It represented a watershed moment for the city’s startup scene. “There hasn’t been a [merger] of that magnitude in India for a tech company,” says Sabbineni. “It’s such an important deal.” However, the deal is not without its controversy. Yesterday (July 2), small business owners organised protests in several Indian cities, arguing the US giant would skew the field against the traders who depend on FlipKart for their livelihood. Bengaluru has come a long way since the inception of its IT industry. By 1983, two soon-to-be-giants of India’s fledgling tech industry – Infosys and Wipro – had moved their head offices to Bangalore. Other tech companies followed, growing their businesses around the two firms. This included foreign companies looking to cut costs by employing cheap local developers. The IT outsourcing model was born. On the one hand, the new jobs raised living standards for Bengaluru’s citizens and made them digital natives, but on the other, it branded the city as a place for cheap labour and one that lacked its own ideas. Emilien Coquard is a French developer who moved to Bengaluru in 2011, and now runs a software recruitment agency connecting foreign companies with local talent. Since arriving, he’s seen the city’s tech culture change. “There’s been a shift from a software-factory model to a startup mindset,” he says. “Twenty years ago people entered IT engineering because that’s where the jobs were – now they’re doing it because they’re genuinely interested in tech, and they’re super excited to be working in software development.” Coquard uses the example of Dunzo, an app that connects people looking for help with tasks to others who’ll accept payment for completing them, as evidence of the entrepreneurial mindset he believes is deep-rooted in Indian culture. Dunzo started as a WhatsApp group, before the founders turned it into an app. Now, Google has invested £9m in it. This entrepreneurial spirit is bolstered in Bengaluru by a number of programmes and government initiatives aimed at supporting the city’s tech scene. One is the not-for-profit 10,000 Startups, which connects startups with funders, accelerators and mentors, with a view to building 10,000 new businesses in the city by 2024. Suresh Jayaraju, a senior director at 10,000 Startups, says that progress has been swift since the business’s inception, four years ago. The incubator is now reorienting its focus away from the quantity of startups and towards their quality, as well as to concentrate on certain sectors. In particular, the programme is focusing on deep tech, such as blockchain, AI and machine learning. Jayaraju sees this as an area in which Bengaluru could lead the world. While the city lacks the expertise of more established tech hubs, such as San Francisco’s Bay Area or London, everyone across the world is at an early stage in deep tech, so the playing field is level, he says. “Having started with this so early, we can still have an advantage. If we have the right ideas, we can definitely get funded.” Not unlike some of its more established competitors, Bengaluru’s tech scene struggles with gender equality. In 2017, just 2% of all equity funding that was raised went to startups with a female founder. “Women staying at home is more of a norm here,” says Hena Mehta, a tech entrepreneur who started a Lean In chapter for Bangalore. “Even educated women who went to college and had jobs before getting married tend to choose to stay at home and raise kids.” While larger companies often have equality and diversity policies aimed at increasing female representation, startups tend to recruit on a “talent-first” basis. Mehta is currently building a team for her own startup, and says she doesn’t have the resources to find enough female candidates. “I literally haven’t seen a single woman’s resume come through for software engineering,” she says. While Bengaluru still has some catching up to do, its tech scene is definitely starting to get the attention of the rest of the world – and this time not just as a source of cheap labour. Last month, US incubator Techstars launched its first startup accelerator programme in Bengaluru. Vishal Ramaswamy, community lead for Techstars, sees this as a vote of confidence in the city’s entrepreneurial culture. This is echoed in the reverse brain drain that Ramaswamy says Bengaluru is experiencing. “There are a lot of people of Indian origin who’re in the US – investors, corporate folks, serial entrepreneurs – who’re slowly coming back to India,” he says. “They’ve got US experience and contacts, and they’re coming back to set up businesses in India.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"guardian-masterclasses/guardian-masterclass-blog/2018/jun/26/performers-want-to-create-a-spectacle-david-levene-on-live-music-photography-guardian-masterclasses-blog","type":"article","sectionId":"guardian-masterclasses","sectionName":"Guardian Masterclasses","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-26T14:12:02Z","webTitle":"\"Performers want to create a spectacle\" | David Levene","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/guardian-masterclasses/guardian-masterclass-blog/2018/jun/26/performers-want-to-create-a-spectacle-david-levene-on-live-music-photography-guardian-masterclasses-blog","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/guardian-masterclasses/guardian-masterclass-blog/2018/jun/26/performers-want-to-create-a-spectacle-david-levene-on-live-music-photography-guardian-masterclasses-blog","fields":{"headline":"\"Performers want to create a spectacle\" - David Levene on live music photography","bodyText":"At the beginning of June, Guardian photographer David Levene led a live music photography masterclass at Field Day Festival in Brockwell Park, South London, which saw 15 lucky photographers taking pictures of artists and revellers from the pit. We ask him what he enjoys about live music photography, and what you can expect from his next masterclass. Could you give us a quick roundup of the masterclass you did with us at Field Day? The Field Day masterclass last weekend was, unsurprisingly, a packed, full day. In order to work at festivals you need to be super-flexible and the masterclass was no exception. The students managed to achieve all their goals throughout the day but not quite in the order we had planned! They shot some portraits of musicians, photographed artists on stage, and carried out general documentary photography around the festival site. We also had just enough time for me to sit down to talk through my work and offer some advice and guidance on how to approach photography at music festivals. How do you find live music photography compares to other means of photography? Live music is generally a fun and playful thing to photograph. Performers usually want to create a spectacle for their audiences, which can be a gift for photography, both in terms of the action and activity on stage as well as the artificial lighting which usually accompanies the acts. What do you enjoy most about photographing at music festivals? I always enjoy photographing the “daily life” of festivals, out there with the punters. Lots of people come to festivals to get away from their normal daily lives so you get plenty of opportunities to see them having lots of fun and letting their hair down. And what do you least enjoy? I hate it if I have to find and photograph a celebrity on a festival site. Thankfully this hardly ever happens - in fact I can only think of one particular occasion and it felt cheap and nasty! As a successful photographer whose work is admired by many - and as someone in a very competitive field - do you have a quick line of advice for people in the early stages of their career who aren’t sure how to go about making their work publicly known? The best advice I can offer is to find themes, stories or subjects that you feel passionate about. Passion will come across in your work and is the best way to catch people’s eyes. Tenacity is also a must for those hoping to get their “foot in the door”. Picture editors will often notice and appreciate it when they see someone really persevering with their work and trying to follow their goals. You will be running a masterclass with us in September - a how-to for using a digital camera. What do you hope participants will come away being able to do or feeling? My September masterclass is much more about going back to the basics of photography. It’s less about digital cameras per se, but rather about how to operate your camera manually. I try to give students the confidence to control their shutter speeds, aperture and ISO because if photographers can understand and master these three elements then they will ultimately achieve full creative control over their cameras and photography.

David Bolt issued a call for evidence as he started work on an inspection of the Home Office’s charging for asylum, immigration, nationality and customs services. Bolt said it would look at the rationale for the fees, including the amounts charged. Following the Windrush scandal, the Guardian has spoken to people who faced severe difficulties caused by the charges. One family had to choose between paying for accommodation or saving money for Home Office fees. Another family, who have a disabled daughter, are still paying back the £7,000 they borrowed to pay the charges and said they fear losing their home. Fees for immigration and nationality applications have steadily risen since 2010 under the “hostile environment” policy, including in the latest round of changes in April. Among the charges are the £3,250 levy for indefinite leave for an adult dependent relative and £1,330 for an adult naturalisation application. The Home Office made profits of up to 800% on some immigration applications from families. The cost to the Home Office of processing a naturalisation application is £372. In 2011, the fee for adult naturalisation was £700, while the registration fee for an adult has gone from £500 seven years ago to £1,206. The cost of a settlement visa for a dependent relative has risen from £585 in 2008-09 to £3,250 in 2017-18, an increase of 450%. Naturalisation for non-British overseas territory citizens costs £1,330, compared with £906 in 2014-15. Nationality registration for adults has gone up from £823 in 2014-15 to £1,206. Stephen Doughty, a Labour MP on the home affairs select committee, said: “Given the repeated shambles in the Home Office over a series of immigration processes, let alone the widening scandal over highly skilled migrants, many people will rightly ask whether the Home Office provides value for money to individual citizens and applicants. “Fees and charges being made by the Home Office should be reviewed. It is never acceptable for them to make a profit on these crucial activities.” Figures released to the BBC showed the Home Office made £800m in revenue from fees in six years. Jan Doerfel, an immigration lawyer, said: “My view on fees is that they are certainly too high and, in my view, will no doubt be prohibitive in the sense that individuals who would otherwise be in a position to regularise their status may not be able to do so because they cannot pay the fees. “The ongoing narrative and myth is that migrants are a drain on the system and don’t pay their way. “In fact, migrants have been paying disproportionate fees for many years, as the Home Office are charging migrants fees that greatly exceed what it costs them to actually process applications.“It also needs to be borne in mind that many migrants working in the UK will have paid taxes for many years, whilst at the same time, would have been barred from having access to public funds to which they have effectively been contributing.” Concerns have repeatedly been raised about the possible profit made by the department, given the lower cost of processing the applications. Registration fees for children have caused particular unease. Registration is the process where someone who has an existing right to British citizenship applies to obtain it. It costs £1,012 to to register under-18s, up from £500 in 2011. In 2014, discounts for a second or additional child were scrapped. The High Court declined to rule on the lawfulness of the fee last year. Yvette Cooper, the chairwoman of the home affairs committee, said: “The scale of citizenship fees for many people, especially children, who have lived here for many years has become a real and growing problem. Under the current system, children can be left in a precarious position, unable to study, work or access social security at the end of their teenage years.” Bolt’s inspection will “look at the rationale and authority for particular charges, including the amounts charged” and whether the services are being provided “efficiently and effectively”. Solange Valdez-Symonds, the director of the Project for the Registration of Children as British Citizens, said: “We are especially concerned about the scandalous Home Office fee charged for children to register as British. “This fee prevents many children, including children born in the UK, exercising their right to be recognised as British, leaving them exposed now and throughout their lives to the very same immigration system and powers that have so blighted the lives of many of the Windrush generation. “Doing this to children, who have lived all or nearly all their lives in this country and are as British as any of their peers, is nothing short of a national disgrace.” The then immigration minister, Damian Green, announced in 2011 that the government would charge fees significantly above cost as part of a deliberate attempt to offset cuts to the funding of the immigration system. The Home Office said charging fees above cost was necessary to reduce the burden on taxpayers from areas of the border, immigration and citizenship system not funded by charges. Chai Patel of the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants said: “The Home Office should not be making a profit on immigration application fees, and certainly not at the obscene markups we see today. “It is simply wrong that there are children in the UK who are entitled to British citizenship, but cannot afford the exorbitant fees to register as British. Instead, they are either forced into irregular status, or forced into a vicious cycle of paying the slightly less expensive fees for temporary status, over and over again, never quite accumulating enough to register as British. A Home Office spokeswoman said: “When setting fees, we also take into account the wider costs involved in running our border, immigration and citizenship system, so that those who directly benefit from it contribute to its funding. “There are exceptions to application fees to protect the most vulnerable, such as for young people who are in the care of a local authority. Application fees are also waived where evidence provided shows that a person may be destitute, or where there are exceptional financial circumstances, and requiring a payment would result in a breach of rights under the European convention on human rights.” Additional reporting by Alexander Marks"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/20/japan-and-senegal-fans-tidy-up-after-themselves-at-world-cup","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-20T09:33:20Z","webTitle":"Japan and Senegal fans tidy up after themselves at World Cup","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/20/japan-and-senegal-fans-tidy-up-after-themselves-at-world-cup","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/20/japan-and-senegal-fans-tidy-up-after-themselves-at-world-cup","fields":{"headline":"Japan and Senegal fans tidy up after themselves at World Cup","bodyText":"Japanese fans further cemented their reputation as one of the politest sets of supporters at World Cups as they were filmed helping to clean up the Mordovia Arena in Saransk after their side’s 2-1 victory over Colombia. Win, lose or draw, fans of the Samurai Blue clean up after themselves with bin bags they’ve specifically brought into the ground for that purpose. They made headlines around the world with a similar display of tidiness during the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. As well as their cleanliness, Japanese fans also lit up the game against Colombia with a wide array of costumes. The victory lifted spirits at home, after a difficult week for the nation which started on Monday with a 6.1 magnitude earthquake striking Osaka, killing five people and injuring hundreds more. Fans watching Tuesday’s match at pubs and outdoor bars in downtown Tokyo celebrated when Japan clinched their win, flooding into Shibuya’s famous “scramble crossing,” prompting scores of police to come out to ensure order. And at the Russian World Cup, this time the Japanese move seems to have started a trend, as Senegalese fans were later seen tidying up after themselves following their victory over Poland. It all leaves the 15,000 volunteers who are working on the 2018 World Cup with a little less work to do. But it wasn’t just Senegal’s fans who caught the eye on social media. There was huge interest in the Senegal, coach Aliou Cissé. A veteran of the team that shocked France in the opening game of the 2002 World Cup, people were entranced by his dramatic tactical instructions from the game’s sidelines. Social media also fell in love with Cissé’s visible rapid mood change at the conclusion of the game.

Female performers in the entertainment industry learn this early. As a soprano, my career has been defined by playing muses – roles such as Cleopatra (in Handel’s Giulio Cesare), Susanna (in Mozart’s The Marriage of Figaro) and Rosina (in Rossini’s The Barber of Seville) that were clearly adored by the male composers who created them. Performing them came naturally – after all this is what I had been trained to do. But where was my voice, where was the female perspective? The answer was simple, by and large there’s isn’t one. Almost every portrayal of a woman in the entire regularly performed opera repertoire is constructed through male eyes. The dominance of male composers is, today especially, staggering. Last week’s Donne – Women in Music report expressed this in stark statistics. Across Europe, 97.6% of classical and contemporary classical music performed in the last three seasons was written by men, leaving a paltry 2.3% written by women. But why? Is the patriarchy of the music business, the crushing influence of their husbands, or society at large to blame for such a skewed situation? One of our most recent and most strikingly innovative British composers was Elizabeth Maconchy. She was a unique voice, a great talent, and an audible influence on her near-contemporary Benjamin Britten. She was told that as a student at the Royal College of Music she had been passed over for a valuable scholarship because she would “only get married and never write another note!” She did get married, and had two children, but continued to compose. When she was 23, her work The Land was premiered at the Proms (prompting Gustav Holst to tell her husband: “Keep her at it!”), but it took her nearly a decade to find a publisher, and performances of her music were few and far between. Undeterred, Maconchy continued composing; her favourite form was the string quartet, of which she wrote 13. In 1942, a Royal Albert Hall concert featured her work alongside that of Mendelssohn, Brahms, Dvorak and Tchaikovsky, and in 1952 she won a competition to compose the Coronation Overture. The piece, Proud Thames, was premiered at the Royal Festival Hall in London to critical acclaim. She was the first woman to chair the Composers’ Guild of Great Britain, and she carried on composing until she was nearly 80. And yet her work is almost never heard today and she is little known. Why? When Robert Schumann married Clara Josephine Wieck, one of the most talented musicians of her generation, what did he give her as a wedding present? You guessed: a cookbook. As if this weren’t enough of a message he also composed Frauenliebe und Leben for her: a song cycle with a clear subtext, a manifesto for dutiful marriage wrapped in romanticism. Clara concluded later: I once believed that I possessed creative talent, but I have given up this idea; a woman must not desire to compose – there has never yet been one able to do it. Should I expect to be the one?” She knew it was possible, that she had the talent: she had, after all, been famous in her own right by the age of 16. Yet she became utterly eclipsed her penniless, unknown husband, Robert. Knowing that the necessary systems of support and education, along with opportunity, platforms and the possibility of critical review were not there for her she instead performed her husband’s works on stage endlessly, and dedicated her life, even after his had ended in madness and premature death, to his elevation. Gustav Mahler made it a condition of marriage to his young bride, Alma, that she give up composing. “I have been firmly taken by the arm and led away from myself,” she wrote. But this is not just a story about the husbands or patriarchal decision-makers in music. Society at large also stifled women; being a female composer or performer was seen as a highly questionable profession – often implying, in earlier centuries, sexual availability. As a woman, your options were limited, so marriage was a critical economic decision for most, and disregarded at peril. One of the very few alternatives was to take the veil , a direction which, through chance, the 12th-century writer and mystic Hildegard von Bingen took. Through this vocation she found a support system and platform for her prodigious creative intellect. Even so, moves were made to mute her. At one point, Hildegard rebuked an archbishop, and as punishment was forbidden to sing. The mechanisms of the classical music industry have long been a patriarchy. Music is a living thing, and any composer lives via the oxygen of performance, on stage, over the airwaves and through publishing. Did all those concert promoters, opera directors, orchestra managers and radio controllers simply forget to provide platforms for women? Without a platform, music as a living art form dies. At one point, my research for the BBC documentary Unsung Heroines led to an all-female student quartet who had named themselves the Maconchy Quartet and were dedicating themselves to performing the composer’s music. It is in these acts, and many others like them, that we can start to turn the tide: to rediscover the lost talents, uncover the forgotten music and give a compelling and inspiring voice to the composers stifled in life or neglected in death. We must celebrate these artists as the collaborative, innovative, unorthodox, irreverent, passionate, daring and resilient people they were. • Unsung Heroines: Danielle de Niese on the Lost World of Female Composers is on BBC Four on 22 June, 8pm, and then on iPlayer for 30 days. • This article was amended on 17 August 2018. An earlier version suggested Hildegard von Bingen took “holy orders”. That has historically not been an option for women, and this has been corrected to “take the veil”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"stage/2018/jun/20/beirut-review-park-theatre-london","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-20T12:55:39Z","webTitle":"Beirut review – sex is banned in surveillance-state New York","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/jun/20/beirut-review-park-theatre-london","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/jun/20/beirut-review-park-theatre-london","fields":{"headline":"Beirut review – sex is banned in surveillance-state New York","bodyText":"An unnamed plague has hit New York. The virus is spread through sexual contact, the death toll is rising, there seems to be little hope of a cure and government response is both unclear and ineffective. American playwright Alan Bowne’s 1987 one-act play Beirut is a clear allegory for the New York Aids crisis; Bowne himself died of Aids two years after its premiere. In Beirut’s world the virus runs rife, transmitted via the merest drop of bodily fluids – at least, that’s what the government thinks. Sexual contact has been banned, with fines handed out for dressing provocatively, and the death penalty is meted out to those who try to hide from their near-constant surveillance and have sex. Quarantined with others infected in New York’s Lower East Side (now known as “Beirut”), Torch hides out in his mess of a bedsit eating tinned food, with little more than a radio for company. Liz Ascroft’s set design shows great attention to detail, and the lighting provides the dingy feel the play needs. Over the course of 60 minutes we watch virus-positive Torch spar back and forth with virus-negative Blue, his pre-infection girlfriend, who has sneaked into Beirut. With both in varying but near-constant states of undress, the conversation boils down to whether or not they should risk sleeping together. While Louisa Connolly-Burnham and Robert Rees have passable chemistry as Blue and Torch, they come across as mismatched. Beyond the “sex or no sex” question, their motivations are incomprehensible. The accents, supposedly from Brooklyn and Queens, veer wildly, which highlights a dialogue that gets progressively more contrived. All talk of the outside world raises more questions than it answers, and the frequent segues into misogynistic violence feel superfluous at best. Robin Lefevre’s direction has the pair coming across as near frenzied – perhaps to show the extent of their lust – but leaves them kissing and flipping each other like a pair of overexcited puppies. What should be a punchy, claustrophobic exploration of one couple’s mounting sexual tension, instead comes across as rushed, confusing and distinctly unsexy.

Roca, whose three-Michelin starred restaurant, El Celler de Can Roca, has twice been named the best in the world, says he is being unfairly criticised for agreeing to host the Spanish monarch, who angered many Catalans by refusing to denounce the police violence that met last year’s illegal independence referendum. The Princess of Girona Foundation awards, which promote young people’s professional and personal development, were due to be given out at a ceremony held at Girona’s auditorium on 28 June. But after the city council said the venue was unavailable because of building works, the event was transferred to Roca’s Espai Mas Marroch, a 15th-century country house on the outskirts of Girona. News that one of Catalonia’s most lauded chefs was hosting the king did not go down well with some pro-independence campaigners. Lluc Salellas, a city councillor for the far-left Popular Unity Candidacy (Cup), published an open letter to Roca and his two brothers, urging them not to host the event. “Rethink allowing Felipe of Bourbon, who justified the violence against thousands of Catalans - including hundreds of people from Girona - into your house, the Mas Marroch, to preach his words in our region,” said the letter. Others have called for a boycott of El Celler de Can Roca, while a local branch of the Cup tweeted an upside-down picture of the Roca brothers next to the image of a burning photograph of the king, with a caption reading: “Don’t forget, don’t forgive!!!” Roca responded to his critics on Wednesday, telling them the decision had nothing to do with politics and had been taken only because the auditorium was not available. “We’re hurt,” he told the Catalan radio station RAC1. “What’s happening seems unfair to us. The only thing we want to say is that we do not have to do politics. We’re cooks. A restaurant is about hospitality. We do our job.” However, Salellas accused the Rocas of being disingenuous. “The Roca brothers have a standing and a public reach that means they can receive thanks and congratulations,” he told RAC1. “But it also means they can receive criticism from those who don’t agree with their decision. They’re taking sides: by accepting the king’s attendance, they’re making a decision. That’s legitimate and respectable and we’re not questioning it. But I don’t think it’s right to suggest this isn’t a political gesture.” Carles Puigdemont, who was sacked as Catalan president by the Spanish government for staging the referendum and unilaterally declaring independence last October, was born in Girona province. The deposed premier also served as mayor of Girona city. A spokesman for the city council said the auditorium and another venue were scheduled to undergo works at the time of the awards ceremony. But he said the mayor, Marta Madrenas, who is a member of Puigdemont’s Together for Catalonia party, opposed the foundation’s use of the auditorium in any case. “The mayor has suggested that the auditorium’s management should not host the foundation’s prizes in future years,” he said. “The reason is the speech the king gave on 3 October, for which Girona city council declared him persona non grata by a wide majority.” The local council in the nearby municipality of Caldes de Malavella said it would protest against the king’s visit by naming a square to commemorate the holding of the independence referendum. In a statement, it said: “The king is not welcome in Caldes de Malavella. The municipality has not forgotten the angry speech he made on 3 October, with its absolute silence over the victims of the brutal police repression that saw peaceful citizens in Catalonia beaten and attacked on 1 October.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/jun/20/steve-trevor-return-wonder-woman-2-absurd-resurrection-superhero","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-20T15:44:36Z","webTitle":"Is Steve Trevor's return in Wonder Woman 2 just another absurd resurrection?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jun/20/steve-trevor-return-wonder-woman-2-absurd-resurrection-superhero","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/jun/20/steve-trevor-return-wonder-woman-2-absurd-resurrection-superhero","fields":{"headline":"Is Steve Trevor's return in Wonder Woman 2 just another absurd resurrection?","bodyText":"In the pages of Marvel and DC Comics, it has become something of a running joke that dead superheroes rarely stay down for long. Captain America, Batman, Superman and Spider-Man have all spent time in an apparently lifeless condition, only to be miraculously restored to merrily continue their adventures. The Dark Knight was revealed to have been transported to the stone age after apparently dying at the hands of Darkseid in 2009’s Final Crisis series, and had to travel back through the centuries to take up the cape and cowl once again. Meanwhile, Peter Parker spent the best part of two years locked in a corner of Otto Octavius’s mind after the supervillain transferred his consciousness into Spider-Man’s body in the 2012 Dying Wish episode. Think that’s outlandish? Steve Rogers (Captain America) was eventually revealed to have been phasing in and out of time for two years, rather than being bounced from this mortal coil, following the landmark The Death of Captain America comic in 2007. Whether such outlandish revelations would work on the big screen is open to question. Warner Bros’ DC Extended Universe has already borrowed heavily from 1992’s The Death of Superman for the storyline in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice and sequel Justice League, which saw Kal-El destroyed by Doomsday, only to be brought back by something called a Mother Box. But if director Zack Snyder had used the original storyline in full, we would have been treated to the high whimsy of four replacement “men of steel” emerging in the aftermath of Superman’s demise. It is probably enough if I tell you that one of these, Cyborg Superman, is basically a robot, and another, named Steel, wears an armoured suit and wields a hammer. But if DC and Marvel’s big-screen writers aren’t yet supping quite so hard from the hallucinogenic Kool-Aid as their print counterparts, they are at least eyeing that tantalising straw with greedy peepers. The past week has seen news break that Chris Pine’s Steve Trevor, whose heroic demise in last year’s Wonder Woman perfectly rounded off the emotional and romantic arc of Patty Jenkins’ origins tale set in the first world war, will inexplicably be back in the upcoming 80s-set sequel. And anyone who thinks the cavalcade of superheroes who met their end following Thanos’s climactic finger click in Avengers: Infinity War are going to stay murdered has clearly not been keeping one eye on Marvel’s upcoming slate, which features new solo outings for the apparently dead Spider-Man and Guardians of the Galaxy (the latter cosmic superhero team’s numbers having been uncomfortably reduced to Rocket Raccoon and possibly Sean Gunn’s Kraglin.) Moreover, the trend seems to have jumped the species barrier from comic-book flicks into mainstream fantasy and sci-fi. The next Star Trek movie is due to star Chris Hemsworth’s George Kirk, AKA James T’s dear old dead dad, despite him having copped it at the hands of angry Romulan rebels in 2009’s Star Trek. Nobody knows quite how the team will explain this one away, but we can assume it has something to do with Hemsworth having become a huge star in the intervening years as a result of his Marvel forays as Thor. To be fair to the makers of the current Star Trek movies, the long-running space saga has been doing this since at least 1984, when a certain taciturn Vulcan was preposterously brought back as a memory-imbued clone of himself in The Search for Spock. Trevor’s return in the upcoming Wonder Woman 1984 has its origins in some equally unsatisfying comic book episodes, which have variously seen the military man brought back to life as a dark-haired version of himself and replaced by a doppelganger from an alternative dimension. It could also be a sly nod to the classic television series starring Linda Carter, which featured father-and-son Steve Trevors across multiple timelines (originally a second world war setting, then later in the modern day) played by the same actor, Lyle Waggoner, in a fairly damning indictment of bargain-bin 1970s casting conventions. The internet has also suggested Trevor could be a clone of himself, or resurrected by Wonder Woman using technology similar to Ra’s al Ghul’s Lazarus Pits, or simply a figment of Diana Prince’s imagination – though this hardly explains why he is wearing 80s threads in publicity shots. If they insist on going down this ill-trodden path, Jenkins and her team need to avoid the spectacular blunders made by others before them. There was equally great excitement when it was revealed in trailers for last year’s Kingsman: The Golden Circle that Colin Firth’s dapper spy Galahad had survived his apparent demise in the original Kingsman. Bloggers queued up to speculate on how the suave secret agent might have escaped death. And yet the character’s eventual return – and the big tech-reveal that explained his resurrection – undermined everything that followed. Likewise, Superman’s return in Justice League was downright weird, though that may have been something to do with Henry Cavill’s ungainly CGI-assisted shave. Perhaps the most subtly rendered example of a return from the dead in movie history is Gandalf’s resurrection in The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, which is left almost entirely to viewers’ imaginations, just as it was in JRR Tolkien’s original fantasy tome. Such gentle sleight of hand worked because Middle Earth is a world of magic and wonder, overseen by hidden all-powerful gods. And herein lies the biggest clue to Trevor’s return, even if it will still probably end up feeling like another cheap Hollywood trick. For the DC universe – in particular Wonder Woman’s corner of it – is exactly the same."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/live/2018/jun/20/county-cricket-surrey-somerset-essex-notts-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-20T19:06:34Z","webTitle":"County cricket: Surrey take charge in top-of-the-table clash with Somerset","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2018/jun/20/county-cricket-surrey-somerset-essex-notts-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2018/jun/20/county-cricket-surrey-somerset-essex-notts-live","fields":{"headline":"County cricket: Surrey take charge in top-of-the-table clash with Somerset","bodyText":"In the top-of-the-table clash at Guildford Surrey’s young batsmen made hay on a ground parched mustard by the summer. As supporters on white bucket seats flexed their bare toes in the sun, first Rory Burns, then Scott Borthwick, then Olly Pope made half centuries as Surrey reached 351 for five at stumps against Somerset. The 20-year old Pope looked in wonderful touch and finished unbeaten on 73. Somerset, who chose not to contest the toss, bowled without much luck. There was a wicket for Dominic Bess and four overs for Jack Leach, back in the side for his first game since being hit with a ball in the nets in early May. At New Road Lancashire made a late-afternoon hash of their innings, going from 77 without loss to 86 for five, with ducks for Stephen Parry, Shivnarine Chanderpaul, Rob Jones and the luckless Haseeb Hameed. Ed Barnard took four wickets. Lancashire had earlier bowled out Worcestershire for 247, with four wickets each for Joe Mennie and Jordan Clark. Daryl Mitchell held the batting together with 118. A superb 146 from Ross Taylor guided Nottinghamshire to 311 for six against Essex at Chelmsford. There were two wickets each for Matthew Quinn and Simon Harmer.

Then Warwickshire collapsed to 71 for eight, reaching three figures, finishing on 125, thanks only to a 51-run ninth-wicket partnership between Jonathan Trott (59 not out) and Henry Brookes. Runs flowed at Arundel, where Sussex finished on 439 for five against Durham thanks to maiden first-class centuries for Philip Salt and, in his third first-class game, Tom Haines. At Grace Road 151 not out for Colin Ackermann guided Leicestershire to 353 for eight. Middlesex’s Tim Murtagh took five for 52. It was a rain-shortened day at Swansea, where Glamorgan slipped to 52 for five. But Chris Cooke had shepherded the tail to 175 for seven at stumps. In the pink-ball game at Wantage Road Northamptonshire were dismissed for 282, with Richard Levi, Ben Duckett and Luke Procter all making fifties. In reply Gloucestershire were 25 for one.

And that’s stumps at Guildford, with Surrey on top at 351 for 5. Pope 73 not out off just 85 balls, Jacks not out 15. The pair of them looked young as new lambs with helmets in their arms, walking off the pitch. The shadows are growing and the spectators potter off the ground towards Woodbridge Road. Close of play scores to follow. Many thanks for your company! A WICKET at New Road. Davies out for 43, Lancashire now 77 for 1, and they save Hass and send in Stephen Parry. Three of this Surrey team are home-grown British-Asian players: Harinath, Patel and Virdi. Good to see. Incidentally it has clouded over here at Guildford, with the wind lightly buffeting the roofs of the festival tents. And the umpires seem to be changing the ball after only 12 overs or so of the new ball. Ollie Pope has a sweet touch with the bat. An empty train trundles over the red-brick bridge, off on its meander via Cobham. And that’s enough disjointed thoughts. Lancashire making a good start against Worcestershire - 56 for 0. And the Glamorgan recovery continues - 106 for 5. Warwickshire now 8 down,for 82, Trott 32 not out. Poor Tunbridge Wells - it could be all over by tomorrow. And fifty for Ollie Pope! Ten smashing fours off 60 balls. Numbers 6 and 7 for Glamorgan rubbing away some of the rouge of humiliation. Now 87 for 5 against Derbyshire. Taylor moves on to 130 for Notts; Ballance and Brook’s 100-run partnership at the Ageas comes up in 155 balls. Finch passes 50 in the run-fest at Arundel. Warwickshire now 65 for 7, Trotty surveying the burning deck - not out 29. I sense the official Lancashire twitter account is watching through its fingers: “We’ve got through 10 overs of the @LancsCCC innings, 23-0 with @JetJennings 14* &amp; @aldavies23 8* in reply to Worcs’ 247ao #WORvLAN 5:10 PM - 20 Jun 2018” Trying to identify a pied wagtail on the outfield, I miss Patel driving at Abell, caught two short of his fifty. Surrey nearly but not totally on top: 300 for 5 Ballance and Brook going well against the pink ball, last year’s U19 captain Harry Brook 48 not out. Trott trying his best to save Warwickshire’s bacon with 27 not out. Ollie Pope now the second Surrey batsman to make 500 Championship runs this season. Young Ryan Patel nearing a deserved half-century, watchful, precise. Oh, Glamorgan. Not a great start at Swansea: 52 for 5, 3 for12 for Tony Palladino. Worse news still, Khawaja is already out, for 5. Another wicket at Arundel - Salt out for 130, a second wicket for Salisbury. Pope looking in gorgeous touch here at Guildford: 20 runs, all in boundaries. Chaos at Tunbridge Wells, Warwickshire 35 for 4, with the unplayable, evergreen Darren Stevens causing mischief with 2 for 9. Trott, not out 13. Tumult at Guildford: Another WICKET as de Bruyn looks to go inside out, skips down the pitch and whacks it to at extra-cover. A duck in his first innings in Championship cricket. Surrey 247 for 4. Borthwick out for 83, bowled by Tim Groenewald, one that nipped back. A lovely little innings. Surrey 247 for 3. And Worcestershire have been bowled out while I was looking elsewhere - Mitchell last man out for 118. Four wickets each for Clark and Mennie. And they run a rare three at Guildford. Division One Surrey v Somerset, Guildford. Surrey 239 for 2 (Borthwick 82 not out, Patel 30 not out) Worcestershire v Lancashire, New Road. Worcestershire 239 for 2 (Mitchell 114 not out; Mennie 4 for 43, Clark 3 for 52) Essex v Nottinghamshire, Chelmsford. Nottinghamshire 229 for 3 (Taylor 110 not out) Hampshire v Yorkshire, Ageas Bowl. Day/night: Yorkshire 94 for 3 (Ballance 39 not out, Brook 34 not out. Division Two Sussex v Durham, Arundel. Sussex 279 for 2 ( Salt 126 not out) Leicestershire v Middlesex, Grace Road. Leicestershire 202 for 5 (Ackermann 76 not out) Kent v Warwickshire, Tunbridge Wells. Kent 197 all out (Denly 59; Barker 5 for 32) Glamorgan v Derbyshire, Swansea: Start was delayed. Glamorgan 26 for 0. Northamptonshire v Gloucestershire, The County Ground. Day/night: Northants 131 for 3 (Duckett 52, Procter 49) And a hundred for Ross Taylor at Chelmsford, while Yorkshire have recovered to 80 for 3 thanks to Ballance and Brook. Leicester a steady 194, Ackermann 75 not out, and Kent all out for 197 amongst the rhodedendrums. Tea scores to follow shortly Make that 232 for 8, Morris for 0, a second wicket for Clark. And that’s a super hundred for Daryl Mitchell who has led a great fightback this afternoon against Lancashire, Worcestershire 232 for 7. Swept to the boundary second ball by Borthwick. Here ends the ball-by-ball commentary. On the money first ball. I really, really didn’t mean to jinx Tom Haines. Sorry Tom. Anyway, you got 124. Are Durham going to have their becoming-traditional two-days-bad, two-days-good match? And replacing Dom Bess at the pavilion end we have Jack Leach... Surrey 212 for 2. At Arundel centuries each for Philip Salt - thrust into the opening role because of injury - and Tom Haines, chucked in to the team this morning when Chris Jordan was picked off by the Lions. “Keep an eye on Tom Haines,” says Sussex expert Bruce Talbot, “he’s one to watch.” Sussex 253 for 1. Mitchell helping the Worcestershire tail to a very healthy wag against Lancashire: he’s put on 45 now for the seventh wicket with Ross Whiteley. Surrey now level on points with Somerset at the top of the table as the 200 comes up. In the other pink-ball game: Northants 105 for 2; Duckett out for 52; Matt Taylor 2 for 28. And at Guildford, we get our second look at Dom Bess, but still no sign of Leach... Eeek! Yorkies. 21 for 3. Pujara b Steyn 0; Lyth c Alsop b Berg 21. A pic so you can see just how scorched the grass is https://twitter.com/SomersetCCC/status/1009425570222964736 It’s so lovely to watch cricket at a ground where everyone is perched on their little white bucket chairs around the boundary, hats firmly on, shoes off, busy festival tent selling HogsBack Brewery pints, trees floating upwards towards the sky. Borthwick moves towards an easy fifty as 20 year old Patel, waits, waits, to get off the mark. A WICKET at Guildford. Rory Burns lbw playing across the line for 66, just slightly above his first-class average, spoils to Lewis Gregory. Surrey 158 for 2 as England U-19 Ryan Patel walks in. Worcestershire whooping it up now at New Road: Daryl Mitchell moves onto fifty. 133 for 5. Chris Nash has been out at Chelmsford for 51, a second wicket for Quinn. A very aesthetically pleasing scorecard at the Ageas. Yorkshire 10 for 1, Lyth 10, Lees 0, Pujara 0, extras 0. It works better vertically. Cripes! Salt’s got the first hundred of the round at Arundel, 15 fours. And young Haines is 80 not out. Leicestershire continue their recovery at Grace Road, now 118 for 3. Ackermann 44 not out while Kent are 6 down at Tunbridge Wells for 158 Pink ball working very well for Northants - perhaps they could take it around with them? Ben Duckett 41 not out, Northants 65 for 0 off ten. Yorkshire make a terrible start with their makeshift team. One for 1 in the first over. Lees lbw Edwards 0. An expert in the press-box has pointed out that something the selectors might not like is Burn’s very quick glance to the right just before the bowler releases the ball. Surely not? Seems to work for him... And that’s Burns’ fifty, four through cover. Surrey 122 for 1. Eavesdropping on Alec Stewart talking to David Fulton about Rory Burns on Sky: “What more does he have to do?... I’ll be staggered, annoyed, disappointed if he is not picked for the Lions games against India A in July.” And the day-nighter at the County Ground starts with a bang! Ben Duckett, who perhaps spent yesterday watching England playing knock-about at Trent Bridge, whallops five fours in an over. bang.https://twitter.com/NorthantsCCC/status/1009415957914312705 And Burns resumes as he was after lunch, hitting Davey to the boundary first ball. Lunchtime scores Division One Surrey v Somerset, Guildford. Surrey 98 for 1 (Burns 31, Borthwick 8) Worcestershire v Lancashire, New Road. Worcestershire 84 for 5 (Mitchell 25 not out; Mennie 3 for 21) Essex v Nottinghamshire, Chelmsford. Nottinghamshire 109 for 2 (Nash 48 not out) Hampshire v Yorkshire, Ageas Bowl. Day/night: play due to start at 2pm. Division 2 Sussex v Durham, Arundel. Sussex 130 for 1 ( Salt 59 not out, and young Tom Haines, only playing because Jordan was called into the Lions squad, 62 not out.) Leicestershire v Middlesex, Grace Road. Leicestershire 84 for 3 (Ackermann 30 not out) Kent v Warwickshire, Tunbridge Wells. Kent 104 for 4 (Hannon-Dalby 2 for 23) Glamorgan v Derbyshire, Swansea: No play yet due to rain. Northamptonshire v Gloucestershire, The County Ground. Day/night: play due to start at 1.30pm. There’s just time for Scott Borthwick to push a beautifully-timed four in the last over before lunch, then the players trot off for sandwiches. Surrey 98 for 1. Rory Burns 31, Scott Borthwick 8. Lunchtime updates to follow. And another one down at Grace Road, Cosgrove for 16. And I’d missed Patel falling, lbw for for 20. Notts close to a hundred before lunch - 97 for 2. Wickets tumbling at New Road, two wickets in two balls for Joe Mennie and Worcestershire down to the bare bones at 82 for five. WICKET! A dejected Harinath thumps his bat on the ground on his slow walk back to the pavilion. lbw Tom Abell for 48. Surrey 83 for 1. Sorry about the slow updates, the wifi is slightly dodgy, but we have just been bought egg mayonnaise sandwiches and a KitKat to munch while Surrey continue with run-manna. And Bess comes into the attack, before 12.30 on the first day with short boundaries, the sun shining and two batsmen set on chunky runs. Notts have also passed fifty at Chelmsford, Chris Nash 34 not out, Samit Patel 19not out. And Sussex are fair motoring at Arundel - 77 for 1. Philip Salt 37 not out. A beautiful shot by Harinath rings up the Surrey fifty. He’s scoring at double the pace of Burns. A man on a mission. And another wicket down at New Road where the Lancashire attack are sharing out the spoils. This time Joe Clarke departs, b Mennie for 21. Worcs: 54 for 3. I see that Lancs are persevering with Haseeb Hameed despite his Championship average of 5. Come on Hass, this time... Play due to start again at Grace Road after a break for rain, with Leicestershire 25 for 2. No play at all yet at Swansea, where rain is miserably spoiling the festival bunting. This is the ICC future tours programme - it is a headache inducing document, don’t try to look at it if you have anything even resembling a hangover. I THINK it is saying England play Ireland next July. Bright sunshine here at Guildford where the lack of rain is evident on the outfield - so dry that it looks almost sandy. Surrey have made a good start, 30 for 0. Rory Burns, leading scorer in Division One, continues in the same commanding form and Arun Harinath is making the most of a chance of first-team cricket. He is currently second-team captain, and made hundreds in each innings here a few years ago when Rory Burns was out with a broken jaw. Yikes, wickets tumbling everywhere - Kent now 30 for 2, with Bell-Drummond joining Guptill back in the pavilion. Leicestershire 25 for 2 - with a wicket each for Murtagh and Finn. And another early breakthrough for Lancashire, Tom Fell b by Tom Bailey for 10. Worcestershire 28 for 2. And a few early wickets round the country - at New Road Martin Guptill is caught off Onions for 2, Worcestershire 5 for 1. At Arundel Luke Wells fell early for 8, Sussex 10 for 1. And at Tunbridge Wells, Sean Dickson bowled Barker for 1. Kent 15 for 1. Hello and welcome to this midsummer round of Championship cricket, with the days at their longest and most perfect for cricket watching. We have a full round of matches including festival games at Arundel, Swansea, Guildford, and Tunbridge Wells – get along if you can. We also have the first two pink-ball clashes of the season, with matches at the Ageas Bowl, starting at 2 o’clock, and at the County Ground, starting at 1.30pm. Division One Here at Guildford, we have the mouth-watering prospect of a top-of-the-table clash between Surrey and Somerset. Jack Leach returns alongside Dom Bess at a new-look Guildford with a revamped pavilion jointly funded by Guildford Borough Council and Surrey CCC. Both sides are missing players to the England Lions: Ben Foakes, the Curran brothers and Craig Overton. Ollie Pope, a product of Guildford colt’s system, will keep wicket for Surrey and blink and you’ll miss him overseas signing Theunis de Bruyn joins the team. Mark Stoneman is missing with personal issues, replaced by Arun Harinath. At New Road Worcestershire take on Lancashire, who batted dreadfully in the previous game against Essex at Old Trafford. Liam Livingstone and Matt Parkinson are away with the Lions, Keaton Jennings is expected to captain. Brett D’Oliveira will lead Worcestershire in place of Joe Leach, who has been ruled out for the rest of the season with a stress fracture of the back. Martin Guptill and Steve Magoffin are added to the squad. In the day-night game at the Ageas Bowl, seventh-placed Hampshire entertain a depleted Yorkshire missing five players to the England one-day squad and Tom Kohler-Cadmore and Matt Fisher to England Lions. Ollie Rayner joins Hampshire on a month’s loan from Middlesex because of injuries to Mason Crane and Brad Taylor and Liam Dawson’s absence, also with the Lions. This game is the first to feature the pink Kookaburra, being trialled this season in Division One floodlit games. Hampshire slipped to seventh after a home defeat by Surrey in their last match, despite having Dale Steyn to share the new ball with Kyle Abbott. Yorkshire are looking for revenge after defeat in the James Vince-fest in the Royal London One-Day Cup on Monday. At Chelmsford, third-placed Essex take on fourth-placed Nottinghamshire who have suffered consecutive defeats. Nottinghamshire are missing Steven Mullaney, who will lead the Lions in their tri-series games; Alastair Cook plays for Essex who will be lead by Tom Westley with Ryan ten Doeschate still suspended. Division Two At St Helens, centurion Usman Khawaja makes his home debut for Glamorgan against Derbyshire who are still missing Luis Reece with injury. At beautiful Tunbridge Wells, Kent take on top-of-the-table Warwickshire, who have only won one once here in 10 Championship games. Warwickshire come into the game full of confidence, after Ian Bell’s double century inspiration against Glamorgan in the last round and four wins from their first five matches. Kent are missing Sam Billings, so Joe Denly continues as captain, Warwickshire are without the injured Oli Stone and Sam Hain with the Lions. At Grace Road Leicestershire play a Middlesex missing Eoin Morgan with England, and Nick Gubbins and Tom Helm with the Lions. Rejuvinated Leicestershire under the leadership of Paul Horton aim for a third consecutive Championship win. Bottom of the table Northants remain winless and well adrift at the bottom of the table after suffering their fourth defeat in five matches, but will hope that the pink-ball fixture can inspire a return to form against Gloucestershire, who batted out a draw against Kent last week. At Arundel, Durham hope to continue the form that has seen them pluck victory from the jaws of defeat in their last two home games. Sussex include Chris Jordan, Jofra Archer and Laurie Evans in their Championship squad for the first time this season."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/20/west-ham-sign-lukasz-fabianski-transfer-premier-league","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-20T09:28:26Z","webTitle":"West Ham sign Poland goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski from Swansea","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/20/west-ham-sign-lukasz-fabianski-transfer-premier-league","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/20/west-ham-sign-lukasz-fabianski-transfer-premier-league","fields":{"headline":"West Ham sign Poland goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski from Swansea","bodyText":"West Ham United have continued to bolster their rearguard by signing Lukasz Fabianski for an undisclosed fee from Swansea City. The Poland goalkeeper has joined on a three-year deal after Swansea’s relegation from the Premier League and is a replacement for Joe Hart, whose disappointing loan spell from Manchester City has ended. Fabianski is expected to compete with Adrián for the goalkeeper’s position. The 33-year-old, who is in Russia for the World Cup but did not play in Poland’s 2-1 defeat by Senegal on Tuesday, is West Ham’s second signing in as many days as the club’s rebuilding for a first season under Manuel Pellegrini continues apace. On Tuesday they broke their transfer record with the £22m capture of the France under-21 centre-back Issa Diop. Pellegrini has also signed the full-back Ryan Fredericks from Fulham this summer. “West Ham is a massive club so I’m really happy to be joining at such an exciting time,” said Fabianski, who was voted Swansea’s player of the year last season. “I will do my best on and off the pitch to help the team to achieve the best results possible and can’t wait to start this new chapter of my career.” Mario Husillos, West Ham’s new director of football, said: “Lukasz is an experienced and established Premier League goalkeeper, with great quality that he has shown at both domestic and international level. He fits perfectly the mould of the modern goalkeeper, with excellent agility, presence and distribution, and will bring strong competition to the position.” Leicester seal Maddison move, Huddersfield sign Bacuna Leicester have completed the £24m signing of James Maddison from Norwich. The attacking midfielder has signed a five-year deal at the King Power Stadium. “I’m really happy to be here,” Maddison told Leicester’s official website. “I had a good chat with the manager about football and how he wants me to play, how he likes to play and I was sold. I haven’t looked back since that phone call.” “Leicester just seems like the right fit for me,” the England Under-21 international added. “I’ve got a good feel about the club and I can’t ignore that, in my head and my heart. I’m delighted and can’t wait to get started.” Claude Puel, the Leicester manager, said: “James is a wonderful player who is one of the most exciting young talents in English football. He’s a young player who can create things in the attacking third. He has good ability and also good potential to develop even more, which is exciting for the team and for the supporters.” Huddersfield have signed the midfielder Juninho Bacuna from Dutch side Groningen for an undisclosed fee. The 20 year old, a Netherlands U-21 international, has agreed a three-year contract with the Premier League club. Arsenal appear to be edging closer to the signing of Lucas Torreira. The club have already agreed a £26.4m (€30m) deal to sign the Sampdoria midfielder and Arsenal were discussing personal terms with the Uruguayan’s representatives in Milan last Tuesday. On Tuesday night, the Serie A side’s president, Massimo Ferrero, suggested Unai Emery’s third summer signing was a done deal. “Torreira has left for €30m,” he said, speaking to Sportitalia. “I bought him from Pescara when no one believed. We bet and we won, paying just €3m. The money that comes in is used to keep the club going.” Gareth McAuley, Claudio Yacob and Boaz Myhill will leave West Brom at the end of the month. The trio’s contracts will not be renewed after the Baggies were relegated from the Premier League last season. James Morrison, who is also out of contract but missed a large part of the campaign through injury, is due to report back for pre-season training on Monday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"film/2018/jun/20/freak-show-review-trudie-styler-alex-lawther","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-20T15:00:43Z","webTitle":"Freak Show review – Trudie Styler looks for the funny side of bullying","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jun/20/freak-show-review-trudie-styler-alex-lawther","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/jun/20/freak-show-review-trudie-styler-alex-lawther","fields":{"headline":"Freak Show review – Trudie Styler looks for the funny side of bullying","bodyText":"Excellent actor Alex Lawther is all but insufferable in this glib, smug and overcooked high-school comedy drama, adapted from the 2007 novel by James St James and in which Trudie Styler makes her directing debut. Lawther plays Billy Bloom, a flamboyant gay teenager who is bullied by the mean boys and mean girls at his reactionary new high school, and is obsessed by memories of his wonderfully glamorous mother, played by Bette Midler. She is now separated from Billy’s father, an uncaring wealthy man with whom Billy must now live in a vast mansion – it is difficult to tell how ironic his endless self-pity is supposed to be. But, despite being savagely beaten and put into a temporary coma by homophobic jocks, Billy finds some comfort in his friendship with the school’s football star Flip Kelly (Ian Nelson), a sensitive guy who wants to be an artist. Billy finally hits on a great idea, which will fatefully divide the school: he will run for homecoming queen. The movie is tiresome and supercilious almost all of the time, and Lawther’s performance is directed with a heavy hand. Just as Oscar Wilde said that someone was “a peacock in everything but beauty”, the movie is a comedy about gay experience in everything but humour and insight. It has its moments, however. Billy’s self-dramatising sense of martyrdom is accompanied with a droll visual reference to the Last Supper. There is a shrewd comment on how middleweight masculinity is learned at high school: guys who are neither arty or jocks just keep their heads down and become stolid “seven-and-a-halfs”. Plus we get an amusing, slightly bizarre cameo from John McEnroe as Billy’s grumpy gym teacher."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/20/senegal-playing-for-africa-poland-group-h","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-20T09:30:37Z","webTitle":"Senegal are pride of Africa after breaking continent’s losing run","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/20/senegal-playing-for-africa-poland-group-h","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/20/senegal-playing-for-africa-poland-group-h","fields":{"headline":"Senegal are pride of Africa after breaking continent’s losing run","bodyText":"Senegal had to wait and it was a painful one. Drawn to play in the final tie of the first round of group fixtures, they watched as, one by one, their fellow African competitors slumped to defeat. First it was Egypt and Morocco; then Nigeria and Tunisia – all beaten and with only one goal to show between them. Even that was a penalty, scored by Tunisia’s Ferjani Sassi against England. Before Senegal’s bow against Poland at the Spartak Stadium on Tuesday, the manager, Aliou Cissé, said that Africa’s toils were not on his mind; they did not add up to additional pressure or motivation. It was a white lie. Senegal had felt it, all right. They knew they were playing for African pride. The truth came out after the 2-1 win over Poland, a success built on steely mentality as much as anything else. “We saw the other African teams lose their first games and it gave us power to play for Africa,” the striker Diafra Sakho, who was an unused substitute, said. “Now, all of Africa is happy.” Even Cissé did not downplay the significance of a win for Africa. “Absolutely, it was important,” he said. “Senegal represent the whole African continent. We are Senegal but I can guarantee that the whole of Africa is supporting Senegal. I get calls and lots of people are proud. We are proud to represent the African continent.” The notion of such a support network across say, Europe, is hard to imagine. But sporting togetherness in Africa is a powerful force. “It’s true and it’s important,” Sakho, the Rennes player, formerly of West Ham, said. “We need to be together if the African continent is going to win a World Cup. It’s a very important job for us to keep it this way, to play together. That way, we’re going to make a lot of victories.” Pelé’s prediction, made in the late 1970s, that an African nation would win the World Cup by 2000 has not aged well. Cissé was a midfielder in the Senegal team who reached the quarter-finals in 2002 but no African country has made it further. Cameroon (1990) and Ghana (2010) are Africa’s other nations who reached the last eight. “It’s time now to give us all in Africa one opportunity to win a World Cup,” Sakho said, bullishly, and Senegal are surely the continent’s best hope of progress this time, even if them winning it remains an outlandish prospect. The victory over Poland was sparked by a lucky break, when Idrissa Gana Gueye’s shot, which was going wide, ricocheted in off the Poland defender Thiago Cionek. There was a measure of controversy to their second. M’Baye Niang had been off the field for treatment and, when he returned, he raced straight on to Grzegorz Krychowiak’s woeful backpass to touch past the advancing goalkeeper, Wojciech Szczesny, and score. Cissé had been readying the substitute Cheikh Ndoye at the same time and Poland did not expect to see Niang. “It was bizarre,” Szczesny said. “The player who played the ball [Krychowiak] didn’t see their player had come back on to the pitch and he played it short. I was the only one who saw the danger so I had to react and come out or otherwise the player was through on goal but he got in front of me.” Sahko made the most persuasive point. “The referee gave Niang permission to come into the game and, if the referee gives his permission, it counts, this goal.” Senegal mustered only two shots on target, with the own goal not counting, and they did catch the breaks. But, equally, it was a tactical triumph for Cissé because his team never looked in trouble and they possessed speed and threat on the counterattack. Ismaïla Sarr on the right of the midfield three and Youssouf Sabaly at left-back have pace to burn. Senegal pressed high and they cut off the service to the Poland dangerman, Robert Lewandowski. “We managed to control the game tactically and emotionally,” Cissé said. “We won thanks to discipline. We had a very compact team, also very aggressive. We know that Poland can play two systems [4-4-2 and 3-4-3], which they did, and we knew exactly how they were going to move. We also knew that Lewandowski was the main element. We knew how to implement the right system.” Earlier on Tuesday, Japan had surprisingly beaten Colombia and there is the sense that Group H has been turned on its head. “Maybe for you it’s unexpected but we are happy,” Kalidou Koulibaly, the Senegal and Napoli centre-half, said. “It’s a difficult job but we know we can do it.” Senegal’s confidence has been pepped but, before Sunday’s tie against Japan in Ekaterinburg, the watchword remains humility. “We are not too euphoric because we know it will be a difficult match against Japan,” Cissé said. “We need to question everything and prepare for the Japan match in the same way.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"}]}}
