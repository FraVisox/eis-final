Islington council last week launched a not-for-profit energy firm, London’s first municipal operator in more than a century, while Doncaster’s energy company will start early next month. Portsmouth is also on the verge of becoming the first Conservative-controlled council to launch one, to bring down residents’ bills as well as bringing investment to the city. The first and best-known publicly owned energy companies, Robin Hood Energy in Nottingham and Bristol Energy, started two years ago. But the growing trend came to the fore this month when Nicola Sturgeon promised to create a Scottish public energy company by 2021. “No shareholders to worry about. No corporate bonuses to consider. It would give people – particularly those on low incomes – more choice and the option of a supplier whose only job is to secure the lowest price for consumers,” Scotland’s first minister said, in an echo of the marketing used by the councils who have already started their own energy companies. Sturgeon’s firm will be entering an increasingly crowded space: publicly owned firms include Liverpool’s Leccy, Derby’s Ram, and Leeds’ White Rose. Councils in Sussex are clubbing together to launch Your Energy Sussex latter this year. The driving forces for these councils stepping into the complex, heavily regulated energy space are largely twofold. One is the need to create a new revenue stream in a time of austerity, as well as rebuilding the public sphere – councils are perhaps most visible to residents when they close libraries and cut other services. But there is also a political project afoot as well, as Labour-controlled councils such as Nottingham push an agenda that has since been picked up by Jeremy Corbyn during the last election. There is also genuine concern over fuel poverty, and a hope that local authorities will be more trusted than the usual energy suppliers, that even Theresa May says have ripped customers off. “It’s about councils trying to provide a trusted and better service for people to switch. We want a challenger model to the big six,” said Labour MP Caroline Flint, whose Doncaster constituency will see the launch of publicly owned Great Northern Energy on 7 November. The flurry of such firms showed Labour’s manifesto pledge of a publicly owned energy supplier in each region was happening regardless of the party’s failure to win power in June’s snap general election, Flint said. Tackling the growing amount of households in fuel poverty, which number 2.5 million in England and Wales, is another big motivation. Steve Battlemuch, chair of the board of Robin Hood Energy and a Labour councillor, said: “Nottingham has a lot of fuel poverty, lot of people on prepayment meters [which people in energy debt are often moved on to]. That was what drove us: coming into the market and driving down prices for the customer.” Like other public firms, part of his sales pitch is that there are no corporate masters to pay. “There’s no shareholder bonuses, because there’s no shareholder apart from Nottingham city council. There’s no director bonuses. I had a cupcake on our first anniversary,” he said. Peter Haigh, managing director of Bristol Energy, said his organisation was more inclusive than private companies, and its physical presence in the city was a big attraction. “Customers can and do walk in, sign up and pay a bill. That often attracts customers who have never switched, people who can pop in face to face,” he said. Part of the reason councils are getting into energy is the barriers to market are not as great as they once were. Mark Coyle, strategy director of Utiligroup, which has provided services to most of the publicly owned energy companies, said: “We’ve been able to lower the barriers for them, without lowering compliance.” But while the sector appears to be burgeoning, combined these companies are a minnow compared with the blue whales that are the big six firms, which between them account for 80% share of the market. Bristol Energy is biggest publicly owned energy supplier, with about 110,000 customers; Robin Hood has just over 100,000. Both have created more than 100 jobs locally, but neither has yet recovered their start-up costs. Moreover, while such firms appear to be proliferating, most are simply rebranding off Robin Hood rather than setting up as fully licensed suppliers which can buy energy on the wholesale market. The approach has its critics. “Islington are doing a good thing but it’s a shame that they’ve had to go to Nottingham to buy the energy,” said Caroline Russell, a Green party London assembly member. Sadiq Khan, London’s mayor, has promised to create an energy company for Londoners, but has been slow to deliver. Last month he was advised by experts to piggyback off an existing supplier, rather than create his own licensed company. While cheaper and quicker to do, it would also mean he had less power and flexibility to offer something genuinely new and different compared with the 50-plus private firms already in the market. Nigel Cornwall, founder of energy analysts Cornwall Insight, said that while he was supportive of publicly owned energy companies, it was revealing that many councils were opting to ride on Robin Hood’s coat-tails rather than set up their own licensed firm. “This is high-risk stuff. The sector is complicated. You [the council] probably don’t have the resources. You’ve probably underestimated the costs. And that’s with costs of entry falling dramatically,” he said. Cornwall said he was also sceptical as to whether the companies would be sustainable and would become a permanent fixture in the market – but that would not stop them trying. Battlemuch said: “What we need to do is break through into the mass market. That’s what we’re trying to do.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2017/oct/20/black-students-on-oxbridge-we-need-to-change-the-narrative","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-20T16:41:50Z","webTitle":"Black students on Oxbridge: 'we need to change the narrative'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/oct/20/black-students-on-oxbridge-we-need-to-change-the-narrative","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2017/oct/20/black-students-on-oxbridge-we-need-to-change-the-narrative","fields":{"headline":"Black students on Oxbridge: 'we need to change the narrative'","bodyText":"Oxford and Cambridge must engage with students at a much younger age and state schools should better prepare their students for elite colleges, black British Oxbridge students say. Hope Oloye, 20, from Newham, east London, is the only black biomedical student in her year at Oxford. She only considered applying after being encouraged to do so by a tutor at her comprehensive. “My head of sixth form, who grew up in a council estate and went to Cambridge, called my mum in to speak to her and helped everyone with all Oxbridge applications. He made the applications with us and made sure we weren’t alone. He was really hands-on and dedicated. I just want black students to think they’re good enough,” Oloye said. Ten of the 32 Oxford colleges did not award a place to a black British pupil with A-levels in 2015 – the first such figures released by the university since 2010. Oriel College has offered one place to a black British A-level student in six years. Similar data released by Cambridge revealed that six colleges failed to admit any black British A-level students in 2015. Oloye said: “Oxford is completely different to Newham in every way. I expected it to be, but it was definitely a culture shock. It’s beautiful and calm, but it’s a lot less diverse. The people I’ve come across are friendly and open, and from all over the UK. But there’s definitely lots from the north London bubble. What weirded me out at first is that they all knew each other. I thought, where do you know each other from?” Oxford said students from black and minority ethnic backgrounds made up 15.9% of its 2016 UK undergraduate intake, up from 14.5% in 2015, and that offers to black students had more than doubled since 2010. Those figures include British Asian students and other minorities. Oloye said she was often the only black person in a room and felt at times that she could be perceived as representative of her race. “If I act badly, for example, it may reaffirm that black women are aggressive. I don’t think people do that intentionally, but I may be the only black woman these tutors have come across. I need to make sure the tone isn’t off. I’m hyper-aware that I’m hyper-visible” she said. Cambridge spends £5m a year on access measures including work with black and minority ethnic school pupils. The Oxbridge students who spoke to the Guardian said more needed to be done to engage with students at a younger age. Ssegawa-Ssekintu Kiwanuka, who graduated with a degree in chemical engineering from Cambridge in 2014, was one of only two black British students on his course. He said access schemes were failing because they targeted GCSE students and above, when it may be too late to help. “You have to sit the right GCSEs, they’ve got subjects, and it needs to be started earlier. They need to look at kids from 13. If we look at it like Premier League footballers, they’re getting trained from early on,” he said. “We’re having a go at Oxford and Cambridge but we need to look at society too – there is not enough focus on access.” Kiwanuka, now a musician known as Love Ssega, whose career began with the group Clean Bandit before going solo, only applied to Cambridge because his father contacted Bambo Akani, a black British Cambridge student who featured in a BBC documentary. “The image of black British boys is so bad. You’re always walking on eggshells, you’re scrutinised. That negativity is a big problem. Bambo was an older mentor, this is what we need: if there’s just one person to inspire you. If you’re a minority, you know you’re going to be a minority. I was able to talk to him, and he told me I’ll have a good time and work hard. “We need the Obama effect over here. You see Michelle Obama and you see they’re not acting up, they didn’t get kicked out. The Obamas did the presidency. We need to change the narrative. Then people are not going to be scared.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/oct/20/labour-mp-clive-lewis-apologises-for-get-on-your-knees-comment","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-20T18:33:49Z","webTitle":"Labour MP Clive Lewis apologises for 'get on your knees' comment","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/oct/20/labour-mp-clive-lewis-apologises-for-get-on-your-knees-comment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/oct/20/labour-mp-clive-lewis-apologises-for-get-on-your-knees-comment","fields":{"headline":"Labour MP Clive Lewis apologises for 'get on your knees' comment","bodyText":"The Labour MP Clive Lewis has apologised for using a misogynist phrase at a Labour party conference fringe event last month after being criticised by several prominent female colleagues. Video from the Momentum event in Brighton surfaced on Friday in which Lewis, the MP for Norwich, told the actor Sam Swann to “get on your knees bitch”. The language attracted widespread condemnation from politicians on all sides but Swann later described the situation as “jovial”. Harriet Harman wrote: “Inexplicable. Inexcusable. Dismayed.” Stella Creasy said: “It’s not OK. Even if it’s meant as a joke, reinforces menace that men have the physical power to force compliance.” Jess Phillips suggested bringing teenage girls to work in order to teach male colleagues about gender inequality. On Friday afternoon, Lewis tweeted that he apologised unreservedly for the language he used. A Labour spokesperson said the party condemned the language used by Lewis, adding: “It was completely unacceptable and falls far short of the standard expected of Labour MPs.” Swann told the Guardian: “It is clearly jovial and nothing vicious. He later told me to fuck off after he downed his can of Red Stripe and I offered him mine to down too and that was also clearly a joke. “The whole event was so brilliant for seeing MPs letting their hair down and fucking around with people who support them. I think Clive Lewis is an absolute legend.” The minister for women and equalities Justine Greening urged Jeremy Corbyn to condemn Lewis’s language. In a letter to the Labour leader, she said: “The recent use of language by Clive Lewis MP was totally and utterly unacceptable in the world of the ‘kinder, gentler politics’ you claim to support. “Senior women in the Labour party have understandably condemned his words, and as leader of the Labour party, you should too … Will you now step forward and condemn the sexist language of Clive Lewis, and the unacceptable attitudes that lie behind it, and set out how you plan to tackle misogyny in the Labour party?” Other panellists at the event, hosted by Novara media during the final night of The World Transformed, the Momentum-backed fringe festival, said the video was taken out of context. Aaron Bastani, the co-founder of Novara, posted a full video of the moment, and said: “Of course I don’t think a parliamentarian should use the B-word. But my God, you really understand why public thinks political class has lost it.” The Guardian columnist Dawn Foster tweeted: “For context, I’m stood next to Clive in this video – he said it to a male audience member in jest, not me.” Novara’s Ash Sarkar, who was compering the event, said: “I asked the audience for a volunteer to keep score in a gameshow section we were doing. The guy who came up is well-known to us, he’s doing a podcast with us. I gave him the notebook to keep score, and asked him to kneel down so the audience and cameras could see the stage. He made a little face, and then Clive jokingly said ‘on your knees, bitch’, to him. “The joke was delivered in a spirit of campy humour. It certainly wasn’t this kind of macho expression of sexual domination. It got forgotten as the gameshow went on.” Sarkar said there was “a rich tradition of leftist, subversive counter-culture, which often has relied on treading lines between the politically correct, the puerile, the extravagant, flamboyant energy that comes with causing a bit of a stir, while also at the same time being inclusive, loving and affectionate”. Lewis’s comment, she added, “was an expression of a boozy, raucous, party celebration, which was something which at the time made people feel quite close to the people who were on stage, that they weren’t these distant political or commentariat-type figures. “It was part of an endearing, informal vibe. Had it been used in a way that had made either our audience members, or the volunteer in question, or anyone else on the stage uncomfortable, then I’d be like yeah, let’s have a conversation about its appropriateness. But we can’t mistake puritanism for meaningful action on oppression. “There’s a certain irony in Guido Fawkes pushing this, when they’ve been one of the chief orchestrators of harassment against Diane Abbott, the most prominent black female politician in the UK.” The row comes after the Labour party launched an investigation into sexual harassment and assault, asking female activists and members to anonymously share their experiences with men in the party who had acted inappropriately or illegally. The website of the Labour Too campaign states: “We know that despite everything the Labour party stands for, women are not believed, told they are lying, or in some cases their potential careers within the party are threatened. “Your stories will be used to convince those who run our party to take these issues more seriously and create a consensus to change policy and cultural norms within our organisation.” Labour Too is not an official Labour party website."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/oct/20/brexiters-trying-to-bluff-no-deal-scenario-emmanuel-macron","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-20T17:05:36Z","webTitle":"Emmanuel Macron accuses Brexiters of bluffing over no-deal divorce","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/oct/20/brexiters-trying-to-bluff-no-deal-scenario-emmanuel-macron","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/oct/20/brexiters-trying-to-bluff-no-deal-scenario-emmanuel-macron","fields":{"headline":"Emmanuel Macron accuses Brexiters of bluffing over no-deal divorce","bodyText":"Emmanuel Macron has accused Brexiters of seeking to “bluff” the EU into softening its negotiating stance by championing a no-deal scenario. In a dramatic intervention at a summit of European leaders in Brussels, the French president said such an outcome was “in no case” part of the discussions, in an apparent reference to reports that the Brexit secretary, David Davis, was planning to positively present a plan to the UK cabinet for Britain to strike out of the EU without a deal. “There is one negotiator on the British side under the political authority of Theresa May,” Macron said. “At no moment has Theresa May ever raised a ‘no deal’ as an option. “If there are noises, bluff, false information by secondary actors or spectators to this discussion, that is … just life in these matters, or in the media. But in no case is it part of the discussions.” In response to the comments, Davis told broadcasters: “We don’t want a ‘no deal,’ but if one comes, we’ll be ready for it.” The clash came at the end of a summit at which the EU leaders agreed in just 90 seconds that insufficient progress had been made on the opening issues of citizens rights, the Irish border and the most thorny matter – the financial settlement – to allow trade talks with the British government to begin. Member states will instead discuss trade between themselves, in the hope that advances are made on the other issues before a summit on 14 December. Earlier, the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, talked up May’s efforts in the negotiations and suggested a deal was in sight. The president of the European council, Donald Tusk, also sought to shield May from criticism at home. He offered an olive branch to the British government by promising the EU would take account of UK proposals on future ties as it talks internally about the future. Tusk, who chairs EU leaders’ summits, said he wanted to be a “positive motivator” to get Brexit talks moving on to trade negotiations from December. “My impression is that the reports of the deadlock between the EU and the UK have been exaggerated,” Tusk told reporters . “While progress is not sufficient, it doesn’t mean there is no progress at all.” Tusk said he wanted to “reassure our British friends that in our internal work we will take account of proposals presented by them”. The British government has published a series of position papers on the UK’s ambitions for the divorce and future relationship, including future customs arrangements, security and foreign policy. But the EU has so far refused to discuss any of them until the divorce is settled. Macron, however, ripped up the script during a bullish press conference, which saw him insist that there was no question of the EU softening its demands to help May avoid political problems at home. The French president became the first leader to put a big number on the divorce bill when he dismissed May’s offer in her recent speech in Florence of €20bn, saying that amount is not even half of what is owed. “It’s not about making concessions,” Macron said. “I would say we are far from having reached the necessary financial commitments before we can open phase two [of the talks]. We are not halfway there.” The Guardian understands that Brussels has now settled on €60bn as the expected landing zone for any deal, less than some estimates but considerably more than many members of the British cabinet are likely to stomach. Macron said the costs of Brexit were unavoidable and the UK would need to make a “substantial effort” to break the deadlock over the talks. May was in political trouble at home, the French president suggested, due to the failure of those who had championed leaving the EU to spell out the dangers. “The problem for Mrs May is that those who pleaded in favour of Brexit never explained to the British people what the consequences would be,” he said. Earlier on Friday, May said the UK was examining “line by line” how much it should pay the EU when it leaves the union. She did not deny she had told EU leaders on Thursday night that her Florence speech was “not the final word” on what Britain was willing to pay as a financial settlement for Brexit. Asked whether it was conceivable that the total bill could reach €60bn, she did not dismiss the sum out of hand, However, Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, has previously said Brussels can “go whistle” for such an amount. May said: “I’ve been very clear on where we are in relation to the financial settlement. I’ve set out the reassurance to our European colleagues and we will go through that line by line in relation to the commitments that we’ve made in our membership. “And I’ve also said in the past, if there are particular programmes where we wish to continue to be a member then of course we would look at paying relevant costs in relation to that, programmes such as science and research, and perhaps some of the justice issues.” In their formal conclusions, the EU27 said they aimed to move to the second phase of negotiations “as soon as possible” and would reassess the state of progress at the next summit beginning on 14 December. But they noted that Britain had so far made no “firm and concrete commitment” to settle all of its obligations. Merkel said a breakthrough in December “depends to a large extent” on the UK: “The topic of financial commitments is the dominating issue in that regard,” she said. The Irish taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, said detail on the UK’s bill had still to be worked out. “There wasn’t anything new on the financial solution. That’s still ongoing,” he said. “Prime minister May has indicated that no European state should have to pay more or receive less than would have been the case had they not been leaving, that they would honour their existing commitments.” Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European commission, was asked if he agreed with the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, who repeatedly claimed at the end of the last round of talks that the negotiations were in deadlock. “In my rhetoric, I would have used the word deadlock four times, not only three times,” Juncker said. Standing alongside Tusk, Juncker also rebuffed May’s plea for help in selling a Brexit deal to the British public. “I would think that Mrs May has all the strength she needs to have the British people understanding what we are achieving as a final result.” Juncker criticised the “superficiality” of the British press, as well as UK politicians talking up a no-deal Brexit. “When some in the UK are pleading the cause of no deal, no one explains what that will mean. We need a British way of carrying out collective education because nobody explained in detail to British people what Brexit meant.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2017/oct/21/phone-hacking-terrible-greater-threats-online","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-21T23:05:35Z","webTitle":"Phone hacking was terrible, but there are greater threats online","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/oct/21/phone-hacking-terrible-greater-threats-online","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2017/oct/21/phone-hacking-terrible-greater-threats-online","fields":{"headline":"Phone hacking was terrible, but there are greater threats online","bodyText":"Two articles from two different media experts drop almost simultaneously. In one, Brian Cathcart, leading advocate for Hacked Off, upbraids the media secretary for continuing hints at relaxing press control implementation. “She needs us to think that there have been so many changes since 2013 that were not foreseen by government, parliament or the Leveson inquiry that she... has been obliged to step in and seek the best way to put things right. It’s just not true … “ Meanwhile, in a long read for the Atlantic, Alexis Madrigal sets a rather different time frame: “Things we thought we understood – narratives, data, software, news events – have had to be reinterpreted in light of Donald Trump’s surprising win, as well as the continuing questions about the role that misinformation and disinformation played in his election. “Tech journalists covering Facebook had a duty to cover what was happening before, during, and after the election… But no one delivered the synthesis that could have tied together all these disparate threads. It’s not that this hypothetical perfect story would have changed the outcome of the election. The real problem... is understanding the set of conditions that led to Trump’s victory. The informational underpinnings of democracy have eroded, and no one has explained precisely how.” Now, apples and pears. Cathcart pursues the events of 2003-07 zealously. Madrigal wouldn’t dream of delving into events so far past. Both see terrible threats looking back. But the gulf between their visions seems stark when you try to look forward.

The drop from the Aiguille du Midi, the 3,842m peak that towers over the French alpine town of Chamonix, had been one of Alexander Polli’s favourites. It was only right, says Schutte, to fly it in remembrance – accompanied by his friend’s spirit animal. “He was sometimes a little bit fat, not doing much exercise,” says Schutte. “I was like, ‘You’re not an eagle, bro. You’re a pig.’” Polli, who was just 31 when he died last year, was the Jimi Hendrix of wingsuit-flying, the supremely dangerous sport whose elite are revered like rock stars, thanks to the eye-watering feats they perform. Polli, like Schutte, had taught himself by trial and error to use the nylon-webbed suits that allow base-jumpers to ascend to the next terrifying level. Launching themselves from peaks and helicopters, they cut horizontally through the air at speeds that can exceed 200mph, “proximity-flying” just inches from rockfaces and buildings. There is little room for error on such high-octane flights – and none whatsoever on the 2013 stunt with which Polli made his name: threading the needle of a 25ft hole in a rockface in Spain’s Montserrat mountains, an accomplishment unusually extreme even by wingsuit standards. Rocketing down from a chopper towards a jagged escarpment, Polli needed absolute precision and commitment to hit his mark. Any unexpected air turbulence, distraction or hesitancy would have meant slamming face-first into rock. But the potential price of such daredevilry was brought home in August last year, at another popular site near Chamonix – the Couloir Ensa, where Polli was keen to try out a new corkscrew manoeuvre. Instead, he became one of seven proximity-flying deaths that year – a casualty rate that calls into question the sanity of anyone who feels the need to dress up like a flying squirrel and chuck themselves off a mountain. For wingsuit-fliers, the risk is worth it. “It’s one of the most archetypal human dreams,” says Richard Parry, director of Base, a new turbocharged film starring Polli and Schutte. “To fly unaided, where you are the bird, and every twitch of every muscle can move you this way or that. To course down valleys and over ridges.” Frequently filmed on GoPro cameras strapped to a person in flight, Base propels the viewer to the brink of the wingsuit experience – quite literally in the case of the opening scene, in which Polli ums and errs about taking one more step towards a precipice above Rio de Janeiro. For something that supplies such a visual kick, wingsuit-flying has featured little in film – outside of documentaries, only in a handful of scenes in such blockbusters as The Dark Knight Returns. Base is the first film drama to craft a decent story around the sport, one that digs into its dark side, its pressurised psychologies. Polli and Schutte play adrenaline junkies whose camaraderie is tarnished when Polli’s character falls for his mate’s girlfriend. His judgment at critical moments starts to waver – with drastic consequences. Parry, a former war photographer, started out with a screenplay about a base-jumping serial killer, but he decided it was too sensationalist, and opted instead to tackle preconceptions about extreme sports. “People shorthand all the time: ‘Oh, they’ve just got a death wish.’ They used to say that about me in conflict zones. It got irritating. It’s so thin. There’s so much more complexity to wingsuit-flying.” The director, a 50-year-old father, doesn’t and won’t participate. But when he contacted Polli for insight, the two bonded over their interest in risk assessment and self-control, subjects they discussed while peering over the edge of a limestone cliff on Switzerland’s Hinterrugg mountain, a plunge that leads to a nauseatingly tight canyon known as the Crack. “I said, ‘What do you do with the fear?’ It was the same as covering a war. If you resist it, it becomes insurmountable. It rules you. Polli would accept the fear, embrace it and turn it into something positive. Use it as an energy.” Schutte elaborates: “You will always feel fear, for sure, before every jump. But you start to get more aware of what you’re doing, whether your gear is set up properly. You take care of the little details. When you push off, in that moment the fear is gone. Now you are focused on doing the best possible jump. The fear returns when you have to deploy your parachute – whether it’s a two-second or a one-minute freefall.” Polli sometimes found that acting, particularly improvising, stripped him down to the bare essentials, in much the same way as base-jumping. He was particularly freaked out by the idea of performing in a death scene, only agreeing to do it in a single take. They succeeded only too well: some viewers have mistaken Base for a snuff movie. An Italian-Norwegian junior skiing and snowboarding champion, Polli was in the throes of youthful rebellion when Schutte first met him: “He didn’t like having any responsibilities. The world he was coming from was very plastic – rich people going to St Tropez.” The Venezuelan, 11 years older, became a surrogate big brother to the anarchic rich kid, who supported himself partly by playing online poker. “I was always the one taking care of stuff: ‘OK, we cannot leave this mess.’ It was like taking a master’s in patience.” The payoff was Polli’s generosity, lust for life and raw talent. “When you’re at the edge of the cliff, everybody is at the same level,” says Schutte. “Whether you’re the richest guy or the poorest. That amazed him.” Months before his death, he briefly stopped flying and started experimenting with ayahuasca, the Amazonian hallucinogenic vine, on trips to Peru. “Ayahuasca changed his life for good,” says Schutte. “He was becoming more conscious of other people. Before, he’d be farting in the cable car, not caring about anyone else.” At 7.30am on 22 August last year, Schutte found Polli up doing yoga. He was keen to fly the Couloir Ensa, a steep 400m gully near Chamonix where there are frequent avalanches. Schutte, who hadn’t flown much that season, didn’t understand the line his friend suggested and said that he would rather steer clear of any rock formations. Polli agreed to that different route and – unusually for him – said he would follow behind. His signoff was different, too. “Normally, he would say, ‘I love you, bro’ or something like that. This time it was, ‘Ciao, bro.’” When Schutte didn’t see his partner’s parachute open, he feared the worst and called a rescue helicopter before he’d even touched down. They reached Polli – who had crashed into a tree – in just eight minutes, but it was too late to save his life. Parry remembers getting the call. “It didn’t feel completely out of the blue,” he says. He delayed the release of the film, only moving forward with Polli’s family’s consent. His mother accepted his lifestyle – but tellingly she had bought him his first parachute, not his first wingsuit. Neither parent had been aware of the film. “They never realised their son was like a rock star,” Schutte says. “For them, he was a crazy spoilt kid. When they saw the love everybody had for him, they felt they should have spent more time with him – to understand what he was trying to do.” As well as serving as a memorial to Alexander Polli, Base also inadvertently documents the voyeuristic and narcissistic impulses that seem to govern life in the age of YouTube and social media. Polli’s character is continually filming himself, or editing his recordings. This urge to self-publicise is a far more pressing issue in the world of wingsuit-flying: some people think the prevalence of cameras has pushed risk-taking to even more extreme lengths, fuelling the recent rise in fatalities. But Parry’s conscience is clear. “I don’t feel any complicity,” he says. “Alex would have done it no matter what. Nobody forced him to the edge.” Base is in cinemas on 27 October, and available on iTunes and on demand from 6 November."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"fashion/2017/oct/20/howard-jacobson-right-about-getting-suited-up","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-20T17:34:29Z","webTitle":"Howard Jacobson’s right about getting suited up | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2017/oct/20/howard-jacobson-right-about-getting-suited-up","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2017/oct/20/howard-jacobson-right-about-getting-suited-up","fields":{"headline":"Howard Jacobson’s right about getting suited up","bodyText":"Bless you, Howard Jacobson (There is no excuse for a man not to wear a suit, Weekend, 14 October).

The Brexit negotiations are going better than EU leaders can let on","bodyText":"The European council’s decision to tell Theresa May to, in effect, “Go back, try harder” is no surprise. It always seemed overwhelmingly likely that the 27 heads of government would rubber-stamp the recommendation of their lead negotiator for Brexit, Michel Barnier, that the UK has not yet made “sufficient progress” to talk trade. And (whisper it) EU leaders seem to be rather enjoying the theatre of all this – why release the pressure when you can keep the squeeze on the Brits? But the simple truth is that there is probably relatively little that the UK could have done that would have persuaded the EU to green-light trade talks at this summit. Officials had already determined the outcome of the summit weeks ago. So the British team should be thinking Keep Calm and Carry On rather than crying May day. A lot has already been agreed in the negotiations. Angela Merkel’s comments yesterday that she has “no doubt” a Brexit deal will be secured are helpful. Yet in our divided post-referendum political landscape there is all too often an unfortunate tendency to abandon critical faculties when considering statements from Brussels, while rightly cranking them up to full dial when following government utterances. The idea is taking hold that the EU was right, or perhaps even acting in accordance with legal prescriptions, when it separated the talks into two phases – with “sufficient progress” required on three initial issues of EU citizens, the so-called divorce bill, and Northern Ireland, before moving on to considering trade and our future relationship. In fact, the EU’s decision to phase talks into these supposedly discrete elements is a profound error. How can progress seriously be made on the Northern Ireland/Ireland border without knowing the nature of the UK-EU future trading, customs and regulatory relationship? Equally, despite publicly saying that sufficient progress is not made, the European commission is privately telling politicians from EU member states that only “technical issues” remain to be resolved before settling on EU citizens’ rights. Meanwhile several of Open Europe’s contacts at the London embassies of EU member states have confirmed to us that they are pleased with developments in the talks. One embassy is even sending the message back to their capital that the UK had moved about as far as it could at this stage of the talks and there is a danger of backing the prime minister into a corner – precisely what May herself is now saying. Last week, I asked a foreign minister of a major EU member what would be needed for the UK to convince his country that sufficient progress had been made to start talking trade. The minister insisted that it wasn’t “time” yet. When I pressed on what policy or other commitment he thought was missing, he brushed off my concern. He explained that the UK and EU were like a couple who had only been out on four or five dates and weren’t ready to ... (that’s when he trailed off). Ultimately, the test of whether “sufficient progress” is made will be first and foremost a political one. Michel Barnier might as well be licking his finger and sticking it in the air to test the wind. So if it comes down to politics, how will this be resolved? May should reject calls to walk away from the talks. Britain should press on negotiating in good faith. The PM should keep reassuring member states that the UK has agreed both to honour commitments it made as a member, and to not leave a financial black hole during this EU budget period. But we also need to start preparing now for the next phase of talks. The cabinet has still not decided – nor even really debated – what sort of country we want to be post-Brexit. Do we want to stick as close as possible to the EU, taking all or almost all of their rules, without any say over forming them, so we can get the best possible market access? Or do we accept the cost of losing some EU market access for the greater opportunities of designing our own rules and regulations? This most fundamental of questions will need to be answered soon. We need to prepare and publish our high-level vision for the future UK and EU trade arrangements. And, if it’s not possible to resolve at this stage which model we prefer, we can lay out the options. The clock is ticking on article 50, but there’s still a good year remaining of substantive Brexit negotiations. Nonetheless there’s no time to be wasted. May forged a grownup consensus with her Florence speech – it has evidently had a positive effect on the talks. She will need to tread as carefully in the months ahead. • Henry Newman is director of the Open Europe thinktank"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"books/2017/oct/31/ancestors-in-the-attic-michael-holroyd-book-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-31T10:00:13Z","webTitle":"Ancestors in the Attic by Michael Holroyd – review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/oct/31/ancestors-in-the-attic-michael-holroyd-book-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/oct/31/ancestors-in-the-attic-michael-holroyd-book-review","fields":{"headline":"Ancestors in the Attic by Michael Holroyd – review","bodyText":"Within two slender and discrete volumes, distinguished biographer Michael Holroyd recounts the story of his isolated family.

An unusual photo of the German and French leaders, Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron, apparently covering their mouths while deep in conversation with a concerned-looking Theresa May has sparked all manner of theories. For some, the picture recalled a conspiratorial huddle of football players trying to conceal from the opposing team their options for a shot on goal. “May, Merkel and Macron going for the old hide-the-free-kick-plan-from-the-lipreader trick,” tweeted the Agence France-Presse reporter Danny Kemp. The gesture is common, too, among tennis doubles players running through their play for the next point, and rugby players debating lineout possibilities. Others suspected matters of a less sporting nature were being discussed. Some thought Macron and Merkel might have been discreetly swapping figures for the kind of sum Britain might have to offer for the Brexit financial settlement before the EU27 would be likely to accept it: “£40bn? No, more like £60bn, surely. Oh go on, then let’s settle on £50bn.” Others, rather more unkindly, suggested the chancellor and president were trying to entertain the British prime minister with amusing imitations of her disastrous Conservative party conference speech, during which May was overcome by coughing. For some, the photo reminded them of uncomfortable scenarios entirely unrelated to either Brexit or sport. “When your mates tell you your ex has just arrived at the club,” tweeted Mollie Goodfellow of the Sky News politics team. In fact, it seems the three leaders were talking about something else altogether. In what was doubtless a pre-planned photo opportunity to show that they would not allow something as trivial as Brexit to get in the way of their friendship, the trio apparently strode into the summit venue in deep conversation about the Iran nuclear agreement."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/20/lord-admiral-horatio-nelson-rotating-gems-chelengk-recreated-decades-after-original-stolen","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-20T17:00:02Z","webTitle":"Lord Nelson’s rotating gems recreated decades after original was stolen","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/20/lord-admiral-horatio-nelson-rotating-gems-chelengk-recreated-decades-after-original-stolen","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/20/lord-admiral-horatio-nelson-rotating-gems-chelengk-recreated-decades-after-original-stolen","fields":{"headline":"Lord Nelson’s rotating gems recreated decades after original was stolen","bodyText":"One of Admiral Lord Nelson’s most treasured possessions, which must have provoked stifled giggles when he switched on the clockwork mechanism and the great diamond in his hat rotated, has been recreated from the original designs more than half a century after it was stolen. The replica jewel – so delicate it needed emergency overnight repairs before the display – will be at the National Museum of the Royal Navy in Portsmouth Dockyard from 21 October – Trafalgar Day. It will be shown beside a black felt cocked hat, identical to those in which Nelson wore it, newly made by the admiral’s hatters, Lock &amp; Co, which still keep his measurements in their London workshops. The Chelengk, a plume of more than 300 diamonds, was presented by Sultan Selim III of Turkey after Nelson’s victory at the Battle of the Nile in 1798. It was reputedly taken from his turban and said to be the first such decoration presented to a non-Muslim. It included 13 diamond sprigs representing the ships sunk or captured by Nelson in the battle. The admiral wore the jewel on his hat for the rest of his life, setting a fashion that was copied by many admirers. He was so proud of it he added its image to his coat of arms. The historian Martyn Downer, whose book Nelson’s Lost Jewel is published this week, traced detailed early drawings that allowed the London jeweller Philip Denyer to recreate the lost treasure, complete with tiny hidden clockwork. He described the original as “one of the most historic, bizarre and instantly recognisable jewels in British history” – so intimately connected with Nelson’s image that it was even included in the towering memorial column in Trafalgar Square. The original had been on public display many times after Nelson’s death, until it was stolen from the National Maritime Museum in the early hours of the morning of 11 June 1951. The thieves used a folding ladder to break in through a window and smashed an 8ft glass case to get at the jewel. It had been inherited by Nelson’s brother and passed down through the family, gradually losing its clockwork and some of the decorative details, until it was sold in 1895 for £710. In 1929 it was bought for the nation by the heiress Lady Barclay and displayed with other memorabilia in the Painted Hall in Greenwich, where Nelson’s body had lain in state after his death at Trafalgar. After the second world war it was included in a Nelson display at the museum from which it was stolen. More than 30 years later a notorious cat burglar, George ‘Taters’ Chatham, claimed responsibility and said the jewel had been broken up and the diamonds sold “for a few thousand” – though when the theft was announced in parliament in 1951, the government offered a reward of £250, which was said to be far more than the value of the stones. No trace of it was ever discovered."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theobserver/2017/oct/21/letters-children-receive-worse-mental-health-care-than-adults","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-21T23:05:36Z","webTitle":"Children receive worse mental health care than adults | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2017/oct/21/letters-children-receive-worse-mental-health-care-than-adults","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/2017/oct/21/letters-children-receive-worse-mental-health-care-than-adults","fields":{"headline":"Letters: children receive worse mental health care than adults","bodyText":"I fully support the children’s commissioner’s request to NHS England to provide information about how local clinical commissioning groups are spending their increased budgets on community-based provision for children with mental health difficulties (“Children’s commissioner savages NHS…”, News). But there is another startling fact that she highlighted in her recent report. That is that the bulk of NHS mental health spending is accessed by only a tiny number of children, who are admitted to largely privately owned, low-secure hospitals. Unlike in adult mental health, no information is published on the outcomes. No one disputes that some children require in-patient treatment but for NHS England to be unable to say if this expensive treatment has had any benefit means public money is being spent without accountability and without consideration for the best interests of the child. After our adolescent daughter was placed in a low-secure hospital, there was little incentive from the hospital or child and adolescent mental health services – despite the legal necessity to ensure the least restrictive option – to make provision for her discharge. She spent 20 months in low-secure provision, only to be transferred to an adult hospital once she reached 18. When there, she was discharged home within the month. This is not because the adult hospital was “better” but because the consultant and community-based services accepted that prolonged hospital stays for particular mental health difficulties can be counterproductive. Adult services provide good local crisis care, something that should be more readily available in children’s mental health provision. Deborah Stott London SE19 Breaking down borders Scottish and Catalan questions are symbolic of our inability to define and understand the purpose of a nation state. Clearly, both need the intricate trade and commerce arrangements that surround them, yet they want independence to “feel” independent, a mixture of pride and control. Is this not the same as Britain’s struggle with the EU? The rhetoric of those wishing to disband the EU, taking back our borders, having our own laws, falls short without an explanation of what these things mean. We have 48 counties in England, each with a border, an administration and a sense of individual pride. In truth, these boundaries have been weakened by relentless abstraction of power to the state. The sharing of this power with the United Nations and the European Community weakened all boundaries, from parish to nation state. But all benefited. The UN Declaration of Human Rights (a British concept) outlawed wife beating in every parish. It is impossible to spread humanity and good governance without lessening the effects of borders. Spain has 17 autonomous regions, a system that has held diverse groups together despite the bitter memories of a civil war. The inability to organically expand this system has led to a rigidity unacceptable to some. Dialogue and mutual respect are necessary to social relationships, something forgotten in the Brexit debate. Jon Choppin Blandford Forum Dorset Who in government accepted the need to resolve three issues (migrant settlement rights, the Irish border and the financial settlement) on Brexit before starting talks about trade? It is exceeded in its strategic weakness and stupidity only by David Cameron’s decision to offer a referendum rather than require his party to have a policy on Europe. For the government to pretend to be contemplating tough “no deal” terms is foolish and will be totally unconvincing to our European friends. Clearly, the Tory party has forgotten the lessons of appeasement. Tony Arnold Bacton Norfolk Opposing US policy on Vietnam Rachel Cooke, in her review of Marcelino Truong’s graphic novel Saigon Calling (New Review), writes of the “anti-Americanism” of British leftists who opposed the Vietnam war and Truong’s bemusement that they were “seemingly so supportive of the communists”. I worked in the British anti-war movement and we were not anti-American, only bitterly opposed to US government policies. We supported the North Vietnamese because they fought to secure the independent and reunified Vietnam promised in the 1954 Geneva accords, whereas the US-dominated regime in South Vietnam (in which Truong’s father served) fought in violation of the accords to maintain American control.

There has been no survey as yet. How does the process work? SB A In theory, once your offer is accepted you can make the purchase dependant on getting planning permission before you exchange contracts. However, the extra time this adds to the transaction, as well as the inconvenience of architect visits for the sellers, may mean that in practice they won’t sign up to such an agreement, especially if they have found somewhere to buy themselves and are keen to move quickly. However, that doesn’t mean you should limit your search to properties which have planning permission for an extension already in place. For example, provided you wouldn’t want to extend the property by more than three metres beyond the rear wall of the house for terraced and semi-detached houses, but four metres for detached properties, and provided the extension doesn’t take up more than half of the unbuilt land around the property, you may not have to get planning permission because of what are called “permitted development” rights. You can see what the restrictions are in a lot more detail in the Permitted development rights for householders: technical guidance notes produced by the Department for Communities and Local Government. Under temporary increases to the size limits for single-storey extensions to six metres for terraced and semi-detached houses, and eight metres for detached properties, you could get a much bigger extension without planning permission provided it is completed by 30 May 2019. Although you may not need planning permission, you would have to send a “notification of a proposed larger home extension” to the planning authorities and consult with your neighbours. It’s worth noting that local planning authorities can remove permitted development rights in some areas, so it would be worth checking before putting an offer in on a house if you hope to make use of them. You should also be aware that whether planning permission is required or not, any works will have to comply with building regulations."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/oct/24/scott-morrison-flags-health-education-and-energy-reforms","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-23T17:00:23Z","webTitle":"Scott Morrison flags health, education and energy reforms","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/24/scott-morrison-flags-health-education-and-energy-reforms","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/oct/24/scott-morrison-flags-health-education-and-energy-reforms","fields":{"headline":"Scott Morrison flags health, education and energy reforms","bodyText":"The treasurer, Scott Morrison, will flag ongoing reforms in health, education and energy to boost national productivity in response to an inquiry by the Productivity Commission to be released on Tuesday. Morrison will use a speech to the Committee for Economic Development Australia to outline the main findings of the new work on productivity – which includes recommendations to adopt patient-centred healthcare, transform teaching capacity in the education system to help workers manage the profound transitions in the labour market, and the creation of more functional cities, which could boost gross domestic product by $29bn. The report is the first instalment in a series of five-yearly reviews by the Productivity Commission examining contemporary methods to boost productivity – advice that will sit alongside the intergenerational report produced by the treasury every five years. According to Morrison, the new report notes, for example, that 17.5% of Australians have mental or behavioural problems and Australia’s suicide rate “is double the rate of the best performing countries.” Adopting more effective preventative strategies could boost labour force participation by up to 26%. According to Morrison, the new work from the productivity commission suggests the economic benefits “from a health system reboot” could be worth up to $200bn over the next two decades. On education, Morrison will say on Tuesday that the commission recommends “boosting salaries in subject areas where there are teacher shortages, to attract high calibre people and stop teachers from teaching out of field – like the 30% of high school IT teachers who have never even studied the subject.” The report also recommends an overhaul of the vocational educational system, including “a graduated assessment system that measures the proficiency of VET students, rather than straight competency, and creating a fair credential embracing massive open online courses (MOOCs) that lower the cost of education and make learning more accessible.” Many economists believe productivity gains are harder to achieve in an environment where technological change is not delivering major boosts to economies around the world. Morrison will argue economic reforms of the 1980s and 1990s were crucial to boosting productivity, and ushered in a generation of prosperity, but he argues “there was a lot of low hanging fruit back then” and reform is harder to achieve today than it was in previous decades. Morrison will note in his speech that it is politically difficult to achieve major economic reform. The treasurer says “the price of a generation of Australians growing up without ever having known a recession is that reform comes more stubbornly and incrementally”. “We also need to understand that many Australians are now far more sceptical of change,” Morrison will say Tuesday. “Whenever governments mention the word reform or productivity, they get nervous.” “They’ve seen this movie before. Unlike last time when economic reform was a mystery to most, this time around Australians are more alive to the costs of change as well as the benefits.” The treasurer will argue “the economic and political bandwidth available for change is narrower than it once was, made more difficult by the binary way change is viewed and exploited”. He says economic reform is translated to voters as winners and losers, in a conflict prism."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/oct/23/london-10-pound-t-charge-comes-into-effect-toxic-car-fumes","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-23T10:04:48Z","webTitle":"London's £10 T-charge comes into effect in fight against toxic car fumes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/oct/23/london-10-pound-t-charge-comes-into-effect-toxic-car-fumes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/oct/23/london-10-pound-t-charge-comes-into-effect-toxic-car-fumes","fields":{"headline":"London's £10 T-charge comes into effect in fight against toxic car fumes","bodyText":"Drivers of the most polluting vehicles must from now on pay a daily charge of up to £21.50 to drive in to central London. From Monday, people driving older, more polluting petrol and diesel vehicles will be liable for the £10 T-charge, on top of the congestion charge of £11.50, which has been in place since 2003. The charge has been introduced in an effort to improve air quality in the capital, where legal pollution limits are regularly exceeded. The mayor, Sadiq Khan, said he wanted to prepare Londoners for the ultra-low emission zone being introduced in April 2019. “As mayor, I am determined to take urgent action to help clean up London’s lethal air. The shameful scale of the public health crisis London faces, with thousands of premature deaths caused by air pollution, must be addressed,” he said. “Today marks a major milestone in this journey with the introduction of the T-charge to encourage motorists to ditch polluting, harmful vehicles. “London now has the world’s toughest emissions standard with older, more polluting vehicles paying up to £21.50 a day to drive in the centre of the city. This is the time to stand up and join the battle to clear the toxic air we are forced to breathe.” The charge came into effect at 7am on Monday. It is applicable to pre-Euro 4 vehicles in the zone, which covers all of central London to the south of King’s Cross station, to the east of Hyde Park, west of the Tower of London and north of Elephant and Castle. Pre-Euro 4 vehicles are typically those registered before 2006, but Transport for London suggests that anyone who has a vehicle registered before 2008 checks if it is liable for the charge. The total daily levy can be reduced by £1 if drivers register to pay the congestion charge automatically. People living within the zone and driving cars covered by the new charge are eligible to pay as little as £11.05 a day in total for the two. Speaking to Sky News on Monday morning, Khan said the T-charge would cost about £7m a year, which he said was a “price worth paying”. He added that the ultra-low emission zone, once introduced, would make money that would then be ring-fenced for clean air initiatives. And he defended the plan against claims it would do little to solve the problem because relatively few vehicles are covered by it, saying it was part of series of measures, including the forthcoming introduction of the ultra-low emission zone. Mike Hawes, the chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers, said: “Industry recognises the air quality challenge and wants to see London and other cities meet their targets. “Investment made by the industry into new diesel and petrol technologies has resulted in the most recent cars being unaffected by this new charge in London and, indeed, exempt from any other charges across the UK. “This new T-charge will affect a very small number of older vehicles so the impact on air quality will be marginal whereas bigger improvements could be achieved by policies which incentivise the uptake of the latest, lowest emission vehicles.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/oct/24/sixty-per-cent-of-postal-survey-voters-have-said-yes-to-marriage-equality-guardian-essential-poll","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-23T17:00:23Z","webTitle":"Sixty per cent of postal survey voters have said yes to marriage equality – Guardian Essential poll","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/24/sixty-per-cent-of-postal-survey-voters-have-said-yes-to-marriage-equality-guardian-essential-poll","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/oct/24/sixty-per-cent-of-postal-survey-voters-have-said-yes-to-marriage-equality-guardian-essential-poll","fields":{"headline":"Sixty per cent of postal survey voters have said yes to marriage equality – Guardian Essential poll","bodyText":"More than half of people who have returned their ballot in the same-sex marriage postal survey say they have voted in favour of marriage equality, according to the latest Guardian Essential poll.

The high level of participation compares with 47% reporting they had already voted three weeks ago, and 33% suggesting they would definitely vote. The new poll suggests older people have higher participation rates in the survey than younger people, with 91% of people aged over 55 reporting they have already voted compared with 60% of people aged under 35. Of the people who have not yet voted in the survey, 39% are intending to vote yes and 33% say they will vote no. Of people reporting they will definitely vote, 64% say they will vote yes and 31% no. The postal vote is now in its closing stages, with voters encouraged to return their forms by 27 October. The survey closes on 7 November. While the trend looks positive for the yes campaign across a range of published opinion polls, debate is still simmering in Canberra about protections for religious freedom in the event the country votes yes. Labor has already endorsed the cross-party marriage equality bill produced by the Liberal senator Dean Smith after a Senate committee inquiry, in effect ruling out any further protections for religious freedoms beyond the ability of religious ministers, celebrants and organisations to refuse to conduct weddings. But conservatives are working on an alternative marriage bill with more broad-ranging protections, and the former prime minister John Howard has warned there will not be enough time to protect religious freedom after the result is known. With energy policy the dominant issue in Australian politics over the past week, voters were also asked in the latest Guardian Essential survey to share their views about the Turnbull government’s new national energy guarantee. With detail about the scheme still scarce, most people are still on the fence, with nearly half (47%) unable to give an opinion. Thirty-five per cent approved of the plan and 18% disapproved. The sample was also split over the government’s decision to dump the chief scientist Alan Finkel’s proposal for a clean energy target and replace it with new reliability and emissions reductions obligations on electricity retailers, with 35% approving of the shift, and 32% disapproving. Voters were more attentive to the lack of ongoing subsidies for renewable energy, with 41% disapproving of the government’s decision to end subsidies once the renewable energy target peaks in 2020, and 32% approving. They are also highly sceptical about claims the national energy guarantee will lower power bills. The Energy Security Board says wholesale prices are expected to decline by 20% to 25% a year between 2020 and 2030 under the proposal, and residential bills will go down “in the order of” $100 to $115 a year over the same period. But voters aren’t buying it. Only 16% think the plan will reduce power prices, while 31% think the plan will increase prices and 31% think it will make no difference. Voters were also asked about who they trusted more in handling Australia’s energy policy challenges, with more than half the sample thinking there is no difference between the political parties or not having strong views about who is more competent. Despite a number of high-profile interventions on energy over recent months by the Turnbull government, including interventions on gas supply and with energy retailers – Labor was more trusted to reduce carbon emissions, invest in renewables, stand up to the power companies and develop a modern power grid. There was no significant difference in preference for either party on reducing power prices or ensuring a reliable power supply. The latest poll has Labor retaining its election-winning lead over the Coalition, with the opposition ahead of the Coalition on the two-party-preferred measure, 52% to 48%, which is the same result as last week."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/oct/24/una-famiglia-the-diverse-roots-of-italys-rugby-league-world-cup-squad","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-23T17:00:23Z","webTitle":"'Una famiglia': the diverse roots of Italy's Rugby League World Cup squad","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/oct/24/una-famiglia-the-diverse-roots-of-italys-rugby-league-world-cup-squad","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/oct/24/una-famiglia-the-diverse-roots-of-italys-rugby-league-world-cup-squad","fields":{"headline":"'Una famiglia': the diverse roots of Italy's Rugby League World Cup squad","bodyText":"In far north Queensland, the Italian rugby league team has been sharing stories. The players come from north and south, from city and country, and can trace their heritage to native-born and immigrant forebears. Some, like James Tedesco and Paul Vaughan, are Australian-born NRL players. Others, like Joey Tramontana, who played under-20s for the Canterbury Bulldogs this season, are hoping that good performances on the international stage will help secure a senior contract for next season. One of the greatest Italian rugby union players, Mirco Bergamasco, has converted to the 13-man code in order to play. And then there is Gioele Celerino, a hopeful 23-year-old second-rower who was born in Italy but has spent the past few months in Queensland’s far north, picking bananas in Tully and playing for a local side with the aim of being selected for the World Cup squad. Geographically, culturally and linguistically, this is a diverse bunch preparing for the 2017 Rugby League World Cup. But last Friday night at Callendar Park in Innisfail, when the Azzurri ran on to the field for its final warm-up match against Tonga, they did so under the slogan una famiglia (one family). The idea originally came from the former coach Carlo Napolitano, an Englishman of Italian heritage, who took Italy to the 2013 World Cup. And just as it was in 2013, at this World Cup the Italian dressing room will feature a photo montage of parents and grandparents, along with the una famiglia slogan. Una famiglia, said Tedesco from the team hotel in Innisfail, “is [about] everyone working for each other and staying united in everything we do”. “The first night, we came in here and shared our stories about the pride they have for the Italian heritage and how they’re connected to their Italian roots,” Tedesco said. “It’s pretty special to hear a lot of guys who are actually from Italy share their story, and their passion for the jersey and the anthem. A lot of guys don’t know it, but we’ve worked hard to learn it all together. It’s a pretty close-knit group here — everyone’s got a similar story with their grandparents coming over for a better life.” In the 2016 census, Italian was the sixth-most reported ancestry in Australia, and with eligibility rules allowing players to represent their grandparents’ nation of origin, Italo-Australians will form the majority of the Italian squad. Joining Tedesco and Vaughan in the Azzurri are high-profile players such as Parramatta Eels pair Daniel Alvaro and Nathan Brown, and Jayden Walker from the Cronulla Sharks. The Minichiello brothers, Mark and Anthony, are again involved, although Anthony is now assistant to Cameron Ciraldo, who this season coached the Penrith Panthers Under-20 side to the semifinals of the Holden Cup. There are also players from the Queensland and New South Wales competitions, such as Joel Riethmuller, Col Wilkie, and the Parata brothers Dean and Ricardo. Rising Newcastle Knights star Jack Johns, the son of NRL and Kangaroos great Matthew Johns, made headlines in August when he agreed to represent Italy. Naturally, the selection of so many Italo-Australian players has been met with a degree of cynicism. Two of the Italy’s best players, Tedesco and Vaughan, played for the Australian Prime Minister’s XIII earlier this year, and Tedesco is a star of the NSW State of Origin side. “There is criticism of the authenticity of it,” admits Paul Fioretto, the team’s long-term physiotherapist. Fioretto has a private practice in Leichhardt, historically the heart of Sydney’s Little Italy, and says the criticism comes from fellow Italo-Australians as well as the wider community. “A lot of older Italians don’t even believe there was rugby league in the 1950s,” he said. “A lot of them will say, ‘no, it’s all made up, there was never rugby league in Italy.’” There is no doubting the commitment of the players, however. All of them have forgone match payments in order to assist the development of Italian rugby league. “I don’t expect any financial return, to be honest,” said Vaughan. “In order to make the Italian team as strong as possible, and get all the funding we need, I think the players will play for passion.” The fact that Mirco Bergamasco – who played 89 times for the Italian rugby union team – has converted to rugby league is considered to be a huge coup, not only for his experience but also for the image of the game in Italy. Bergamasco, 34, has been grinning from ear to ear and listening attentively as older Italo-Australians approach him in restaurants in Innisfail, and at Club Marconi in south-west Sydney. “Australia is full of Italians,” said Bergamasco. “So, it’s funny because I hear the dialects from where their family lives. They are completely different to my dialect. I’m from the north. I understand a little bit, it’s great. Sometimes I smile because you are thousands of kilometres from Italy, and you speak a language that I can understand, but is completely different to my dialect! I love it. It’s an amazing experience.” The football manager, Mick Pezzano, believes Bergamasco brings “a lot of credibility” to rugby league. “People back home, back in Italy, see a player who has played at the highest level who is now coming and learning a new game,” said Pezzano. In Begamasco there are shades of Vincenzo Bertolotto, Italy’s first great cross-code international. In the 1950s Betolotto converted from rugby union to rugby league, joining a club side in Torino and helping to organise an Italian national team to tour England, France and Wales. The rugby union authorities did not approve, threatening to ban those who also played rugby league, and the Italian government refused to recognise the sport which starved it of funding and legitimacy. By the 1970s rugby league had effectively ceased to exist in Italy. The country’s rugby league renaissance began in the autumn of 1993, when Pezzano wrote an article in Sydney’s Italian newspaper, La Fiamma, in the hope of attracting players for a national team to compete at the World Sevens tournament. John Benigni, who had played first grade rugby league in Sydney, spotted the article. “My parents used to buy La Fiamma to look through the soccer results and all the sports results from overseas,” remembered Benigni. “I read the article that he had written, rang him and asked if he needed players. I played union over in Italy in the mid-1980s, and I said I knew a few players that would be alright for it, so it started from there. “We put a proposal to the Australian Rugby League, got knocked back, and then in 1994 we had another go. We met a guy called Colin Love, who was the original promoter of the World Sevens, and with his help we were able to get in.” Benigni became the manager, Pezzano the coach. Paul Fioretto was recruited after giving a lecture on sports injuries at Club Marconi. Orazio D’Arro, who played club football in Brisbane, was made captain. The rest were a motley crew of Italians recruited from rugby union. Many had watched State of Origin matches from afar and were intrigued to play a different form of rugby. The results were mixed, with many of the recent converts still hazy on the finer points of rugby league, but a foundation had been laid. All four men are still involved in some capacity. Pezzano is the football manager, Fioretto has been the physiotherapist since 1995, Benigni is a keen supporter and occasionally pops in for pre-match pep-talks, and D’Arro is the president of the Federazione Italiana Rugby League (FIRL), which was established in 2008. After the breakthrough World Sevens tournament in 1995, the Italian side continued to play international matches and attempted to qualify for the World Cup in 2000. It was slow going. Italians are obsessed with soccer, and rugby union is a marginal sport. Introducing another code of rugby was always going to be difficult. In Australia, however, there was a significant breakthrough in 2006 when Club Marconi in the south-west of Sydney agreed to back a rugby league side. Benigni wrote the proposal, Pezzano organised the meeting with the board, and the Marconi Mustangs Junior Rugby League Club was born. “Marconi is known as one of the strongest soccer clubs this country has had, so it didn’t go down too well with some of the faithful there,” explained Reno Santaguida, the president of Federazione Italiana Rugby League Australia (FIRLA). “But we chipped away and I ended up becoming president of the Marconi Mustangs. We had under-6s all the way to A-grade. We won an A-grade competition in the Parramatta comp, which is a massive achievement.” Marconi Mustangs has since been a home of sorts to Firla, the Australian branch of the Italian federation. Joey Tramontana, for example, came through Firla and played all his junior football with Marconi before playing in the National Youth Competition. Australian-born, Tramontana qualifies for Italy through his Calabrian grandmother, Cathy, who drove him to all his junior matches. “It’s only because of her that I was able to play rugby league,” he said. “My parents worked on Saturdays. They said, ‘If you want to play footy, go and ask her.’ She jumped at the opportunity. So everything I do at the World Cup will be because of her.” The biggest concern for Firl, however, is the development of players in Italy. There are clubs in three regions, including sides such as Lions Brescia, Spartans Catania and Brianza Tigers. It is still very much an amateur concern, with the games played in summer to avoid clashing with rugby union, but there are now also women’s teams, school sides, and even a wheelchair rugby league team. “Rugby league is being played from Sicily all the way up to the French-Italian border, where we have a team called the Saluzzo Roosters playing in the French competition,” said D’Arro. “Rugby union is an extreme elitist sport, the top echelon of people, so rugby league is truly going to the working class and the grassroots. We’re attracting a lot of people who aren’t accepted elsewhere.” Everyone involved in Firla is extremely proud of the progress of Gioele Celerino, who converted to rugby league five years ago and has been part of the national team for the past four years. He played in Italy’s famous victory over England in 2013, and was the only Italian-born player at the 2013 World Cup. He believes the game in Italy is “a new movement”. Celerino has played for Saluzzo Roosters, the Italian team in the French competition, as well as the Newcastle Thunder in England. In July this year, he moved to far north Queensland to play for Tully Tigers in the Cairns competition. Adjusting to life in small country town was not easy, especially the daily grind of waking at 5am to pick bananas for eight hours before footy training, but in his first two games for Tully he was named man of the match. When I interviewed Celerino in late July, just after those man-of-the-match performances, he told me that he had “finally found the confidence to play at my best”. After the World Cup he is keen to stay in Australia to improve his game. “He’s a guy who was born in Italy, and he begin to do a sport that not many people know in Italy,” said Bergamasco. “He took his opportunity in England, came for three months in Tully, work in the morning, train in the afternoon and play on the weekend. It’s not easy. It’s a big choice. I hope after the World Cup he will have more opportunity … I’m proud [of him] because he chose something important, and something that can become big if we work hard in Italy.” According to D’Arro, progress at the World Cup is inextricably linked to the progress of the domestic game. By fielding players such as Bergamasco and high-profile Italo-Australians, the Italian side has been able to raise the profile of the sport in Italy and attract better commercial sponsors. The money earned will be funnelled into the national team, into purchasing new equipment for Italian clubs, and into promoting rugby league back home. “Money isn’t a real issue for us,” said Vaughan. “I will play for the passion and love for the Italian side. It’s better to put the money into something else so we can get stronger each year and be more competitive.” The Italians play their opening match against Ireland in Cairns, before travelling south to Townsville to play the US, and Canberra to play Fiji. They are hoping that thousands of Italo-Australians who love rugby league will latch onto the una famiglia concept. “We’re all working toward one cause, and I think for us, that’s to make the quarter-finals,” said Tedesco. “I think we can definitely do that if we start the campaign strong. We’re all looking forward to getting out there and playing together.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/blog/2017/oct/23/jacksonville-jaguars-nfl-london","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-23T08:30:12Z","webTitle":"'London's team' are finally threatening to become an NFL force","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2017/oct/23/jacksonville-jaguars-nfl-london","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2017/oct/23/jacksonville-jaguars-nfl-london","fields":{"headline":"'London's team' are finally threatening to become an NFL force","bodyText":"If the Jacksonville Jaguars are indeed London’s NFL franchise then how strange is it for the capital to possibly have an NFL playoff team? After years of failed attempts to win more than five games in a season, the Jags – long tipped for a move from Florida to the UK – sit at 4-3, tied for first place in the AFC South and are a legitimate threat to be playing in the post-season. And who would have figured this? At the end of last year, it seemed Blake Bortles was the latest of young Jaguar quarterback blunders, throwing for a lot of yards but also a lot of interceptions. Jacksonville had no discernible running game and a solid defense wasn’t enough to promise they could haul themselves to respectability. Something strange has happened to the same old Jaguars since. They got good. The season is almost half-over and Jacksonville lead the NFL in sacks, interceptions and point differential. Yes, they were the lucky beneficiaries of Houston quarterback Tom Savage’s regrettable season debut – one that lasted a half. And, yes, they picked up 10 sacks that day because Houston’s starting left tackle, Duane Brown, was holding out. Still, the Jags never used to dominate teams no matter how broken those clubs might be. On Sunday, they trampled the woeful Colts 27-0 in Indianapolis, but the score, as one-sided as it was, said little about how complete this domination was. The Jags outgained Indianapolis 518-232 as Bortles, the quarterback who appeared close to through in Jacksonville, threw for 330 yards and a touchdown. That the Jags won so decisively a week after a loss to the Rams is also a tremendous sign. An even better sign is that the players almost expected to win. And that is definitely different about this team. “The beauty of it is it’s still October and we’re in control of our identity,” defensive end Calais Campbell told reporters last week. “That’s all you can really ask for. Nobody is 6-0 and we’re in a tie for first place. We’re in a good place. We just have to bounce back [from the Rams loss]. One thing we’ve shown is we can bounce back and we are very resilient.” There are plenty of reasons for Jacksonville’s resurgence. Rookie running back Leonard Fournette, who missed Sunday’s game, has given the Jags a more balanced, more potent offense. Bortles, who is amazingly just 25, has been efficient, growing into the role of a game manager. The defense is healthy and aggressive – and still young. But the biggest change may be the return of the franchise’s best coach, Tom Coughlin, who is the Jags’ executive vice-president, and the fact head coach Doug Marrone has a full year in charge of the team. Marrone, who filled in at the end of last season when Gus Bradley was fired, has always been underrated as an offensive mind. Suddenly, the Jags are something of a threat. In the past, the schedule never favored Jacksonville much. The Jags often found themselves staring at second halves filled with winning teams, but in the season’s final 10 games they play the Bengals, Browns, Cardinals, Colts and 49ers. All teams with losing records. The playoffs aren’t guaranteed but for a team that has already won games by scores of 29-7, 44-7, 30-9 and now 27-0 Jacksonville’s playoff chances are as good as they have been for a long, long time. London’s de facto, NFL team in the postseason. Who would have guessed? Fantasy player of the week Jameis Winston. Not often is a player on a losing team the offensive star of a week, but the Buccaneers quarterback was fantastic in Buffalo on Sunday. Just a week after a shoulder injury knocked him from the game (and made his appearance in this week’s game a legitimate question) Winston threw for 384 yards and one touchdown. He is starting to come into his own as a passer. The Bucs were in good position to win this game but the Bills scored 10 points late in the game – a winning field goal set up by an Adam Humphries fumble. Instead of leaving town at 3-3 in a muddled NFC South, Tampa Bay fall to 2-4. The Bucs are still in position to make a good second-half run and Winston may finally be dependable enough to get them there. Quote of the week “There is no question the league is suffering negative effects from these protests” – Cowboys owner Jerry Jones continues to talk about the anthem protests from several of the league’s players. Two weeks after saying any of his players who “disrespect the flag” would be benched, Jones continues to worry about the fallout from having players kneeling or holding up a fist during the anthem in support of Colin Kaepernick’s plea for a national conversation about racial equality. On Sunday, in the stadium where Kaepernick starred for the San Francisco 49ers, Jones’s Cowboys rolled over the 49ers 40-10 with quarterback Dak Prescott throwing for three touchdowns and running back Ezekiel Elliott running for 147 yards and two touchdowns. Stat of the week 10,363. That’s the number of consecutive snaps Browns tackle Joe Thomas had taken until he left Sunday’s game with a triceps injury. It’s impossible to imagine, really, the number of times game-after-game that Thomas jumped from a crouch and smashed himself into an opposing defender. Never did he quit. Never did he throw up his hand and walk to the sideline. Never did he say he was tired and needed a break. Perhaps most amazing was that he did this for a dreadful team that has wallowed near the bottom of the NFL for his entire career. It’s hard enough to play every play for more than a decade when you are winning. Imagine doing it when you are losing. A lot. Fittingly, the Browns lost on the day Thomas’s streak ended – 12-9 in overtime to Tennessee. Stat of the week II Seven. As in the number of passes attempted by Chicago’s rookie quarterback Mitch Trubisky. Yes, seven. The Bears are not comfortable letting Trubisky loose just yet. In fact, his attempts have dropped considerably with each week he has been starting, going from 25 in his debut to 16 last week to just seven on Sunday. He did the most with the seven he had, however, completing four for 107 yards and finished the day with a quarterback rating of 101.8 (which goes to show how useless quarterback ratings are). Bears coach John Fox has always been uniquely creative for a man in his position. While many coaches fear tearing apart their offenses, Fox has done so in the past with great success. Remember when he did in Denver back in 2011 with Tim Tebow? Most importantly, his plan worked on Sunday. Trubisky barely threw but the Bears beat Carolina 17-3 in one of Cam Newton’s worst games (0 touchdowns, two interceptions). Video of the week Not only have the Jets surprised the NFL this year by not being the worst team in the league but their receivers should get points for imagination. Here’s Robby Anderson catching a touchdown pass and then doing the Lambeau Leap one better by hopping into the stands and reclining in what appears to be a very comfortable field-side seat. Of course why that seat is empty is another story. Unfortunately for the Jets, Miami got the last laugh when Matt Moore took over for an injured Jay Cutler and lead the Dolphins to a late 31-28 victory. Unfortunately for Anderson, he ripped off his helmet in frustration just before game’s end – a costly penalty that made a longshot, last chance even more of a longshot. Elsewhere around the league --The Super Bowl rematch wasn’t quite as dramatic as last February’s game. The New England Patriots didn’t need to mount a comeback against the Atlanta Falcons this time: they didn’t trail the entire game and ran out easy winners. The Falcons’ offense, so devastating last season, is starting to come a concern. Tom Brady, meanwhile, is still sickeningly good in his fifth decade – it was another two touchdown game for the ageless one. --After knocking Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers out for the season, Minnesota can probably skate to the playoffs. On Sunday, the Vikings rode their defense and running back Latavius Murray to a 24-16 victory over disappointing Baltimore. --Brett Hundley has not proven to be a great replacement for Rodgers, throwing for just 87 yards in Green Bay’s 26-17 loss to the Saints. --Todd Gurley had 106 yards rushing for the surprising 5-2 Rams along with one touchdown in a 33-0 trampling of Arizona at Twickenham Stadium. Cardinals quarterback Carson Palmer broke his left arm and was knocked from the game. --Pittsburgh continue to roll back after a slow start this season with a 29-14 win over Cincinnati behind two passing touchdowns by Ben Roethlisberger and 202 total yards from running back Le’Veon Bell."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"society/2017/oct/23/victorias-assisted-dying-advocates-predict-tight-vote-in-upper-house","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-23T07:01:54Z","webTitle":"Victoria's assisted dying advocates predict tight vote in upper house","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/oct/23/victorias-assisted-dying-advocates-predict-tight-vote-in-upper-house","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/oct/23/victorias-assisted-dying-advocates-predict-tight-vote-in-upper-house","fields":{"headline":"Victoria's assisted dying advocates predict tight vote in upper house","bodyText":"Supporters of Victoria’s voluntary euthanasia legislation say the vote in the upper house will be tight, with a number of MPs yet to declare their vote. The voluntary assisted dying bill 2017 passed the lower house 47 votes to 37 on Friday after four days of debate, culminating in a 26-hour straight debate that began at 9.30am on Thursday. The Sex party founder and upper house MP Fiona Patten, who has pushed this version of the legislation since 2015, said she expected the vote would be “very close, but I feel that we will pass it”. “It’s very close, and I know there’s been a lot of pressure on a lot of people,” she told Guardian Australia. “A lot of it has been political rather than anything to do with philosophy or the bill itself.” Paul Price, political director of assisted dying advocacy organisation Go Gentle Australia, said the vote would be “tight”, increasing the pressure on MPs. “Those same MPs should be reminded that for more than a decade and again in recent polling, more than three-quarters of Victorians support this law, and that the process and consultation preceding it has been rigorous and comprehensive.” Patten said she was not concerned by reports on Monday that suggested previously undeclared MPs had switched their vote against the legislation, saying she had not considered those votes to be in the yes camp. She also said she did not think a warning against the legislation by the former prime minister Paul Keating had swayed many votes. A bigger concern was the possibility that the legislation would not pass without amendment, which would mean it would have to return to run the gauntlet of the lower house again. More than 300 amendments were proposed during the lower house debate last week, all of which failed. The Australian Conservatives MP Rachel Carling-Jenkins said she would not propose any amendments, saying: “I don’t think it’s salvageable.” But she expected that others would, and said the government did not have the numbers in the upper house to sweep them aside. There are 14 Labor MPs in the Victorian Legislative Council, as well as 14 Liberal MPs, five Greens, two members of the Shooters and Fishers party, and three, including Carling-Jenkins and Patten, representing micro-parties. The third micro-party member, James Purcell, from the Vote 1 Local Jobs party, has said he will go back to his electorate now that it appears his could be the deciding vote. “The way declared voting currently sits it seems likely that my vote will decide whether voluntary assisted dying becomes law,” he said in a statement on Monday. “This is a major decision – a life-changing decision – and while I support the bill personally, I think it’s important that I represent my community in this vote and take into consideration both sides of this incredibly sensitive issue before casting my vote.” The upper house will begin debating the legislation on Thursday next week. Carling-Jenkins said it was unlikely to begin discussing amendments until Friday evening, which meant the final vote would not be held until the following week. Unlike the lower house, the decision to extend the sitting house of the upper house requires the consent of all members. If they did vote to sit through until the committee process has been completed, Carling-Jenkins said, they could easily run from Friday night to Sunday afternoon. “I don’t have a sense that the upper house is willing to do that,” she said. “They think 30 hours sitting in the lower house was a lot – we could do double that. Easily.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2017/oct/23/chris-gayle-defamation-trial-hears-cricketer-devastated-by-fairfax-claims","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-23T03:26:07Z","webTitle":"Chris Gayle defamation trial hears cricketer 'devastated' by Fairfax claims","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/oct/23/chris-gayle-defamation-trial-hears-cricketer-devastated-by-fairfax-claims","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2017/oct/23/chris-gayle-defamation-trial-hears-cricketer-devastated-by-fairfax-claims","fields":{"headline":"Chris Gayle defamation trial hears cricketer 'devastated' by Fairfax claims","bodyText":"Cricketer Chris Gayle has told a Sydney court he was devastated when he read a headline in the Age newspaper saying he had exposed his genitals to a female masseuse in the dressing room. On day one of a defamation trial against Fairfax Media, Gayle said the incident reported on never happened and was false. Gayle said the story had travelled all over the cricketing world. Under questioning from his own barrister, Bruce McClintock SC, Gayle said he had not seen the female masseuse that day, he had not been undressed and he had not worn a towel at any stage. He said he was taken to the Sydney training ground in a team bus and was already wearing his kit. He entered the dressing room only to put on his cricket boots. McClintock said in his opening address to the jury that the international cricketer would show that the very serious allegations were entirely false and Fairfax has been reckless and malicious in publishing them. He said they never happened and they could never have happened. Gayle said the stories published in January last year have already ruined his reputation, upset his partner and had caused him the most hurt he had ever experienced. The articles said the all-rounder had “indecently propositioned” a woman in the West Indies team dressing room during the 2015 Cricket World Cup. When his agent called him to tell him a journalist was asking if he had exposed his genitals he was not given any details and he denied the allegation. He said he did not know who made the allegation or if there were any witnesses. On the day it was published he saw people on TV calling for him to be banned. “I felt devastated,” he said, adding he had never been more hurt in his life as cricket was his livelihood. Under cross-examination by counsel for Fairfax Media, Matthew Collins SC, Gayle denied he had said to the team masseuse Leanne Russell in 2013: “Do you want to come and touch me up baby”. “Never,” said Gayle. Gayle said he couldn’t remember how many times Russell had treated him with a massage for an injury but it was only once or twice because he didn’t think she was a good masseuse.

Ican, founded in Melbourne in 2007, was last month named as the 2017 Nobel peace laureate for its “groundbreaking efforts to achieve a treaty-based prohibition” of all nuclear weapons. Labor member Anthony Albanese tabled the letter in parliament on Monday. Australia has consistently refused to support or sign the ban treaty – supported by 122 countries – arguing that it relies on the protection of the United States nuclear umbrella and the nuclear nonproliferation treaty. But the letter to Turnbull, co-signed by more than 90 community, religious and human rights groups, argues the global nonproliferation regime has failed. It says nuclear weapons “are illegitimate, immoral and now, illegal”, and pose an existential threat to all Australians. “As long as some countries hold these weapons, other countries will work to acquire them. There are no safe hands for nuclear weapons. We face a clear choice: continue to let these weapons spread and risk their inevitable use, or eliminate them. Nuclear weapons are an existential threat to all Australians and all humanity.” There are more than 15,000 nuclear weapons globally, the vast majority in the hands of the US and Russia – 1,800 are on hair-trigger alert. “If a single modern nuclear weapon is detonated in a large city, millions of people would be killed. In addition to the scale of casualties, a viable humanitarian response would be impossible because many health workers, ambulances, emergency services and hospitals would be destroyed in the blast and the city would be dangerously radioactive to surviving responders,” the letter says. Tilman Ruff, the founding chairman of Ican, said: “A majority of nations have made immense progress this year to delegitimise and outlaw nuclear weapons. Meanwhile, Australia’s approach is inching us closer to nuclear conflict. Our government should be calling on all nuclear-armed states, not only North Korea, to reject nuclear weapons and disarm.” The UN Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons was opened for signature on 20 September, and has 53 signatories so far. Once 50 nations have ratified or acceded to the treaty, it enters into force. The efficacy of a global nuclear weapons ban treaty is fiercely contested. Global support for the treaty built over months of negotiations, but it has no backing from the nine known nuclear states – the US, China, France, Britain, Russia, India, Pakistan, Israel and North Korea – which include the veto-wielding permanent five members of the security council. Critics argue that a treaty cannot succeed without the participation of the states that possess the weapons. But proponents say a nuclear weapons ban will create moral pressure – in the vein of the cluster bomb and landmine conventions – for nuclear weapons states to disarm, and establish an international norm prohibiting the development, possession and use of nuclear weapons. Australia has been the most outspoken of the non-nuclear states in opposing the ban treaty. It has lobbied other countries, pressing the case for what it describes as a “building blocks” approach of engaging with nuclear powers to reduce the global stockpile of weapons. But many non-nuclear states have expressed increasing frustration with the current nuclear regime and the sclerotic movement towards disarmament. With nuclear weapons states modernising and in some cases increasing their arsenals, more states are becoming disenchanted with the nuclear nonproliferation treaty and lending their support to an outright ban. The letter to Turnbull concedes a treaty “will not eliminate nuclear weapons overnight”. “However, similar treaties which have outlawed chemical weapons, biological weapons, landmines and cluster munitions, have led to massive reductions in the manufacture and use of such weapons as well as their progressive dismantlement.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/oct/24/kevin-rudd-direct-from-new-york-a-new-episode-of-national-scab-picking","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-23T19:31:52Z","webTitle":"Kevin Rudd: direct from New York, a new episode of national scab-picking","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/24/kevin-rudd-direct-from-new-york-a-new-episode-of-national-scab-picking","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/oct/24/kevin-rudd-direct-from-new-york-a-new-episode-of-national-scab-picking","fields":{"headline":"Kevin Rudd: direct from New York, a new episode of national scab-picking","bodyText":"Kevin Rudd lives in New York now. If you were one of the 600-odd people who found themselves shuffling into Sydney University’s Great Hall on Monday night to hear Australia’s 26th prime minister speak, you will already know this. But it feels important to mention Rudd’s self-imposed exile right from the off, since it seemed to preface almost everything he said during an hour-long conversation with the Australian Financial Review’s Jennifer Hewett. It’s why he can’t comment too closely on Chinese influence on Australian university campuses: “I live in the US ... so I’ve probably missed something.” It’s the proof, he says, that Malcolm Turnbull lied about initially supporting his bid to conquer the United Nations: “I had the guy in our living room in New York before he became PM, saying Abbott was mad to have any reservations about me going for UN secretary general.” And it’s the reason he couldn’t predict whether Bill Shorten would win the next federal election: “I’m no great seer, particularly from the distance of New York.” In front of a captive and (presumably) friendly audience, Monday night should have been one for the true believers. But like the pompous cousin home for Christmas, Rudd’s reappearance in our national politics to coincide with the release of the first volume (!) of his autobiography, Not for the Faint-hearted, has instead prompted a conflicting mix of nostalgia, petty boasting and thawed animosities. All the old tropes were trotted out on the night. The famously forced folksiness (the book is “this bloody book”) and well-trodden narratives – his greatest regret is that he didn’t better communicate the impact avoiding the global financial crisis had on his agenda. “Where I could have done a lot better is explaining [that] we had to fulfil our reform agenda a lot slower … why we needed to space it out a bit.” He took a familiar swipe at his former treasurer Wayne Swan – “I believed he’d learn with the job, the problem was he didn’t” – and reanimated his feud with Turnbull over the UN job. “After the election Malcolm dropped his bundle … he felt the hot breath of Dutton and Abbott breathing down his neck [and] he wilted like melting jelly in the midday sun,” he told the audience. But there was something muted about the whole thing. The only spontaneous outbreak of applause came during an impassioned defence of the national broadband network, and in his introduction even Anthony Albanese, still Rudd’s great defender, seemed to display the air of a friend called on to bear witness one too many times. But to be fair, a decade after Kevin 07, what else is there he could tell us? Besides the question of who attends these events (true believers? masochists? Sunrise viewers?), is there anything left to ask Rudd? In fact, dashing the vague hope that the law of diminishing returns dictates that eventually we’ll get tired of this national scab-picking exercise, the only purpose to Rudd’s memoir seems to be as a hellish reminder that a decade from now we’ll probably still be picking at the bones of Rudd-Gillard-Rudd-Abbott-Turnbull ad infinitum. And this is only volume one."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/oct/27/rugby-league-world-cup-is-australias-to-lose-as-legacy-builds","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-26T17:00:06Z","webTitle":"Rugby League World Cup is Australia's to lose as legacy builds | John Davidson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/oct/27/rugby-league-world-cup-is-australias-to-lose-as-legacy-builds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/oct/27/rugby-league-world-cup-is-australias-to-lose-as-legacy-builds","fields":{"headline":"Rugby League World Cup is Australia's to lose as legacy builds","bodyText":"There was a feeling of single-purpose vision and steely determination about Australia’s last Rugby League World Cup campaign four years ago. The Kangaroos had stunningly lost the World Cup final on home soil in 2008 at Suncorp Stadium, a controversial Joel Monaghan penalty try and a late Billy Slater brain explosion helping New Zealand to an upset 34-20 victory. Some called it the biggest upset in rugby league history. When the tournament rolled around again in 2013, this time on British shores, the green and gold wanted badly to win back the Paul Barrière trophy. Tim Sheens’ team were clinical and effective, winning six games straight to wrest the title back off the Kiwis. No opponent got closer than eight points to the Kangaroos, and New Zealand were routed 34-2 in the final at Old Trafford. Now the World Cup is back, again on home turf, and Australia’s status at the top of the rugby league tree is already confirmed. They are clear tournament favourites once more, and are adamant they won’t let complacency derail their campaign. England (or Great Britain) haven’t beaten Australia since 2006. The Kiwis have been convincingly unsuccessful in their past five encounters. Their trans-Tasman rivals have also been rocked by the unexpected defection of Jason Taumalolo, along with the bans of captain Jesse Bromwich and Kevin Proctor, and will also be without Kieran Foran and Isaac Luke. England will likewise be without the services of star fullback Zak Hardaker. There is an air of invulnerability around Mal Meninga’s men, particularly after the way they cruised to the Four Nations title in the UK last year; there is a dash of fait accompli about the end result of this tournament and an 11th world crown. But if, according to the pundits, the Kangaroos have won the 2017 World Cup without a ball being kicked, that’s not the message within their own camp. Humility rather than overconfidence is the mantra. “Mal set the platform against Papua New Guinea a year ago in saying that every time you represent Australia we have expectations about what we do,” explains Australia assistant coach Michael Hagan. “The pressure is being put on the players to represent and play at a certain level for the Kangaroos. We respect the opposition of course, but it’s about making sure that we uphold the values of the Kangaroos.” Like the All Blacks in rugby union, the Kangaroos have gone to a different plane, a different level than the rest. Every match is an opportunity to showcase their superior skills, to add another glorious chapter to their charmed history. The focus is inward, and also about honouring the great teams and players of Australia’s past. With the likes of Hagan and Adrian Lam, Meninga is employing the same methods and staff behind Queensland’s recent domination of State of Origin. “The expectation is to win the World Cup but we know there’s a lot of hard work [to be done],” Hagan says. “There is a bit of pressure you put on yourself with that mindset, but I think Mal’s trying to get the Kangaroos [back] to how they were regarded in a different era. It’s on home soil, it’s an important event and we want to make sure that we do well.” Some may have already written off England and New Zealand – Australia’s main two rivals in the World Cup –but the Kangaroos certainly are not. “I think the Kiwis [will] probably surprise a lot of people in the way they play and they’ll be out to prove a few people wrong,” Hagan says. “Blokes like Adam Blair have already talked about what the Kiwi jersey means and how united they’re going to be. “I think they’re going to be a threat in the competition and they’ve got that knack of being successful in Four Nations and World Cup games when the punters haven’t backed them. They showed a lot of fight and spirit in the Four Nations last year and I’m tipping that’s what we’ll see this year.” Then there’s England, who the Kangaroos meet in the tournament opener at AAMI Park. Now led by former Australia coach Wayne Bennett, the English have previously failed to perform consistently or compete with the Australians for the full 80 minutes. After 11 years of disappointment, however, there is hope now the “super coach” effect – which rubbed off on the Kiwis in 2008 – could take England to new heights. “Wayne’s only been coaching their team for 12 months so you’d think they’d be better from the experience last year, having spent time together as players and coaching staff,” Hagan says. “We’re expecting them to be better this time round and it’s very much about trying to set the standard for the World Cup. “We’re very mindful of their back five and that’s probably a real strength for them in how they bring the ball back from kick reception. That’s a real Wayne Bennett influence... that’s where you start your sets and build your momentum. You have to be really good out of the backfield. That will be a real challenge for us to get our defensive control up to speed on them. They’ll be very disciplined, [and] it will be very much be a field position game.” Even without being able to call on Jonathan Thurston, Matt Scott, Greg Inglis and Darius Boyd, the World Cup is still Australia’s to lose. They possess experience and scary depth across the field. If the green and gold play to their maximum potential and execute like they know they can, no opponent can stay with them. Farewelling the “big three” of Cameron Smith, Cooper Cronk and Slater, with their combined 108 Tests for their country, in style is just added motivation. “They all treat the Kangaroo jumper with enormous respect,” Hagan says. “I’m sure that will be a similar theme over the course of the World Cup. If it is their last World Cup then we’d like to make sure we prepare well and give them the best chance to be successful.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/23/australian-teacher-shot-dead-in-kenya-may-have-been-targeted-lawyer-says","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-22T22:32:35Z","webTitle":"Australian teacher shot dead in Kenya may have been targeted, lawyer says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/23/australian-teacher-shot-dead-in-kenya-may-have-been-targeted-lawyer-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/23/australian-teacher-shot-dead-in-kenya-may-have-been-targeted-lawyer-says","fields":{"headline":"Australian teacher shot dead in Kenya may have been targeted, lawyer says","bodyText":"The lawyer for the Australian teacher Gabrielle Maina shot dead in Nairobi has said she was in fear for her life before the attack and it is possible her killing was a targeted murder rather than a botched robbery. Maina’s lawyer, George Kingori, said the teacher had been granted a restraining order in April against her estranged husband. The relationship between the pair had broken down and Maina was seeking custody of their two children, he said. “She required a restraining order against the husband for constantly stalking, approaching her place of work and as well as the residence,” he said. He has urged authorities to keep investigating the murder of the mother-of-two in the Kenyan capital. The teacher was shot in the exclusive suburb of Karen on Thursday during what was initially believed to be a botched robbery reportedly involving assailants on motorbikes. “It is important for them [Australian Department of Foreign Affairs] to keep on pushing until it is certain as to what caused her death,” Kingori told ABC Radio. It’s believed Maina, who was originally from Armidale in New South Wales, had just dropped off her son at a friend’s home. “The shooting happened when she was kneeling and someone was standing,” Kingori said. Security company Insight Secure, which monitors local incidents, said a caucasian woman was killed by “unidentified assailants” and “a 9mm cartridge was recovered at the crime scene”, Fairfax Media reports. The Kenya high commission in Canberra said investigations were under way in Nairobi."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2017/oct/23/americans-want-a-tax-on-carbon-pollution-but-how-to-get-one","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-23T10:00:08Z","webTitle":"Americans want a tax on carbon pollution, but how to get one? | Dana Nuccitelli","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2017/oct/23/americans-want-a-tax-on-carbon-pollution-but-how-to-get-one","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2017/oct/23/americans-want-a-tax-on-carbon-pollution-but-how-to-get-one","fields":{"headline":"Americans want a tax on carbon pollution, but how to get one?","bodyText":"According to a new study published by Yale scientists in Environmental Research Letters, Americans are willing to pay a carbon tax that would increase their household energy bills by $15 per month, or about 15%, on average. This result is consistent with a survey from last year that also found Americans are willing to pay an average of $15 to $20 per month to combat climate change. Another recent Yale survey found that overall, 78% of registered American voters support taxing and/or regulating carbon pollution, including 67% of Republicans and 60% of conservative Republicans. This raises the question – with such broad support across the political spectrum, why doesn’t America have a carbon tax in place by now? Study co-author Anthony Leiserowitz noted the similarity to public support for many gun control policies: Policy elites sometimes have ideological stances quite different than their constituents, even of their own party (e.g., background checks on gun purchases in the US which is overwhelmingly favored by Democrats and Republicans). Public support often doesn’t translate into policy. On the issue of gun control, Republican lawmakers are afraid that if they vote for even the most benign policies like requiring background checks for all gun purchases, the NRA will mobilize its supporters against them. In primary races with relatively low turnout, with partisans more likely to vote, Republican lawmakers fear that mobilizing even a relatively small minority of opposition voters could cost them their jobs. On the issue of climate change and carbon taxes, they have the same fear of the Koch network. In short, the wealthy and powerful have more influence over American policy than average voters. A key question – what to do with carbon tax revenue The new Yale study also asked survey participants how they would like to use the revenue generated by a carbon tax. Supporting the development of solar and wind energy and funding infrastructure improvements were the two most popular choices (around 80% support), followed by assisting displaced coal workers (73% support) and paying down the national debt (67% support). Interestingly, the option of returning the revenue back to taxpayers was supported by fewer than half of Americans – both Republicans and Democrats. Basically, Americans support a carbon tax because they want action to address climate change, and they want to spend the revenue on clean energy for the same reason. Or they at least want to spend the money on something they consider important; for conservative Republicans, paying down the national debt was the top choice. However, we’ve seen that public opinion doesn’t dictate policy, and there are some important reasons why returning all of the carbon tax revenue to households (a.k.a. ‘revenue neutrality’) has widespread support, including among many prominent Republicans. The case for a revenue neutral carbon tax Perhaps most importantly, Republican Party thought leaders and elder statesmen consider revenue neutrality critical to their support for a carbon tax. For one thing, many Republican policymakers have signed ‘the no tax pledge.’ During Obama’s presidency, Republicans weren’t even willing to accept large budget cuts in exchange for much smaller tax increases. Cutting taxes may become the only significant legislative accomplishment of the current two-year congressional session. If there’s one issue Republican policymakers can agree on, it’s cutting (or at least not increasing) taxes. But as Ronald Reagan’s Secretary of State George Shultz put it, “It’s not a tax if the government doesn’t keep the money.” Secondly, because poorer households spend a larger proportion of their income on energy bills, a carbon tax would be a regressive policy. However, because wealthier households use more energy and thus have larger net energy bills, returning all the revenue equally to households would be a progressive policy. Studies have found that most households would actually come out ahead, with rebate checks exceeding their increased energy costs, and particularly lower income households. Studies have also shown a revenue-neutral carbon tax policy would grow the economy, largely for this very reason – the rebate checks would give people more disposable income to spend. Third, returning the revenue to households would allow for a higher carbon pollution tax. If Americans are willing to pay an extra $15 per month to tackle climate change, that would translate to a very modest carbon tax. But if some or all of the revenue is returned to households, net energy costs will be offset by rebate checks, allowing for a higher carbon tax at the same cost to households. And the higher the tax, the more effective it will be at reducing American carbon pollution. Grassroots and grasstops are pressing for a carbon tax There are major efforts underway to make a revenue-neutral carbon tax policy a reality in the USA. From the grassroots level, the volunteer organization Citizens’ Climate Lobby has been at work for ten years, and the group has grown exponentially. In its annual summary lobbying effort this year, the group sent 1,300 volunteers to lobby every member of congress to support a revenue-neutral carbon tax. The policy is also supported by many prominent Republican Party elder statesmen, including cabinet members from the last three Republican administrations; two former Secretaries of State, two former Secretaries of Treasury, and two former chairmen of the President’s Council of Economic Advisors. Their group, called the Climate Leadership Council, has met with the White House to urge support for a revenue-neutral carbon tax. Although most Republican Party policymakers continue to oppose taxing carbon pollution, it’s inevitable that the USA will implement national climate policy sooner or later. A revenue-neutral carbon tax seems to represent the path of least resistance. The only question is how much longer the GOP will delay the inevitable."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/oct/22/football-liverpool-tottenham-hotspur-jurgen-klopp","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-22T20:38:55Z","webTitle":"I’d have stopped Harry Kane if I was playing for Liverpool – Jürgen Klopp","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/oct/22/football-liverpool-tottenham-hotspur-jurgen-klopp","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/oct/22/football-liverpool-tottenham-hotspur-jurgen-klopp","fields":{"headline":"I’d have stopped Harry Kane if I was playing for Liverpool – Jürgen Klopp","bodyText":"Jürgen Klopp lambasted Liverpool’s hapless defence after a rout that condemned the club to their worst defensive start to a season since 1964-65. A series of clangers helped Tottenham Hotspur record a 4-1 win, with Harry Kane again influential in deciding the game’s outcome. “If I am involved in this situation on the pitch, then Harry cannot get the ball,” Klopp said. “It wouldn’t happen if I was on the pitch – but I am in the middle of the technical area in trainers. Each job is clear but we couldn’t do it.” Even in the heat of post-match emotion, to infer that a 50-year-old manager can do a more efficient job than a current international does not reflect well. Dejan Lovren, the worst culprit for the first two goals which Liverpool shipped in a feeble start to the match, was substituted in the 31st minute in an attempt to reshape and offer more protection. They conceded twice more, taking their total goals against for the season to 16 (15 of them away from home). Klopp was not particularly minded to point the finger at Lovren. “I really don’t want to blame players. He feels not good. That’s OK. Nobody should feel good. He is part of the squad. That’s all.” Klopp conceded that Liverpool’s collective defending was well below expectations. “In all decisive moments we were not there. The first goal was unbelievably easy to defend. The second we miss the moment. The third goal another present. Everything was bad from us. We cannot get results with a performance like today. They were completely spot on and we weren’t. That’s my responsibility. It was much too easy for Tottenham today. Our fault.” Mauricio Pochettino was delighted with his team’s comprehensive victory. “I am so pleased for the team, so pleased for our fans. We start to change the feeling that it was difficult to play here at Wembley. We start to feel it can be our home. That’s so important for the rest of the season,” he said. The Tottenham manager again had praise for Kane, who will be rested for the midweek EFL Cup match. “He is amazing. He was tired at the end. He put in a massive effort in Real Madrid and today and it’s normal to be a bit tired. No problem.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/blog/2017/oct/22/liverpool-tottenham-dejan-lovren-undefending","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-22T19:34:34Z","webTitle":"Dejan Lovren and Liverpool introduce us to the art of un-defending | Barney Ronay","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2017/oct/22/liverpool-tottenham-dejan-lovren-undefending","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2017/oct/22/liverpool-tottenham-dejan-lovren-undefending","fields":{"headline":"Dejan Lovren and Liverpool introduce us to the art of un-defending","bodyText":"The humane thing to do, looking back on this exhilaratingly open 4-1 Wembley victory for Tottenham Hotspur against Liverpool, would be to focus on the ruthlessness of Harry Kane, the brutal speed of Spurs’ counterattack, the running of Son Heung-min. Things are rarely that easy, though. In Germany they have a concept called Ruinenlust, which describes the irresistible pleasure of seeing a deeply distressed object in the process of falling to pieces. And for half an hour here Liverpool provided something similar as Jürgen Klopp’s team produced collectively one of the worst displays of elite-club defending the Premier League will see this season; and individually a candidate for worst half-hour on the pitch in recent memory. Dejan Lovren has been thoroughly eviscerated by now, not just on social media and in on-the-whistle match reports, but by his own manager, who stated, rather cruelly, that he could have done better himself just wandering around Wembley in a pair of trainers. And make no mistake, this was a horrendous half-hour from Lovren, who appeared at times to have completely forgotten he was actually playing in a football match, startled to find himself in the middle of all that green, so many faces in the crowd. Nothing happens in a vacuum, however. Exactly why and how Lovren was quite this awful, so bad his awfulness itself feels like an event, a happening with its own sheen of beauty, is the real issue Klopp must attempt to address. Lovren came to Wembley having played out 314 minutes without conceding a goal for club and country. Liverpool came here having kept successive clean sheets. And yet there was no surprise whatsoever in their defensive collapse against some high-grade attacking play, just a feeling of an axe being taken to a rickety and woodwormed fence. First, though, the horror. It took four minutes for Tottenham to open the scoring. It was a beautiful striker’s goal, Kane springing on to Kieran Trippier’s dinked pass, working the ball on to his left foot, then thumping it low and hard into the corner. Even in real time, though, it was impossible not to feel the eyes drawn to Lovren who produced a genuinely scene-stealing piece of un-defending. Lovren did not just lose Kane, he seemed to lose all concept of what it was he was doing here, dressed in these strange red clothes, ambling about like a man recently winched up off the anaesthetist’s table, and watching on with only the vaguest curiosity as the ball floated over his head into Kane’s path. If the first Tottenham goal was helped by a horrible mistake from Lovren then, well, so was the second – albeit with the benefit of illuminating what was also a terrible goal to concede as a team. Credit to Spurs, who sent the ball the entire length of the pitch in two passes. But there was very little resistance to this as a basic idea. From a corner Hugo Lloris hurled the ball out to halfway. At which point Lovren felt the music swell, the choir begin to purr and coo and for just one tiny, fatal moment really did seem to believe he could fly. It was a poor decision. Lovren launched himself. The ball floated in a gentle parabola over halfway. Lovren floated in a gentle parabola under the ball, Kane sped away and offered the perfect pass for Son to finish. You can only play the loopy central defence in front of you, but Tottenham had been utterly clinical. Moments later it was almost three, with another attack down Lovren’s no-fly channel. The ball floated over Lovren’s head in an eerily familiar echo of what had passed before, a case of Dejan Vu. Son spanked it on to the bar. And so it carried on, the white shirts seeming to treat Liverpool’s No6 as a minor piece of street furniture to be swayed around without much thought en route to somewhere else. With half an hour gone Lovren was euthanised from the pitch, wandering off straight past his manager to sit three rows back, looking utterly stunned, still in his red shirt. Has there been a worse half-hour from an international‑standard Premier League player? And yet to see this as simply a Lovren story, as Klopp has in the past, complaining that the problems with his defence are not structural, but a matter of individuals making bad decisions, would be misleading. Liverpool are well capable of conceding weak goals without Lovren, as they did here for the fourth and as they did while shipping five at Manchester City last month. Lovren has looked and felt exposed at Liverpool ever since he got there, playing often in front of a midfield that leaves large, open green spaces. Emre Can and Jordan Henderson have an unfortunate case of shared weaknesses. Neither is quick to the ball, as Premier League central midfielders must be. Neither has the will or the discipline to sit deep. Even a world-class centre-half would be exposed behind them. And Lovren is not a world-class centre-half. He will take the unkind headlines.

On hearing the first reports and seeing pictures of the vast black plume of smoke, I realised this was unlike the typical, low-level terror attacks that have plagued Mogadishu. The Zoobe district was a lively area shaded by palm trees, full of small traders, businesses, hotels and cafes – with a busy four-lane highway cutting through it. At 3pm on the day, people were shifting gears: from primary school to home, from university to socialising, from siesta to work. Suddenly every building in the district was flattened, ash and dust billowing away to reveal total devastation – as if the district had seen months of war and heavy shelling. The remains of the first 165 unidentified victims were so badly damaged that what could be found was hastily buried in a mass funeral the next day. The truck bomb went off beside a fuel tanker so there are people who will never be traced, whose disappearance has left families emotionally and financially crippled. You see their names and faces on Gurmad252, a crisis response organisation staffed by volunteers who aim to identify the victims of the attack and raise funds for the survivors. Many of the missing were just starting their lives, unsurprising for a country where 62% of the population is under 24 years old: they include first division footballers (Mustaf Qoor), medical students just about to qualify (Maryan Cabdullahi), shoe-shiners (Catar Aden) and so many more. The militant group al-Shabaab, which has lost much of the territory it controlled in Somalia over the last few years, continues to snipe away at soft targets. It is yet to take responsibility for the Zoobe attack, but there is little doubt regarding its culpability. The famed make-do-and-mend resilience of Mogadishu is built on the reputation of groups such as Aamin Ambulance. I had first seen their work online, a few months ago, when they responded to a much smaller attack. They rushed to the scene even though security forces often fire at ambulances in the confusion of smoke and crowds. And when I contacted them via Twitter on the night of the attack their primary concern was not for themselves, but whether there would be another attack that they would not have the resources to deal with. Led by a dentist, Abdulkadir Adan – who was inspired by the work of the Pakistani humanitarian Abdul Sattar Edhi – the service rushes into danger zones in a fleet of second-hand ambulances that once belonged to the fire service of a tiny Japanese island. They needed radios urgently, Adan said, because they relied on mobile phones to communicate, and the network was jammed with people trying to locate loved ones. The GoFundMe appeal for Aamin Ambulance quickly took on a life of its own with donations from the supermodel Iman, the rapper K’naan and the group Coldplay: from Finland to South Korea, money arrives. We raised our target two times, and were elated when the United Nations donated 36 radios – so we could concentrate on other urgent supplies. I saw humanity and solidarity and didn’t think to ask who hadn’t been moved by this catastrophe – until I realised that London, my home city, had not marked this atrocity the way it has those in western cities: no flags at half-mast, no illumination of the London Eye in the blue and white of the Somali flag – not even a tweet from mayor Sadiq Khan. This failure to respond publicly was not inevitable but a choice – a choice that was not made in Istanbul, Toronto, Paris or Kuala Lumpur. So how many dead Somalis does it take to muster the kind of sympathy that gushes out for cities closer to home?.Well, it seems that 358 dead is too low. Despite some western newspapers, including the Guardian, putting the attack on their front pages, compassion seems to be ebbing daily. There are many out there who prefer easy, flippant excuses – “That’s the religion of peace for you” – than to use their imagination and curiosity to offer sympathy to an individual who suffers and grieves no less than they. • Nadifa Mohamed is a British-Somali novelist.

The latest lawsuit, against Ohio State University, was filed on Sunday, days after police in Florida announced attempted homicide charges against three men who shouted “Hail Hitler!” and fired a gun at protesters after Spencer spoke at the University of Florida. Security for the speech in Gainesville on Thursday, which drew more than 2,500 protesters, cost at least $600,000, the university’s president said. Ohio State, Penn State and Michigan State have announced they will not allow Spencer to rent a campus venue, citing public safety concerns and serious disruption to school communities. Spencer’s backers argue this is an unconstitutional infringement of his rights, since the government, including public universities, is not allowed to discriminate based on the content of speech. In April, Spencer won a suit against Auburn University in Alabama, when a federal judge ruled a planned speech should be allowed. “While Mr Spencer’s beliefs and message are controversial, Auburn presented no evidence that Mr Spencer advocates violence,” US district judge W Keith Watkins ruled. “Auburn did not produce evidence that Mr Spencer’s speech is likely to incite or produce imminent lawless action.” The lawsuits in Ohio, Pennsylvania and Michigan will test whether the attempted homicide charges in Gainesville, as well as a violent attack on protesters at a far-right unity summit in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August, which left more than 19 protesters injured and one dead, have made any difference. Ohio State, which had delayed giving a final response to the request to rent a venue to speak on campus, wrote in a letter to an attorney for Spencer’s college tour organizer late on Friday night that they would not allow him to rent a venue, citing “yesterday’s events at the University of Florida”. Gainesville police arrested three white men for attempted homicide. All had links to white supremacist groups and previous white supremacist events, according to the Anti-Defamation League’s Center on Extremism, and had given media interviews talking about their beliefs outside Spencer’s speech. “I’m disappointed in the course of things,” Tyler Tenbrink, the alleged shooter, reportedly told the Gainesville Sun before the shooting. “It appears that the only answer left is violence, and nobody wants that.” Less than two hours after Spencer’s speech, the men got into an altercation with a group of protesters after yelling “Hail Hitler!” at them and giving the Nazi salute. As two of the men yelled “Kill them!” and “Shoot them!”, police said, Tenbrink fired a single shot at the protesters. Police said he had a felony record that barred him from owning a gun. The round hit a building. As the men drove away, a protester noted their license plate and called the police. All three were being held in the county jail. Michael Carpenter, a lawyer representing Ohio State, wrote on Friday that “the university values freedom of speech” but that it was denying the request to let Spencer speak “due to substantial risk to public safety, as well as material and substantial disruption to the work and discipline of the university”. Kyle Bristow, a Michigan attorney who is a white nationalist and “in-house attorney for the alt-right”, filed a lawsuit against Ohio State on Sunday. On Twitter on Friday, Bristow wrote in Latin: “The die is cast.” In a press release on Sunday, he saud: “The alt-right shall enjoy the right to free speech.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/oct/22/rangers-motherwell-scottish-league-cup-semi-final-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-22T17:12:59Z","webTitle":"Pedro Caixinha under pressure after Rangers slump to Motherwell defeat","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/oct/22/rangers-motherwell-scottish-league-cup-semi-final-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/oct/22/rangers-motherwell-scottish-league-cup-semi-final-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Pedro Caixinha under pressure after Rangers slump to Motherwell defeat","bodyText":"Cup competitions are providing such embarrassment to Pedro Caixinha that it is looking increasingly doubtful he will be afforded the luxury of a full league season. The League Cup could have offered salvation to a Rangers manager whose reputation was tarnished by a European exit at the hands of opposition from Luxembourg. Instead, Motherwell inflicted yet another bloody nose on the itinerant Portuguese coach in this semi-final. The listless nature of Rangers’ display at Hampden Park was even more damning than the result, with Caixinha now in a position from which it appears confidence in his ability may be irretrievable. Bluntly, it would take a miracle for him to turn this around. Those Rangers fans who hung around until full-time did so only to make their displeasure perfectly plain. Caixinha has been in charge for 25 matches yet has not won three in a row. Despite being backed during the summer transfer window to the point where the Ibrox club should easily be the second force in Scotland, the manager is presiding over a team with no obvious style or identity. And yet, Rangers have been subject to recent and bemusing overpraise. To his credit, Caixinha did not shirk from blame. “I need to assume all the responsibility for our team because of the way the team presented themselves,” he said. “They were a shade of the team they needed to be. The opponent played better, they played their own game and we allowed them to play their own game. “Our performance was very poor, our performance was not anywhere near it needed to be. When that happens I need to assume full responsibility.” Caixinha and his opposite number, Stephen Robinson, watched the closing stages of a tousy encounter from the main stand. If the referee, Steven McLean, had been as firm in dealing with players the match would not have ended at 11-a-side. McLean endured a horrendous afternoon but his inability to impose the laws of the game did not deny the better team victory. Whereas natural focus falls on the glaring shortcomings at Rangers, it would be folly to ignore Motherwell. This is a club who refused to buckle under a £350,000 bid for their main striker, Louis Moult, in August. Moult dismantled Aberdeen in the quarter-final and scored both goals against Rangers, thereby fully justifying a smart business decision. Motherwell’s cup run and a meeting with Celtic in the final will earn them around three times the fee offered for Moult. Rangers had arguably been the better team in the opening 45 minutes but Motherwell wasted the finest chance to edge ahead. Ryan Jack, on the Rangers goalline, blocked a net-bound Cédric Kipré shot. The opening goal owed everything to Rangers’ failure to defend an excellent Chris Cadden corner. Peter Hartley hit the bar with a header, with Moult reacting quickest to nod home. Both managers were subsequently sent from their technical areas with the anger of Caixinha understandable after Ryan Bowman, already on a booking, cracked the nose of Fábio Cardoso with an elbow. Cardoso had to be substituted. Later in the game, McLean ignored offences from Bruno Alves and Moult that were both worthy of a red card. By the time that clash occurred, Motherwell had an unassailable lead. Moult latched on to a Charles Dunne clearance and the 25-year-old provided a wonderful lob over the stranded Jak Alnwick. The most striking thing thereafter was Rangers’ inability to summon any kind of proper response; Trevor Carson in the Motherwell goal had just one, relatively comfortable, save to make. “We knew we were fitter and stronger than them,” said Robinson. This proved a final blow for Caixinha on an afternoon in which Rangers flailed around in the dark."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/22/the-guardian-view-on-the-fall-of-raqqa-as-isis-loses-iran-wins","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-22T18:08:22Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on the fall of Raqqa: as Isis loses, Iran wins | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/22/the-guardian-view-on-the-fall-of-raqqa-as-isis-loses-iran-wins","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/22/the-guardian-view-on-the-fall-of-raqqa-as-isis-loses-iran-wins","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on the fall of Raqqa: as Isis loses, Iran wins","bodyText":"Raqqa, self-styled capital of the self-styled Islamic State’s self-styled caliphate in eastern Syria, fell to Kurdish and Sunni Arab forces last week. The event was an indisputable success for the US-led anti-Isis international coalition. For the city’s inhabitants, it meant the end of a terrifying three years under the rule of a nihilistic cult. Isis’s rule in Raqqa made a global statement, showcasing its atrocities and its ideology: there were beheadings in a sports stadium, gay men thrown off rooftops, women reduced to slavery, and children indoctrinated to become suicide bombers. That the insurgent group has now been kicked out is a piece of good news for the Middle East and beyond. It is much too soon to claim that Isis has been beaten for good. It still holds pockets of territory across the Syria-Iraq border. Nor is Sunni disenfranchisement – a key recruiting sergeant for Isis – likely to disappear if the Syrian dictator, Bashar al-Assad, is allowed to continue to persecute his people. Donald Trump’s assertion on Saturday that the fall of Raqqa heralded a political transition for Syria is both cynical and hollow. There is no sign whatever of such a transition in Damascus. Nor can it be said that the wider region is any closer to stability, let alone peace. As Raqqa fell, a second city, Kirkuk in neighbouring Iraq, changed hands too. Here, though, the circumstances were very different. Kurdish peshmerga forces, who had held Kirkuk and nearby oil fields since 2014, were pushed out by the Shia-dominated Iraqi army. Just weeks earlier, a referendum in Iraqi Kurdistan voted overwhelmingly for independence. Designed as a measure to further the Kurds’ long-held political aspirations, the vote backfired badly. Baghdad government troops swept in almost unopposed. Divisions among Kurdish factions played no small role in the collapse. That, in just one week, Kurdish forces should be victorious in Raqqa but crushed in Kirkuk, is part of a chaotic realignment across the region. Anticipating the imminent demise of Isis power, local armed groups and the nation states that act as their patrons have moved quickly to hedge their positions and fill any vacuum. Alliances are shifting as circumstances change, and lines are redrawn in the sand. A regional free-for-all is in motion, whose end game no one can predict. Kurdish and Iraqi forces who had allied against Isis, both of them trained and equipped by the US, have now turned against one another. In Syria’s eastern desert, US- and Iran-supported groups who once confronted Isis in parallel are now violently competing for strategic landmarks. Tactical solidarities are also wearing thin. Turkey, formerly an active supporter of the anti-Assad insurgency, now seeks Russian support against the Kurds, while announcing it will send ground forces into Syria’s rebel-held province of Idlib. Blunt military power and geopolitical opportunism governs these events in the Middle East. Diplomacy has all but been abandoned. There is no rule book except might-makes-right. As Isis-held territory shrinks, states and non-state entities alike vie for influence and conquest. Sectarian and ethnic differences fuel a dangerous dynamic. Comparison with the thirty years’ war may not be exaggerated. However, the one state that has so far gained more than it has lost in this multifaceted regional war is surely Iran. With its troops and its proxies deeply involved on the ground, Iranian sway has grown across Iraq, Syria and Lebanon. It has capitalised on chaos as well as on American errors and miscalculations. Mr Trump’s recent threats against Iran should perhaps be seen in this context as an attempt at pushback, but they have the potential to create even larger problems. As Isis recedes, the world is witnessing a scramble for the spoils. For the moment, every military victory sets the stage for another confrontation, not for talks. For the people of Raqqa, Kirkuk and many others, it is a recipe for more, not less, uncertainty."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"media/2017/oct/22/tom-watson-refuse-murdochs-sky-bid-after-32m-oreilly-cover-up","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-22T17:54:05Z","webTitle":"Refuse Murdoch's Sky bid after $32m O'Reilly 'cover up', says Tom Watson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/oct/22/tom-watson-refuse-murdochs-sky-bid-after-32m-oreilly-cover-up","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2017/oct/22/tom-watson-refuse-murdochs-sky-bid-after-32m-oreilly-cover-up","fields":{"headline":"Refuse Murdoch's Sky bid after $32m O'Reilly 'cover up', says Tom Watson","bodyText":"Tom Watson is to write to the competition watchdog urging it to refuse the Murdoch family’s takeover of Sky after it emerged that Fox News gave presenter Bill O’Reilly a new contract after paying $32m (£24m) to settle a sexual harassment suit against him. Labour’s deputy leader and shadow culture secretary said the revelations showed Fox “allowed a culture of bullying to flourish” and made its parent company, the Murdoch-owned 21st Century Fox, an unsuitable owner for Sky. The fact that O’Reilly, the pugnacious and hugely popular Fox News host, was given a more lucrative contract a month after settling the harassment lawsuit, was “jaw dropping”, Watson said. “It raises yet more questions about the corporate culture at 21st Century Fox. It has now been demonstrated beyond doubt that executives at Fox News were free to act with impunity in the knowledge that their actions would go unpunished.” The culture secretary, Karen Bradley, said last month she was minded to refer the proposed takeover of Sky by 21st Century Fox to the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) on the grounds of its commitment to broadcasting standards, as well as media plurality. The decision means the CMA will scrutinise the editorial standards of Fox, which is controlled by Rupert Murdoch and his sons Lachlan and James. According to a report in the New York Times on Saturday, O’Reilly was given the improved contract in February, a month after he agreed the $32m (£24m) payout to a regular on-screen analyst on Fox, who said O’Reilly repeatedly harassed her and sent indecent material. According to documents seen by the newspaper, and the testimony of people who knew about the deal, it followed allegations covering 15 years by analyst Lis Wiehl. Fox told the New York Times that it did not pay the amount to Wiehl, and was given no details of the amount. But the paper said Rupert, Lachlan and James Murdoch had “made a business calculation to stand by Mr O’Reilly despite his most recent, and potentially most explosive, harassment dispute”. It is at least the sixth such settled case involving O’Reilly, who was eventually sacked by Fox in April. He has denied any wrongdoing, telling the New York Times he paid the money to protect his family. Watson said he would write to the CMA to urge it to take all this into account when deciding on the Sky takeover, calling the latest revelations about O’Reilly “depressingly familiar”. He said: “They show that 21st Century Fox engaged in a prolonged campaign to cover up allegations of serious sexual harassment by a senior employee instead of investigating the claims and taking action against him. The fact that Fox handed Mr O’Reilly a lucrative new contract worth $25m months after he reportedly paid $32m to settle a claim by a colleague is jaw-dropping.” Fox News has faced similar controversy before. In 2016, the network’s founder, Roger Ailes, was forced to resign after a series of sexual harassment accusations from female colleagues. Ailes died earlier this year. “[Fox executives] knew they could rely on their employer to ignore serious allegations of sexual misconduct and pay huge sums to silence the women who made them,” Watson said. “The parallels with the phone-hacking scandal at Rupert Murdoch’s UK newspaper empire are unsettling. Instead of admitting wrongdoing, the Murdoch family’s first instinct is to deny it took place and, in many cases, to label those who try to establish the truth as liars or fantasists. It is a pattern that keeps on repeating itself.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/blog/2017/oct/22/football-safe-standing-home-advantage-studies","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-22T16:39:57Z","webTitle":"Safe standing’s surprise byproduct?

It might help the home team’s game","bodyText":"Slowly the barriers to safe standing in English football are tumbling. Most supporters want it. The majority of top-flight clubs back it. And, as we learnt last week, Shrewsbury Town will soon become the first league side to introduce it. Yet while the advantages for fans – and club finances – are repeated ad nauseam, another potential benefit is rarely discussed. Might safe standing improve a home team’s performance, too? The idea sounds left-field, even barmy. But anyone who has stood on the terraces knows the strange alchemy they possess and how the sound can spread like a contagion, inspiring players and intimidating referees. And with the Football Supporters’ Federation noting that safe-standing sections could legally fit 1.8 people into the same space as one seated fan, stadiums are likely to become buzzier again. Could it make a difference in a sport where home-field advantage has been eroding for decades? Ignacio Palacios‑Huerta, a professor of management, economics and strategy at the London School of Economics and head of talent ID at Athletic Bilbao, where he also sits on the board, suggests so. He points to multiple studies that show stadiums with a better attendance-to-capacity ratio can influence referees – and help the better supported team. One way to illustrate this is by looking at the link between referee bias and crowd size with injury time. On average it is three minutes in football’s top tiers. However, if the home team is behind by just a single goal, injury time stretches to 35% longer than average, whereas if they are ahead by one goal, it is 29% less. “What we also find is that when crowds are larger, referees become more biased,” he says. “An increase of one standard deviation in crowd size causes the home bias to rise by 20%.” Unsurprisingly, when the crowd is largely made up of away fans, home bias is mitigated. Palacios-Huerta also cites another study, which looked at what happens when teams in Italy were forced to play in empty stadiums. It found that without any spectators, the typical ‘home’ advantage in terms of foul rate and yellow and red cards disappeared entirely. That should not come as a surprise. Referees might think they are immune from crowd pressure but the data suggests otherwise. When 40 qualified referees were asked to judge 47 incidents from a 1998-99 match between Liverpool and Leicester – half with crowd noise, half in silence – researchers found that those viewing the footage with crowd noise awarded 15.5% fewer fouls against the home team compared with those watching on mute. Other research has shown that when teams in Germany removed running tracks from their stadium they also received fewer yellow and red cards at home. As the co-author Dr Rob Simmons, an economist at Lancaster University, explains: “Less distance between fans and referee imposes more social pressure on referees. A switch to safe standing would be predicted to have similar consequences.” Palacios-Huerta, meanwhile, gives another example from his experiences at Bilbao about how crowds can also affect players. A few years ago the club moved to a new stadium and had to play for one season with no fans behind one end. Beforehand the coach Ernesto Valverde asked him to research the effects of playing in such an asymmetric venue. When he examined Rayo Vallecano, whose stadium is U-shaped, he found there were between 2-3% more goals (both by the home and visiting teams) in the end without supporters. That result is counter-intuitive – perhaps the defence is more relaxed or attackers feel less pressured? – but notable. As Palacios-Huerta explains: “When I discussed the implications with Valverde for whether to choose to attack the end with no people in the first or second half, one assistant mentioned the effects were very small. I replied they were potentially huge in terms of points and money. “I showed this by translating the impact on goals to expected points if we managed to attack during the whole season the first half towards the end with no people. It was between 1.5 and two points in a season – so potentially choosing ’correctly’ the ends by halves was worth a lot.” Of course these effects are subtle. Millwall are not going to win the Premier League by building a 200,000 safe-standing stadium. We are talking a point here, a fortuitous decision there. But it all helps. In the season Bilbao played in their three-sided stadium, incidentally, they qualified for the Champions League. That said, there is no knowing yet the true desire for safe standing. The former Coventry City managing director Chris Anderson – a supporter – wonders whether it might be a symbolic demand that harks back to the ‘good old days’ for a generation of fans old enough to remember standing. “What if you built it and no one came?” he asks, especially given the cost of reconfiguring stadiums. It is a reasonable point. Undoubtedly safe standing is linked to a yearning for something ‘lost’ from English football beyond the ability to stand. Yet if the demand is there and it leads to cheaper prices and a better atmosphere, while also ensuring that no fan who attends a match ever loses his or her life, it is hard not to back it – especially if boosting one’s team is a happy by-product."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2017/oct/22/benjamin-kayser-defends-dylan-hartley-sin-bin","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-22T21:00:02Z","webTitle":"Benjamin Kayser defends Dylan Hartley from further punishment after sin-bin","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/oct/22/benjamin-kayser-defends-dylan-hartley-sin-bin","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/oct/22/benjamin-kayser-defends-dylan-hartley-sin-bin","fields":{"headline":"Benjamin Kayser defends Dylan Hartley from further punishment after sin-bin","bodyText":"Benjamin Kayser, Dylan Hartley’s opposite number at Clermont Auvergne on Saturday, believes punishing the hooker further would be bad for the game, after the Northampton and England captain was sent to the sin-bin for hitting an opponent in the face with a swinging arm. Hartley will know on Monday evening whether he faces further disciplinary action following his act 29 minutes into the 24-7 defeat at Clermont when he crashed into a ruck off his feet and caught the home prop Rabah Slimani, who was later sent to the sin-bin for a shoulder charge at Hartley’s head, in the face with his right arm. Slimani received treatment for a bleeding nose and Hartley, who is in line to be named on Thursday as England captain for the opening autumn international against Argentina at Twickenham, was sent to the sin-bin after Ben Whitehouse, the referee, ordered a review of the incident. “I think a sanction was merited because a penalty is a penalty and, if he deserved yellow, it was a yellow,” said Kayser, the France hooker who spent a season with Leicester. “Should it have been a red card? No, come on. “Rugby is rugby and, if you say that any hit on the head is a red card, there will be 25 a match. The last thing we want is to go out and start playing on the rules and to start saying [to the referee], ‘It was a cheap shot.’ We are not football. We are just here to play hard and to keep on going. I don’t think it was a red card, just a yellow.” A year ago World Rugby launched a crackdown on challenges that made contact with an opponent’s head. Hartley was sent off playing for Northampton against Leinster last December when he caught Sean O’Brien with a swinging arm that left the British &amp; Irish Lions flanker concussed. Hartley was banned for six weeks. “It is a physical game and serious offences need to be dealt with harshly for the health and safety of the players,” Kayser said. “But it must not be taken too far. It is about players taking it in our own hands and ensuring we do not spoil this wonderful game of ours. “It is a sport where we are fortunate enough to be able to talk to referees and have decent relations. There is nothing better than a referee turning round and asking the opposition captain whether a player deserved a red card. Most of the guys would say: ‘Listen, it is nothing.’ We are not idiots and we are not cheats.” If Hartley were cited, and it would be on the basis of the risk his action posed to Slimani, who remained on the pitch after treatment and did not require a head injury assessment, rather than its consequence. At the start of the year, when World Rugby’s aim was to punish high challenges to deter others, a citing would have been likely but so far this season the disciplinary process has been less punitive. The England head coach, Eddie Jones, has steadfastly supported Hartley and said the hooker would lead the side in the first autumn international against Argentina if his form merited selection. But as Jamie George closes the gap, Hartley needs to be disciplined, not just playing well."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/22/cherif-bassiouni-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-22T17:33:53Z","webTitle":"Cherif Bassiouni obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/22/cherif-bassiouni-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/22/cherif-bassiouni-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Cherif Bassiouni obituary","bodyText":"The Egyptian law professor Cherif Bassiouni, who has died aged 79, made an important contribution to the struggle for global justice and to the revival of the Nuremberg legacy. His work, both academic and in his UN reports from war zones, led to the creation of two international criminal courts. In 1992, he was appointed by the UN to chair a commission of experts to examine war crimes in the former Yugoslavia. His report delivered a searing verdict on the behaviour of all parties to the Balkan wars, but especially on the Serbs under Slobodan Milošević. It argued, in a novel development of the law of war, that through using rape as an instrument of ethnic cleansing, the Serb commanders were guilty of a crime against humanity. The UN had to act and, over the objections of British diplomats (who believed that peace could be negotiated without justice), accepted Bassiouni’s recommendation to set up a war crimes court – the international criminal tribunal for the former Yugoslavia or ICTY– in The Hague. Bassiouni, whose report and lobbying was instrumental in establishing the court (the first since Nuremberg), was an obvious choice as prosecutor, and was nominated by the US. He was blocked by Britain, for no good reason, although perhaps for a bad one – he was a Muslim. The court, in time, delivered justice on Radovan Karadžić and Ratko Mladić and other Serbian and Croat mass-murderers; Milošević died half-way through his trial. Bassiouni was appointed instead by the UN to report on the conflict in Afghanistan, where he upset the Bush regime by exposing the excesses of its military. He went on to lobby for a proposal he had long supported, when it was just a professorial pipe-dream: an international criminal court. He dominated the Rome conference in 1998 that established this court, the ICC, chairing the drafting committee that produced its statute and lobbying behind the scenes to obtain a large measure of agreement until it began operation in 2002. It now has 124 state parties. His work won him nomination for the 1999 Nobel prize (which went, instead, to Médecins Sans Frontières). More recently, however, he had spoken despairingly of the UN security council’s failure to permit ICC involvement in Syria, and of the continuing damage to the court by the refusal of Russia, China and the US to sign up to its statute. Bassiouni was born in Cairo, into an elite family: his grandfather had been president of the senate, and his father a senior diplomat – ironic, given Cherif’s long battle against diplomats who preferred to give tyrants expedient amnesties rather than to put them on trial. His upbringing was unusual – a Muslim youth sent to be schooled by Jesuits in Egypt and thence to study law in France. He returned to fight for Egypt during the Suez Crisis in 1956, and was wounded and decorated for his courage. His patriotism did not stop him from speaking out about the brutality of Gamal Abdel Nasser’s security forces, and he was placed under house arrest (it would have been prison, had his family not been well connected). After seven months of confinement he fled, smuggled himself on board a ship sailing for the US, and continued his legal studies. His conspicuous brilliance soon led him to be appointed professor of law at DePaul University in Chicago, where in 1990 he set up an International Human Rights Law Institute, as one of the first academics to teach this subject. It remained the base for his outpourings of books (he published 27) and lengthy essays in learned journals (270). He established a European base at the Siracusa Institute in Italy, where he trained quite a few of the judges who now sit on war crimes cases. They speak of him as an inspiring teacher, a role that he never neglected despite his UN work and frequent trips to war zones. As well as this intellectual output, he conducted no fewer than 22 UN inquiries and commissions. Although he never served as a UN judge or prosecutor, his reports carefully weighed the evidence, some of which he had collected himself at risk to his own life (his light aircraft was once hit by sniper fire over Sarajevo, his hotel in Bosnia was attacked and he narrowly escaped a suicide bomb in Fallujah). Despite the fears of British diplomats, he did not display bias, other than against the authors of the atrocities he examined. His reports had the particular merit of expedition – he usually produced them within six months or so of his mandate. In 2011 he chaired a commission of inquiry set up by the king of Bahrain to investigate the killings and torture of protesters. His 500-page report, produced in five months, pulled no punches and condemned the culture of impunity that had come about through failures in the local judiciary and in military courts. Several thousand detainees were released as a result. Bassiouni was, in private, an ebullient man, witty and sophisticated, who loved fine wines and classical music and (at least when I met him) was never without a fine cigar. He was a clever, insistent lobbyist for his projects behind the scenes at the UN, and an advocate for truth who never took money for slanting it. When the UN underfunded his inquiry into the Balkan atrocities he did accept money from the Soros Foundation to pay for some investigations – a matter that the Serbian government criticised, but he believed it was the only way to complete the report, and the funds came without strings attached. Although some states were cautious over suspicions of his Muslim background, this should have been seen as an asset: he was one of the first scholars to examine the concept of jihad in books and articles and to nuance Islamic teaching in a way that disfavoured violence. He did speak out against the discrimination that Muslims were suffering in the US, and defended the Gaza flotilla after it was attacked by Israel. Bassiouni watched the developments in his native Egypt with concern and some despondency. He shared the values of the protesters but knew the power of the army too well to think that the overthrow of Hosni Mubarak in 2011 would pave the way to freedom. He was, of course, correct. Bassiouni’s first wife, Rosanna Cesari, and second wife, Nina Delmissier, both predeceased him. He is survived by his third wife, Elaine Klemen-Bassiouni, and by a stepdaughter and two grandchildren. • Mahmoud Cherif Bassiouni, legal scholar, born 9 December 1937; died 25 September 2017"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/22/spain-needs-responsible-politicians-insurrection-catalan-crisis","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-22T16:59:24Z","webTitle":"Spain needs responsible politicians.

Instead, they are stoking insurrection","bodyText":"It happened before in the bourgeois capital of a prosperous region that proclaimed itself a republic. The year was 1919 and the revolutionary spirit was roaming the streets of Munich, capital of the short-lived Bavarian Soviet Republic. That’s where Max Weber delivered his famous lecture Politics as a Vocation (Politik als Beruf), in which he defined the basic virtue of a politician: to be able to balance conviction with responsibility. A responsible politician, he argued, will avoid doing anything that, while impeccable from a moral point of view, could alter the supreme public good of social peace. Weber’s words fell like a hammer blow on his audience, made up of impetuous students, eager to build a new country. Today in the streets of Barcelona, his sentiments would also fall on hostile ears. The regional government, blind to the social and economic uncertainty in which Catalonia is currently immersed, has abandoned the ethics of responsibility and has thrown itself off the cliff of its earnest moral principles. Since the staging of an unconstitutional referendum on 1 October, more than 1,000 Catalan companies, including its largest banks, have moved their legal headquarters from Catalonia to other Spanish regions. Social unrest is on the rise, with spontaneous, and increasingly difficult to control demonstrations by both separatists and unionists in many Spanish cities – not just in Catalonia. But the Spanish government also deserves criticism for its decision to impose direct rule from Madrid. The Spanish prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, announced on Saturday that he was legally invoking the rather vague article 155 of the Spanish constitution, which allows the Spanish government to give legally binding orders to regional governments that have been acting outside the law. After the Spanish senate authorises it next Friday, the Spanish government will dismiss the Catalan executive, and will limit the powers of the Catalan parliament. In practice, this means elected Catalan politicians will be replaced by unelected Madrid bureaucrats. Needless to say, these “men in black” will meet resistance both within the official buildings and in the ever more febrile streets. If the conservative-led Spanish government executes this plan, it will be acting according strictly to an ethics of conviction. The moral principle is immaculate. Spain’s rule of law has been violated by the Catalans’ illegal referendum, and thus the Catalan authority must be suspended. End of story. But were it to act responsibly, Spain’s dominant political forces would avoid anything that could lead to a serious disturbance of public order. By suddenly taking the reins of what, like it or not, is the democratically elected ruling body of a 7.5 million-strong region, they risk infuriating large social groups. Indeed, polls suggest that two out of three Catalans oppose the application of article 155. In an ideal world, the pure and surgical implementation of legality should not delegitimise the actions of a government. However, in today’s Catalonia, what would prevail in the popular narrative is the perception that the Catalan government has been “occupied” by foreign forces. Article 155 will have a boomerang effect both in the short-term – because it may trigger an insurrection in Catalonia – as well as in the long-term, because it will surely enhance the chances of the separatists in the next regional elections. This does not mean that Spain’s government and its unionist political allies have to renounce their political principles. But they should seek a compromise. Instead of imposing direct rule and firing the Catalan government from day one, the Spanish government should first ask the Catalan leader, Carles Puigdemont, to call for early elections. In the event of a negative response, the Spanish government could proceed with the mildest implementation of article 155 – that is, legally forcing the Catalan authorities to organise the early elections themselves. Threatened with judicial prosecutions, the Catalan government would be forced to obey – and, as a matter of fact, early elections would be the second-best option for most separatists. Only if the Catalan authorities failed to comply with this requirement, then, and only then, should the Spanish government take over those Catalan autonomous institutions necessary for organising the regional elections. Spain’s major unionist parties – the PP, the PSOE, and Ciudadanos – should substitute this gradual chain of actions for the harsher reaction they all seem to prefer now. They need to understand that incrementalism does not mean appeasement, but rather responsibility. Only a better calibrated response can persuade the average Catalan citizen to accept the eventual suspension of the Catalan government as a lesser evil, over joining an insurrection in the streets next week – or in the ballots next month. • Victor Lapuente Giné is a columnist for El País, and associate professor at the University of Gothenburg’s department of political science"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"society/2017/oct/22/universal-credits-flaws-hurt-the-people-who-most-need-it","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-22T16:09:52Z","webTitle":"Universal credit’s flaws hurt the people who most need it | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/oct/22/universal-credits-flaws-hurt-the-people-who-most-need-it","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/oct/22/universal-credits-flaws-hurt-the-people-who-most-need-it","fields":{"headline":"Universal credit’s flaws hurt the people who most need it","bodyText":"Your editorial on universal credit sets out what it describes as its “unimpeachably sensible” goal of simplifying benefits so they mimic a monthly pay cheque (19 October). This echoes the argument made by politicians that monthly benefit payments will help claimants get into the “habit” of working life, and of monthly budgeting. But many low-paid workers receive their wages weekly or fortnightly. For those on low incomes (in and out of work), stretching the budgetary period over a longer time frame can make managing resources harder still. This is one more reason why universal credit is only likely to worsen the hardship claimants face. It is policymaking grounded in a one-dimensional view of what employment looks like, which ignores the experiences of those on low incomes. Dr Ruth Patrick University of Liverpool • The consequences of giving people with little or no savings the challenge of managing a monthly budget with a very low income are obvious. However, ministers seem to have a remarkable ability to disregard common sense and carry on regardless (think Chris Grayling and his prison reforms, or Andrew Lansley and his health service changes, and possibly now Brexit). It rarely seems to be moderated by hands-on experience of what they are changing. In the 1980s, Matthew Parris, then a Tory MP, took on the challenge of trying to manage to live for a week on benefits. Perhaps now is the time to repeat the experiment and ask Iain Duncan Smith, the brains behind the original idea, and David Gauke, responsible for rolling it out, to repeat the experiment and imagine they have just received their P45s and have to manage for six weeks until they get their first payment. I would be fascinated to see how they get on.

It’s true British authors are not eligible for the main US awards, but isolationism on one side of the Atlantic need not be met by timidity on the other. I was a judge of the Man Booker prize in 2014 when American books were first admitted, and all the panel felt this had brought wonderful new energy to it. I was able to compare it with an earlier year when I had again been a judge, but without any American submissions. Second time round was even more enjoyable than the first because we knew we were meeting the challenge of finding the best novel in the English language of that year, regardless of where it originated. We chose an Australian book. The next year the winner was Jamaican. This year British and Pakistani writers have been on the shortlist. Why should British or Commonwealth novelists be frightened of American competition? Each year the judges make a sincere effort to find the best. There will be plenty of future winners from the UK, the Commonwealth and, of course, the US.

Other Evertonians laughed. Most headed for the exits. Arsenal then scored a fourth, then a fifth. Turning the screw. “Write what you want to write,” bristled Ronald Koeman when, having decried the amount of negativity around an Everton team now languishing in the bottom three, he was asked what positives he could see in a comprehensive home defeat. The highly paid manager had needed a show of conviction, of progress and most of all a result with the pressure intensifying and him no closer to a solution to the conundrum posed by this summer’s investment of almost £140m. His team got a sound beating instead as Arsenal marked Arsène Wenger’s 68th birthday with a first away win in the Premier League this season and a scoreline to help exorcise the trauma of their last visit to Merseyside, the 4-0 reverse at Anfield in August. Wenger deployed Alexis Sánchez, Mesut Özil and Alexandre Lacazette in attack for the first time this season and was rewarded with a vibrant, expansive and dominant display. But for Jordan Pickford, Everton’s £30m goalkeeper and rare success in the summer transfer market, Arsenal would have registered seven or eight. “That was maybe our most complete performance of the season defensively and offensively,” the Arsenal manager said. “Alexis was on fire. Mesut was superb – agile, quick, intelligent and always at the service of the team with his passing. He is an exceptional player.” As for those Manchester United rumours about Özil, Wenger said: “As players and manager we can only give one response and that is to be focused on the pitch.” For Koeman the focus will inevitably shift towards his future as Everton manager. His team are adrift, without hope and direction. Their manager is scrambling around for answers and producing nothing, although Koeman’s case here was not helped by the 68th-minute dismissal of Idrissa Gueye. Arsenal were on the front foot long before Wayne Rooney rolled back the years – 15 years and three days to be exact – to open the scoring with another long-range strike against Arsenal. The 32-year-old’s finish carried echoes of his memorable debut goal against Wenger’s then league champions, in 2002. Right foot, Park End, textbook technique and struck to the Arsenal goalkeeper’s right; Rooney reminded the watching Gareth Southgate of his enduring quality as he used Nikola Vlasic’s decoy run to move into space before sweeping a 20-yard finish beyond Petr Cech. For Arsenal it was an unnecessary – but only fleeting – reminder of their defensive deficiencies. Granit Xhaka was easily dispossessed by Gueye in midfield to allow Rooney to take possession. Defenders then backed off the former England and Manchester United captain as he lined up the 201st league goal of his career. It was a gift for Everton, who desperately needed a release after two wins in 12 matches and had been besieged until that point. Koeman’s latest selection and formation shuffle had him arrive at a 3-4-2-1 shape that soon morphed into a bizarre 3-3-3-1, with Gueye all alone in central midfield as Vlasic followed his natural inclination to attack. Özil and Sánchez prospered in the space either side of the stranded Senegal international. The only surprise about Arsenal’s equaliser was the identity of the goalscorer. Pickford had foiled Aaron Ramsey, Sánchez and Lacazette superbly but arguably could have done better with Xhaka’s low 25-yard shot than to parry back into the danger area. In mitigation, the midfielder’s effort took a slight deflection off Gylfi Sigurdsson, who endured another poor game, and Everton defenders reacted slower than Nacho Monreal to the rebound. The Arsenal defender converted emphatically and the stage was set for another dispiriting afternoon for Koeman and his team. Everton fell behind after a rare foray forward broke down in the Arsenal area. The visitors broke incisively. Sánchez, Goodison’s pantomime villain after demanding a second yellow card for Ashley Williams, carried the ball down the left and floated a delightful cross between Michael Keane and Phil Jagielka. Between the central defenders ghosted Özil, who gave Pickford no chance with a pristine header from six yards out. Belief, already fragile, vanished from Everton in an instant and their task became more ominous when Gueye was sent off for clattering into Xhaka, his second bookable offence. The needless challenge was duly punished. Arsenal’s third stemmed from a careless pass by Vlasic to Hectór Bellerín. Xhaka released Özil down the right and, with no royal blue shirt near him, the Germany international strolled into the area and squared for Lacazette to beat Pickford with a convincing finish. It was the cue for Arsenal to start show-boating. Ramsey converted a fine through ball from the substitute Jack Wilshere to extend the visitors’ lead and, though Oumar Niasse grabbed a consolation having dispossessed Cech, it was left to Sánchez to have the final say with a precise finish into the far corner in stoppage time. The final word on the pitch that is.Moshiri and Kenwright may determine otherwise if their patience in Koeman has evaporated."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/20/women-sexual-harassment-gaslighting-instincts","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-20T19:37:05Z","webTitle":"Women, we should stop gaslighting ourselves and trust our instincts | Mona Chalabi","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/20/women-sexual-harassment-gaslighting-instincts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/20/women-sexual-harassment-gaslighting-instincts","fields":{"headline":"Women, we should stop gaslighting ourselves and trust our instincts","bodyText":"Aside from the words “massage”, “bathrobe” and “undressed”, there’s another theme that recurs in the allegations – more than 50 of them – against Harvey Weinstein: many of the women felt uneasy as soon as they met him. The sickening allegations have reminded me just how important it is that we trust our instincts. If you don’t get to the bottom of this piece, please remember this crucial caveat: I am not placing one iota of blame on the women whose trust was abused – the responsibility for that will always lie with the person who did the abusing. In the case of Harvey Weinstein, and so many others, the choice about whether to ignore our instincts is distorted to the point of being almost meaningless. The women’s decisions were deeply affected by the fact that their entire careers could rest on this man – a fact Weinstein knew how to play all too well. That’s what power does. It doesn’t just affect the choices we have available to us, it affects the way we choose between them. But on those rare moments where we can choose; where we’re deciding whether or not to go for a second date, whether or not to share a ride, and when there’s that voice within us saying “that guy seems like a bit of a creep”, we should listen, rather than heeding the million other voices that say “you’ve got no reason to think that” or “he doesn’t seem so bad” or “stop being crazy”. We should stop gaslighting ourselves. Instincts are difficult to describe but easy to know. I’ve shaken hands with men and seen a look in their eye that makes my throat dry up. I’ve sat beside men on trains and felt their legs a fraction of an inch closer than they needed to be. I’ve paid for things and had men touch my hands as I place my money down on the counter. We often feel utterly paralysed in those moments. You can’t stop meeting men, riding trains or paying for things. And to speak up would be to expose yourself to ridicule, to show yourself as a monster who has lost their mind to paranoia. The very least we can do in those situations, the absolute bare minimum, is to listen to those inner voices. We can have so little information available to us when we meet someone new. Rather than saying “I don’t want to read too much into that”, we should trust that the little signs are revealing of something bigger. This is about unlearning a lesson that is good in one classroom but not in another. Yes, we should be generous; yes, we should give people a second chance – but not when it comes to our mental and physical safety. It’s just not worth it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/2017/oct/20/fa-greg-clarke-john-amaechi-equality-claims","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-20T18:31:32Z","webTitle":"FA’s Greg Clarke under further pressure after John Amaechi’s equality claims","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/oct/20/fa-greg-clarke-john-amaechi-equality-claims","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/oct/20/fa-greg-clarke-john-amaechi-equality-claims","fields":{"headline":"FA’s Greg Clarke under further pressure after John Amaechi’s equality claims","bodyText":"Greg Clarke’s position as chairman of the Football Association is set to come under further scrutiny after it was alleged he told John Amaechi, one of Britain’s highest-profile openly gay sportsmen, that he would not risk “getting fucking fired for equality”. Clarke is already in hot water over the FA’s handling of allegations of discrimination made by Eni Aluko. At a parliamentary hearing this week, which exposed deep flaws in the way the organisation investigated the former England Women’s manager Mark Sampson, Clarke dismissed the idea of institutional racism as “fluff”, although he swiftly attempted to retract his words. Now Amaechi, a former NBA player who came out in 2007 in the United States, says Clarke displayed an arrogance and lack of appetite for real action to combat homophobia in football. “His office reached out to talk to me,” said Amaechi. “I was surprised to be asked because I’m persona non grata among many sporting organisations. “He walked in and explained what he was doing and said he was trying to move things forward. I said what he was saying they were going to do wasn’t going to work and then we got into an intellectual pissing contest where he told me about his multiple degrees and how he was on the board of many different high-powered organisations and he knows better. “I mentioned to him that I thought the FA had the power to do a lot more than they currently do to address the problems. At which point Greg described the ‘crustiness’ of the FA council and the existence of a bunch of octogenarians who weren’t going to tolerate radical change. “I said: ‘Part of the job of organisations which speak so strongly to British culture as football was to lead not follow, to set an example.’ I said it was about time he did something radical to which he said: ‘I’m not going to do something radical. That’s what got the last guy fired. I’m not getting fucking fired for equality.’” The previous chairman of the FA, Greg Dyke, stood down in June last year after facing opposition to long-overdue reform at the governing body. “If it’s true that the last person got fired for trying to bring around change too quickly then it’s a sad indictment of the sport,” Amaechi said. Amaechi claims Clarke also later said the government would be powerless to affect any change. “They won’t do a fucking thing, we have all the power,” is what Amaechi alleged was said by Clarke. A spokesperson for the FA said: “Homophobia in football is an important subject and one that the Chairman feels passionately about. He had a private meeting with John Amaechi in March to discuss potential ways how he and The FA can work most effectively in the field of LGBT inclusion. They had a strong, healthy and robust debate and the chairman valued John’s personal insight and suggestions.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2017/oct/20/ronald-koeman-everton-fans-arsenal","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-20T21:30:05Z","webTitle":"Ronald Koeman’s close shave shows he is not deaf to Goodison Park gripes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/oct/20/ronald-koeman-everton-fans-arsenal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/oct/20/ronald-koeman-everton-fans-arsenal","fields":{"headline":"Ronald Koeman’s close shave shows he is not deaf to Goodison Park gripes","bodyText":"It is part of Ronald Koeman’s routine to tweet before and after a match but he does not dwell on the reactions among his 1.16m followers. “I don’t read the comments of fans, no,” the Everton manager claimed. “I want a quiet life.” He is in the wrong place in that case. Against Arsenal on Sunday opinions from inside Goodison Park may not be easily ignored. Just when Everton thought their problems were confined to Koeman’s overpriced, underperforming team a knuckle-dragger emerges from the Gwladys Street stand, child in arm, to aim a blow at Lyon’s goalkeeper, Anthony Lopes. His actions have prompted a police investigation, a ban from the club and disciplinary action by Uefa, yet could not distract totally from another severe setback for the Everton manager on Thursday. Lyon was a must-win for Everton’s Europa League prospects, Koeman said beforehand. A 2-1 defeat ensured they go into the Arsenal game having won twice in 12 matches, lost six of the past 10 and with their £6m-a-year coach under intense pressure – if not from the board, then from an increasingly disillusioned fanbase. “I am still the man and we will fight for everything to turn it around,” said Koeman, who has followed recent Twitter advice and shaved before Arsenal’s visit. “Now I am 10 years younger after a shave,” he quipped. “But no, seriously, it is normal it has an impact if the team is not doing well; then it always comes in the direction of the manager. If you don’t like it, then take another job.” Koeman is clinging to the positive that Everton displayed fighting spirit against Lyon – not a reference to the pitchside mêlée sparked by Ashley Williams. As for quality, however, something that might be expected following a summer outlay of almost £140m, that was mentioned only in terms of its absence. “I can’t complain about the attitude or workrate of the players,” Koeman said. “But I can about several situations in the game, about cleverness, about quality and about decision-making. But not about how they fight, how they try and what they give on the pitch.” He says that, with the exception of the £30m goalkeeper Jordan Pickford and Wayne Rooney, none of the club’s summer signings has fulfilled expectations “at the moment but the future will tell everyone that the signings we did were really good signings”. He elaborated: “You need time to adapt. That’s the situation for Davy Klaassen and the situation for Sandro Ramírez. Yes, Pickford is showing why we signed him as maybe a future No1 for England. Michael Keane is performing well sometimes, like the first half against Lyon, but the second half was not good. He made mistakes in the buildup. [Gylfi] Sigurdsson showed in 20-25 minutes yesterday why we signed him with an assist and was close to making a second goal. He will show that quality. Wayne Rooney is not a player for me who brings any doubts. He is a quality player but of course the situation is difficult. For Davy Klaassen it is a lack of confidence. You can see that in his decision-making on the pitch and about his aggression. I expect him to be more aggressive but with many doubts in his head it is difficult to play football.” A home win over Arsenal was a turning point for Everton last season although last season they had Romelu Lukaku. Despite being aware of Lukaku’s intention to leave in the spring and heavy investment in the summer, Everton are now reliant on the inexperienced Dominic Calvert-Lewin, the once-ostracised Oumar Niasse and the £5.2m summer recruit Ramírez to lead the line. The boardroom’s support for Koeman perhaps stems from a recognition the manager is not solely to blame for the gaping hole in his team. “We know that we don’t have that striker in what we expected and that makes it more difficult,” said Koeman, who will have regrets when he sees Olivier Giroud, a striker he wanted, in the Arsenal ranks on Sunday. “It is not straight and honest to expect Dominic to be that already. He will grow and is improving and nobody else of that age is playing as often in the Premier League and in a difficult position. We had someone who scored 25 goals last season and that is a big miss. It is not easy to find something that is better than it was. And that’s normal. “On the football side Steve Walsh [the director of football] and I were working on getting a good one in. We didn’t get anyone in who was better than the players we had and then there was the cost of several players who were not the first options. Finally we decided not to sign. We knew we had some new players in. We needed time. What is the best formation? What is the best striker with Wayne, Sigurdsson, Klaassen? We struggled at the beginning to get the right formation and that makes it even difficult. Then not good results and that brings us back to the lack of confidence.” And avoiding Twitter."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/27/canada-indigenous-women-sterilisation-lawsuit","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-27T09:00:25Z","webTitle":"Canada indigenous women were coerced into sterilisations, lawsuit says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/27/canada-indigenous-women-sterilisation-lawsuit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/27/canada-indigenous-women-sterilisation-lawsuit","fields":{"headline":"Canada indigenous women were coerced into sterilisations, lawsuit says","bodyText":"Two indigenous women in Canada have filed a class action lawsuit over allegations that they were coerced into undergoing sterilisation at a Saskatchewan hospital. The suit was launched after health authorities in the province admitted that several women had come forward with similar claims. The legal challenge, which still needs to be certified by a judge, centres on the idea of proper and informed consent – and whether this was obtained before the womenwere sterilised. One of the complainants alleges that she explicitly refused to have her fallopian tubes tied when staff suggested the procedure after the birth of her son in 2001. Despite her objections, she was taken to the operating room in a wheelchair, still weak from delivery, and the procedure was carried out, she said. The second woman alleges that a doctor suggested tubal ligation as she was being wheeled into the operation theatre for an emergency caesarean section – and had already been given an epidural to counter the deep pain she was in. She had serious reservations about the procedure, but was also worried about the premature arrival of her son and felt she was in no position to reject the idea, she alleges. She consented and the procedure was carried out immediately after her son was born in 2008. Both complainants’ identities are protected by a publication ban. “You have to ask yourself, how did this happen?” said Alisa Lombard, the lawyer who filed the statement of claim. “These are people whose choices were taken away and they are choices based in fundamental human rights. The very intimate and personal decision to have children – or to not have children – belongs to the individual. It’s not something that can be fettered or influenced or coerced or forced.” The issue of coerced sterilisations in Saskatchewan was thrust into the spotlight in 2015, after several women told local media that they had felt pressured into having a tubal ligation immediately after childbirth at a hospital in Saskatoon. Health authorities responded by introducing new criteria for tubal ligations and commissioning an independent review. The resulting report by an indigenous doctor and lawyer was released in July and described the experiences of seven indigenous women who felt they had been coerced into sterilisation. The report did not give timelines or specific details. Instead it focused on the women’s experiences of feeling powerless and discriminated against, documenting how some felt as though they had been harassed into the procedure by nurses and doctors. One woman said hospital staff did not want her to leave until she had tubal ligation. Several of the women said they did not give consent or could not recall doing so. Others said they consented because they were “too tired and overwhelmed to fight any longer”, the report found. Most of the women, it added, did not understand that tubal ligations were permanent. Historians have long documented the disproportionate effect that policies on sterilisation have had on Canada’s indigenous women. In 1928, the province of Alberta enacted legislation aimed at sterilising those considered mentally challenged and other disadvantaged groups. An estimated 2,800 sterilisations were carried out – including on many Aboriginal people – before the act was repealed in 1972. Authorities in British Columbia, which passed its own act in 1933, sterilised some 400 people. The release of the report this summer sparked a public apology from the Saskatoon health region, the authority that oversees the hospital highlighted in the claims. “I want to apologise to the women who came forward in the review, who’ve come forward to us in the past, and who haven’t yet been able to come forward to us,” a spokeswoman, Jackie Mann, said at a news conference. “This report states that racism exists within our healthcare system and we as leaders acknowledge this,” she added. “No woman should be treated the way you were treated.” The report also delved into the lasting consequences the procedure had had on the women, from health issues to the breakdown of relationships. These after-effects are reflected in the proposed class action lawsuit: one of the complainants said she sought to reverse her tubal ligation in 2011, only to be told there was little chance of doing so successfully. The realisation left her wrestling with feelings of shame, depression and anxiety, according to court documents. “She has experienced a feeling of losing her womanhood and value as a woman, an ability integral to her cultural and spiritual beliefs, and has isolated herself physically and emotionally,” the claim noted. If certified, the lawsuit is seeking damages of C$7m per plaintiff. Since filing the statement of claim, the lawyer representing the two women said she had heard from more than 40 other women across Saskatchewan with similar experiences, one as recent as 2010. “The number increases every day,” said Lombard. “There are some women that it not only happened to them but it happened to their mothers and daughters.” Their stories shed light on the barriers that can, at times, cloud the issue of proper and informed consent, from entrenched power structures and stereotypes, to language and cultural barriers, she noted. “It’s just so terrible to hear,” she said. “Because you hope that it’s isolated and then when it turns out not to be – when it turns out to look like a systemic failure – you really have to wonder how this could happen.” While the legal action aims to address individual consequences, Lombard wondered about the broader impact. “What would indigenous nations look like if these practices had not have been carried out?” Lombard asked. “How many more children would we have as part of our vibrant, indigenous communities? We’ll never know. So the loss is primarily individual, but also collective.” She pointed to the United Nations convention on the prevention and punishment of genocide, which includes measures aimed at preventing births within a group. “When you talk about genocide, no one wants to think Canada,” she said. “I don’t want to call it that, but I have to call it that, because that’s what it is.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/21/england-scotland-accents-dialects-north-south","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-21T05:00:14Z","webTitle":"Flattening in England, resurgent in Scotland: accents still shape our island life | Ian Jack","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/21/england-scotland-accents-dialects-north-south","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/21/england-scotland-accents-dialects-north-south","fields":{"headline":"Flattening in England, resurgent in Scotland: accents still shape our island life","bodyText":"Accents might be seen as the failure of speech to match some imaginary norm. What’s odd in Glasgow seems ordinary in Essex, and vice versa; and what was ordinary yesterday seems extraordinary now. In Ma’am Darling, Craig Brown’s recently published (and very entertaining) biographical study of Princess Margaret, the author devotes a chapter to the princess’s stilted encounter in 1981 with Roy Plomley on Desert Island Discs. “Ma’am, have you a big collection of records?” the presenter begins reverentially. “Ears, quate,” says the princess. “Have you kept your old 78s?” Plomley ploughs on. “Oh, ears,” the princess replies, “they’re all velly carefully preserved.” The “ears” is baffling until Brown discloses that that’s how she says “yes”, just as she says “nyair” for “no” and “velly” for “very”; and of course the short “a” now commonly rendered as an “e” in comic transcriptions of Brief Encounter: “Eh hev them up in the ettic, eckshleh,” HRH says when Plomley wonders where her 78rpms are kept. Or rather, that’s what Craig Brown hears. When I find the recording of that episode in the BBC archive, I hear something different. “Yes” sounds more or less like “yes”. No matter how often I say “ears” aloud, I can’t hear a “yes” lurking inside it. Then it occurs to me that, having grown up in Scotland, I sound the “r”. People in England tend to skip the “r” as the final consonant and say “ee-uh” or “ee-ah”. To them this pronunciation is standard. So to reach an understanding of the princess’s pronunciation, we must also understand the author’s. Sure enough, when I try “ee-uhs”, I catch the “ya” that’s often present in the upper-class affirmative, spoken from the back of the throat – and there is, of course, something of that in Princess Margaret. Many fewer people speak this way now, and almost none of them can be heard with any regularity on television or radio unless as the subjects of documentaries on impoverished aristocrats, secret fox hunts or elephant polo. The Queen herself no longer sounds as she did – compare last year’s Christmas speech to the one she made in 1957. Like priests abandoning Latin or pundits Sanskrit, what was once known as British “society” has, consciously or otherwise, rejected a form of pronunciation that was exclusive to them, in a vocal effort to blend in with the social classes lower down the scale. This could be read as a failure of confidence, or a way of protecting their position by demonstrating that they are really just like the rest of us. Probably it’s both. George Bernard Shaw writes in the preface to Pygmalion about the impossibility of an Englishman ever opening his mouth “without making some other Englishman hate or despise him”. And who in a democratic-turned-populist age would want to go on living as an advertisement for privilege when a few lessons from a voice coach – of the kind taken, for example, by Samantha Cameron – could help maintain or increase their public esteem? Until the 1960s, it was the other way around. Accents were continually upgraded. “An honest and natural slum dialect is more tolerable than the attempt of a phonetically untaught person to imitate the vulgar dialect of the golf club,” Shaw wrote in the same preface (a less well-known sentence, in which the Irish playwright displays the snobbery he was chastising the English for a paragraph or two before). But not many working-class people shared that view. It was good to speak proper: you got on that way. Elocution lessons were one way to progress – “how now brown cow”, and so on – though it would be wrong to stress their importance. Trying to understand why I speak differently from my parents, I can think of some reasons that are particular to me – for instance, leaving home in Fife for Glasgow when I was 18, and leaving Scotland for London seven years later – as well as others that were widely shared in my generation. Schoolteachers, the radio, the cinema: all these played their osmotic part. We absorbed an idea of “pure” or standard English that was exemplified by the way officers spoke on the bridge of HMS Compass Rose, or Dirk Bogarde in Doctor in the House. Voices that deviated from this standard (such as cockney, Highland, Welsh, north country) usually signified personality types (chipper, melancholy, talkative, bluff) rather than complicated individuality. As this was Scotland, a place of strong dialects that some now argue amount to a separate language, vocabulary as well as accent was worn away. I can’t ever remember using words that my parents used: bairn for child, bide for stay, blate for shy, breeks for trousers, brig for bridge (to name a few of the Bs). An aunt, who had left Fife as a girl to do well in London, would sometimes trot out old aphorisms when she came north to see us: “They keep their ane fish guts fir their ane sea maws [seabirds],” she’d say of some tight-fisted or self-interested group. But the effect was odd. London vowels mixed with Scottish consonants. It was like looking at some piece of folk art in a museum, encouraging the notion that the dialect was ill suited to modernity. In England, other than in the big-city patois developed by the multicultural young, I think that notion still holds good. Dialects are certainly paid attention. This week the Leeds Archive of Vernacular Culture announced it was to receive a National Lottery grant of nearly £800,000 to help with its survey of English linguistic traditions; and next month The Arsonists, a new opera to be sung entirely in the Yorkshire accent, will have its premiere in Salford. But however worthwhile the result, these ventures have the same air of scholarship and hobbyism associated with enthusiasms for canal boats, preserved railways and brass bands. The country where accents are genuinely resurgent is Scotland, where they have political clout. And in one particular case, that of the Glasgow accent, have thickened rather than weakened. A comparison of Scotland and the West Midlands region is instructive. Both contain similar numbers of people, but while Scottish-accented reporters and presenters are ever present on BBC news programmes, it’s hard to think of any regular voice from Birmingham. A knotty cluster of reasons may explain this, including the fact that middle-class Scots tend to retain their local accents while middle-class Midlanders tend to shed them but the suspicion that politics has empowered the Scottish accent is hard to avoid. When the TV presenter Tessa Dunlop presented an idea for a documentary about Ben Nevis to Radio 4, concerns were raised about her sounding “too English”. In fact, she was born and raised in Scotland, and in a recent piece blamed the BBC for kowtowing to “that last acceptable whipping boy of national identity – the accent … every lazy xenophobe’s best friend”. Anglophobia certainly exists in Scotland, and the “slightly posh-sounding English” that Dunlop says she speaks probably does make her inimical to the more bigoted nationalist. But in England too that voice has lost friends. Who wants these days to sound posher than the family they were born into? Well, one man at least. How did Jacob Rees-Mogg come to sound as he does? “Top school” and “family background” won’t do as explanations. Etonians don’t as a rule drawl like that, at least not in the past half-century, and there are no dukes and earls in his lineage. His mother, Gillian, went to Camden School for Girls, a good grammar in north London, and then to secretarial college; his father, William, was born into the Somerset gentry and attended Charterhouse and Balliol College, Oxford. They met at the Sunday Times in the early 1960s, when William was the city editor and Gillian his secretary. A colleague at the paper, Hunter Davies, remembers William as good journalist (he later edited the Times): no drawler, but rather aloof and too work-absorbed to notice that his secretary was secretly in love with him – until, that is, Davies pointed it out. A shy man married a jolly woman. Jacob was the fourth of five children. He had some of his father’s accent but little of his shyness. His persona probably combines his mother’s sense of fun with his father’s self-importance, but to a large extent he’s self-invented. The theatrical drawl and the good suits make him a retro figure who seems to come from an older England of accents and classes, layered like geological strata, everyone knowing their place. His supporters, who know they can never sound as fine as he does, are drawn like moths to a most superior lamp. His rise is the great exception to the demotic progress of the English accent; the old dialect of the upper classes may not be quite done for yet."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/2017/oct/20/southampton-west-bromwich-albion-match-preview","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-20T17:23:36Z","webTitle":"Southampton v West Bromwich Albion: match preview","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/oct/20/southampton-west-bromwich-albion-match-preview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/oct/20/southampton-west-bromwich-albion-match-preview","fields":{"headline":"Southampton v West Bromwich Albion: match preview","bodyText":"These two sides are sitting in mid-table but may feel under pressure by kick-off, when all but one of the teams below them will have played.

Christian Cole read classics and went on to become the first African-origin barrister in the English courts in the 1880s. Where Mr Cole once blazed a trail, few unfortunately have followed. Data extracted by Labour MP David Lammy shows that 10 out of 32 Oxford colleges did not award a place to a black British pupil in 2015. Oxford’s great rival Cambridge University fared little better: six colleges failed to admit any black British A-level students in the same year. Britain’s most elitist universities could put a plaque up for every black person they admitted and still have room for Cecil Rhodes statues. There is a legitimate call to broaden access to the best universities. The top institutions are gatekeepers, in many walks of life, to a high-flying, well-paid career, often in prestigious fields where power and influence reside. Oxford – the alma mater of seven of the past 10 British prime ministers – and Cambridge regularly vie for the top spot in global university rankings. Race matters; as does place and class. Wealthy, privately educated students from the south-east of the country dominate Oxbridge’s intake. Oxford and Cambridge represent an elite within the elite. London’s Imperial College, one of the world’s best universities, took in double the percentage of black students Cambridge did last year. Within the Russell Group, representing the best universities, 6% of new young students come from the most disadvantaged fifth of neighbourhoods. At Oxford, it’s only 3%. It is also claimed that universities are rejecting minority ethnic students when they judge that too many are taking a course. Without access to quality education, divisions that have opened up in British society are likely to widen, not narrow. This would be deeply corrosive, affecting the way the country works and the way it thinks about itself. There’s plenty of evidence to suggest diversity should be prized – obvious when you consider that those from the same milieu probably share too much of their world; they are a lot less likely to introduce new information or challenging viewpoints. Resolving such differences is a creative act. This thinking has driven calls for a more inclusive Britain. In 1997, many of our country’s professions were deeply elitist. Today, says the social mobility commission, they have begun to recognise the benefits of being open to a far wider pool of talent. It also explains why, for the first time in its 380-year history, more than half of Harvard University’s student intake will not be white. In Britain universities need to face up to the challenge of today’s society and produce detailed statistics so deficiencies can be highlighted and tackled. There must also be a recognition that only a few hundred black Britons score the requisite three As or above to go the top universities. Similarly, only 1% of students eligible for free school meals do so, compared with 20% of all other state school pupils. We cannot reform the entire school system at a stroke. But we could, and should, judge A-levels in the light of the socioeconomic context in which they were achieved. Lowering entry requirements for applicants from disadvantaged backgrounds would signal a shift towards concern with fairer, rather than formal, forms of opportunity. Exams can break down inherited privilege. But at present they increasingly advantage those who have been schooled to excel in such situations."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"music/2017/oct/20/solange-knowles-tells-evening-standard-dont-touch-my-hair","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-20T18:37:41Z","webTitle":"Solange Knowles tells Evening Standard: 'Don't Touch My Hair'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/oct/20/solange-knowles-tells-evening-standard-dont-touch-my-hair","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/oct/20/solange-knowles-tells-evening-standard-dont-touch-my-hair","fields":{"headline":"Solange Knowles tells Evening Standard: 'Don't Touch My Hair'","bodyText":"The singer Solange Knowles has called out the London Evening Standard for apparently digitally altering an image of her for the cover of its weekly magazine.

Knowles posted excerpts from the interview on Instagram Stories, where posts disappear after 24 hours, including her quotes about braiding. She also posted an image of the cover of the magazine and circled where the braids were. The Evening Standard has published full photos of Knowles on its website and Instagram page.

On stage, a brother and sister are figuring out how to share their bedroom, following the arrival of a baby sibling. In the theatre, my two-year-old nephew Joseph is struggling to sit alongside a crowd of noisy and excited kids. Joseph is scared and he wants to go home. By the end of Sarah Argent’s brilliant show, we have to stop him clambering on to the stage. It’s quite the transformation. Argent creates richly detailed, funny and thoughtful shows and has had a number of hits at the Polka, including Shake, Rattle and Roll last year. She devises family theatre that speaks directly to children, and works hard to find their language, their visuals and their feelings. My Brother, My Sister and Me is based on a series of conversations with local kids and their excited chatter has led to a script that glows with quirky and authentic detail. As the siblings get ready for bed, they discuss their new sister and wonder if she “speaks baby”. When they play hide and seek – they’re too excited to sleep – the brother proudly informs his sister: “The best place to hide is in Belgium.” And when the two make up a song about a toy gecko, the rhymes echo around the room (“Geckooooo, echoooo!”). It’s a uniquely empathetic production, and everything about it is seen through the eyes of a child. When the parents appear, they are suggested by a tiny sliver of light under the bedroom door. For their midnight feast the siblings open a sweet box which lets off a golden glow. As night sets in, the light of the moon feels magical and just a little bit frightening (Aaron J Dootson’s lighting is gorgeous), and when the two play with their toy gecko, the bedroom (designed with class by Katie Lias) throbs pink and green, transformed by the siblings’ collective imagination. Leona Allen and Craig Gazey are careful not to act as “kids” and infuse their performances with variety and depth. Their characters are fully-rounded, prone to temper tantrums, panic attacks and spontaneous acts of love. Tiny gestures take on a great significance, as we get pulled into the siblings’ world. The brother hangs up his sister’s hats and Joseph’s face lights up with joy. The two hide under the bedcovers and Joseph dissolves with laughter. It begins to snow outside the bedroom and a beautiful night-light floods the theatre with stars. The night draws to a close and Joseph, rather than being afraid of the unknown, embraces it. The world on stage has become his world and he doesn’t want it to end. At Polka theatre, London, until 11 February 2018.

Why not create vocational peerages?","bodyText":"As we crawl towards Brexit, it is inevitable that our attention will turn towards our institutions of national self-government. As parliamentary sovereignty is reasserted, the anomalies of the UK’s ancient constitution will re-emerge. Not the least of these is the House of Lords. There was a suggestion this week that there should be 15-year terms for newly appointed peers to limit their overall numbers. This does not really get to the point. The dilemma is that the unelected nature of the Lords supports the supremacy of the Commons. If it were elected it would lead to legislative conflict by undermining the democratic mandate of MPs. Paradoxically, the unelected Lords strengthens the democratic authority of the Commons. While there is undoubted experience, expertise and not a little excellence in the Lords, it nonetheless remains a vestige of cronyism and patronage in our polity that requires reform. The idea proposed by the government, during the last parliament, of a mirror of the commons called a senate, elected by proportional representation and with 15-year terms is not a very good idea. The Lords is really an extraordinary place. The hereditary peers are selected by internal election, there are people there with genuine distinction in their careers in business, academia, medicine and the church as well as politics. There are moments listening to debates when I am genuinely moved by the experience being brought to bear on the issue. Legislation is very properly amended and revised and a certain civility characterises conversation between parties and more eerily, within them. The number of working-class peers on our benches outnumbers those in the Commons. So, obviously, it has to go. I would suggest that the Commons is locational democracy, where people are elected from the places where they live. There was a referendum on electoral reform a few years ago and it was overwhelmingly in favour of keeping the single member constituency system. The Lords, in contrast, should represent vocational democracy. There should be people elected from each sector, whether that be electrical or academic, medical or administrative. Doctors should vote for a peer, as should nurses and cleaners. It would give an incentive to the organisation of carers, builders and gardeners, who would each select a representative from within their organisation. Faith communities should also be elected, with representatives of the Church of England, Sunnis, Shias, Catholics, Hindus and Jews. Their voices would be small, but they should also be heard in the framing of legislation. A recognition of religious diversity and its status as a vocation would thus be recognised within the body politic. The judges should be returned to the chamber so that it is the final court of appeal, thus restoring the balance of power in parliament. The vocational chamber would revise and amend legislation, as it does now, on the basis of the judgment of people who actually know what they are talking about, who are recognised as experts in their field by their peers through democratic election. It has been the greatest honour and privilege to sit in parliament, but I recognise that I would not win election to such a distinguished house and would not deserve to. The move towards becoming a self-governing democracy once more demands that we recognise the weaknesses of the prevailing system and take steps to remedy them. The representation of the working life of society, in its myriad of vocational forms, would bring experience and knowledge where currently it is lacking. The role of the Lords is to advise, amend and suggest, so that would not interfere with the primacy of the Commons but complement it. It would be a form of constitutional and institutional renewal that serves modern demands within the constraints of a meaningful tradition and offers an alternative to the status quo that would be consistent with its historical form. Such an arrangement would ensure that the working life of the country is represented in parliament. • Maurice Glasman is a Labour life peer and director of the faith and citizenship programme at London Metropolitan University"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/2017/oct/20/huddersfield-town-manchester-united-match-preview","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-20T15:56:55Z","webTitle":"Huddersfield Town v Manchester United: match preview","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/oct/20/huddersfield-town-manchester-united-match-preview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/oct/20/huddersfield-town-manchester-united-match-preview","fields":{"headline":"Huddersfield Town v Manchester United: match preview","bodyText":"Huddersfield, eager to arrest a decline that has led to them taking one point from their past five matches, were walloped 4-0 by Tottenham Hotspur in their last home game but that does not mean they will park the bus against their latest illustrious visitors.

Something has clearly put them off the pursuit of Alexis Sánchez, whom they courted in the summer. Perhaps they believe he is set upon a reunion with Pep Guardiola at Manchester City. Maybe they feel they cannot compete with the financial package Manchester United could offer. Possibly they deem the costs excessive. Yet, if that avenue is blocked, and with Crystal Palace unlikely to entertain offers for Christian Benteke, there remains the possibility Chelsea will explore Andy Carroll’s availability. Antonio Conte had hoped to secure a targetman over the summer and is apparently an admirer of Carroll, for all the 29-year-old’s patchy injury record. Such a move would once have seemed outlandish. Yet times may have changed. Dominic Fifield • Chelsea interested in signing Carroll from West Ham this month • Chelsea 0-0 Leicester: Read Dominic Fifield’s match report • Mourinho says he is man enough to apologise in latest Conte spat • Mahrez will not leave Leicester City in January, says Puel 2) Wenger has made a mess of the Sánchez situation Back in August, Arsène Wenger spoke of the conundrum he faced in dealing with Alexis Sánchez’s future. “We have to make a choice between efficiency on the field and financial interest,” he said. “In this case, I think I prioritise the fact that he will be useful on the sporting side.” The gamble has failed spectacularly; hindsight is 20/20 but how Wenger must be regretting his decision not to cash in and rebuild last summer. He is left with a stale, disjointed squad whose performance at Bournemouth was just the latest in a series of characterless away showings – all the more frustrating given the improvement in their form at home. There has not been a worse Arsenal side since the 1994-95 season, a campaign that at least brought a European final. That year they were pipped to the Cup Winners’ Cup by Nayim and Real Zaragoza; it looks increasingly likely that Wenger will have to muster whatever resources he has left for a more successful tilt at the Europa League if the current vintage are to play in the Champions League next term.

In a short space of time at the club David Moyes has not only restored his own credentials as a top-flight manager, he has rescued the reputation of Marko Arnautovic, whose running and chasing brought about all four of the goals. “We’re getting the ball to him more through playing him in the middle,” Moyes said of the temperamental Austrian. “He’s a challenging player to manage but he wants to improve and he’s done everything we have asked. There was a suggestion early on that he wasn’t running about or putting in enough effort, but I think that’s the last thing anyone would say about him now. I think he’s trying to show the West Ham fans that he is not what people think, but a really good player worth every penny the club paid for him.” Paul Wilson • Huddersfield 1-4 West Ham: Read Paul Wilson’s match report 4) Delph’s injury leaves Manchester City short at left-back Fabian Delph isn’t a left-back. Who knew? For the last few weeks Delph’s presence in Manchester City’s defence has looked a little odd, a little chancy, evidence of Pep Guardiola’s ambition, of the player’s ability to learn and adapt, but also of the oddly unbalanced nature of City’s extravagant full-back recruitment programme. Delph has filled in gamely, but here Liverpool targeted him relentlessly. At times in the early moments the pitch resembled a pool table with a wonky leg as the ball kept rolling out to Delph’s side. He lasted only half an hour, twisting his knee tackling Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. Benjamin Mendy’s injury has left them reliant now on Danilo, who has looked unconvincing. No doubt the quality elsewhere in the team will disguise it once again. But City do have a weakness here that might just test the limits of Guardiola’s ingenuity against better teams.

But quite what Roy Hodgson thinks of the player, and several other fringe names, remains difficult to read. The manager sang the Malian’s praises and talked up the performance of Wayne Hennessey in goal. A moment later he was stressing the importance of signing a striker and a goalkeeper. One aspect of Hodgson’s sterling job at Palace, thus far, has been his ability to coax Premier League performances from those previously not thought up to the task. There were many such performances on Saturday – from Martin Kelly at centre-half to Jairo Riedewald in midfield. Maintaining the balance that allows the former England manager to get the best from his squad while doing his best to reinvent it is a task he appears to have in hand.

It has been a long time coming – 18 months and 52 games to be exact – but Jordon Ibe finally registered his first goal for Bournemouth when he scored the winner against Arsenal. Signed for £15m from Liverpool, Ibe endured a difficult first season at Bournemouth and, remarkably, it was 29 appearances before he set up a goal for the club in the Premier League, when he came off the bench to turn the game around against Brighton earlier this season. Ibe, 22 last month, has always had potential but the big question is whether he can deliver consistently in the Premier League. “I genuinely believe now that he can have a major impact at this level,” Eddie Howe, Bournemouth’s manager, said. “His numbers are very good in terms of assists this season but now he’s added a goal and I’m really pleased for him personally that that’s out of the way. Hopefully it’s the first of many.” Stuart James • Bournemouth 2-1 Arsenal: Read Stuart James’s match report • The Dozen: the weekend’s best Premier League photos 7) Shelvey likely to stay but does himself few favours Rafael Benítez beckoned Paul Dummett to the touchline and gave his left-back instructions to pass on to Jonjo Shelvey. A Newcastle free-kick was about to be taken and Benítez wanted it played wide across the 18-yard area. Judging by Shelvey’s head-shaking and the glare he directed back towards the dugout, the playmaker disagreed. Later, Shelvey, struggling to impose himself, was replaced by Mikel Merino and, clearly annoyed, he batted away Benítez’s outstretched hand while stomping past him. Cue more pronounced head-shaking. Newcastle’s manager – who, given his alarming lack of transfer market support from Mike Ashley, has bigger problems – played down the incidents but is unlikely to forget them. Neither will the watching England head coach, Gareth Southgate. With the expected absence of signings apparently preventing Benítez from offloading Shelvey this month it seems football’s Geordie soap opera has yet another subplot. Louise Taylor • Newcastle 1-1 Swansea: Read Louise Taylor’s match report • Martin O’Neill rules himself out of contention to take over at Stoke 8) Deeney too important for Watford to let go The Troy Deeney question remains a sizeable one for Watford. The club’s self-styled big character, never afraid to be outspoken or ruffle feathers, returned from a second suspension of the season with his team in a tricky predicament. They were two goals down and totally inhibited when Deeney was part of the half-time change that gave Watford heart. He set up the equaliser with a header that was turned in via Abdoulaye Doucouré’s hand. Deeney may have missed a chunk of the season because of bans but he has come off the bench to turn games against Arsenal, Manchester United and now Southampton. If Watford are seriously considering selling a player with that kind of impact, they had better have a ready-made replacement lined up. Southampton’s dismay to be pegged back was understandable but they did show enough quality to suggest a win is not far away. Amy Lawrence • Watford 2-2 Southampton: Read Amy Lawrence’s match report 9) West Brom’s Evans shows why bigger clubs are interested There are not many centre-backs in England who have proved themselves able to cope with the best attackers in the biggest matches. But Jonny Evans is one, still at his physical peak yet still playing for West Brom who, before Saturday, had not won in 20 games. Such is the Premier League and such are Swansea City that somehow they now sit second-bottom – though they have work to do if they are to stay up. Whether they can achieve that depends a lot on whether Evans stays. Arsenal and Manchester City are interested in buying him, and with good reason: though he lacks an outstanding single attribute, on his game he is an excellent all-round defender, intelligent, composed, good on the ball and sharp in the tackle. He may not have a fancy name or reputation, but Sir Alex Ferguson always rated him and he knew a thing or two about what makes a player. Daniel Harris • West Brom 2-0 Brighton: Evans puts Albion on way to ending drought 10) Allardyce knows he needs to get Everton firing again Sam Allardyce was candid enough, after Everton’s capitulation at Tottenham, to admit his honeymoon period is over. They have scored once in their last five league games, picking up two points, and if they do not rediscover the vigour they showed after his arrival then a return to the relegation battle cannot be discounted. It piles the pressure on Saturday’s meeting with West Brom and Allardyce, who admitted he felt “shock” at their Wembley performance, feels there is little room for error. “Next week’s game is massive on whether we’re going to start slipping into that relegation zone or decide we don’t want to be there,” he said. He pledged to “go back to square one” but hopes the potential acquisition of Theo Walcott will be a step nearer by then. “I hope we can do it in the next week or two,” he said, but a similarly negligent showing against the Baggies could risk deterring even the most receptive of new recruits.

The biggest winner from July’s share price crash was hedge fund Marshall Wace, whose co-founder Sir Paul Marshall was a major backer of the leave campaign in the Brexit referendum.

He has threatened to cut a quarter of the curriculum and the workforce in student support. Horrocks is seriously compromising the future of the OU as a distance-learning provider of excellent degree programmes. Critical thinking and critical speaking are indeed being stifled in the faculties. For some years now the vice-chancellor’s executive has implemented disastrous strategies (centralisation, closure of regional centres, putting so much online in administration and teaching, and drastically reducing tutorial support for students). We are now confronted with a remote, blinkered and yet highly paid senior management which fails to consult or listen to those who actually know something about the OU students and their educational needs. The catastrophic drop in student numbers cannot simply be explained away by the hostile environment, which in any case could easily change if a government with socially progressive policies is elected and rapidly restores properly funded state education at all levels. In the meantime the OU could use its enviably large reserves to subsidise fees, increase the pay of part-time associate lecturers, and re-establish the regions and the university’s local presence and internal support network. Expensive vanity projects like FutureLearn and its massive open online courses are not bringing in students. This may be the digital age, but the American experience of online universities is that the option of regular face-to-face interaction among colleagues and between tutors and students is the only way to make blended tuition work at degree level, and to motivate those creating, delivering and studying intellectually stimulating modules. Dr Paula James Research associate, retired senior lecturer in classical studies and south-east staff tutor, OU • As an OU tutor in Northern Ireland in the early 70s I saw how the tutorial system, regular meetings at study centres and summer schools were a vital and intellectually stimulating part of the students’ experience. Many were studying for the first time, others to increase existing qualifications, and some for the sheer pleasure of learning. All had something to teach each other. The chilling new proposals for an OU based on “service centres and media platforms” operating in the cloud, are bound to kill off the OU’s great strengths of warmth and inclusion in an academic community. I remember Peter Horrocks when he was head of TV news at the BBC and I was a daily newscaster. He was a man of dry intellectual brilliance, but his admitted shyness revealed a crippling lack of social skills. He is not the visionary needed to lead and encourage the Open University community to grow and prosper in the 21st century. Anna Ford (OU tutor in Northern Ireland 1971-74; chancellor, Manchester University 2001-08), London • Imagine a philanthropic university that aims to provide high-quality education to anyone who wants it. Tens of thousands of students from all over the country pour through its open doors and avail themselves of the rich resources on offer. People can choose to educate themselves in this way, joining others, learning together, changing their lives and expanding their minds. Now wake up from this delightful daydream. Get back to the dreary repetition of rumours, slogans, scandal and gossip known as social media. Sit back down on your sofa. The university has sold out and joined the real world, where everyone is hypnotised by the magic of the screen. Who needs high-quality education when you can have Twitter and Instagram? Who needs books when you have Facebook? Who ever needed face-to-face meetings with real people? Real people are so last century. The doors have closed already. Now the weasels are busy taking the faltering structure down altogether. Hurrah! We are happy in our ignorant consumption. So, so happy.

A game that was totally in their control with just over 20 minutes remaining, as they led through Héctor Bellerín’s second‑half goal, inexplicably slipped from their grasp after Bournemouth scored twice in the blink of an eye to pile more misery on Arsène Wenger. The narrative feels all too familiar, so much so that it no longer comes as a surprise when Arsenal players troop off the field with heads bowed after failing to see out a match. Once again, Wenger’s team were their own worst enemy, capitulating defensively to gift Bournemouth a route back into a game that they had not looked like getting anything out of for so long. Callum Wilson and Jordon Ibe accepted the invitation to punish ruthlessly the “surprising mistakes” that Wenger lamented, although the Frenchman was honest enough to admit that Arsenal’s problems start, rather than end, at the back. Wenger described Arsenal as lacklustre as an attacking force and bemoaned the lack of creativity on a day when his team registered only three shots on target and Alexandre Lacazette’s goal drought was extended to nine matches. At times Lacazette, the club-record signing, looked lost. In truth, there are weaknesses all over the pitch and it was hard to think of any Arsenal player who emerged with any credit apart from Jack Wilshere. Making his seventh consecutive league start after recovering from the ankle injury that forced him off against Chelsea in midweek, Wilshere faded late on but ran the game for long periods, using the ball intelligently and generally doing his best to make Arsenal tick with his energy in the centre of the pitch. The supporting cast around him, however, were a huge disappointment. Alex Iwobi produced a lovely pass to set up Bellerín’s goal but offered little else and it is hard to escape the feeling that he would not get near one of those formidable Wenger teams of the past. Danny Welbeck never imposed himself and there is nothing convincing about the three-man central defence of Rob Holding, Shkodran Mustafi and Calum Chambers. As for Ainsley Maitland-Niles, it seems almost unfair to expect a 20-year-old defensive midfielder to fill in at left wing-back, and it was no real surprise that one of the Bournemouth goals originated from a raid down that flank. There was, in other words, plenty for Wenger to chew over as he headed back to London reflecting on a result that means Arsenal have gone four games without a win at the start of a calendar year for the first time since 1995 and on the prospect of losing arguably his best player. The Arsenal manager took the decision to leave Sánchez out of the squad because he senses that the Chilean’s departure is imminent, with the 29-year-old expected to sign for one of the two Manchester clubs within 48 hours. Whatever anyone thinks of Sánchez at Arsenal – and he has clearly been a destructive influence at times – his ability to score and create goals leaves a huge void. Bournemouth could have been forgiven for thinking that this was the perfect time to be playing Arsenal, yet it took a long time for Eddie Howe’s team to bare their teeth and they also had to come from behind. Bellerín, running on to the pass that Iwobi slid in behind the flat-footed Charlie Daniels, gave Arsenal the lead with an angled shot that Asmir Begovic got a good hand to but was unable to prevent from bouncing over the line in what felt like slow motion. Other than a Ryan Fraser shot blocked by Chambers towards the end of the first half, Bournemouth had rarely threatened but that all changed in a devastating four-minute spell. First Fraser escaped on the right and delivered a low centre that Petr Cech, rashly, dashed off his line to try to claim. Wilson, alert and unforgiving, got there first to poke the ball into the empty net with two Arsenal defenders watching. Arsenal were still reeling when Bournemouth struck a second. Lewis Cook’s floated pass picked out Wilson, who had so much time and space in the Arsenal area after Holding had stepped up to try to play offside. Wilson took a touch and then another that ran into the path of Ibe, who drilled a low shot past Cech from 18 yards. It was Ibe’s first goal in 52 appearances for the club and gave Bournemouth, who are up to 13th, their first victory over Arsenal."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"money/2018/jan/15/average-uk-property-asking-price-up-2000-says-rightmove","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-15T06:01:48Z","webTitle":"Average UK property asking price up £2,000, says Rightmove","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/jan/15/average-uk-property-asking-price-up-2000-says-rightmove","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2018/jan/15/average-uk-property-asking-price-up-2000-says-rightmove","fields":{"headline":"Average UK property asking price up £2,000, says Rightmove","bodyText":"The average price of a property coming on to the market in January is up by nearly £2,000 compared with December, but sales are down by 5.5% on the same period a year ago. Rightmove, which tracks 90% of the UK property market, said there had been a “busy start” to 2018, with more than 4m visits a day to its site, up nearly a tenth on last year. The average price was up 0.7% to £297,587. But sellers may be being over-optimistic in their pricing and may have to reduce to find buyers. Rightmove said the average time to sell a property has jumped to 67 days compared to 55 days last summer. The period from now to late spring is traditionally the busiest time of the year for househunters as they aim to complete transactions and then move during the summer school holidays. But Rightmove said the pace of activity had slowed. Asking prices continue to fall in London. The average price for a home listed by the website in the capital is currently £600,926, down 1.4% on the month and 3.4% over the year. With affordability stretched and incomes falling behind inflation, most property forecasters are predicting flat house prices in 2018 or relatively small rises. Of the two big lenders that operate well-known price indices, Nationwide said it expected property values to be “broadly flat in 2018, with perhaps a marginal gain of around 1%”. Halifax allowed itself some wiggle room, predicting UK growth from 0% to 3%. Halifax said that in December house prices fell by 0.6%, the first decline it had registered in six months. • Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"books/booksblog/2018/jan/15/tips-links-and-suggestions-what-are-you-reading-this-week","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-15T15:00:02Z","webTitle":"Tips, links and suggestions: what are you reading this week?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2018/jan/15/tips-links-and-suggestions-what-are-you-reading-this-week","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/booksblog/2018/jan/15/tips-links-and-suggestions-what-are-you-reading-this-week","fields":{"headline":"Tips, links and suggestions: what are you reading this week?","bodyText":"Welcome to this week’s blog. Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week. Let’s start with some remarkable last words, courtesy of playitagainstu: Thieving, lying, disobedient, immoral, lusting after every female he encounters and harbouring secret erotic fantasies -is this the villain of a trashy novel? No, it’s that venerable enlightened philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau who holds nothing back in his fascinating The Confessions (1781). I’m only up to age 16 so how he gets from social rebel to Social Contract I’m sure will be very enlightening. I must mention one incident which has got to be up with the best ‘last words’. The teenage Rousseau obtains a place as lackey in the Turin household of the cultured Mme de Vercellis, a childless widow dying of cancer. He becomes her favourite and is by her bedside at the end: “Finally, when she could no longer talk and was already in her death agony, she broke wind loudly. ‘Good,’ she said, turning over, ‘a woman who can fart is not dead.’ Those were the last words she spoke.” Nanpilgrim has just finished Neil Gaiman’s American Gods: I feel kind of empty without it. The story is unrolled at a smooth, tranquil pace. I found that the characters grew upon me, particularly the zombie wife. Gaiman is an excellent writer, a trickster extraordinaire, who kept some of his surprises in plain sight. I really enjoy the premise - similar to that in Adams’ wonderful Long Dark Teatime of the Soul - that all the gods humans have imagined into being continue to exist even after we have lost interest. I look forward to perhaps reading Norse Gods. Meanwhile, BMacLean is in the middle of EF Benson’s first novel, Dodo: We tend to draw sharp lines between different eras of literature so it was a bit of a surprise to find that this book often reads like something from the 1920s: the cleverness, the acerbic wit, the blasé, iconoclastic set of rich young things with nothing to do ... it all feels so modern that I have to remind myself that, when it says so-and-so drove to here or there one morning, it means they took a horse and carriage, not an automobile. But it could be simply that I haven’t read much from the 1890s before and thus unthinkingly lumped the decade in with the rest of the 19th century, when it was actually looking forward to the 20th as much as or more than it was looking back towards the immediately preceding era. Dark Pines by Will Dean, a more recent debut, receives a recommendation from roadwaterlady: It reminded me of The Dry by Jane Harper in an odd sort of way. That had a sense of menace from the heat in the small Australian town and Dark Pines has the same sense emanating from the cold trees in the Swedish forest. The book is a tad over wordy at times and I guess the next will be tauter but it’s a good first. Roald Dahl’s Switch Bitch has pleased MosquitoDragon: I was in absolute heaven with the two Uncle Oswald stories in this. I was thinking the genius of Dahl was his ability to just grab hold of you by the septum and drag you helplessly into the story - his ability to maintain pace and intrigue is really second to none. But later on it struck me that what I really love about Dahl is his subversiveness. He revels in his naughtiness and that is just so refreshing in these weird times where our talent for being offended has been surpassed only by our willingness to be ruled by bigots and robots. Pick up an old Dahl book and give yourself a holiday from today’s reality... Alternatively, you could try some hard reality from the 19th Century.

The punches it delivers are the stronger for being delivered so dispassionately. The anger is held in, and checked by its almost clinical exposure of events. The revelation that freed black slaves themselves became slave owners lies at the heart of the book. This illustrates the depth and pervasiveness of the cancer that slavery became... The Known World is a book of understatement which can, as the Ghost in Hamlet states, “a tale unfold whose lightest word” will “harrow up thy soul”. Finally, Neeskens has just finished Bob Dylan’s Chronicles Volume One: A very elegantly written and interesting memoir. Dylan is excellent at creating a mood and painting a scene. Almost no name dropping apart at all from his own artistic heroes (writers, musicians, actors). I hope he gets around to volume two. I hope so too. Although I have an uncomfortable feeling that he might not bother... Interesting links about books and reading Surprising reading matter has been found on the wreck of Blackbeard’s ship.

Hodgson has made no secret of the fact the squad he inherited in September was imbalanced, with Palace boasting only Christian Benteke as a recognised striker and only two senior goalkeepers. The pursuit of Getafe’s No 1 Vicente Guaita has been complicated by the Spanish club’s refusal to sell despite the player saying he made an agreement with the president which permitted him to discuss a move to suitors offering more than €4m. Palace are understood to have bid accordingly and hope to secure the former Valencia player, despite the possibility of a legal dispute. Palace, who remain in talks with Lille over their 24-year-old centre-half Ibrahim Amadou, have made Babacar their priority up front in preference to Oumar Niasse and Diafra Sakho. Discussions began last week over a potential £15m move for a player who has been at Fiorentina since he was 15 and whose progress has long been noted at Selhurst Park. Babacar, who has also attracted interest from West Ham and West Bromwich Albion, has scored four goals in Serie A this season, though all 15 of his appearances have been off the bench with the head coach, Stefano Pioli, preferring Giovanni Simeone ahead of the 24-year-old. Babacar has only three Senegal caps but would hope a move, and regular involvement in the Premier League, would help him gain selection for the summer’s World Cup. Amadou, who was schooled at Nantes but has made his name with Lille, was the subject of interest from Palace over the summer, with that situation since revisited. Hodgson had initially been content with his defensive options but has lost Scott Dann – who underwent surgery on a cruciate knee ligament injury last Thursday – for the long term and is still without Mamadou Sakho, who has a calf complaint. Palace may seek to take the player initially on loan before a permanent transfer in the summer, though Lille will need convincing that represents an acceptable deal."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/live/2018/jan/15/australian-open-2018-rafa-nadal-caroline-wozniacki-tennis-action-day-one-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-15T12:51:48Z","webTitle":"Australian Open 2018: Nadal, Kyrgios, Wozniacki win; Sock out on day one – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2018/jan/15/australian-open-2018-rafa-nadal-caroline-wozniacki-tennis-action-day-one-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2018/jan/15/australian-open-2018-rafa-nadal-caroline-wozniacki-tennis-action-day-one-live","fields":{"headline":"Australian Open 2018: Nadal, Kyrgios, Wozniacki win; Sock out on day one – as it happened","bodyText":"Novak Djokovic and his fragile elbow swing into action against the world No63 American Donald Young. The six-time Australian Open winner is last on the Margaret Court Arena in the day session and is seeded 14th mainly because he’s spent half of the previous season out through injury. On the same court, and in the match immediately before Djokovic, we’ll see how Maria Sharapova gets on. With no Serena Williams around, she has a fair chance of going deep this year. Whether that will prove popular with fans or not is another matter. She plays Tatjana Maria, who is ranked higher than Sharapova but who the Russian should beat. On the Hisense Arena Johanna Konta, seeded ninth, takes on the world No82 American Madison Brengle, who may feel a little added pressure to do well given how badly the her better known compatriots have performed so far. And in the evening the Rod Laver Arena welcomes back Roger Federer, who will cruise into action against the sometimes tricky Slovenian, Aljaz Bedene. Thanks for following. Goodbye. The experienced and stocky Tunisian battled back from two sets down to dispatch the Italian qualifier. He outlasted him in a marathon that just went past the four-hour mark. That’s the last of the action for today. I’ll post a few of the matches to look forward to tomorrow shortly. With only one match left to finish it’s probably worth reminding ourselves as to which seeds were sent on their way on a good day in Melbourne for the underdogs. Among the men’s seeds to fall, were: John Isner (16), beaten 6-4, 3-6, 6-3, 6-3 by Matthew Ebden Kevin Anderson (11), beaten 6-7, 6-3, 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 by Kyle Edmund Lucas Pouille (18), beaten 6-4, 6-4, 6-7, 7-6 by Ruben Bemelmans Philipp Kohlschreiber (27), beaten 6-3, 2-6, 6-0, 1-6, 6-2 by Yoshi Nishioka Jack Sock (8), beaten 6-1, 7-6, 5-7, 6-3 by Yuchi Sugita Among the women’s seeds to fall, were: Venus Williams (5), beaten 6-3, 7-5 by Belinda Bencic Ekaterina Makarova (31), beaten 3-6, 6-4, 8-6 by Irina Begu Sloane Stephens (13), beaten 2-6, 7-6, 6-2 by Shuai Zhang Dominika Cibulkova (24), beaten 6-2, 6-2 by Kaia Kanepi Coco Vandeweghe (10), beaten 7-6, 6-2 by Timea Babos Despite having to receive treatment for some kind of muscle problem, the Italian Caruso has fought his way back into the fifth set against Jaziri. He’s battling on the outer courts and trails 2-1 but is on serve in the fourth game. There is only one singles match still in play at Melbourne, where Caruso v Jaziri has gone to a final set after three and a-half hours of gruelling baseline trades. The older player, Jaziri, has the upper hand in the fifth. He’s using his nous to drag Caruso around court and is 2-0 up. In fact, the Italian looks to be suffering from cramp. The French No15 seed breezes through in straight sets and will face a tricky customer in the second round in the form of 18-year-old Canadian Denis Shapovalov. The world No51 is all action, like a younger version of Tsonga, and has a blazingly bright future ahead of him. Expect tickets to sell fast for that one. Tsonga’s greater athleticism is starting to show against King. He’s starting to pull the qualifier around the court and is moving supremely well. He leads 5-1 in the third and look set to go through in the next few minutes. He’s made more unforced errors than he’d have liked – particularly on his forehand – but looks in good shape. He got to the quarter-final last year. Could he go further this time out? They’re both rank outsiders but what an epic they have produced out on Court 19, where the teenage Norwegian, ranked 142 in the world, has triumphed 6-3, 3-6, 6-7 (5-7), 7-5, 11-9 in fours hours and 16 minutes against the world No129. Casper Ruud: remember the name! It appears that the effort Dustin Brown put into levelling the match against Joao Sousa at 2-2 took the remaining energy out of him. He lost his mojo in the fifth and went down 4-6, 3-6, 6-4, 7-6 (7-4), 1-6. Maybe next year Dustin. Tsonga has taken the second set against Kevin King and leads 6-4, 6-4, but he’s being given a fair workout by the American qualifier, who is battling gamely from the baseline. It’s 1-1 on serve in the third. The Australian No23 seed barely paused for breath as she raced through against the US qualifier. She punches the air and shakes her opponents’s hand before shuffling off to put her feet up after a comfortable night’s work. Bemelmans’ victory against Pouille is just the latest of a number of shock wins for underdogs at Melbourne today. In case you missed it, here’s the report of one of them from earlier in the day, when a legend of the women’s game and last year’s finalist, Venus Williams, was sent tumbling by Belinda Bencic, who said Roger Federer gave her a helping hand. That’s another result to add to the list of surprises on day one! The Belgian qualifier, ranked 118 in the world, dispatches the talented world No18 in four sets. Pouille survived the ignominy of losing in straight sets by winning the third on a tie-break but he couldn’t repeat the trick in the fourth, crumbling with three unforced errors in a row. But what a win for Bemelmans, who played superbly well and has never been past the first round in Melbourne before. Dustin Brown stays alive! The German took the fourth set tie-break after applying the pressure by getting his forehand swinging. He wins the tie-break 7-4, with Sousa dumping a return into the net. Here’s a quick update as to what is happening in the matches that are ongoing in Melbourne as the clock ticks towards 10pm there: On the Rod Laver Arena, the Australian No23 women’s seed, Daria Gavrilova, is cruising against the American Irina Falconi and has just taken the first set 6-1. On Margaret Court, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, the men’s 15th seed, took the first set 6-4 against the US qualifier Kevin King and is leading 3-2 in the second set but is by no means having it all his own way. On Court 7, the men’s 18th seed, Lucas Pouille, is involved in a rare old battle with Belgian qualifier Ruben Bemelmans, who took the first two sets 6-4, 6-4 before Pouille fought back to take the third 7-6. Bemelmans leads 6-5 in the fourth but it is on serve. On Court 14 Salvatore Caruso leads Malek Jaziri 7-6, 6-3 but is trailing 3-5 in the third. On Court 15 the great entertainer from Germany, Dustin Brown, is battling hard against Portugal’s Joao Sousa. He trails 4-6, 3-6, 6-4 and is hoping to stay in the tournament by taking the fourth, which is tied 6-6. And on Court 19 Casper Ruud of Norway is approaching a fourth hour of play in an epic match with Quentin Halys of France. It’s two sets all and 6-6 in the fifth as the two men slog it out in the evening air. Kevin King is battling hard to break Tsonga, who is trying to serve out – but struggling – in the first set. The qualifier plays two wonderful backhand winners as the two bounce between advantage and deuce repeatedly in a lengthy game before Tsonga finally finds a couple of booming serves to win 6-4 and take a 1-0 lead. On the Margaret Court Arena, the men’s 15th seed Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, is doing what he does best – leaping, slipping, smiling and bouncing around as he plots a course for a first-set win over the US qualifier Kevin King. Tsonga leads 5-3. Some good news for Australian tennis fans. The world No165, John Millman from Brisbane, has beaten the talented young world No41 Borna Coric of Croatia. He did it in some style too, winning 7-5, 6-4, 6-1. It’s been an up-and-down first day for the home fans, with Matthew Ebden battling to a brilliant career-best win over John Isner and Sam Stosur losing in three sets to Monica Puig. You can read all about those matches here: The American horror story continues as the No8 seed and top-ranked US men’s player, Jack Sock, falls victim to the Japanese world No41 in four sets on Show Cout 2. He follows fellow US players John Isner, Venus Williams, Sloane Stephens and CoCo Vandeweghe in falling at the first hurdle. Sock made seven double-faults and looked extremely laboured. There were questions about his fitness before the tournament but regardless, it’s a wonderful moment for Sugita, who has never been past the first round before. The women’s No4 seed is through. She had a bit of trouble finishing the qualifier off at the end – a touch of the tennis yips – but she got there eventually. “I was disappointed I couldn’t make it in Brisbane but I’m very happy to be here again,” he says. And how did he get fit again after a lengthy absence after Wimbledon? “I just worked. I took a little time off and straight after London I had to stop for a while and then started working step by step. That’s why I didn’t make Brisbane because I wanted to be ready for this.” He’s asked how many more years he thinks he can play for? “This year I am here,” he chuckles, with sweat dripping off his hair. “I know one day that I won’t have the chance to play on this court so I want to enjoy every moment when I have the chance.” Well, you could say this was a no-sweat victory for Rafa but the way he went about it in such an aggressive manor was quite impressive. He treated his 37-year-old opponent like a grand slam rival, pounding shots back at him and chasing down everything. The scoreline doesn’t reflect the entertaining value of the match. Some of the rallies were good fun and Estrella Burgos deserves a lot of credit for that. But Rafa charges on. Having taken the first set against Ivana Jorovic 6-3, the women’s No4 seed, Elina Svitolina, has stepped it up in the second set. She’s 4-0 up and giving the young Serbian a painful runaround. The Ukrainian won the Brisbane International before this year’s tournament and, understandably, looks full of confidence. The temperamental Australian No17 seed was all business on the Hisense Arena, taking just an hour and 27 minutes to send the Brazilian, ranked 101 in the world, tumbling out. Making early predictions about Kyrgios is a risky game though. But he looked focused out there and could be one to keep an eye on if he stays fit and happy. Nadal didn’t enjoy being broken by Estrella Burgos. He swats aside his oponent in the next game to take the second set 6-1 and lead 2-0. And he very quickly races into a 2-0 lead in the third. On the subject of player’s in the men’s draw who are in a hurry, the enigma that is Nick Kryrgios has been i9n rampant form and is on the verge of making the second round as he leads Dutra Silva 6-1, 6-2, 5-4. The women’s No2 seed takes just over an hour to sweep aside the Romanian world No60. She found her groove and never missed a step. Her first serve was accurate and she looked in fine fettle. She’ll be hoping to go deep this year, having not been past the fourth round since 2012. Hello, Gregg here. Well, you join me as Estrella Burgos has just enjoyed a wonderful moment at the Rod Laver Arena, where after being pummelled 6-1 in the first set and trailing 5-0 in the second, the 83 ranked player in the world broke the No1 seed after a helter-skelter game and celebrated it like he’d just won a grand slam. The crowd loved it. That’s all from me for this morning. Having brought you up to speed on events thus far, I’m going to leave you in the very capable hands of Gregg Bakowski, who’ll bring you updates from the big matches of the Australian evening. Women’s singles: Infuriating local favourite Sam Stosur has gone out in the first round for the third consecutive year after blowing a match point against reigning Olympic champion and Porto Rican world No58 Monica Puig. The winner of the 2011 US Open, 33-year-old Stosur was competing in her 16th Australian Open and recorded her sixth first round exit. She has never made it past the fourth round. Stosur was a set and a break up against the reigning Olympic champion - even holding a match point in the second-set tiebreak - before falling 4-6, 7-6 (6), 6-4 in two hours and 20 minutes. Men’s singles result: Marcos Baghdatis (Cyp) has beaten Yuki Bhambri (Ind) 7-6 (7-4), 6-4, 6-3. Rafael Nadal has won the first set of his match against Estrella Burgos 6-1 and leads the second set 4-0. Nick Kyrgios is wasting no time as he dismantles Rogerio Dutra Silva. He’s won the first two sets 6-1, 6-2 but has lost the first game of the third. Women’s singles: Out on the Margaret Court Arena, Danish No2 seed Caroline Wozniacki is leading Romania’s Mihaela Buzarnescu 5-2 in the first set of their encounter. Men’s singles: On the Rod Laver Arena, Rafael Nadal is currently 5-1 up in the first set of his first round match against the 37-year-old Dominican veteran Estrella Burgos in their first ever meeting. On the Hisense Arena, Aussie bad boy Nick Kyrgios has just won the first set of his match against Brazil’s Rogerio Dutra Silva, 6-1. Sloane Stephens crashed out of the Australian Open in a first round defeat to Shuai Zhang. The US Grand Slam champion suffered her eighth consecutive loss when she was dismissed 6-2, 6-7 (2), 2-6 in Melbourne. It was a challenging draw for Stephens, currently ranked 13th, to go up against the Chinese 28-year-old, who at 34th, was just outside the seed. The 24-year-old has struggled to rediscover the form that carried her to victory over fellow American Madison Keys at the US Open in September.

The 20-year-old came into the tournament in great form and knocked out last year’s runner-up Venus Williams 6-3, 7-5. She prepared for the year’s first grand slam by teaming up with Federer to represent Switzerland at the Hopman Cup, with the pair going on to lift the trophy. And Bencic had support from the whole Federer family here, with the defending champion offering his advice before the match and congratulating her afterwards while his parents were courtside in Bencic’s player box. “I really admire that before the match in the locker room he’s so relaxed, being funny with his team, or even with everyone,” said Benic. “Then on court, he’s so focused. I think that’s the main thing I want to learn from him. Even off the court, a normal, humble person, really happy and trying to give advice and help someone like me. I think that makes him pretty special.” PA Other results Kirsten Flipkens (Bel) bt Alison Riske (USA) 2-6, 7-6 (6), 6-3 Kaia Kanepi (Est) bt (24) Dominika Cibulkova (Svk) 6-2, 6-2 Irina-Camelia Begu (Rom) bt (31) Ekaterina Makarova (Rus) 3-6, 6-4, 8-6 Ying-Ying Duan (Chn) bt Mariana Duque-Marino (Col) 6-0, 6-1 (19) Magdalena Rybarikova (Svk) bt Taylor Townsend (USA) 6-0, 7-5 Alize Cornet (Fra) bt Xin Yu Wang (Chn) 6-4, 6-2 (7) Jelena Ostapenko (Lat) bt Francesca Schiavone (Ita) 6-1, 6-4 (12) Julia Goerges (Ger) bt Sofia Kenin (USA) 6-4, 6-4 Petra Martic (Cro) bt Alison Van Uytvanck (Bel) 7-6 (5), 6-3 Mona Barthel (Ger) bt Monica Niculescu (Rom) 6-4 7-5 Shuai Zhang (Chn) bt (13) Sloane Stephens (USA) 2-6, 7-6 (2), 6-2 Timea Babos (Hun) bt (10) Coco Vandeweghe (USA) 7-6 (4), 6-2 (30) Kiki Bertens (Ned) bt Catherine Cartan Bellis (USA) 6-7 (5), 6-4, 6-2 (32) Anett Kontaveit (Est) bt Aleksandra Krunic (Ser) 6-4, 7-5 Katerina Siniakova (Cze) bt Maria Sakkari (Gre) 6-2, 6-7 (5), 6-4 Magda Linette (Pol) bt Jennifer Brady (USA) 2-6, 6-4, 6-3 Denisa Allertova (Cze) bt Pauline Parmentier (Fra) 6-3, 6-0 While Kyle Edmund’s win over Kevin Andersen may be the biggest story of the day thus far, the Briton is not the only man to have been in action on a busy day in Melbourne. Third seed Grigor Dimitrov encountered few difficulties as he advanced to the second round with a 6-3, 6-2, 6-2 straight sets win over Austrian qualifier Dennis Novak. Elsewhere, Russia’s Andrey Rublev went the distance with Spain’s David Ferrer before winning their five-setter 7-5, 6-7 (8), 6-2, 6-7 (8), 6-2. Canadian teenager Denis Shapolvalov is also through to the second round after beating Stefanos Tsitsipas 6-1, 6-3, 7-6 (5), while American 16th seed John Isner was an early casualty, losing 6-4, 3-6, 6-3, 6-3 to Australia’s Matthew Ebden. Sixth seed Marin Cilic, from Croatia, needed four sets to see off Yen-Hsun 6-2, 6-2, 4-6, 7-6. Welcome to the Guardian Sport’s live coverage of this year’s Australian Open, where Kyle Edmund, Britain’s lone representative in the men’s draw in the absence of the injured Andy Murray, has already created rather a stir by knocking out the 2017 US Open finalist Kevin Andersen in five sets. In the women’s singles, there have also been several high profile casualties, with the elimination of Venus Williams, Sloane Stephens, Dominika Cibulkova and Ekatarina Makarova serving to throw an already hard-to-predict competition even more wide open. There’s plenty more action to come, so stay tuned for regular updates."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/jan/14/jason-roy-england-highest-odi-score-five-wicket-australia-cricket","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-14T11:53:06Z","webTitle":"Jason Roy blasts England’s highest ODI score in five-wicket win over Australia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jan/14/jason-roy-england-highest-odi-score-five-wicket-australia-cricket","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jan/14/jason-roy-england-highest-odi-score-five-wicket-australia-cricket","fields":{"headline":"Jason Roy blasts England’s highest ODI score in five-wicket win over Australia","bodyText":"The Ashes may be gone but England kicked off the one-day internationals with a thumping five-wicket win in the first of a five-game series. For that they have Jason Roy to thank. Chasing 305 for victory, Roy pillaged 180, carving 16 fours and five sixes from 151 balls, and setting a record for the highest score by an Englishman in ODIs, beating Alex Hales’s 171 against Pakistan in 2016. Earlier, a ninth ODI hundred by the Australia opener Aaron Finch looked to have ensured an even tussle. His effort was measured and serene. Roy, by contrast, was a man with a claw hammer in each hand, swinging at anything and everything that came his way. His half-century came from a chaotic 32 balls, and he was responsible for 12 of the 15 boundaries England managed in their first 10 overs. The path to his century was more treacherous. On 91 he misread the line of a ball from the leg-spinner Adam Zampa and was adjudged lbw. Upon review the ball was shown to have hit his pad outside the line while Roy was playing a shot. The decision was overturned and Zampa’s next ball was blitzed for six, just out of the reach of long-on. A scampered three off his 94th delivery then took Roy to his fourth ODI hundred. Having lost his opening spot to Jonny Bairstow during the ICC Champions Trophy last year, Roy was recalled for the final two ODIs against West Indies last summer when Hales was suspended immediately for his part in the incident outside a Bristol nightclub on 24 September. The reprieve allowed Roy to score 84 and 96, securing a place on this tour. He now possesses the highest ODI score anyone has posted at the MCG, which helped pull off the highest chase seen at this venue. Hales’s return to international cricket lasted three balls: undone by Pat Cummins and spooning a catch to midwicket for only four. “I had a very tough year in 2017, being dropped from the side and then being brought back into it towards the end of the year,” Roy said. “It kind of gave me a kick to recognise where I’m at. It has turned round incredibly quickly. That’s the nature of this game – especially in one-day and T20 cricket.” His final 80 runs were a collection of reverse sweeps, hacks and a towering straight six. He departed as he arrived: swiping with disdain, only this time to the fielder at square leg. It ended a fine partnership with Joe Root that, at 221, is now the highest third-wicket stand for England in ODIs. Root saw the side home, unbeaten on 91. An unconverted fifty that will not bother him one bit. There was a Sliding Doors theme at the start of the match when the first ball was struck for four. It was the 1,003rd competitive delivery Chris Woakes sent down on this tour and was driven back past him by Finch. By contrast Mark Wood’s first threatened to pierce David Warner’s right ear, skidding off the pitch and forcing the left-hander to flinch for the first time in three months. Wood’s third drew a tough chance at cover before Warner was squared up two balls later, popping a simple catch to Root at second slip, for two. Five balls in and Wood had England fans wondering what might have been. He eventually returned figures one for 49 from his 10 overs, bowling at a top speed of 93mph. “To give them a taste of their own medicine was nice,” Roy said. “The boys have copped it a bit over the last month. To see Woody coming in and doing that is a huge positive for us. He’s a massive asset.” After missing the Ashes Wood now has the opportunity to move his career forward. He has made the squad for the Test series in New Zealand and is in the 2018 Indian Premier League auction. He will start off in the second-highest category: base price £170,000. The Guardian understands Royal Challengers Bangalore have registered their interest. Wood’s solid start was made sweeter when Adil Rashid dismissed Steve Smith, caught behind via an inside edge.

Its achievement is to convince you that, were they to do so, they wouldn’t look out of place. They may not be performing to the 12,000 people they envisage in their heads, but they make Soho Theatre sound like that way, with this cheeky, characterful and vocally accomplished hour-long gig. At the beginning, the five-piece seem too big for Soho’s main house. But then, that’s the joke: their swagger and stadium-pop touches are setting up a punchline to come. And you soon realise that only frontwoman Glamrou La Denim (Amrou Al-Kadhi) is outre in the conventional drag manner, and even her camp theatrics come with political edge. Her opening gag, singing the words “Alan Ayckbourn” in the style of a muezzin, are a mere palate cleanser for the solo routine mid-show, a sharp-clawed attack on attitudes to queer identity. It’s striking how transgressive this feels, as Glamrou retools Whitney Houston’s So Emotional into a cri de coeur. Her bandmates, meanwhile, bring flavours other than fabulous spikiness to the table, and each gets her solo moment in the spotlight. Crystal Vaginova, she of the sparkling beard and cool, still demeanour, fashions Beyoncé’s I Was Here into something far filthier. Brittle Aphrodite Green, mother of six and with a marriage to Donald Trump under her belt, torch-songs Girls Just Wanna Have Fun. Electra Cute, the outfit’s Sporty Spice, blows the gaff on the Wembley conceit then redeems herself with a will-to-power rendition of Rise Like a Phoenix. It’s all done with a great sense of fun – and a remarkably light touch given the bombastic, stadium-party-pop conceit – by the quintet who emerged earlier this decade as Cambridge University’s first professional drag band. Their act leans less on cattiness and on burlesques of femininity than is sometimes the case in drag. There’s also some lovely singing, solo and choral, all backed by a tight three-piece band. Scheduled in a 10pm slot, it could hardly be bettered for partygoers seeking a smart and uplifting late-night knees-up. At Soho theatre, London, until 3 February.

Anna Christie was released to the accompaniment of the blazing promise “Garbo talks!” to mark the first time the silent film star had given utterance on camera. I suspect the BBC’s publicity department collectively ruptured several vital organs as they strained not to do the same with their coup. After 22 years of negotiations, our notoriously camera-hating sovereign agreed to talk on camera in The Coronation, a documentary to mark 65 years since she ascended the throne. “Queenie speaks!” was surely the strapline everyone wanted. Closely followed by “Farkin’ ’ell!” The Coronation was presented by former herald and “coronation expert” Alastair Bruce, because this is 2018 and this is England and no one had the balls to let Alan Bennett do it, but do you know what? It could have been a lot worse. The tone was only ever momentarily reverential, and when it slipped into that squishy territory it was usually the Queen herself who yanked it back out on to dry land. Watching Her Majesty’s personal footage of the 1953 ceremony’s aftermath, as the young Prince Charles and Princess Anne played hide-and-seek underneath her train, Bruce murmured “Such fun for the children.” “Not what they were meant to do,” the mother-monarch replied tartly. Later, when Bruce asked the white-gloved crown jeweller (one of the three people who is allowed to touch it; this is 2018, this is England) “if the crown can be brought a little closer to the Queen”, she moved it herself. “This is what I do when I wear it!”, our Sovereign grinned delightedly, the spider at the centre of a webby mass of protocol and etiquette, across whose sticky strands only she can stride safely. When Her Majesty was not on screen, obsequiousness was kept at bay by concentrating on the origins of the regalia and the ceremony, wisely treating them all as embodiments and vectors of history rather than mere accretions of pageantry. It won’t turn you from republican to ardent monarchist to know that although the St Edward’s Crown was created in 1661 for Charles II, the makers strove to replicate Edward the Confessor’s. They did that to assure a people riven by civil war that there would be a return to medieval certainties, but it is surely fairer to know what it is you are embracing or dismissing. Contemporary footage showed the breathtaking scale of the preparations and the Duke of Norfolk’s talent for organisation down to the last detail (the maids of honour had phials of smelling salts tucked behind their glove buttons in case they fainted). Though I guess it comes slightly easier when overseeing extraordinary state occasions has been your family’s raison d’etre for five centuries. But it was Elizabeth Garbo we’d come to see, and for once, a royal documentary didn’t cheat its punters by making an ounce of access fill a hogshead of primetime. She was there. She spoke. She let the mask slip by a reasonable degree. And it matters not where you stand on the republican-monarchist spectrum; it was fascinating to watch the public persona be briefly set aside. I personally feel that my entire licence fee has been well spent just to secure the moment when she flicked the St Edward’s Crown (2kg of gold frame encrusted with 444 precious stones) with a casual finger to appraise its solidity. “Yes, weighs a ton,” she remembered cheerfully (Queenie smiles! Four times in the hour, by my reckoning). She hasn’t seen or worn it since that day in 1953. She wears the Imperial State Crown to things like the state opening of parliament. It’s her everyday crown. When the dress code says “smart casual”, that’s the one she – as her father did before her – pops on. “Fortunately,” she notes, “my father and I have the same sort of shaped head.” You can’t look down in it, though, she added. “Or your neck would break. And it would fall orf.” “Pearls,” she said, while joggling in her hand a quartet that once belonged to Mary, Queen of Scots, then Elizabeth I, and now dangle from the state crown, “are sort of living things. They need warming up and these have just been hanging here. Quite sad, really.” In the BBC’s capable hands, this was a warming programme for a sovereign whose refusal to “engage” has dulled her lustre to modern eyes. But there was a melancholy at the heart of it. At 91, this will likely be the first and last time we glimpse the ‘real’ monarch. If The Coronation was a fine display of living history, it was also, somewhere beneath its surface, a living elegy. She will become, sooner rather than later, one of the memories enshrined in the ancient regalia. And we will remember this warmth, and it will all be quite sad, really."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"stage/2018/jan/14/the-here-and-this-and-now-review-antibiotic-resistance-pharmaceuticals","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-14T11:19:16Z","webTitle":"The Here and This and Now review – drug reps find humour is best medicine","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/jan/14/the-here-and-this-and-now-review-antibiotic-resistance-pharmaceuticals","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/jan/14/the-here-and-this-and-now-review-antibiotic-resistance-pharmaceuticals","fields":{"headline":"The Here and This and Now review – drug reps find humour is best medicine","bodyText":"What poses the greatest threat to global welfare? Glenn Waldron, in a play that arrives from the Theatre Royal Plymouth, follows the lead taken by England’s chief medical officer, Dame Sally Davies, in suggesting that antibiotic resistance should rank alongside international terrorism and climate change. But, in order to put the point across, Waldron jumps uneasily from sparky satire to dystopian drama. Waldron starts amusingly with a trio of pharmaceutical sales reps practising their pitch, under the guidance of their leader, to promote a drug that will cure liver spots. We see the gauche Gemma, the cynical Robby and the shy Helen all offering variations on the boss’s patter while engaging in team-building ball-games and privately speculating on the nature of happiness. But, having raised doubts about the whole drug-pushing trade, Waldron spins forward to suggest an apocalyptic future in which people are desperate to obtain a precious vaccine to nullify a viral epidemic. While the play has an important point to make, it is far more effective when it seduces us with laughter than when it socks us between the eyes. Simon Stokes’s production does its best to unify the two halves by highlighting the debate about whether life is best seen as a prolonged journey or a series of intense moments. Becci Gemmell, Tala Gouveia, Andy Rush and Simon Darwen perform with great aplomb, and Bill Paterson voices a chillingly reassuring climactic spiel.

Adults. Even when it’s about issues that affect their lives, young people often find themselves going unheard. No wonder children in the UK are some of the unhappiest in the world. In Wild Life FM, director Pol Heyvaert and the boundary-busting comedian, live artist and writer Kim Noble have been part of a devising process with teenagers from Norfolk and London, who then get to take centre stage to express themselves in whatever way they wanted. Most of them have chosen to do it through music: one who normally writes and performs songs with her dad, sings alone. He hovers redundantly on stage; his daughter’s singing evidence that she is outgrowing him. A boy plays the harp; another sings like a young Gil Scott–Heron, his voice forcefully in opposition to the powerlessness of the young. But what happens to you if you can’t play the harp or don’t have a cute song? One of the fascinating things about this show is the way that not everyone feels obliged to perform. For all the talent on stage, this is no teenage X Factor. They refuse to conform. One girl creates a comic skit out of trying to persuade a hotel to take a booking for teenagers. Does the hotel have 24-hour reception, she inquires, before adding: “Some people have sex outside business hours.” Adults may have been involved in the making of the show, but it feels as if the young own it. It is as messy as a teenager’s brain or bedroom and joyfully crashes the barriers between theatre, gig, sketch show and radio. It also embraces its own contradictions, not least in the way it deals with the intensely intimate in a public space. Produced by the terrific Ghent-based company Campo, Wild Life FM is reminiscent of a 2016 show at the Unicorn, The Hamilton Complex, in the way it defies adult conceptions about teenage sexuality, and shows identities being discovered and discarded. It plays on the idea of watching and being watched – although not quite with the same steely, challenging gaze of that piece. If that show was designed primarily for an adult audience, this one has the performers’ own peer group in its sights and involves them through audience participation that is both squirm-inducing and funny. There are jitterbug visuals, too, with gifs, videos and internet searches blurring into each other, offering connections and disconnections, in a way that is likely to bring on a migraine in anyone over the age of 30. This is a show that, for all its love songs, is clear-eyed about the realities of life. “There was a bit of doner kebab in your mouth when I first kissed you,” begins one song that neatly undercuts the idea of romance. But what’s most memorable about the evening is that these kids, whatever their personal circumstances and anxieties, are all too aware that they are the lucky ones, because they have the chance to take the microphone. As one of the evening’s most startling images makes clear, too many of their contemporaries are gagged and voiceless. • At the Unicorn theatre, London, until 20 January.

The racist milkshake drinking duck which has come to define a particular thread of the internet’s collective fickleness was announced as the Macquarie Dictionary’s word of the year for 2017 on Monday. Coined on Twitter by @pixelatedboat in June 2016, the term quickly became short-hand for the internet’s habit of rushing to seize on the latest cultural zeitgeist before rejecting it just as enthusiastically when it is revealed to be somehow problematic. Per Macquarie, it is defined as “a person who is initially viewed positively by the media but is then discovered to have something questionable about them which causes a sharp decline in their popularity”. “The media” though, might be too broad a prism. Milkshake Ducks by and large are made and unmade on social media. Think Ken Bone, the mild-mannered guy in the red sweater who briefly became a darling of social media after asking a question during a debate at last year’s US presidential election. Bone’s star fell as quickly as it ascended when Reddit users dug through his past to discover he had occasionally commented on erotic subreddits including one called “preggoporn,” and argued that the killing of Trayvon Martin was “justified”. Or more recently, Keaton Jones – a young boy in Tennessee who became a viral hit for tearfully denouncing his bullies – became the focus of a different sort of internet attention when photos of Keaton’s mother were unearthed on Facebook in which she is smiling and holding the Confederate flag. After previously losing out to portmanteaus of dubious origin such as “youthquake” and “Kwaussie”, it might have seemed as though Milkshake Duck’s chance for dictionary fame had passed. But on Monday Macquarie announced it had chosen the word over runners up “framily”, which apparently refers to a group of people not related by blood but who constitute an intimate network, and endling, the last surviving member of a species. The Macquarie Dictionary judging committee said milkshake duck reflected a growing phenomenon. “Even if you don’t know the word, you know the phenomenon,” the committee said in a statement. “Milkshake duck stood out as being a much-needed term to describe something we are seeing more and more of, not just on the internet but now across all types of media. It plays to the simultaneous desire to bring someone down and the hope that they won’t be brought down. “In many ways, it captures what 2017 has been about. There is a hint of tall poppy syndrome in there, which we always thought was a uniquely Australian trait, but has been amplified through the internet and become universalised.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jan/14/tate-suspends-contact-donor-sexual-harassment-claims-anthony-doffay","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-14T17:05:39Z","webTitle":"Tate suspends contact with donor over sexual harassment claims","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/14/tate-suspends-contact-donor-sexual-harassment-claims-anthony-doffay","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jan/14/tate-suspends-contact-donor-sexual-harassment-claims-anthony-doffay","fields":{"headline":"Tate suspends contact with donor over sexual harassment claims","bodyText":"Tate and National Galleries Scotland have suspended contact with one of their biggest donors after he was accused of sexual harassment and inappropriate behaviour. The 78-year-old art dealer Anthony d’Offay created the Artist Rooms programme when, in 2008, he sold almost his entire art collection to the galleries for the price he had paid originally rather than what it was worth. At the time, the then Tate director Nicholas Serota called it “one of the most generous gifts that has ever been made to museums in this country”. On Sunday the Observer revealed that D’Offay was facing allegations of harassment and inappropriate behaviour dating from 1997 to 2004. He denies the claims. In a joint statement Tate and National Galleries Scotland said they had been made aware of the allegations. “In 2008 Mr D’Offay was the donor of the Artist Rooms collection which is now owned and jointly managed by Tate and NGS. Mr d’Offay stepped down from any connection with Artist Rooms in December 2017. “In light of these allegations, Tate and NGS have decided that it is appropriate to suspend any further contact with Mr D’Offay until these matters have been clarified. “The work of Tate and NGS is underpinned by values of fairness, equality and respect and the right to work free of sexual harassment. We expect these values to be demonstrated in the behaviour of everyone who is involved in our organisations.” The allegations against D’Offay have been made by women with successful careers in the art world who said they hoped it would encourage others to come forward. One of the women, a former employee at his London gallery, claimed D’Offay had become increasingly and inappropriately touchy. It culminated with an alleged incident when he approached her while she was on the phone. “He grabbed me,” the woman told the Observer. “Pulled me really tight and started kissing my neck. I pushed him away. Because I was on the phone I could not scream. Pushing him away was the only thing I could do.” The Metropolitan police are also investigating a complaint from a young woman that D’Offay sent her malicious messages. In a statement D’Offay said he was “appalled” by the allegations and categorically denied the claims. Artist Rooms has been an enormous success. It was originally 50 rooms of contemporary art by 25 artists who included Damien Hirst, Jeff Koons, Diane Arbus and Gilbert &amp; George. D’Offay sold them to the nation for the price he paid, so £28m rather than a possible £125m. The initial 725 works by 25 artists have grown to more than 1,600 works by 40 artists, often as a result of gifts from artists themselves. Phyllida Barlow was named as the 40th Artist Rooms artist in 2016. The works have been seen in nearly 100 museums nationwide, with Robert Mapplethorpe photographs exhibited in Dunoon and Gerhard Richter works in Middlesbrough. An Artist Rooms hub is part of Tate Modern’s new extension where visitors can currently see works by Bruce Nauman. D’Offay said in his statement that he had decided in December “it was time to retire as ex-officio curator” of Artist Rooms."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/jan/14/surgeon-who-signed-livers-is-punished-but-managers-let-off","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-14T17:46:39Z","webTitle":"Surgeon who signed livers is punished but managers let off | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jan/14/surgeon-who-signed-livers-is-punished-but-managers-let-off","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/jan/14/surgeon-who-signed-livers-is-punished-but-managers-let-off","fields":{"headline":"Surgeon who signed livers is punished but managers let off","bodyText":"I am an altruistic kidney donor and am appalled at the treatment of Simon Bramhall, the surgeon who initialled two livers in transplant operations (Surgeon fined £10,000 for signing his initials on livers of two transplant patients, 12 January). I am particularly incensed at the comments of the judge and the whingeing of Patient A. For the judge to call it “an abuse of power and betrayal of trust” borders on the ludicrous. If anything, they were acts of elation after two very difficult successful operations – the equivalent of a footballer pulling off his jersey after scoring a great goal. And for Patient A to suffer an “overwhelming feeling of violation” is beyond ludicrous. Mr Bramhall had just saved your life! He did nothing to you. It was not your liver. It was the liver of a dead person who bequeathed it to you: a final act of great generosity. Where is your generosity? If my brilliant Sheffield surgeon, Mr Shrestha, had initialled my kidney I would have been delighted. It would have been a celebration of a successful partnership between a gifted doctor and a donor to give someone a better life.

John Carlisle Sheffield • In sentencing former Queen Elizabeth hospital surgeon Simon Bramhall, Judge Paul Farrer QC described those actions, which resulted in no physical harm, as “conduct born of professional arrogance of such magnitude that it strayed into criminal behaviour”. Less than two years ago, your newspaper highlighted the Care Quality Commission’s damning report into cardiac surgery at the Queen Elizabeth hospital in Birmingham, estimating that 17 patients may have died unnecessarily as a result of the hospital’s failure to heed repeated patient safety warnings. Yet no member of the hospital’s executive team has been held to account for their failings. The contrast is striking: we are forced to conclude that, even where patient safety is at stake, there is one rule for the individual clinician, another for his or her organisation. Less than five years since the publication of his report of the Mid Staffordshire NHS foundation trust public inquiry, the words of another QC, Robert Francis, appear to have already been forgotten.

I have worked in the NHS in Oxford for 20 years, barring two years in a post in rural Canada. In July 2017, we returned to the UK and a friend of mine, who’s a cardiothoracic anaesthetist, commented on my bounding neck pulses as we were chatting over a beer. A little later that day, I had a listen to my heart and even I, a GP, could hear a loud murmur. I asked one of my colleagues to have a listen, just to check I wasn’t being paranoid. I think he was trying to make me feel better and reassured me: “It’s probably just a flow murmur.” Nevertheless, I saw my GP that day. With detached, mildly mounting alarm I registered the abnormal findings she discovered. High blood pressure, wide pulse pressure, mild tachycardia and, of course, The Murmur. Her worried expression made me more alarmed than the findings, and I found myself trying to reassure her that everything would be OK. I saw the cardiologist in October and as soon as he mentioned he wanted to get the medical student, I knew I was in for some bad news. He told me I had severe aortic regurgitation, where blood flows in the reverse direction from where it’s supposed to as the heart pumps. He said he’d see me in six months and by that time I would have a new aortic valve. My reaction was silence, followed by expletive-laden surprise, not least as I had had no symptoms at all. Also, doctors never get sick. It’s funny how that kind of news affects you – for a week or so, I was mentally crossing things off the list of things I could do with the rest of my life, and confronting the possibility that I might not see my daughter grow up. In December, I was very relieved to get a date for my operation in January 2018 but my urgent surgery was cancelled when I called in at 10am on the day of admission. It’s difficult to describe the sense of loss that I felt. It came as a surprise, even for someone who works in the NHS every day. I really did not know what to do with myself. As doctors in the NHS, we are trained from an early stage to soak up punishment, not to complain and to always carry on. But with my patient’s brain, I idly wondered how other people might be coping with similarly disorientating news all over the UK. About how they might be thinking how unfair this was, and what would they do now. Lives put on hold, terrible feelings of uncertainty, resignation and finally acceptance. After such news they must love, fear and hate the health service all at the same time. Nevertheless, the NHS is so beloved that it would never cross their minds that the government would have deliberately underfunded it for the last seven years. Some people might think it’s pretty decent of ministers to apologise for all the disruption, and that the government, to its credit, is forward-planning for a winter crisis. The fact is, of course, that it is not, and that the crisis was entirely avoidable and is down to consistent underfunding. Doctors and the Kings Fund predicted it, even the head of NHS England predicted it. It’s quite difficult to describe the strangled sense of anger as I watched Jeremy Hunt on the news that night. I’m not sure how much more short-notice my surgery cancellation could have been, and yet here was my ultimate boss telling me that this was being done to avoid just such upheaval. I was back to work the next day and I have my game face firmly back on, but I can’t deny it has been disruptive and upsetting. I’m determined not to let any of these developments compromise my patient care and commitment to the NHS. I am sanguine, but waiting hopefully for another appointment. I understand that this situation may well occur again. In that circumstance, I look forward to a time when the apology from my health secretary and prime minister will be replaced by sustained hard investment in the NHS. Platitudes and short-term measures will not save or improve it. And yet, as many commentators have already suggested, perhaps that is this government’s point."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"film/2018/jan/14/from-turner-to-lowry-timothy-spall-to-play-another-artist-on-big-screen","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-14T16:38:09Z","webTitle":"From Turner to Lowry: Timothy Spall provides portrait of another artist","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jan/14/from-turner-to-lowry-timothy-spall-to-play-another-artist-on-big-screen","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/jan/14/from-turner-to-lowry-timothy-spall-to-play-another-artist-on-big-screen","fields":{"headline":"From Turner to Lowry: Timothy Spall provides portrait of another artist","bodyText":"After rave reviews for his portrayal of JMW Turner in 2014, Timothy Spall is to star in a film about another British artist – LS Lowry. Shooting begins this week on Mrs Lowry &amp; Son, directed by Adrian Noble, a former head of the Royal Shakespeare Company. The film will portray Lowry pursuing art as a hobby while working as a rent collector and living with his overbearing mother, played by Vanessa Redgrave. Speaking to the Guardian, Spall joked: “I’m trying to tick off all the artists.” Spall’s performance in Mike Leigh’s Mr Turner won him the best actor award at the 2014 Cannes film festival. The Observer described him as “a giant” in a “visually ambitious biopic”. The actor did extensive research for that role, even taking a long course in painting. A refresher session was unnecessary for Lowry because, he said, “there’s very little painting” in the film. “I do paint a little bit [in the film]. It’s mainly about his relationship with his mother and how that influenced his work … he was an only child. It’s about this very unusual close relationship [with] his mother, who he adored … how that informed his work and how that work happened late in his life.” Spall’s previous films include Denial, a courtroom drama about the libel case brought by the Hitler apologist David Irving, and The Journey, a fictionalised account of the relationship between Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness that developed during the Northern Ireland peace process. He referred to those roles when asked how he planned to portray Lowry: “I’m trying to do him as he was. There’s not much footage of him, but there’s enough for me to know what he looked like and sounded like. He wasn’t a public figure particularly, so I don’t have to worry about trying to be Irving or Paisley.” The film will be shot in Greater Manchester and London. Asked whether it would use locations from Lowry’s life, Spall said: “Yes … a lot of that amazing landscape has gone, but they’ve found bits and pieces. We have to move about a bit.” Lowry was born in Manchester in 1887 and died in 1976. A purpose-built gallery, The Lowry in Salford, houses the world’s largest public collection of his paintings and drawings. He is seen as the quintessential painter of northern, working-class life, of industrial landscapes filled with matchstick figures and chimneys belching out black smoke. Although he is adored by the general public and his paintings fetch seven-figure sums at auction, it was not until 2013 that the Tate staged a major Lowry retrospective."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2018/jan/15/it-was-making-me-ill-experiences-sexual-harassment-at-work","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-15T00:01:40Z","webTitle":"'It was making me ill': experiences of sexual harassment at work","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/15/it-was-making-me-ill-experiences-sexual-harassment-at-work","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jan/15/it-was-making-me-ill-experiences-sexual-harassment-at-work","fields":{"headline":"'It was making me ill': experiences of sexual harassment at work","bodyText":"Sarah, 27, electrician I started as an electrical apprentice in 2012, and for the first six months I loved it. I became friends with one of the bosses and he started sending me suggestive text messages. One said something like: “Why don’t you come over to my house and sit on my … and let me show you what a real man can do.” That was the type of thing I was getting quite regularly. I said: “Please can you stop doing it. You’re married and it’s not appropriate.” I was friends with someone related to the big boss, and I mentioned it to him. I did stop getting the text messages, but the way I was treated dramatically changed. It was just a constant battle then for the next three years. When I raised a formal complaint they basically pointed the finger at me, saying I hadn’t said anything at the time. They said I had provoked the situation, that it was me that had caused it. But I was used to being treated with disrespect. It was only when my partner said it was wrong that I decided to speak out. In the end he was given a written warning, and I ended up leaving the company. It was making me ill. I felt I had to leave because they were going to make my life unbearable. Anna, 24, waitress We were really busy [one] night so I was helping the waiting staff take drinks to a table. We had a big office party in, mostly men, and every time I walked past them they made comments about my appearance and the way my chest looks in my shirt. It made me really uncomfortable. Then after their last drink I was walking past them again and one of them grabbed me by the hips and pretended he was doing me up the arse while the rest of them stood around laughing. One of the women in the group told him to stop it and get off me, and then the men she was with started laughing at her, and one of them then grabbed her and started doing the same to her. It was awful. Then my manager told them they had to pay and leave, and they left a massive tip. One of the women came up to me to apologise and gave me £50. It felt like they were buying me off. [Sexual harassment] happens all the time. It’s like men think that because they are giving you money to pour them a drink or whatever that also means they are entitled to your body. Or they expect you to flirt with them and then get offended if you don’t, like it’s a bad thing that you’re just trying to be professional. Or they will wait for you to finish your shift and try to follow you. Or they make comments about our uniforms (which aren’t revealing, or tight, or whatever), like how your chest looks or whether or not the skirt is too short. Tracey, 43, painter and decorator My harassment started as soon as I started working with men. I was working for a company and there was this one guy in particular who every time we met would ask me what colour underwear I was wearing, if I’d seen such and such disgusting film. But it was constant. If I was painting floorboards it was always “while you’re down there love”, or while I was tiling a bathroom someone came in and just urinated while I was in the room, or I’d be slapped on the arse with a piece of wood or paperwork. I did make a formal complaint about a guy who had stroked my hand while I was driving and I nearly crashed, but they basically said they didn’t believe me. When I decided to leave one bloke gave me a hug and groped my tit. I’m self-employed now and it’s a bit of a struggle, but I’m happy I just don’t get any of that hassle any more. Laura, 24, former market stall worker My first experience of sexual harassment was in my first job working on a food stall on a local market while I was studying for my A-levels. The manager of the food stall would only hire young women. The space was tight, so we had to often squeeze past each other, but there was actually more space than he made out as he would often brush against me unnecessarily. At the end of the day I had to help pack up the stall, which meant walking past another stall where a group of about five men worked. They would leer, wolf-whistle and generally catcall as I struggled with heavy wooden planks and rubbish. They would ask: “Where did you get her from? Can we get one?” etc. My second experience was while I was volunteering supporting victims and survivors of rape and sexual assault. Occasionally, men would phone, would start to recount their “abuse”, but it would quickly become clear that they were masturbating whilst I was talking to them. They would go into quite a lot of detail and it was clear that they were actually telling me what they wanted to do to me. I think that a lot of people are either in denial that sexual harassment is so prolific, or just think it is inevitable. It also feels like it’s a risk to report it, depending on how your organisation or manager feel about it. Sometimes, it’s easier to just get on with it, especially if you depend on your job to survive. • Names have been changed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/jan/14/superswiss-roger-federer-ready-to-unleash-weapons-australian-open-tennis","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-14T13:39:08Z","webTitle":"‘SuperSwiss’ Roger Federer ready to unleash weapons on Australian Open | Kevin Mitchell","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jan/14/superswiss-roger-federer-ready-to-unleash-weapons-australian-open-tennis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jan/14/superswiss-roger-federer-ready-to-unleash-weapons-australian-open-tennis","fields":{"headline":"‘SuperSwiss’ Roger Federer ready to unleash weapons on Australian Open","bodyText":"If Roger Federer were a superhero (to many, he already is), he would, he says, like to be Thor. At the US Open last year, he nicknamed Juan Martín del Potro “Del Thortro”, after the Argentinian had conjured the most dramatic comeback to defeat Dominic Thiem in five sets, so he clearly shares a lot of TV time with his young children these days. They will have been thrilled, no doubt, to watch him play alongside Spider‑Man and other comic-book folk in a fun hit-up that drew a far bigger crowd than did Bernard Tomic’s thrilling, three-set exit from the qualifying tournament on Court 8. With lazy fingers sending off nuclear‑missile alerts in Hawaii, it is comforting to be in the presence of a tennis player who could probably save the planet if required. As for winning big tennis tournaments, Federer manages still, at 36, to combine the laid-back mien of a contented father of four and the relentless passion of a man who has been a champion for most of his career. He must now concentrate on beginning the defence of his Australian Open title, against Aljaz Bedene (formerly of Welwyn Garden City, latterly of Slovenia again), and it was pointed that his opponent got not a single mention during Federer’s packed press conference on Sunday afternoon. Few think Bedene, ranked 51st in the world, will disturb the universe when SuperSwiss unfurls his weapons on Rod Laver Arena on Tuesday to launch a campaign most respected judges reckon will culminate in his second back‑to‑back triumph here, and his 20th major. Speaking with his customised regal air, Federer gave assembled hacks another masterclass in restrained holiness, but made several on-the-money observations about the game and its army of wounded soldiers. Asked if he thought his fluid, floating style and natural athleticism gave him an advantage over the more overtly physical “baseline grinders” – Andy Murray (hors de combat), Novak Djokovic (armed with a new, elbow-protecting serve) and Stan Wawrinka (owner of one reliable knee) – he demurred. He has had his struggles, too, as he pointed out, winning this title a year ago after seven months out with a banged-up knee. “The off-season is tougher than playing tournaments – for me anyway,” he said of his regime away from the court. “I work hard in the off-season to create a base that serves me well throughout the season and then I rework the base time and time again throughout the season. I think that’s very important. “Attacking tennis also has a lot of wear and tear on the body,” he said of his reversion in recent seasons to raiding the net, “because being highly explosive is something that’s a big challenge. Playing more of a reactive game is maybe more physical in the sense that you play longer rallies, you spend more time on the court, but it’s always pretty much the same. It’s a similar rhythm. There’s not that much sprints going on in this regard. “We talk about Murray and Djokovic being grinders [but] I think they actually play quite aggressively. To be honest, everybody does. Even Rafa [Nadal] is standing closer to the baseline normally than he ever has in the past. “Injuries can occur in one single moment when you come down from a serve. You’re, like, how did that happen? Sometimes you just don’t know. Sometimes it’s unexplainable how certain injuries happen. “I’ve played thousands of matches in my life and I’m sure I’ve gotten lucky throughout my career. But sometimes you have to take a minute and talk to the team about it: like, how we’re going to approach these next three months, next year, next day. Everything needs to be perfectly planned to avoid as many injuries as possible.” Numbers matter to him. Federer and Nadal are the only players in the draw competing for the No 1 world ranking: the Spaniard keeps the crown if he reaches the quarter‑finals but Federer has to keep his title. Nobody is better at that. Even with his peers battling to just get on court, it will not be easy. Federer won two slams in 2017 because he managed his court time and his energy to perfection. He skipped the clay and probably will not be seen at Roland Garros again. He saw Djokovic and Murray collapse at Wimbledon and he cashed in when Marin Cilic’s run petered out in the final. Federer deserved everything he achieved because he works so hard to get there. He has won five majors in Melbourne and is comfortable in a city where he has many friends outside the game. Where Federer differs from many players is in creating space around him that looks something like normality. As he pointed out: “I have a big family. I get to see familiar faces again at all these events because I’ve made so many friends over the course of my career. I’m so happy to come back to Melbourne, see all my friends that live here in Melbourne. “It’s nice that it’s never actually gone away, the fun aspect of enjoying the travel, coming back to Australia. These are great times in my life and in my career. My wife is incredibly supportive. Is it the best ever? I’m not sure. It’s definitely a lot of fun right now.” As the service came to an end, a journalist – perhaps jet-lagged or still dazzled – banged his head on a low-hanging camera and fell to the ground. “Are you, OK?” inquired Federer from the other end of the room. Is there no end to the man’s magnificence? SuperSwiss: a hero for our times, to gobsmacked hacks, young children and … well, maybe not those striving to bring him down here over the next fortnight."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"news/2018/jan/14/corrections-and-clarifications","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-14T21:00:37Z","webTitle":"Corrections and clarifications","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/jan/14/corrections-and-clarifications","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2018/jan/14/corrections-and-clarifications","fields":{"headline":"Corrections and clarifications","bodyText":"• We said that in the days following Winston Churchill’s election as prime minister in May 1940, he had to decide “whether to accept a negotiated peace treaty with Nazi Germany or go to war”.

The fight, which was agreed on Sunday after months of wrangling between the rival camps, will also mean the 28-year-old Joshua putting his IBF, WBA Super and IBO belts on the line. Parker, who turned 26 last week, is regarded as a 10-1 underdog by the bookmakers and looked unimpressive in his last fight when he scored a majority‑points verdict against Hughie Fury. But the New Zealander, who has a record of 24-0, with 17 knockouts, is convinced he has the speed and power to test Joshua’s chin – which he clearly believes is suspect. “Anthony Joshua is in for a huge shock,” Parker said. “A couple of months ago I heard him say: ‘Why should I be worried about this little kid from New Zealand?’ Well, now he’s about to find out. And the world is about to find out whether AJ can really take a punch. My entire existence is now devoted to proving what the boxing world already knows.” Joshua, meanwhile, is in confident mood as he returns to the site of his tougher-than-expected victory against Carlos Takam, whom he stopped in 10 rounds in October. “These fights aren’t easy because there is a lot on the line, so respect to team Parker for taking the challenge,” he said. “And you know me, I love this game. I am looking forward to it, training camp is under way and before you know it 31 March will be upon us.” Referring to his epic unification victory against Wladimir Klitschko last April, when he was put down before stopping the Ukrainian in the 11th round, Joshua said: “It is a unification heavyweight championship fight – and we all know what happened last time I was in a unification heavyweight championship fight: it was gruelling, it was interesting and we both left the ring with masses of respect.” Joshua’s promoter, Eddie Hearn, is expecting another 75,000 sellout and a classic encounter. “Champions should fight champions and AJ continues to step up to the challenges,” he said. “It’s the first time in history that two reigning heavyweight world champions have met in Britain and it’s a classic match‑up between two young, fast, undefeated belt holders, and it’s going to be an explosive fight.” Should Joshua win he is expected to face the WBC champion Deontay Wilder in a hugely anticipated reunification fight later in the year."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2018/jan/14/tories-right-to-take-credit-for-eu-imposed-policy-says-party-chair","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-14T14:53:41Z","webTitle":"Tories right to crow about EU-imposed credit card policy, says party chair","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jan/14/tories-right-to-take-credit-for-eu-imposed-policy-says-party-chair","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jan/14/tories-right-to-take-credit-for-eu-imposed-policy-says-party-chair","fields":{"headline":"Tories right to crow about EU-imposed credit card policy, says party chair","bodyText":"The Conservatives are right to take credit for an EU policy to protect customers from hidden credit card charges, the party’s chair has said, after widespread mockery of a promotional tweet from Theresa May’s account. Surcharges imposed by retailers, airlines and ticketing companies for using credit cards which can be as high as 20%, will be banned after an EU–wide directive. Lewis told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show there was nothing wrong with the Conservatives promoting the decision while the UK remained a member of the bloc. “We are fully represented and part of that process of making those decisions,” Lewis told Marr, saying Conservative MEPs had backed the measure. “We’ve got to spread that message much more widely about the things we are doing.” May’s official Twitter account tweeted that “we’ve banned credit card charges” on the day the new regulations were introduced, without mention of the EU. Guy Verhofstadt, the Brexit representative for the EU parliament, tweeted it was “refreshing to see so many embracing the benefits of EU legislation”, while the Liberal Democrat leader, Vince Cable, said the Tories were “claiming a popular policy that they had nothing to do with”. The Labour MEP Clare Moody replied to May’s tweet saying: “No, you haven’t. This is an EU initiative from which all EU citizens will enjoy, not instigated by UK government.” The ban on charges is among 2,557 new EU regulations and changes made since the UK voted to leave the EU in 2016, according to new data released by the House of Commons library. The research, which was requested by the pro-EU campaign Best for Britain, found that 1,602 new EU regulations had been introduced since 24 June 2016, though they may not all be applicable to the UK. Lord Malloch-Brown, who chairs the group, said: “These regulations show, clearly, how intertwined we are with Europe. These rules are not the Brussels diktats that the few on the extreme right pretend they are. They are rules to protect us from rogue practices and dodgy businesses. “I guess Brandon Lewis thinks ‘we’ is also MEPs, EU commission and 26 other governments. It’s just shameless and shows how the Tories try to use Europe for their own ends.” Lewis, the former immigration minister who replaced Patrick McLoughlin as party chair, has been charged with re-engaging with the party’s dwindling membership and refortifying the party’s online war against Labour. Over the weekend, Lewis said the party would distribute a “toolkit” of videos and gifs for party activists to use online but told the Sunday Telegraph he was conscious that many Conservative supporters felt uncomfortable engaging in the debate online. “What I want to see out there is more and more of our activists and people who support some of the principles we’re outlining, whether it’s a particular policy or a whole package of government reforms, getting out there in the digital world saying so and spreading that message with us,” he told the newspaper. Lewis also said he wanted the standards of debate online to be raised, pledging Tory candidates would sign up to a code of conduct, saying Labour should do too. “If people, our candidates, in the elections this year breach that code and there is evidence they’ve breached that responsibility pledge, we will suspend them,” he said. “We’ve got to make sure that all of us at the very top of the party avoid this rot that we’re seeing at the top of the Labour party and we actually show, from the very top, we’ll argue our case robustly, but with respect.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/jan/14/uk-governments-brexit-impact-assessment-shameful-says-sturgeon","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-14T12:29:09Z","webTitle":"UK government's Brexit impact assessment 'shameful' says Sturgeon","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jan/14/uk-governments-brexit-impact-assessment-shameful-says-sturgeon","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jan/14/uk-governments-brexit-impact-assessment-shameful-says-sturgeon","fields":{"headline":"UK government's Brexit impact assessment 'shameful' says Sturgeon","bodyText":"Nicola Sturgeon has described as “shameful” Westminster’s failure to consider the impact of Brexit on the economy, as her own government prepares to publish a “clear-eyed, hard-headed” analysis of potential outcomes of leaving the EU. Interviewed on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show on Sunday morning, Scotland’s first minister said that, although she had seen “some redacted material” from the UK government’s Brexit impact assessments, “I think everyone has concluded that what we were told previously by David Davis were in-depth impact studies are no such thing”. “I really do think it is shameful that the UK government, that is the government that is looking to take the UK out of the European Union, hasn’t even bothered to properly look at the impact on our economy.” Speaking ahead of the publication of the assessment by Scottish government economists on Monday, she said that the modelling would look at the impact of three different Brexit outcomes on GDP, trade and immigration: staying in the single market and customs union; a free trade agreement; or reverting to WTO terms, and would conclude that the first scenario would be least damaging to the country’s economy. Sturgeon continued to put pressure on the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, to join the SNP in coalition against a hard Brexit. She said: “There’s a real window of opportunity. I believe that there is a majority in the House of Commons for remaining within the single market, if Labour gets its act together.” The leader of the SNP at Westminster, Ian Blackford, invited opposition leaders from across the Commons to a new year summit last Tuesday to coordinate cross-party efforts to limit the “catastrophic damage” of a hard Brexit, but Corbyn did not attend. Sturgeon added: “Jeremy Corbyn has to decide where he stands on this. I think most of his supporters will be deeply disappointed that he appears to be only slightly less in favour of a hard Brexit than the Tories are and many will find that completely inexplicable.” Her remarks came as Andrew Adonis described Sturgeon as a “powerful voice” on Brexit, while insisting the “tide is turning” in England against leaving the EU. Adonis, who resigned as Theresa May’s infrastructure tsar at the end of December in protest at the government’s handling of Brexit, told Scotland’s Sunday Herald: “Her voice is a powerful one and I hope I can work closely with her in forcing Theresa May to let the people of the UK make the final decision on the Brexit deal that’s negotiated.” Sturgeon has said previously that calls for a second EU referendum may “become difficult to resist”. The SNP leader earlier this week reiterated that the Scottish government would not recommend that Holyrood approve the EU withdrawal bill in its current state, after the Westminster government failed to bring forward amendments to a highly contentious clause that centralises more than 100 European powers in Whitehall after Brexit, even though they involve policy controlled by the devolved parliaments. She told Andrew Marr that, while legislative consent is a convention, “it is unthinkable that the House of Commons would ignore the views not just of the Scottish parliament but the Welsh assembly”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/jan/15/perth-glorys-static-ball-movement-shows-lack-of-identifiable-game-plan","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-14T17:00:32Z","webTitle":"Perth Glory's static ball movement shows lack of identifiable game plan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/15/perth-glorys-static-ball-movement-shows-lack-of-identifiable-game-plan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jan/15/perth-glorys-static-ball-movement-shows-lack-of-identifiable-game-plan","fields":{"headline":"Perth Glory's static ball movement shows lack of identifiable game plan","bodyText":"Football, it is often said, is a results business. Most recently in the Australian game, results have provided the foundation for Graham Arnold’s growing support to take on the role of Socceroos coach. However, despite the vindication results can bring, they can also create false equivalencies in the estimation of players, teams and coaches. Almost a month ago, for example, Perth Glory were in the A-League’s top six, following wins over Brisbane Roar and Wellington Phoenix. A solitary round has the potential to drastically change perceptions of a team’s progress dramatically. Despite Saturday’s 3-2 loss to Melbourne Victory, Perth still sit only three points off finals. But only now has the pressure been heaped on Glory coach Kenny Lowe, following four consecutive defeats and a goal difference of -12 over that period. When considering the team’s play this season, however, something has been wrong throughout. Outside of mere results, Perth have scored the third-least amount of goals (17) and conceded the most (33) in the A-League thus far. In context, nine of Glory’s 17 goals this season have come in the team’s five wins, which have been borne of unsystematic scenarios – aside from VAR’s role against Melbourne City. In victories over Central Coast and Brisbane Roar, Lowe’s side benefitted from simple launches from the goalkeeper up the pitch – instances where the attackers could punish a scrambling and isolated defence. Perth’s second win against the Roar last month was indicative of this random quality, where a mistimed pass from an injured Xavi Torres somehow found its way to Joseph Mills, who was able to attack in transition. In these situations, Glory have showed just enough individual quality to capitalise, through the likes of Castro, Andy Keogh and Adam Taggart. Otherwise, Perth have greatly struggled – with 10 losses in 16 games. The problem, primarily, is that Perth’s attackers lack overall quality in one-on-one situations, while the team’s movement off the ball in both offensive and defensive phases is static. Consequently, there is an unhealthy reliance on Castro and Jacob Italiano to create in open play. The oldest and youngest of Glory’s outfield players account for 50.55% of Perth’s successful dribbles so far this season, with players having logged at least 600 of an available 1,440 minutes. The only other players to have hit double figures in this respect are Mills (10) and Jeremy Walker (11), who both benefit as full-backs, with the ability to dribble from deeper positions in increased space. Keogh, Taggart and Mitch Nichols – along with Andreu and Xavi Torres – have together contributed to only five of the team’s successful dribbles so far this season. Tellingly, Jacob Poscoliero and Shane Lowry – who play in central defence – have been able to beat their primary defender more often, with a combined tally of eight. A collective inability to get past opposition defenders cripples a team in attack but inert movement off the ball – an aspect all too prevalent with Perth this season – works both ways. Not moving fluidly to create passing options off the ball means individuals have to operate in isolation – the very thing that exposes the majority of Perth’s players. With this in mind, it is no surprise Perth rank ninth in the A-League this season for dribble success rate (53.4%) and last for total successful dribbles (101). As a result, average pass completion for Glory players in the opposition half is at a poor 59.8%, while the team are ranked ninth in total shots (166). Although Castro’s errant pass contributed to James Troisi’s equaliser on Saturday, a lack of movement meant Victory outnumbered Glory before winning possession. A best case scenario in that instance was for the Spaniard to attract a foul in order to advance the team’s field position, which is far from ideal. Static movement also hurts a team defensively and Perth have conceded an embarrassing 2.06 goals per game this season because of it. Glory have been continually punished in transitional phases this season, with two on Saturday night following similarly conceded goals against Adelaide United and Sydney FC in recent weeks. The first against Adelaide was particularly troubling, where one movement between the lines from Baba Diawara allowed a 3v2 situation for Daniel Adlung to score from, in only the 10th minute. Kenny Lowe’s comments that his side was in desperate need of a settled back 10 following the loss to the Reds bemoaned a lack of stability, but the availability of players is ultimately a secondary problem. The absence of personnel – let alone personnel who can penetrate defensive lines – absolves Lowe to a degree, but the absence of an identifiable plan is less forgivable. A professional team should not have such little collective impact when individuals are not in possession of the ball. Responsibility falls on the coaching staff to recognise this tactical issue and respond. To this point, the team and the coaching staff have shown the same level of inaction. If this continues, results will increasingly reflect Perth’s level of play, meaning pressure on Lowe’s position will only grow."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"society/2018/jan/21/steroids-quest-perfection-performance-enhancing-drugs","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-21T19:04:53Z","webTitle":"‘I think I’ll be on a dose for ever’: steroid users on the quest for perfection","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jan/21/steroids-quest-perfection-performance-enhancing-drugs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/jan/21/steroids-quest-perfection-performance-enhancing-drugs","fields":{"headline":"‘I think I’ll be on a dose for ever’: steroid users on the quest for perfection","bodyText":"John eased his bulky frame into a chair at the Lower Dock Street clinic in Newport, south Wales and reeled off a dizzying list of substances he injects or swallows as he seeks the perfect, honed physique. “I take all sorts,” he said. “Testosterone, trenbolone, Equipoise, Dianabol, Halotestin, hCG, Arimidex, Nolvadex, clenbuterol. It’s not cheap – I spend more than £200 a month.” Is he worried about the long-term dangers of his regime? “If I’m honest, no. There’s a lot worse things I could be doing. I don’t drink, I don’t smoke. I go to the gym avidly. I feel fit and well. Surely what I’m doing can’t be worse than smoking or drinking?” The old archetype of the IPED (image and performance-enhancing drugs) user, of a beefed-up thug shooting up before throwing weights around a backstreet gym, garage or garden shed, is changing. John, 30, is one of a new breed. He is a quietly spoken engineer on a good wage and devoted to his career. In his spare time he works hard, not only on pumping iron but on understanding what each of the IPEDs he uses does. This visit to the new IPED clinic in Newport – run by the Gwent Specialist Substance Misuse Service and one of the few of its kind in the UK – is part of what he sees as a responsible approach. Doctors and nurses carry out blood and ECG tests on users and give them non-judgmental advice about the substances they use. “I saw this clinic advertised in my gym and thought it wouldn’t hurt to make sure my body is working correctly,” said John. “I don’t think I’m in danger but it’s about keeping me going for longer.” John takes part in bodybuilding competitions and does not have much time for those who are more concerned about using anabolic steroids simply to look good when they are out socialising or on holiday. “For me, that is abusing. In my opinion, it’s okay to use steroids as performance-enhancing drugs. But I don’t approve of those who take steroids then go out on a Friday night in a tight top and get drunk. That gives us a bad name.” Following John into the clinic was Paul, a 27-year-old security worker. He has been training since he was 13 and began taking IPEDs after seeing so many other people doing it. “I started off small, then built up. All my mates are training. It’s quite a sociable thing to do.” Paul does not take a cocktail of substances. “I take about 800mg of testosterone a week. You hear about the big boys going up to 1.5g, so I’m not up there.” He envisages himself taking steroids for the rest of his life. “I don’t plan on stopping any time soon. I think I’ll probably be on a dose for ever. I’m not worried about my heart or anything. If I was blasting it I would be, but I don’t think there’s a problem with what I do.” The medics who work here – all as volunteers – see some worrying cases. When the Guardian visited, one young man was found to have a resting heartbeat of more than double the normal. He did not drink or smoke, had a well-balanced diet and exercised every day. But he did take steroids and caffeinated drinks. They also speak to young men who inject directly into the muscles in the areas of the body they want to enhance – such as the pectorals – though this is considered dangerous. One man in his 20s explained how he believed he had achieved a “cut” and lean figure thanks to steroids and amphetamines – and had never set foot in a gym or lifted a weight. During hospital shifts they come across steroid users in their 40s collapsing of heart attacks and suffering liver failure. They also speak to users who try to save money by sharing vials but open themselves up to the risk of contracting bloodborne viruses, and those who self-medicate rather than going to a doctor. Jim, who is in his 60s, is a leading figure in the south Wales IPED scene. In the past he has used steroids; he now runs a gym. He gives advice to anyone who will listen and is encouraging users to visit the IPED clinic. “You get all sorts using steroids now, from athletes and bodybuilders to lads who want to look good at the weekend or at the beach.” There is no shortage of IPEDs in south Wales. Some users buy them on the internet from countries such as Turkey, Greece and Thailand, where they can be bought across the counter. Others source them from underground laboratories. Jim said he had noticed an increase in the number of drug dealers trading in steroids. “They are moving away from the class As and Bs and into steroids. The problem is that you can’t always be sure of the quality of what you are doing.” He believes IPEDs are here to stay. “When I first got into the game, gyms were just shacks with a few weights,” Jim said. “Now there are gyms everywhere and the pressure on young men to have a six-pack and look buff is immense.” Names of users have been changed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jan/15/its-time-wayne-swan-weighs-up-future-as-labor-sources-urge-retirement","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-14T17:00:32Z","webTitle":"'It's time': Wayne Swan weighs up future as Labor sources urge retirement","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/15/its-time-wayne-swan-weighs-up-future-as-labor-sources-urge-retirement","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jan/15/its-time-wayne-swan-weighs-up-future-as-labor-sources-urge-retirement","fields":{"headline":"'It's time': Wayne Swan weighs up future as Labor sources urge retirement","bodyText":"Speculation is mounting in Labor that the veteran MP and former treasurer Wayne Swan is preparing to retire from politics at the next election, although he would only say he “has not made a decision as yet”. With Labor moving into campaign mode ahead of the next federal election, which can be held anytime from August, attention has turned to what “Labor 2018” should look like. Several senior sources have told Guardian Australia they believe Swan is actively looking to step aside come the next election, with fellow AWU right member and former campaign manager Anika Wells considered the most likely candidate to step in. “It’s time and I think Swanny knows that,” one Labor source said. “He has had a lot to contribute, and he is still active, but he is also one of the last relics of the Rudd-Gillard years and we are looking to move past that. I think he feels that too.” Others, while acknowledging Swan’s service and role in the party, were more straight forward. “He should have left at the last election and I think he realises that now,” another Labor source said. “It’s time for new blood. We know it, he knows it. It’s just taken a little longer for him to let go.” Speaking to Guardian Australia, Swan said he would not make his decision about whether to re-contest until nominations were officially called. “I haven’t made any decision,” he said. “I still see myself as having significant input to make at both the local and national level. I am certainly still very active and passionate about what I do, including looking at tackling inequality, looking at how we for the long term pursue not only economic growth but a far stronger society. “I am very involved in the economic debate about how we create prosperity and opportunity.” It is those contributions that some of his colleagues believe have delayed the decision. “Swanny is still very involved in how we deal with inequality and those sorts of things and I think he is just aware that if he announces, or confirms he is looking at walking away, he’ll suffer from ‘lame duck’ syndrome,” said one colleague, who was one of three colleagues to mention “lame duck” concerns. “Why would you take advice from someone who was pulling the plug?” Swan, who has held the Queensland seat of Lilley since 1998, bucking predictions he would lose the seat in the 2013 election that saw Tony Abbott sweep to victory, has been dogged with retirement rumours for years. His decision to re-contest the last election was met with disgruntlement from some within the party, who expected him to step aside, as Labor pushes to increase female representation and shake off the “shackles of the past”. “Swanny has done a lot but it doesn’t surprise me he is now looking at walking away,” another colleague said. “If we’re going to be successful at the next election, we need to get serious about moving completely on from what happened the last time we were in government. “He knows it. He’s certainly not the only one who should be thinking it.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/jan/13/ospreys-saracens-european-champions-cup-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-13T22:09:45Z","webTitle":"Saracens’ title defence out of their hands after Biggar earns Ospreys draw","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jan/13/ospreys-saracens-european-champions-cup-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jan/13/ospreys-saracens-european-champions-cup-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Saracens’ title defence out of their hands after Biggar earns Ospreys draw","bodyText":"When Saracens defeated Ospreys in October, they extended their unbeaten run in the Champions Cup to 20 matches. Since then they have gone three without victory and the draw here, which Ospreys secured with a Dan Biggar penalty in the final minute after the holders had been blown again for collapsing a scrum, leaves them on the verge of elimination from the competition they have won in the last two seasons. Even five points at home to Northampton on Saturday may not be enough. Saracens can no longer top their group, although Ospreys will if they win at faltering Clermont Auvergne, and while they never trailed here, the early assurance they showed in methodically building a 6-0 lead, looking to wear down their opponents with a series of body blows, melted as the game evolved to hinge on the scrum rather than the breakdown. Even though the persistent rain throughout the day had relented by the kick-off, it returned midway through the opening period. Handling mistakes contributed to more than 20 scrums on the night and Saracens were penalised at six of them. Only the last one, in the final 90 seconds shortly after Owen Farrell’s fifth penalty looked to have secured victory for the holders, directly led to points. But the problems up front eroded their initial superiority and allowed Ospreys to establish territorial dominance. Injuries also cost Saracens. They lost one back rower, Jackson Wray, to a hamstring injury in the warm-up and another, Michael Rhodes, to the same problem at half-time. The most grievous blow, though, was a wrist injury suffered by their No8, Billy Vunipola, in the first half as he attempted to tackle his opposite number, Rob McCusker. The England international failed to return for the second half of his second match following a knee injury and will be assessed this week before the national squad for the Six Nations is announced on Thursday. In addition, Saracens were forced to replace the second row Will Skelton with the hooker Christopher Tolofua 10 minutes from the end, stretching even the most resourceful of clubs to the point that when Ospreys were awarded their final penalty after the prop Juan Figallo had dropped a scrum, their first thought was to kick for touch and go for the victory that would knock out the holders rather than the draw that would keep them on a life support system. “Common sense prevailed and we took the three points,” said Biggar, whose fifth penalty cancelled out the five of his opposite number Farrell. If Farrell had largely dictated the first half, Biggar took over after the break, pinning back Saracens with his kicking variations and constantly in the ears of his forwards. Ospreys may have at no point been in the lead, but a draw was the least their initial defiance and latter mastery of the conditions merited. It had looked so different in the opening quarter when Billy Vunipola went on a couple of rampaging runs, once flattening the wing Dan Evans as Ospreys pressed their advantage at a scrum unaware that the No8 had the ball in his hands, and the home side relieved the pressure by conceding penalties, two of which Farrell turned into points. There was a familiar brutality to the game, both sides seeking contact on a night that was about the basics rather than the trimmings with the match effectively a knockout. Biggar scored his first points after 30 minutes when Maro Itoje contested a ruck off his feet, and although Farrell quickly restored his side’s six-point advantage with his third penalty, Biggar concluded the opening period with three points and drew Ospreys level with his third kick three minutes after the restart. The momentum was swinging towards the hosts but Saracens regained the lead after 46 minutes with Farrell’s fourth penalty, although the prop Dmitri Arhip, who provided Mako Vunipola with an uncomfortable 80 minutes, was aggrieved to have been penalised at a ruck. The whistle of the referee, John Lacey, provided the theme tune to a night when risk was avoided to the point where the result was likely to be decided by a mistake. Ospreys turned down three points to go for a driving lineout after Mako Vunipola had been enclosed at a scrum, but they never got the maul into gear. They were trailing when, with 15 minutes to go, the full-back, Sam Davies, claimed a ball in the air just inside his own half from Chris Wyles, who turned his back as he saw Jeff Hassler in front prepare to jump. It meant he inadvertently tipped Davies shoulder first to the ground. Wyles was shown a yellow card and was in the sin-bin when Biggar equalised the score for the second time after Schalk Burger had held on to the ball under pressure from Justin Tipuric and Alun Wyn Jones. Saracens quickly hit back via Farrell’s boot but Ospreys never wilted and when Figallo dropped a scrum 40 metres in front of his own posts, Biggar showed his gratitude. “It was a disappointing way to finish and it is out of our hands now,” said the Saracens director of rugby, Mark McCall. “It was a tight, scrappy game that came down to the penalty count in the scrum which we lost heavily. Maybe we do not deserve to be in the competition because we lost twice to Clermont and drew here; we have probably not quite been good enough.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2018/jan/11/ooh-have-you-seen-the-state-of-kim-kardashians-kitchen","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-11T18:23:48Z","webTitle":"Ooh, have you seen the state of Kim Kardashian’s kitchen?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2018/jan/11/ooh-have-you-seen-the-state-of-kim-kardashians-kitchen","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2018/jan/11/ooh-have-you-seen-the-state-of-kim-kardashians-kitchen","fields":{"headline":"Ooh, have you seen the state of Kim Kardashian’s kitchen?","bodyText":"Behold.

After all, as in a fairytale, she is the youngest of seven children. She has magicked what could have been a tear-soaked memoir into a rap. Having learned about gangsta rap from one of her sibs, Warden was never drawn to Celine Dion’s wanness but to Tupac Shakur’s Hit ’Em Up. Inured to some misogyny and violence, she found it empowering. My Mum’s a Twat throws a punch: at her mother, at the movement that seduced her, at the journalists who didn’t listen to her when she tried to tell her story. When Warden was 12 – she is now 34 – her attentive mother was swept up by a cult. She became set on “healing” (failing to cure her daughter’s scars) and meditation, a path she was persuaded had to be pursued in Canada, persisting even when her daughter said she wouldn’t go with her. So Warden went to live with her father in Devon, visiting the Canadian cult in the hols. Where she had a mostly good, that’s to say, bad teenage time. Delivering coke with pizza, drying out skunk in her bedside cabinet, having her first Reese’s Peanut Butter Cup. Written in two weeks, and written with flair, this “true story filtered through a hazy memory” has the power of compulsive confession and its unevenness: the extraordinary is jumbled with routine teenage angst; it ricochets rather than builds. Added dash comes from Vicky Featherstone and Jude Christian’s production – swoony music encloses woo-woo moments – and in Chloe Lamford’s lovely teenage-bedroom design: some spectators sit on beanbags; trolls (old-style) line up on a shelf. Marvellous Patsy Ferran is Warden. Always able to appeal directly to the audience she is sprite-like, often appearing less as a character than a mood. Her feet slide as if she were skating; her features swivel all over her face. She is a natural comic with a seam of sadness. Physically unlike the dramatist – known to much of the audience on press night as the Court’s press officer – she catches her restless mischief: tapping on a keyboard, her feet move as if longing to dance away. She has only one fault: she allows for no rest between vivid moments. She can’t, you see, bear to be boring.

First that of the dramatist Andrea Dunbar, who put on stage the life she lived and saw around her on the Buttershaw estate in Bradford in the 80s (not many dramatists like that nowadays), and who was dead at 29 from a brain haemorrhage. Then the story of the Court’s windmilling reactions. At the height of the Weinstein revelations, Max Stafford-Clark, co-director with Kate Wasserberg, stepped down from the production and from co-producer Out of Joint, following allegations of sexual harassment. The theatre found the idea of putting on a play in which two 15-year-old girls have sex with a 25-year-old married man, mostly in the back of a car, “conflictual” and cancelled the show. But following an outcry – surely this was a singularly apt time for a revival? Since when did showing a play mean endorsement? – artistic director Vicky Featherstone overturned the cancellation, and said she hoped the staging would be an occasion for new conversations. The conversation is happening. But this is a precarious evening: a retrieval rather than a rediscovery. What is terrific about Dunbar is her clear-eyed frankness. She records without preconceptions. The girls are not victims – or not simply victims. They are quick-witted, avid, and up for “a jump”. They conduct almost-adult lives as a schoolgirl game: giggling together in the back seat of the car; speaking pertly in chorus; watching each other as Bob goes at it, pumping away, trousers around his knees and squabbling about who has the first turn; flinging around soggy rubber johnnies. Bob, a cruising penis in jeans, is himself under threat. He has to wag his willy because he has little else to offer. No one has enough to do. Thatcherism has them all on the skids. The once urgency of the play gleams intermittently in its sharp dialogue. It is a striking chronicle of misogyny – of the casual “run an iron over my jeans” kind, and the vicious slut-calling and battering kind. It is also a witness to the succour of female friendship. Gemma Dobson, sassy and wistful, makes a memorable stage debut. Yet, rather like the Court’s recent revival of Road, Wasserberg’s production often feels not immediate but monumental, set up to honour a piece of theatrical history. There is even a battleaxe mother in curlers. It nods to current events but does not give us new ways of thinking about them. • Rita, Sue and Bob Too is at the Jerwood Theatre Downstairs, Royal Court, London, until 27 January This article was amended to correct the cause of Andrea Dunbar’s untimely death."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"stage/2018/jan/11/john-lithgow-stories-by-heart-review-star-presence-cant-save-humdrum-one-man-show","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-12T02:00:16Z","webTitle":"John Lithgow: Stories by Heart review – star presence can't save humdrum one-man show","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/jan/11/john-lithgow-stories-by-heart-review-star-presence-cant-save-humdrum-one-man-show","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/jan/11/john-lithgow-stories-by-heart-review-star-presence-cant-save-humdrum-one-man-show","fields":{"headline":"John Lithgow: Stories by Heart review – star presence can't save humdrum one-man show","bodyText":"Maybe some ticket buyers to John Lithgow: Stories by Heart have long dreamed of Lithgow fixing them cocoa, tucking them in, and regaling them with a bedtime tale. Those people have probably not seen Raising Cain. One of the finest things about Lithgow is how unclassifiable he is, how idiosyncratic. Another pale giant with a rabbit face and a plum pudding voice might have become a niche performer, but he has always moved gracefully among classics and schlock, leads and character roles, charmers and drips and villains and extraterrestrials. So it is both a pleasure and a disappointment to find him doing something as aggressively ordinary as this one-man show, which Lithgow first developed a decade ago, alternating family reminiscences with good-natured performances of two short stories, Ring Lardner’s Haircut and PG Wodehouse’s Uncle Fred Flits By. Lithgow, dressed in a loose gray suit, steps on to a stage decorated to look like a wood-paneled study. Friendly and avuncular, he bathes for a while in the audience acclaim and then offers a series of rhetorical questions about the matter at hand. “Why do all of us want to hear stories?” he asks. “Why do some of us want to tell them? Why, for that matter, are all of you even here tonight?” That last question is actually a pretty good one and raises others: why would a leading non-profit like the Roundabout devote a Broadway theater to something so humdrum? Were no new plays available? Is a cracking turn on The Crown so bankable? Has no one there seen Dexter? Then Lithgow introduces a book central to his childhood, Tellers of Tales, a collection of 100 short stories selected by W Somerset Maugham. When Lithgow was young, his father, Arthur Lithgow, an intermittently successful actor, director and producer, would read his children a story from it at bedtime. Now Lithgow does the same, though after a page or two he abandons the book itself and begins to act out the stories. The first, set in a rural Michigan town, is an American gothic, the second, which begins at the bread roll-battered Drones Club, is an English trifle, with an unnecessary intermission in between. Lithgow performs both ably, switching voices, postures and outsized facial expressions with ease. But that’s really the bare minimum for a successful single-actor, multi-character show. When you set yourself a low bar, it’s easy enough to step over. There is one startling moment when Lithgow looks likely to remove his trousers, but he’s only tucking in his shirttail. Stories by Heart is cozy and folksy, as affable and daring as a dish of vanilla ice cream. When performing Uncle Fred Flits By, Lithgow speaks of a character who has generated “a great store of loopiness which expends itself with frightful violence”. That could describe plenty of Lithgow’s performances. Not this one.

As Hanna, Sophie Khan Levy makes eye contact with her audience with such sympathetic naturalness that one feels almost tempted to interrupt her monologue and turn it into a conversation. Her compelling performance brings out her character’s insecurity through a smile that intensifies and fades, as though on a dimmer switch. Yet for all her hesitancy, Khan Levy shows that Hanna knows herself. In George Turvey’s elegantly focused production, she sits in what could be a television studio were it not that we are her only company. Her story is hard to process: a DNA test reveals that her daughter is not hers (an alcoholic hospital worker swapped babies). Hanna describes meeting her real daughter and the real daughter’s “mother”. It is a great subject for a play – an emotional tug-of-war in which it is, at first, morally unclear in which direction to pull. Potter is sharp and entertaining about nature and nurture and the divisiveness of British society. Visiting the house where her daughter lives is, Hanna feels, “like being shown round the Cluedo board”. Her daughter has been “upgraded”. Potter confidently overturns cliche – especially the commonplace about children’s adaptability: “Children hate change,” she asserts. And, in case you wondered, this story is not far-fetched. In a blog about her play, Potter quotes the statistic that, worldwide, an estimated 19,000 babies a year are accidentally swapped at birth. • At the Arcola, London, until 20 January; then touring until 22 February"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/2018/jan/11/scarlets-bath-power-leigh-halfpenny-injury-european-rugby-champions-cup","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-11T16:06:05Z","webTitle":"Scarlets’ plan to hit Bath with power dented by Leigh Halfpenny injury","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jan/11/scarlets-bath-power-leigh-halfpenny-injury-european-rugby-champions-cup","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jan/11/scarlets-bath-power-leigh-halfpenny-injury-european-rugby-champions-cup","fields":{"headline":"Scarlets’ plan to hit Bath with power dented by Leigh Halfpenny injury","bodyText":"The Scarlets are aiming to invoke the spirit of 2002 at Bath on Friday night in their quest to reach the knockout stage of the European Champions Cup for the first time in 11 years. Only victory will do for the Pro12 champions in the most keenly contested of groups, with one point separating third from first in the table. However, a late injury to Leigh Halfpenny means the full‑back will be a key loss. When the Scarlets last played Bath, it was as Llanelli 16 years ago. They had made the quarter-finals as one of the best runners-up and were not expected to trouble Bath but eight penalties and a drop goal from their fly-half Stephen Jones, who is now the side’s attack coach, took them to a 27-10 victory. “This is another opportunity to show what we are about and you can see the enthusiasm of the coaches,” the Scarlets fly-half Rhys Patchell said. “Stephen Jones has been animated in meetings and on the training field. He was a big-game player and he has huge experience in Europe.” The Scarlets started their European campaign with a narrow defeat in Toulon before losing at home against Bath. “The disappointing thing about that night was that we hardly fired any shots,” said Patchell, whose opposite number in that match was Bath’s match‑winner, Rhys Priestland. “They put a squeeze on us territorially and we could not get out of our half. Rhys played very well and we were unable to get a foothold. “We will have a crack at them on Friday night and what happens, happens. We have to make sure we do not come off the field with any bullets left in our pockets.” Halfpenny was ruled out after failing a late fitness test on Thursday because of a pectoral muscle injury. Johnny McNicholl also misses out with a shoulder injury, meaning Patchell will take Halfpenny’s role, Paul Asquith will play on the wing, Hadleigh Parkes will start in the centre and Dan Jones will feature at fly-half. They are close to full strength at forward and boast the Wales front row. The Scarlets, like Glasgow, lead their divisional group in what this season became the Pro14 but both sides have found that in Europe raw power counts for more. Bath, who include three Wales internationals in their team, welcome back the England flanker Sam Underhill, who will be making his first appearance since sustaining a second concussion of the season while playing for England against Australia nearly two months ago. The England head coach, Eddie Jones, announces his squad for the Six Nations next Thursday, giving Underhill one chance to impress. “It has been tough for Sam because he has a high profile and people keep talking about him,” Todd Blackadder, Bath’s director of rugby, said. “We have waited for him to come right and he is feeling confident.” Matt Banahan features on the wing for Bath for the first time since the 26-21 victory against Toulon in December at the Rec put the Premiership club at the top of the group, level on points with the three-times winners of the tournament and one ahead of the Scarlets, who finish with a home match against Toulon on 20 January, when Bath are in Treviso."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"society/2018/jan/11/nhs-winter-crisis-hospital-felt-like-something-out-of-a-war-zone","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-11T18:28:20Z","webTitle":"NHS winter crisis: hospital 'felt like something out of a war zone'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jan/11/nhs-winter-crisis-hospital-felt-like-something-out-of-a-war-zone","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/jan/11/nhs-winter-crisis-hospital-felt-like-something-out-of-a-war-zone","fields":{"headline":"NHS winter crisis: hospital 'felt like something out of a war zone'","bodyText":"Senior doctors have taken the unprecedented move of writing to Theresa May, warning that winter pressures mean some patients are dying prematurely.

Chris Page, 53, from Greenwich, London: ‘My wife had sepsis and we were told to wait in a chair for three hours’ My wife had been ill in bed for a long time. We thought she had flu and on Monday went to our GP. The doctor looked at her and said she needed to go to hospital. The doctor told us to call an ambulance so we could circumvent going to A&amp;E. The ambulance arrived in about 20 minutes and took us to Queen Elizabeth hospital in Woolwich, which was already full when we arrived. Admissions staff said: “I am really sorry, but there is nowhere [for you] to go.” This was at around 9.30am on a Monday, it wasn’t Saturday night in the emergency department. We were told to sit in a chair and wait. My wife was quite distressed. The hospital was jammed and eventually – after about three and half hours – she was taken through resus [resuscitation]. She was then put into a room for assessment, but because it was so busy the curtain had to be pulled around the bed and another three patients were moved into the same room. Two of them were sharing a drip stand. I went out to get a coffee and on the way to the canteen I met with a blocked corridor. I thought: “That’s weird.” A porter came up and said: “You have to go another way.” I looked over and all I could see was a corridor full of beds, around eight or 10 patients, a mixture of young and old. It felt like something out of a war zone. The staff were impeccable throughout but they were obviously under a lot of stress. The problem was that there was simply nowhere for patients to go. They did what they could for my wife, who was quite ill with sepsis, and she eventually made it on to a ward that evening at about 6pm. The whole process made me feel really sorry for the people who work there. You kind of feel like apologising to them for the fact that you are taking up their time. They were so amazing, faultless and doing everything they could but there was just not enough room for them to operate. It was just regretful and it’s sad doctors and nurses have to work in these conditions. A trust spokesperson said: “Like many other NHS trusts, we are experiencing very high demands for our services, with large numbers of very sick patients visiting our A&amp;E departments. We are extremely sorry that the care we provided on this occasion didn’t reach the standards that our patients expect and that we aim to offer.” Anonymous locum doctor, Scotland: ‘I worked in an overflow ward which didn’t have enough equipment or staff. It was completely unsafe’ Last week, for two days, I was a locum doctor on a general medical ward. It was so busy in A&amp;E that they had to open overflow wards. A number of patients were moved, but many were confused as to why. We were supposed to move only those who were stable but I believe some that were sent were not. One patient had quite severe heart failure and another was withdrawing from alcohol. But the problem was that, once we had transferred patients, we realised there was not enough equipment or enough staff to man the ward. We were missing syringes and tubes so it was hard to take a patient’s bloods. We were also missing stickers for ECG machines. Lots of patients were transferred without their zimmer frames or medication, so we had to order more. Nurses were going to write a letter to say how unsafe it had all been. We didn’t really know what patients were going to be sent over and were given no handover documents. One patient was transferred without their medical notes. It was completely unsafe."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/jan/12/julie-delpy-women-directors-sexual-advances-hollywood-misogyny-film","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-12T06:00:21Z","webTitle":"Julie Delpy: ‘Women were  bred to be directors’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jan/12/julie-delpy-women-directors-sexual-advances-hollywood-misogyny-film","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/jan/12/julie-delpy-women-directors-sexual-advances-hollywood-misogyny-film","fields":{"headline":"Julie Delpy: ‘Women were  bred to be directors’","bodyText":"Julie Delpy is angry. Right now, the French actor and director should be up to her neck in spreadsheets. For three years, she has worked night and day “fighting, fighting, fighting” to get her sixth film as a writer-director, My Zoe, financed. The script is the best thing she has ever written, she says, a mother-daughter drama “with a crazy third act”. The plan was to shoot this spring, but in November, the night before Thanksgiving, a financier pulled out at the 11th hour, spooked she believes, by a “sexist” American lawyer advising him. “My God, the guy was like a poison.” So here we are, drinking tea in a fancy Paris hotel a few days before Christmas. (Delpy lives in LA but is home for the holidays.) In theory, we are meant to be talking about one of the few acting roles she has taken on while concentrating on her film, playing a love-interest French teacher in The Bachelors, a sweet, emotionally grown-up US indie about a grieving father and son. But her blood is boiling and her brain is in overdrive. Don’t get her started on that lawyer. “I’ve never dealt with someone, so, so …” For a moment, the sheer scale of his perfidy stumps her. “He is a third-rate lawyer, not a classy guy. Really trashy, trashy, trashy.” Her words hang in the air, deliciously transgressive in the genteel atmosphere of clinking porcelain. She has had bad experiences before, but never anything as awful as this. For eight months, Delpy says, she negotiated with the lawyer, along with her female producer. “I couldn’t believe how he was behaving, the bullying, the aggression.” If you want to discredit a woman film-maker, you just need to drop the “e” word. Which is what he did at the beginning of a conference call, she says, warning the two women “not to get emotional. As if the discussion was going to be emotional because there are two women on the line!” Her eyes widen with disbelief. “He wasn’t saying: ‘It’s great to be emotional.’ He was saying: ‘Your money is at stake. Do not invest in a woman’s film.’ And it’s easy to put the idea into [financiers’] heads that women will take the money and go buy Prada bags.” She screws up her face sarcastically. “That’s what I do. I take the money and run to the Prada store. It’s exhausting dealing with the stupidity.” In cold print, perhaps a little of her screwball Diane Keaton-ness is lost; but believe me, she is hilarious. You could time Big Ben by Delpy’s delivery. While she pauses to gather steam, I sneak a look at her handbag. Knackered black leather, definitely not Prada. Delpy has lived in LA for years, but has yet to acquire the swallowed-a-lightbulb glow of the rich and famous. She is very beautiful, of course, but doesn’t seem to go in for poise or gloss. In fact, I almost didn’t recognise her walking into the hotel reception under a huge woolly hat. She’s back: “He would not feel comfortable destroying the film of a man. But he’s comfortable crushing a woman.” She balls a fist and slams it into the other hand, miming the action. “But he picked the wrong woman to crush. I’m not going to let him get away with it. When I’m under attack, I’m fierce.” Taking a sip of herbal tea, she eyes the tape recorder suspiciously and says, a little wearily: “I’m so angry. I sound like I’m on drugs. I’m not. I just don’t sleep. I haven’t slept more than two hours a night for the past three weeks.” Worrying? “No, trying to find solutions.” Her outspoken attitude has got her into deep water before. In January 2016, Delpy issued an apology after suggesting that women in Hollywood face a tougher time than people of colour. This experience with the hateful lawyer has triggered her disgust with the misogyny in the film industry. So, too, has the wave of recent stories of men abusing their power. Delpy doesn’t identify as a victim, but reels off encounters with “scumbags” over the years that have kicked the trajectory of her career off course and slammed doors shut. Shockingly, she claims that, from the age of 13 or 14, “creepy directors” in France warned her that she would never make it if she didn’t go along with the casting-couch culture. Not a chance. She moved to New York at 19. “It made me really tough.” Then there was the director who smeared her reputation in Hollywood. The first week she arrived in LA in 1993, then in her early 20s, she brushed off his sexual advances. “It wasn’t aggressive. I didn’t snap at him. I just said: ‘It’s not for me. This is not who I am.’” Years later, she found out through friends that the man in question had spread it about that she was “difficult”. “I couldn’t figure out why every time I had a studio audition it would end up: ‘We love her, but we don’t know if …’ And the part would go to someone else.” So he damaged her career? “For sure. I didn’t work with a lot of people because I had the reputation of saying no. But men of power never say to other men of power: ‘She said no to me.’ They say: ‘I can’t work with her. She’s too crazy.’ Or: ‘She’s too difficult.’ And you realise that all those actresses who had the reputation of being difficult, they’re not difficult. You realise so much damage has been done. Careers destroyed. Lives destroyed. It really hurts me inside. Luckily, I was able to turn my life upside down by directing and writing. I won in the end.” She treated Harvey Weinstein like the plague, she says, after meeting one of his victims early in her acting life: “I knew he was someone to avoid being alone with at any cost.” That reputation for being difficult has lingered, she believes. After shooting The Bachelors, the director Kurt Voelker came up to her and said how easy she had been to work with. “I was like: ‘What were you expecting?’” She took the role of Isabelle the French teacher partly in response to playing a monstrous mother in her previous film, Todd Solondz’s Wiener-Dog. Weirdly enough, funny and kind Isabelle in The Bachelors also reminded Delpy of her boyfriend: “He always wants to help people. He’s a kind person. I think that’s an undervalued quality nowadays. People admire Trump, who’s a scumbag. He has no kindness in him whatsoever.” Delpy and her partner – he is a Greek production manager and assistant director – met on the set of Before Midnight, the third in the trilogy of films that has earned her two scriptwriting Oscar nominations with director Richard Linklater and actor Ethan Hawke. Any plans for another sequel? “No, I don’t think we will.’ These days, the truth is that she’s not being offered so many parts, Delpy says. “Some actresses would be crushed by that, but I’m not because I’m doing my own stuff. I rarely get screenplays. Especially after I directed 2 Days in Paris. From then on it was just …” She pulls a comedy horrified face. “It was like I was blacklisted, or something. First, you say no to a few powerful men. Then you start directing movies, and then you’re done.” “You need milk?” Delpy nods down at my pot of tea and calls over a waiter. She strikes me as a woman who gets things done, steelier than the quirky, slightly scatty figure she has often portrayed on screen. People make the mistake of confusing her with Marion, her character in 2 Days in Paris and 2 Days in New York, the pair of relationship comedies she wrote, directed and starred in. “They think I’m a little bit crazy, a little bit neurotic,” she says, with a touch of frustration. What does drive her nuts is the Hollywood old guard’s hostility to female directors – a deep-down feeling in the gut that women are simply not up to the job. “What is directing but multitasking?” she jokes. “That’s all it is. It’s basically multitasking. Women were meant to be directors. We were bred to be directors.” The thing is, says Delpy, that no one has ever lost money on one of her films. Male directors get away with murder by comparison. “Men are indulged so much bullshit. Shooting for eight months, assaulting people on set, screaming. Women? You can’t even run an hour over time.” More than ever, she believes, we need to see the complexity of women and their lives on screen in films: “When I see films by women like Jane Campion I feel like I’m home. It’s a feeling of peace inside. It’s tough for women, huh?” Now, she is working on overdrive to reduce the budget of My Zoe – cutting locations and trimming the script. “The film is getting smaller, smaller, smaller, but there is a limit to what I can cut without destroying the project. So I’m probably not going to get paid. It’s hard to work for free for five years. After a while you get exhausted. I’m 48. I’m a mother [she has a son with her ex, Marc Streitenfeld, the German composer]. I can’t even take care of my kid if, after a certain time, I don’t make a living. But I will make this film. Because I’m not going to let this rat …” Exasperated, she doesn’t finish the sentence, and ends instead with a long low chuckle. You wouldn’t bet against her. • The Bachelors is in cinemas in March"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jan/12/media-to-come-under-scrutiny-in-manchester-arena-attack-inquiry","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-12T06:00:21Z","webTitle":"Media to come under scrutiny in Manchester arena attack inquiry","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jan/12/media-to-come-under-scrutiny-in-manchester-arena-attack-inquiry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jan/12/media-to-come-under-scrutiny-in-manchester-arena-attack-inquiry","fields":{"headline":"Media to come under scrutiny in Manchester arena attack inquiry","bodyText":"An inquiry into Manchester’s response to the arena bombing will examine the role played by the media in the aftermath of the attack. The independent Kerslake arena review – commissioned by the mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham – was tasked with examining the response of the authorities and emergency services to the attack on 22 May 2017, which killed 22 people and injured hundreds more. In a progress report, published on Friday, the review panel said it would also look at the role of both mainstream and social media during the response phase. Stuart Murray, whose stepson, Martyn Hett, was killed in the bombing, said reporters had knocked on the door of the family home and asked his daughters if they would give interviews before Hett’s death had been officially confirmed to relatives. He and his wife had gone to a nearby stadium to find out what had happened to Hett, having heard he was missing, Murray told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Friday. He left the two teenage girls in “what you would imagine would be a safe haven”. He said: “While we’re trying to find news, reporters are knocking on the door at home, my children are answering it and they’re offering their condolences. They basically were inferring that … he had died and would they be prepared to give an interview or talk about it. “That’s during the morning and we actually never got confirmation from the police till 10 o’clock at night.”On the morning after the bombing, Hett’s brother, Dan Hett, complained he had been hounded by the press. He tweeted a photograph of a note that a journalist had put through his letterbox, writing: “I have dealt with 50+ journos online today. Two found my mobile number. This cunt found my house. I still don’t know if my brother is alive.” The inquiry, chaired by the former head of the civil service, Bob Kerslake, started work in September 2017 and is expected to report in March. It has so far heard evidence from 170 people, with the help of a dedicated phone line managed by the NSPCC children’s charity. “Following meetings and discussions with some of the bereaved families and some of those who were injured in the attack, the panel is also looking at the role of the media in relation to the families,” the report says. On Friday, Lord Kerslake told Today part of the problem was the proliferation of the names of missing people on social media. “Then it’s: ‘How do the press respond to that?’ And many did treat the families respectfully,” he said. He cited Murray’s experience as an example in which journalists did not meet that standard, adding: “What we want to do is to say: ‘What can we learn from that and how can the press and the media behave differently?’” Kerslake raised the prospect of a charter to govern how media organisations treat people bereaved in incidents such as the arena attack, though he declined to give specifics on the provisions it might contain. The panel also called on public bodies in Greater Manchester and the north-west of England to support the creation of a charter for families bereaved through public tragedy, which was first proposed in a report, published in November last year, on the experiences of the families affected by the 1989 Hillsborough disaster. The charter would commit organisations to put the public interest above their own reputation and to “avoid seeking to defend the indefensible or to dismiss or disparage those who may have suffered where we have fallen short”. Speaking before the publication of the progress report, Kerslake said: “Throughout the review, we have given everyone the chance to have their say and share their experiences of that dreadful night and the days that followed – good or bad – so we can look at what worked well and learn any lessons for the future. “I’m grateful to everyone who has contributed and come forward with their views and experiences of what was undoubtedly an extremely traumatic event.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/feb/12/orban-allies-could-use-eu-as-cash-register-meps-say","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-12T05:00:06Z","webTitle":"Orbán allies could use EU as cash register, MEPs say","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/12/orban-allies-could-use-eu-as-cash-register-meps-say","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/feb/12/orban-allies-could-use-eu-as-cash-register-meps-say","fields":{"headline":"Orbán allies could use EU as cash register, MEPs say","bodyText":"A European parliamentary watchdog has called for tougher scrutiny of EU spending in Hungary, as concern grows among MEPs and transparency campaigners that a class of oligarchs with ties to the prime minister, Viktor Orbán, could use the EU “as a cash register”. Hungary is on course to receive €25bn (£22.2bn) from the EU in the seven years to 2021, making it one of the largest per-capita recipients of the bloc’s economic development funds. MEPs are increasingly worried that funds are going to Orbán’s family, friends and supporters, who are winning EU-funded infrastructure contracts with little competition – a red flag for anti-corruption campaigners. Ingeborg Grässle, a German centre-right MEP who leads the European parliament’s budgetary control committee, said Hungary had “some specific problems which need to be tackled”. Following a recent visit to Hungary, Grässle and her committee found that 36% of tenders for public projects had only one bidder. Poland and Croatia had an even higher proportion of single-bids for public money at 45%, which the MEPs considered unusually high, she said. “Rules seem to be respected, but at the same time they … avoid competition,” she said in emailed comments. Grässle said the problems were not isolated to Hungary, and a new kind of “semi-legal” irregularity was emerging. “We see oligarchs in some member states becoming politicians and benefiting at the same time from EU and national money for their companies,” she said. She is urging the EU to step up control by using a recently agreed regulation to stop conflicts of interest. Without such action “we accept as legal a grab into the cash register by acting politicians or their friends”, she said. The Czech prime minister, Andrej Babiš, the second richest man in the country, came under renewed pressure last month after a leaked EU report concluded numerous laws had been broken to obtain EU subsidies for a hotel and conference centre he owns. Babiš denies any wrongdoing and has said the allegations are a plot by his opponents. Following an investigation in Hungary, the EU’s anti-fraud office, Olaf, said it had found serious irregularities related to street-lighting contracts awarded to a company that had been owned by Orbán’s son-in-law, István Tiborcz. Olaf has called on the European commission to claw back more than €40m (£35.5m) of EU funds spent on lighting projects. Tiborcz had limited business experience when his company, Elios Innovativ, won contracts to supply EU-funded street lighting for Hungarian towns. Some of the lamps Elios supplied were more than 50% more expensive than market prices, according to analysis by Direkt36, an investigative journalism website that is part of the Global Investigative Journalism Network. Tiborcz sold his stake in Elios shortly before the EU’s anti-fraud office began investigating. Elios did not respond to requests for comment, and Tiborcz is yet to respond to Olaf’s allegations. Olaf had already recommended that European institutions claw back €283m that Hungary has received to build a new metro line in Budapest, after finding evidence of “fraud and possibly corruption”. The project was planned under previous governments and completed in 2014, shortly before Orbán won a second term. Olaf’s inquiry touched on unnamed UK companies, according to its annual report. “The European Union structural funds have an eminent role in the questionable enrichment of government cronies and business oligarchs,” said Miklós Ligeti, the head of legal affairs at Transparency International Hungary. “We would expect the EU to be much more anxious about the dismantling of democratic checks.” Concern about the misspending of EU money is likely to ricochet into a tense debate about the bloc’s future budget, set to fall by €13bn a year because of Brexit. Frank Engel, a centre-right Luxembourg MEP, said Hungary should be obliged to join a newly created EU prosecution service if it wanted to continue to receive EU funds. Twenty EU countries agreed last year to create a European public prosecutor’s office to investigate the misuse of EU funds, but Hungary was among those that declined to take part. “Getting public contracts now in Hungary is a matter of friendship and not a matter of merit,” Engel said. While “not technically materially illegal, where else in the European Union would you have a system where public contracts of significant size go to family members of the head of government?”he said. “I don’t think that happens anywhere else.” The European commission said it had zero tolerance of the fraudulent use of EU funds. “Member states are primarily responsible for the sound management of EU funds, according to the shared management principle,” it said. A spokesperson for Hungary’s international communications office responded to Olaf’s investigation into Elios by noting that the anti-fraud body had investigated street-lighting contracts under the former Socialist government. “Similarly to the previous investigation, we also fully support this latest investigation.” Further questions were directed to the Hungarian prime minister’s office, which said Hungary had an extensive system of controls for monitoring EU funds. Orbán’s office also said Grässle’s figures were out of date. Citing data from Hungary’s public procurement office, it said EU contracts with only one bidder had fallen to 26.3% of the total in 2017 – similar, it said, to other countries in the region. Orbán insisted in December that the Hungarian economy could manage without EU funds. “Hungary has nothing to fear as it is not dependent on any outsiders’ money,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jan/12/winston-churchills-eccentric-working-habits-revealed-in-rare-papers","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-12T00:01:14Z","webTitle":"Winston Churchill's eccentric working habits revealed in rare papers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jan/12/winston-churchills-eccentric-working-habits-revealed-in-rare-papers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jan/12/winston-churchills-eccentric-working-habits-revealed-in-rare-papers","fields":{"headline":"Winston Churchill's eccentric working habits revealed in rare papers","bodyText":"Winston Churchill had a habit of breakfasting in bed and remaining there – sometimes until as late as 1pm – with a secretary and typewriter near his bedside, according to rare papers and insights revealed for the first time by the Imperial War Museums. Documents, testimonies and images showing what life was like in the Churchill war rooms – the former prime minister’s underground wartime HQ under central London – have been made public to mark the UK release of the film Darkest Hour, which recounts the early days of his premiership. Among the collection is a rare surviving example of a letter confirming a typist’s appointment, as well as insights from Churchill’s private secretary, Elizabeth Layton, and other secretaries working in the underground bunker, including details of the leader’s working habits and routines. “We of his personal staff were completely devoted to him, even though he was inclined to be impatient and demanding,” said Layton. “He was somebody who drew our loyalty and our deep respect and affection ... The negative side was only on the surface. Underneath he was a very caring person.” Myra Nora Collyer, a secretary working in the war rooms, remembered the “masses and masses and masses of corridors” and the need for “sun ray lamps” once a week because they were working 12-hour shifts underground. Margaret Walker, employed as a typist and secretary, said: “He used to wear a siren suit and we used to see this shortish, fattish, tubby man bouncing along in a siren suit.” A siren suit, similar to a boiler suit, was an all-in-one garment which could easily be put on over other clothing and was used by people who had to leave their homes for air-raid shelters during bombing raids. Other documents revealed by the Imperial War Museums include early plans for the basement headquarters. The materials have been released to inspire people to visit the Churchill War Rooms in London, which are featured in Darkest Hour and allow visitors to walk in the footsteps of people who worked there. Visitors will also be able to see locations which were recreated for the film, including the map room, the cabinet room, Churchill’s bedroom and the transatlantic telephone room. Churchill is played by Gary Oldman in the upcoming film, which is set in May 1940 as Churchill, just days after becoming prime minister, has to decide whether to accept a negotiated peace treaty with Nazi Germany or fight on. It features three of his most famous speeches: his debut to parliament as prime minister, his first radio address to the nation and a speech to MPs following the Dunkirk evacuation. Churchill’s premiership has become something of a cultural touchstone for politicians, both in the UK and across the Atlantic. “In the year of Trump and the doubts a lot of Americans have about the whole concept of leadership, Churchill is about to get an extra boost,” Andrew Roberts, a British historian who has written a biography of Churchill, recently told the Guardian. “It’s having a leader whom everyone admires and looks up to and is working towards a goal that everyone needs. It does remind people that kind of uncomplicated, unequivocal leadership can be out there.” Michael Bishop, executive director of the International Churchill Society, wrote in an online review: “Gary Oldman inhabits the role of Churchill, capturing his wit, grit and determination and even his impish smile. “Wreathed in cigar smoke, with a voice that ranges from a slurred mumble to a stentorian roar, Oldman looks and sounds the part.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jan/11/protests-pakistan-police-inaction-rape-murder-girl-seven","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-11T15:59:19Z","webTitle":"Protests in Pakistan over inaction on rape and murder of girl, seven","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/11/protests-pakistan-police-inaction-rape-murder-girl-seven","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jan/11/protests-pakistan-police-inaction-rape-murder-girl-seven","fields":{"headline":"Protests in Pakistan over inaction on rape and murder of girl, seven","bodyText":"Roads have been blocked and vehicles burned in the Pakistani city of Kasur as hundreds of people protested against police inaction in the case of a seven-year-old girl who was raped and murdered last week. The body of the girl, Zainab, was found in a rubbish dump on Tuesday. She was the 12th child to have been murdered in the past year within a 1.2-mile (2km) radius of Kasur, a city in the province of Punjab scarred by years of paedophilia scandals. On Wednesday two protesters were shot dead by police, and on Thursday a company of military police entered the city as residents attacked the homes of politicians. “We want justice and the real culprit presented before us,” Zainab’s uncle, Gulam Rasul, told the Guardian. He said he feared that police, under pressure to resolve the matter and send protesters home, might shoot someone else. Mahira Khan, an actor and one of many public figures to have echoed the sense of anguish across Pakistan, demanded an example be made of the culprit that “scares anyone to even think of doing something like this again”. Kiran Naz, a newsreader on local television, delivered the afternoon bulletins with her eight-year-old daughter on her lap in a protest against violence against children. Zainab, the youngest of four children, was last seen on 4 January. She was apparently abducted outside a religious tuition centre where she was a student, 100 metres from her home Kasur police have since released a grainy CCTV image of the child walking hand-in-hand with her suspected killer, whose back is turned to the camera, a little further down the road. On Wednesday an autopsy revealed that Zainab was raped and strangled to death. According to local media, DNA collected from her body matched that from other recent cases in which the bodies of raped and murdered children aged five to eight were dumped in parks, drains and other public spots. Zainab’s mother and father were on a pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia at the time of her abduction. Arriving at Islamabad airport on Wednesday, Ameen Asari, Zainab’s father, said relatives had informed him that police “didn’t do anything” when Zainab was first reported missing. Instead they would “come, have food and leave” as “friends and family spent day and night looking for my daughter”, Asari alleged. “In Pakistan, security is for leaders and we are just common insects,” he said. Shehbaz Sharif, the chief minister of Punjab, visited the family to pay his respects on Thursday, promising to install CCTV cameras across the city. His administration also offered a reward of $90,000 (£66,000) to anyone who supplied information leading to an arrest. Khadim Hussain Rizvi, a firebrand cleric whose protest camp on an Islamabad motorway last month brought the capital to a standstill, led the funeral prayers for the two killed protesters. Residents in the city are angry about what they consider to have been years of government stonewalling in the face of rampant child abuse. In 2015 a paedophile gang in the nearby village of Hussain Khanwala was found to have abused up to 280 children over almost a decade. The gang forced children to perform sex acts on camera and sold the footage or used it to blackmail their families. A report by the National Commission for Human Rights found police guilty “not only of criminal negligence but connivance” and had deferred to gang members, who came from an influential local family. The scandal – the largest of its kind in Pakistani history – prompted parliament to outlaw the making of child pornography. But Ansar Sajjad, the regional coordinator of the anti-abuse charity Sahil, said the government had made “more promises [in terms of child protection] that were not fulfilled. That is why we are seeing so much problems.” Police have detained 10 suspects in the Zainab case in Kasur and said the investigation was ongoing."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2018/jan/12/scientists-criticise-trend-for-raw-meat-pet-food-after-analysis-finds-pathogens","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-12T06:30:22Z","webTitle":"Scientists criticise trend for raw meat pet food after analysis finds pathogens","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/jan/12/scientists-criticise-trend-for-raw-meat-pet-food-after-analysis-finds-pathogens","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2018/jan/12/scientists-criticise-trend-for-raw-meat-pet-food-after-analysis-finds-pathogens","fields":{"headline":"Scientists criticise trend for raw meat pet food after analysis finds pathogens","bodyText":"The trend for feeding dogs and cats raw meat has been criticised by scientists, who say it often contains bacteria and parasites that could pose dangers to both pets and their owners. A growing trend has seen pet owners plump for products such as meat, bones and organs which can be bought frozen and then thawed before being fed to dogs and cats. Among the ideas fuelling the movement is that these diets are more “natural” for pets, avoid problems of additives or contamination in processed food, and can help to tackle issues like skin problems and allergies. But researchers have pushed back, saying there is no evidence of such health benefits and that raw meat diets can cause dental and gut injuries as well as growth problems in pets – the latter a result of a deficiency in certain nutrients, a particular issue with home-prepared raw meat diets. The latest study flags a further concern: pathogens. “We see that more and more people are feeding [cats and dogs] this kind of product and we know that meat is infected with bacteria and parasites,” said Paul Overgaauw, co-author of the new research from Utrecht University in the Netherlands. With many studies focused on North America, Overgaauw said it was necessary to look at the situation in Europe. Writing in the journal Veterinary Record, the researchers describe how they analysed samples from 35 raw meat diet products across eight brands available in the Netherlands – a country where more than half of dog owners are thought to feed their dog, at least in part, with raw meat. After thawing the meat, the scientists looked for the presence of salmonella, listeria, E coli and antibiotic-resistant E coli as well as two types of parasites: species of Sarcocystis and Toxoplasma gondii – a parasite that, among its risks can cause problems in babies. The results reveal that 23% of the products tested contained a type of E coli that can cause renal failure in humans, while 80% of products across seven brands contained antibiotic-resistant E coli. Moreover, species of listeria were found in more than half of products, while salmonella species were found in 20%, species of sarcocystis in 23% and Toxoplasma gondii in 6%. Overgaauw noted that while the parasites are rendered harmless by freezing, bacteria are not, and that both posed a risk in home-prepared raw meat diets – not only to the pet but owners as well, either directly, as a result of cross-contamination of human food, or through exposure to pathogens shed by the animals. As well as calling for increased awareness, the authors suggest that raw meat diets should be labelled to highlight the risks. Daniel Chan, professor of emergency and critical care medicine and clinical nutrition at the Queen Mother Hospital for Animals, who was not involved in the research, said the new study added to a growing body of evidence on raw meat diets for pets. “We have known that there are risks associated with raw meat feed diets since the early 2000s, but this is the first [research] in Europe that has gone as far as to check commercially available frozen raw meat diets,” he said. Chan added that the study was important as it showed that buying commercial, frozen products rather using than home-prepared food, did not circumvent the dangers of pathogens. “The most concerning from our public health point of view is that they are finding multi-drug resistant bacteria in the food source,” he said. “If you buy mince from a supermarket you are likely to have bacteria, but because you cook it you are not at risk,” added Chan, pointing out that commercial raw meat diets were not designed to be cooked because it could break down supplements that have been added to them. Chan stressed that vets should discuss the risks of raw meat with owners, adding that it was not yet known what the best precautions were. “There hasn’t been any evidence to show [if] an animal has an allergy problem, that allergy is best treated with raw food products,” he added. “We don’t have any scientific evidence to support those claims.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/jan/20/the-wanderers-by-tim-pears-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-20T09:40:18Z","webTitle":"The Wanderers by Tim Pears review – a hypnotic paean to rural England","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jan/20/the-wanderers-by-tim-pears-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/jan/20/the-wanderers-by-tim-pears-review","fields":{"headline":"The Wanderers by Tim Pears review – a hypnotic paean to rural England","bodyText":"Last January The Horseman, the first instalment in Tim Pears’s West Country trilogy, introduced us to young Leo Sercombe, a Devon carter’s son with an exceptional affinity for horses. Set in the early 20th century, it is a gorgeously hypnotic paean to rural England, recreating in its myopic focus, languid pace and spare prose a way of being in the world that is all but unrecoverable to our hyperconnected modern minds. Unfolding slowly, it saves its punch for the final pages when Leo’s friendship with Lottie Prideaux, the local landowner’s daughter, at last brings disaster down upon him. The Wanderers continues the story of both Leo and Lottie, and with little in the way of conventional plot to drive the narrative, it is largely the question of whether they will find one another again, and how, and when, that pulls the reader along. That it does so, without question, is testament to Pears’s uncommon skill. It is no mean feat for a writer to eschew the tyranny of cliffhangers, coincidences and plot twists, instead trusting the reader to stay with them for the sheer pleasure of the writing and the interest in the world conjured up. It requires unwavering confidence; a consistency of pace and vision that must be there from the outset, and must not falter; and something withheld, however subtly, that creates an itch to turn the page. None of this is to say that nothing happens in The Wanderers. Having been driven from his home, Leo (usually referred to as “the boy”) lives for a time with Gypsies, then with a hermit, and works in a Dartmoor mine and on a farm. Lottie pursues a fascination for anatomy, endures her father’s remarriage, and unwillingly prepares herself to be sent to Germany to be “finished”. Slowly, incrementally, Pears sets the stage for the final book in the trilogy. In common with many contemporary novelists who are drawn to describe the relationship between men and landscape – for instance, Cynan Jones and Ben Myers – Pears seems to owe a debt to Cormac McCarthy. His writing slips between gorgeously sonorous Old Testament rhythms and clipped, verbless sentences (“He ate the meat and bread crouched upon the rock in his fine suit, and beheld the horse below and knew not whether he was blessed or cursed. Wealthy or poor. Free or bound. Joyful or desolate. In time he might discover”). Similar, too, is the almost anthropological detachment of the narrator and a wordless unsentimentality that nevertheless becomes highly emotionally charged as masculine vulnerability is revealed in spite of the characters’ best efforts. But McCarthy devotees need not be concerned about encountering some kind of pastiche in these pages: The Horseman and The Wanderers are much gentler and less elemental, and their bucolic, prewar, West Country world could not be more different from the harsh landscapes of the American west. It is the first world war, of course, that hangs over these books, and which Pears so deftly employs (and avoids). It’s impossible to set a book in 1912 without fencing in some way with its shadow, but he does not rush us towards it too precipitately. Instead, the coming conflict is foreshadowed here and there, but in the subtlest of ways: They each stood and watched whatever it was growing larger, approaching them through the air. Bearing down upon them, flying low and fast along the ridge, straight as arrows. Leo felt his knees weaken … the two mute swans rose and flew over them, a yard or two above their heads. The Wanderers is peppered with moments of awestruck wonder at the natural world, often related to birds, for Leo is a noticer, and in his own way, a thinker. Their effect is to remind us that, just a century ago, life for ordinary people was full of mysteries that could not be resolved by typing a keyword into Google. This meant that experience itself – thought, curiosity, imagination – was differently textured, something that many writers of books set in the past fail to take into account when they remove modern technology but ignore the phenomenological implications of a world without it. For instance, there were far fewer mirrors; news travelled slowly, if at all; many people journeyed no further than a few miles from their home, few expected to move faster than a horse could carry them. In both this book and its forerunner, the care that has been taken with historical research is obvious; but it is this deeper, subtler layer of reconstruction that sets these moving novels apart. • The Wanderers by Tim Pears (Bloomsbury, £16.99).

The loophole was an anomaly compared with similar schemes in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. It was also imposed against the wishes of corner shop owners at the time, with three small business trade associations opposing being exempted on the grounds it would be confusing for customers. “Its abolition is long overdue,” said Mary Creagh, chair of the environmental audit committee of MPs. The change will affect 3.4bn bags handed out at about 200,000 stores each year. Encouraging plastic-free supermarket aisles Wrap, the government’s waste action body, will explore whether supermarkets can introduce aisles where there is no plastic packaging and all the food is loose. The British Retail Consortium, which represents supermarkets, said its members were cutting plastic but that it was sometimes necessary to avoid food waste. It cited shrink-wrapped cucumbers, saying they last five times as long as ones without plastic. The eye-catching proposal is not something that campaigners have pushed hard for, though shoppers often protest on social media against egregious examples such as single bananas encased in plastic. All avoidable plastic waste should end by 2042, the government said. Creating more habitat for wildlife To arrest the decline in wildlife numbers in the face of intensive farming and land lost to housing and development, the environment department will investigate establishing 500,000 extra hectares of wildlife habitat. About 17,000 hectares of land is lost to new building each year. The measure is part of an effort to connect up large areas of nature to reflect the fact that animals need to move around the country – an increasingly difficult task with new roads and other developments. The environment secretary, Michael Gove, also promised to plant 11 million trees, which sounds like a lot but is the amount planted in England under government schemes during the coalition years. Experts at Kew said it was critical the right tree species were chosen to maximise benefits to wildlife and capturing carbon. Changing local planning rules to boost biodiversity Today, when a developer wants to build a new housing estate, supermarket or other building, local authorities have to ensure there is a net benefit to biodiversity – the variety of species in the area – when possible. The government said it will now consult on making this requirement mandatory. However, in the small print it also said it would consider “any exemptions that may be necessary.” It also said the measure should avoid increasing the burden on developers. New environmental watchdog Underpinning all the actions is the pledge of a “world-leading” and independent environmental watchdog to hold ministers’ feet to the fire. Gove has previously said that such a body would ensure standards on clean air, water and soil will be maintained post-Brexit. The 25-year plan today confirms that the government will consult on plans for the statutory body. It’s worth noting that the UK previously had an environment watchdog, known as the Sustainable Development Commission, before it was axed by the coalition in 2010 as part of the “bonfire of the quangos”. Deciding on new protected areas around the coast By July 2019, ministers will designate a third round of marine conservation zones, a network of areas in English seas designed to protect species from overfishing and other threats. Gove said he will ensure that: “these stretches of environmentally precious maritime heritage have the best possible protection.” The Marine Conservation Society said that while the timeline was welcome, it was concerned that the measures to enforce the areas lacked teeth. Previous governments have been criticised for watering down the number of zones. What’s not in it Gove mentions waste four times in his short foreword to the report, but there is no tangible plan or policy for how the government will move the dial on recycling. Recycling rates stalled in England in 2012 and in 2015 fell for the first time in more than a decade. Diverting waste away from landfill and into recycling centres largely falls on the shoulders of local authorities, which have been hit by austerity budget cuts. A 25p charge on disposable coffee cups, of which only one in 400 is recycled, is not mentioned in the environment plan. Campaigners also expressed disappointment at the absence of a bottle collection scheme, which existed in the UK decades ago. Louise Edge of Greenpeace said: “The most glaring gap is support for deposit return schemes. These are tried-and-tested ways to keep plastic bottles out of the environment and have strong public backing, yet there’s no trace of them in the government announcement.” Creagh said such a scheme was the only way to “deliver true behavioural change.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/jan/11/fast-eddie-clarke-motorhead-guitarist-rock-n-roll-revivalist","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-11T16:10:22Z","webTitle":"'Fast' Eddie Clarke: a rock'n'roll revivalist who made Motörhead motor","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jan/11/fast-eddie-clarke-motorhead-guitarist-rock-n-roll-revivalist","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/jan/11/fast-eddie-clarke-motorhead-guitarist-rock-n-roll-revivalist","fields":{"headline":"'Fast' Eddie Clarke: a rock'n'roll revivalist who made Motörhead motor","bodyText":"And then there were none. With the death of “Fast” Eddie Clarke, from pneumonia, at the age of 67, all three of the members of Motörhead’s greatest lineup have gone. And to be in the greatest lineup of Motörhead was to be part of one of hard rock’s most uncompromising and important bands. Though Lemmy came to personify Motörhead, without the presence of Clarke on guitar and Phil “Philthy Animal” Taylor on drums they wouldn’t have had half the impact. We know that, because the band that existed before they joined, with Lucas Fox on drums and Larry Wallis on guitar, sounded like a bubblegum group compared to the trio that lasted from 1976 until 1982. It was evident from their first single that Motörhead were not a conventional metal band. Though the sleeve depicted Taylor, Lemmy and Clarke looking like a biker gang on a day trip, and the A-side began with a snarl of a riff, it soon became apparent that the song was something different entirely. In fact, it was a Motown cover, of Holland-Dozier-Holland’s Leaving Here, a song Lemmy had picked up from his time on the 60s beat scene, when it had been covered by the Birds, Ronnie Wood’s pre-fame band. Lemmy always maintained that Motörhead were a rock’n’roll band, not a metal, punk or thrash band. That was probably a pointless protest, given metal’s embracing of Motörhead, but it was truest of that classic trio. Clarke wasn’t a widdly-woo guitarist: he could and did play absurdly fast, but rarely did he spew out dense clusters of single notes to prove his dexterity. Far more often his solos were compendiums of licks from the first age of rock’n’roll, distorted and bent to his own purposes, like some obscene transmogrification of James Burton, as if he had been given access to monstrous volume and told to do his worst. Nor was his lead playing confined to his solos: those rock’n’roll licks popped up all over the place – in the verses of Ace of Spades, the riffs of Bomber, Stone Dead Forever and so many more. You could hear debts to other guitarists, too – the riff from the 1978 single No Class is a straight steal from ZZ Top’s Tush, and Motörhead also covered that band’s Beer Drinkers and Hell Raisers. Nevertheless, Clarke wasn’t a thief: he was someone who knew how to synthesise styles to create something new, because Motörhead were like nothing that had come before. Rarely has any band contained four such distinct sounds, all of which combined into a whole that sounded utterly unforced: Lemmy’s polluted growl and bass-as-guitar, Taylor’s double-time kick drumming, and Clarke’s revision of the 50s. You would never have guessed what was coming from Clarke’s prior musical endeavours. Before Motörhead, he had played for Curtis Knight in the progressive blues band Zeus, writing the music for the track The Confession, which offered no hint as to what Clarke might do if allowed to cut loose. It took several years for him to find the right vehicle for his talents, and it proved to be the only suitable one. After he left Motörhead in May 1982 – for the marvellously dogmatic reason that he disapproved of them covering Stand By Your Man with Wendy O Williams of the Plasmatics – he formed his own band, Fastway. That was meant to be a collaboration with Pete Way of UFO, but Way left before a note had been recorded, which was perhaps for the best, given the pair’s enthusiastic approach to intoxication. Fastway proved to be a much less rambunctious affair than Clarke’s previous band. Whereas Motörhead had the advantage of finding themselves in the emergent punk and metal scene, Fastway were just another hard rock band seeking a foothold as that genre became commercially successful in the early 80s. The result is that “Fast” Eddie Clarke will always be associated with just six years of his life. But it was in those years that he helped redefine the parameters of rock music. That’s not so bad, is it?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"global-development/2018/jan/11/un-chief-urges-world-leaders-celebrate-migration-positive-antonio-guterres","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-11T18:36:57Z","webTitle":"UN chief urges world leaders to celebrate migration as a positive","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/jan/11/un-chief-urges-world-leaders-celebrate-migration-positive-antonio-guterres","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2018/jan/11/un-chief-urges-world-leaders-celebrate-migration-positive-antonio-guterres","fields":{"headline":"UN chief urges world leaders to celebrate migration as a positive","bodyText":"The UN secretary general is urging the governments of member states to open up more routes for migration and take steps to promote and safeguard foreign labour. António Guterres is calling for a collective shift to celebrate the international benefits of migration as part of an ambitious plan to create a more humane global strategy on the issue. In a report published on Thursday, Guterres said political leaders must take responsibility for ending the stigma surrounding migration and dispel alarmist misrepresentations of its effects. The report, entitled Making Migration Work for All, comes ahead of negotiations on a global compact on migration to be adopted by the UN general assembly later this year. In September 2016, the 193 members of the UN general assembly unanimously adopted a non-binding political agreement, the New York declaration, which pledged to uphold the human rights of refugees and migrants and recognised the need for a comprehensive approach to international migration. The declaration set in motion a series of consultations on how to deal with the needs of 258 million international migrants and is due to culminate in the formal adoption of a global strategy at a conference in Morocco in December this year. In an opinion piece for the Guardian, Guterres said the first international agreement of its kind was an “unprecedented opportunity for leaders to counter the pernicious myths surrounding migrants and lay out a common vision of how to make migration work for all our nations”. He said: “The best way to end the stigma of illegality and abuse around migrants is, in fact, for governments to put in place more legal pathways for migration, removing the incentives for individuals to break the rules, while better meeting the needs of their labour markets for foreign labour.” The report stresses that migrants contribute financially by paying taxes and injecting about 85% of their earnings into the economies of their host countries. The remaining 15% is sent back home. In 2017, an estimated $596bn (£440bn) was transferred in remittances globally, with $450bn going to poor countries – three times the amount of overseas development assistance. Governments that crack down on migrants unintentionally encourage illegal migration and harm their own economies, Guterres warned. Addressing an audience in New York, Guterres said: “Authorities that erect major obstacles to migration – or place severe restrictions on migrants’ work opportunities – inflict needless economic self-harm, as they impose barriers to having their labour needs met in an orderly and legal fashion.” He described migration as a “positive global phenomenon” that powers economic growth, reduces inequalities and connects diverse societies. The number of international migrants has grown by 49% since 2000 and now represents 3.4% of the world’s population, according to the UN. It is often assumed the majority of migrants are men, but 48% are women, who tend to send home a higher percentage of their earnings than men, said the report. While the vast majority of migrants move across borders legally and safely, Guterres highlighted the fate of the “thousands who die in doomed efforts to cross seas and deserts” as not just a human tragedy but “the most acute policy failure”. His report condemned the use of short-term, reactive security approaches and draconian border controls set up to detain migrants in transit. He recommended member states instead find “more credible pathways for migrants who do not qualify for international refugee protection but face insurmountable obstacles to return”. The International Organisation for Migration said it welcomed the report’s recommendations. A spokesman told The Guardian: “Most of the world’s international migrants already move through legal safe channels and it’s important to make this point, because you get a sense in the media and in politics that migration is something chaotic that involves flouting laws.“The fact the report is urging countries to make assessments on future labour needs is also important. The world by 2050 will need 50m additional healthcare workers because of the ageing population. “We have a youthful south and an ageing north, a big economy in the north and growing economy in the south – are you going to have the planning in place to bring up low-cost labour to take care of your elderly? “You will learn to love those people that are willing to do that work, so let’s plan for that day instead of focusing on the fact they speak a different language.” The report precedes UN talks on the global response to migration, which have been controversially boycotted by the US. The US ambassador to the UN, Nikki Hayley, informed Guterres in December that Donald Trump was not willing to continue US commitment to the UN global impact on migration. The Trump administration is threatening to deport thousands of immigrants who came to the US illegally as children and were allowed to stay under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals programme, which Trump has since scrapped."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/2018/jan/11/corrections-and-clarifications","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-11T21:00:10Z","webTitle":"Corrections and clarifications","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/jan/11/corrections-and-clarifications","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2018/jan/11/corrections-and-clarifications","fields":{"headline":"Corrections and clarifications","bodyText":"• The caption to an image of the reshuffled cabinet table identified Andrea Leadsom as leader of the House of Commons, but didn’t make clear that although she attends cabinet meetings, Leadsom is not a member of the cabinet (10 January, page 9). • The clue for 6 down in Monday’s crossword, “???

Charles Hendry, a Conservative politician and former energy minister, enthusiastically supported the scheme a year ago as a source of clean power and UK jobs. Since then, the government has not indicated whether it wants to move ahead with the project, and ministers were recently reported to have gone cold on it. But Hendry told the Guardian he was still hopeful that Swansea would receive backing, because the plan would have been ruled out before now if it was not being given serious consideration. “I remain optimistic that government will decide to move ahead, especially in light of [this week’s] announcement from the Welsh government,” he told the Guardian. On Wednesday it was revealed that Carwyn Jones, first minister of Wales, had written to prime minister Theresa May offering “substantial” investment in the form of a loan or equity stake to help the lagoon move forward. “This investment could help to reduce the cost of capital for the project and reduce the subsidy requirement over the lifetime of any contract for difference,” he said. The last offer tabled by the Tidal Lagoon Power company was £89.90 per megawatt hour over 90 years, though Hendry prefers a 60-year timescale. The Welsh offer should bring the number down, but it could still appear expensive compared to rival low-carbon sources of power. New offshore windfarms to be built in 2022-23 have won contract for difference subsidies of £57.50 per MWh over 15 years. EDF Energy was awarded £92.50 per MWh over 35 years for Hinkley Point C, the nuclear power station due online by 2025. Business secretary Greg Clark has refused to be drawn on whether he will back the lagoon, which could be the first of several. Government sources insist a decision has not been taken either way yet. Hendry said that the delays were understandable and should not be mistaken for officials turning lukewarm on the scheme. “I was always clear that government would require some time to consider my recommendations. With an election and ministerial changes that process was inevitably going to take longer,” he said. Swansea city council has sent birthday cards to May, Clark and the Welsh secretary to remind them it is one year since Hendry recommended supporting the lagoon. Rob Stewart, the council leader, said: “Post-Brexit, this is exactly the kind of innovative project the UK government should be wholeheartedly backing because it will lead to a new global industry in the UK that will benefit British workers and British businesses.” There have also been warnings that a thousand jobs could be lost in the Midlands if the lagoon does not go ahead at GE plants in Stafford and Rugby, which had been earmarked to make the lagoon’s underwater turbines. The government said a response to the Hendry review would be published in due course. A spokesperson said: “We want to ensure that the UK has a diverse, secure and affordable energy mix but it must provide value for consumers.” Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/ng-interactive/2018/mar/26/did-lana-del-rey-plagiarise-radiohead-note-by-note-analysis","type":"interactive","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-26T15:30:28Z","webTitle":"Did Lana Del Rey plagiarise Radiohead?

A note-by-note analysis","bodyText":"“Lana Del Radiohead”, the internet scoffed recently, after Lana Del Rey’s song Get Free was found to have more than a passing similarity to Radiohead’s breakthrough hit Creep. It was all there: the moody chord changes, the even moodier, downward-turning melody. Radiohead noticed, and requested that they be added to the song’s credits – a dispute that, according to Del Rey, has been brought to an end. Creep had, of course, been subject to its own plagiarism dispute in the 1990s, with the songwriters Albert Hammond and Mike Hazlewood added to the credits thanks to a similarity with the hit song they wrote for the Hollies, The Air That I Breathe. So how similar are Get Free and Creep, and did Radiohead have a legitimate complaint? The Guardian spoke to a professional composer, Ed Newton-Rex, to analyse the pair of songs. The chords heard in Creep are rare in pop music He starts his analysis by pointing out that the two songs use the same sequence of chords to accompany the melody throughout the track. While this is not unusual in the industry – some chord progressions appear in hundreds of songs – the chords heard in Creep and Get Free are relatively rare in pop music. According to online database Hooktheory, only four out of 17,000 popular hits of the last decades have used this specific sequence. Furthermore, the songs in question employ those four chords in exactly the same fashion, repeating them throughout verse and chorus with no differences in rhythm whatsoever. The melodies bear an uncanny resemblance Many listeners have also claimed that the parallels between the two songs are not limited to the chords. Newton-Rex agrees, noting “the melody is where the similarities become really apparent”. When musicologists assess a plagiarism claim, they will often split the melody of each song into a number of shorter phrases to compare them one by one. In the case of Get Free, many of the phrases found in the verse and chorus use exactly the same notes as their counterparts in Creep, often in the same order. In other places, the exact set of notes or their order might differ, but the general outline or “contour” of both melodies remains the same. “When you analyse [the phrases] one by one, you find a pretty astonishing degree of similarity,” Newton-Rex says. However strong they may be, the parallels between the two songs don’t necessarily imply that Del Rey intentionally copied Radiohead’s work. Del Rey herself said: “I know my song wasn’t inspired by Creep.” Newton-Rex imagines the similarities in Get Free are unintentional, despite calling the two pieces “the most obviously similar pair of songs I’ve heard”. It’s not the first case of its kind The “Lana Del Radiohead” case is far from isolated. In 2017, Ed Sheeran settled a claim over his hit Photograph after similarities to the Matt Cardle song Amazing were found, and he quietly added the songwriters of TLC’s No Scrubs to the credits of his hit Shape of You. Two years earlier, the same lawyer representing the songwriters of Amazing had won a $7.4m (£5.1m) settlement against Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams for the estate of the late soul singer Marvin Gaye – last week the US court of appeal refused a new trial in the case.

On its cover was an effortfully moody-looking Marco Pierre White, smoking a fag and wearing a black trilby; inside were the chefs Nobuyuki Matsuhisa (“Nobu - the world’s sexiest restaurant”) and Ruth Rogers (“One of the most exciting moments of the year is the arrival of the first porcini”), and the actor Christopher Walken (“My brothers and I worked in our father’s bakery: I was the guy who put the jelly in the doughnuts”). Introducing the magazine to readers, Nigel Slater noted that the public’s interest in food-related matters had never been greater. “I am sure you will agree the timing is perfect,” he wrote, promising OFM writers would both debate the important issues of the day and sing the sensual praises of cooking. To pick up this magazine now is to feel suddenly vertiginous, the steep slopes of time falling away all around you. O tempora o mores! as Cicero observed. Things change, and yet they change not at all. The formerly Michelin-starred White, then still clinging to his bad-boy pomp, is best known these days for his association with Knorr stock cubes, while Nobu is just another slick but uninspiring global chain, as good (or bad) in Doha and Riyadh as in Miami and Beverley Hills. Ruth Rogers, on the other hand, sails blithely on – last October, she published River Cafe 30, a collection of recipes marking three decades of cooking at her influential but wildly expensive west London restaurant – as does Tamarind of Mayfair, whose Punjabi dishes the actor Meera Syal singled out for praise in the same issue. Still other names have moved from what was then relative obscurity to relative fame (we were good pickers). Stephen Harris, whose column deconstructing such dodgy mainstays of the local menu as “seafood avocado” also appeared in the first OFM, is now a revered chef-patron, his pub, The Sportsman in Seasalter, Kent, having held a Michelin star since 2008. It’s certainly true that in 2001, interest in food was unprecedentedly high. Jamie Oliver was already famous; Nigella Lawson had already published How To Be A Domestic Goddess; in the capital, restaurants were, for better or worse, the new nightclubs, or at least the new red carpets, their doors haunted by paparazzi, their maître d’s nominally friends to the famous (I joined the Observer in November of the same year, and remember all too well the way splashy new places seemed to open almost every day on a wave of sponsored champagne; I still shudder to remember some of the hangovers). But surely no one could have predicted that our fascination with all things culinary would grow exponentially, that it would ultimately devour both the bestseller lists and the TV schedules, and young people would aspire to careers in kitchens as they never had before (on MasterChef, revived by the BBC in 2005 after a four-year hiatus, the contestants seem to grow ever more youthful – and ever more competent). Nobu and its ilk were undoubtedly fashionable back in the day, but they were not hip. The wilder shores of our major cities had then yet to be colonised by the cool (and frequently bearded) purveyors of the artisanal and the authentic. Our timing, though: it was uncannily good. In the months after the arrival of OFM, restaurant culture shifted in a number of enduringly significant ways. In 2002, Simon Rogan opened L’Enclume in Cartmel, Cumbria; the following year, René Redzepi opened Noma in Copenhagen, Denmark. With their emphasis on fresh, local food, and particularly on foraged items – L’Enclume went on to have a full-time forager – both blazed a trail; though their worlds seemed rarified from the outside, we have them to thank, at least in part, for the fact that supermarkets now stock such things as samphire, unlikely mushrooms and edible flowers. It was in 2002, also, that Jamie Oliver opened his first restaurant, Fifteen, which began as a way to bring the young unemployed into the restaurant trade; in the years since, it has trained some 500 apprentices worldwide, among them Tim Siadatan, the chef-patron of Trullo, in Islington, north London, and Padella, in Borough Market. Siadatan belongs to that inspirational new generation of younger chefs who have changed the way people think about restaurant work (and, in his case, about pasta, too). The Wapping Project, a gallery housed in a listed former hydraulic power station in London’s East End, sadly closed in 2014, and with it, its fantastic restaurant, Wapping Food. But its influence cannot, I think, be overstated. When its cavernous spaces opened to the public in 2001, people understood in a glance that a restaurant could be situated almost anywhere: the more excitingly unusual the venue, the better (also, that such enterprises could be used to cross-subsidise community and arts ventures). Cut to 2017, where a kitchen can thrive everywhere from a Victorian lavatory (Attendant, in Fitzrovia, where the original Doulton &amp; Co porcelain urinals are still in place) to a greenhouse (the lush Petersham Nurseries in Richmond, Surrey). I discern shades of both Fifteen and Wapping Food in the brilliant Clink restaurants, run as part of a countrywide programme to rehabilitate prisoners, of which there are now four. Were there pop-ups and supper clubs in 2001? I don’t believe there were; nor were chef residencies and consultancies so much of a thing. Both are trends that seem ostensibly to be great for the customer, providing the chance to try something, or someone, new. In reality, however, what they mostly reflect is the fact that during the last 15 years, rents in our larger cities, and particularly in the capital, have become prohibitive. Think – to take just one example – of Racine in Knightsbridge, which opened not long after OFM launched. When it closed in 2015, its chef-patron Henry Harris gave as his reason both its rent and the radically changed nature of the neighbourhood, locals having been pushed out by non-doms who visit only rarely. Harris is now chef-director at a small group of London pubs that includes the Truscott Arms in Maida Vale, which itself closed in 2016 thanks to a rent rise; last year, he admitted he had struggled to find a London site for a new restaurant of his own. Celebrity customers aside, in 2001, restaurant culture in general was less performative than now; before smartphones and Instagram, there wasn’t much to be done with a pretty plate save for to eat its contents. It was also perhaps a little less macho, for all that the likes of Ramsay, White and Tom Aikens of Pied a Terre (who once reportedly branded an employee with a hot palette knife) were famed for their hot tempers and foul language. The “I’m-all-about-knife-skills-and-barbecue-pits” vibe had yet to lift off; impossible to imagine, then, that meat would become such a fetish, that Hawksmoor, founded in 2006 in Spitalfields by Will Beckett and Huw Gott, would shift so many £29 steaks it would one day open a branch in Manchester. (The smart, or smart-ish, chain is another notable development of the last decade, whether we are talking Burger &amp; Lobster or Wahaca, the Mexican street-food joints co-founded by the MasterChef winner Thomasina Miers – which only goes to prove that those with the cash for a certain kind of casual midweek supper are frequently the most conservative diners of all.) Street food, now turned out with such ubiquitous dash by hot-browed men and women in urban markets, was in 2001 still mostly the nostalgic preserve of people who’d had a gap year. Away from restaurants, it’s possible the landscape has changed even more dramatically. In 2001, tracking down pomegranate molasses, kimchi and ras-el-hanout (all now stocked by Sainsbury’s) was often the work of several days; in 2018, supermarkets are on a mission to outdo each other when it comes to unusual and hard-to-find stuff (in the old days, they just responded to whatever new ingredient Delia Smith had in her latest book). But the advent of austerity has brought with it an emphasis on value, too, ever more of us making our way to Lidl and Aldi. As I write, the two chains have in play 90 planning applications for new supermarkets. Meanwhile, the big four – Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Asda and Morrisons – have filed a grand total of just 11 as they continue to struggle with property costs and the numbers of customers shopping online. For them, smaller convenience stores are now the order of the day (stores that have, of course, brought with them their own problems, from their detrimental effect on local businesses to the congestion caused by outsized lorries on too-small streets). In 2001, I had never shopped for food on the internet. Not once. By 2004, that had changed forever. Ever since, my basics have been delivered, while specialist shops – real ones, as opposed to virtual – have picked up the slack, something that may go some way to explaining (I can’t be alone) the small but cheering revival, in some towns, of butchers, fishmongers and greengrocers. The internet’s impact on takeaways has been slower to take effect, but thanks to recent publicity most of us are now all too painfully aware of how increased demand has encouraged courier services such as Deliveroo to establish so-called “dark kitchens” in prefabricated structures for restaurants that want to expand their business (in London, this includes the Thai chain Busaba Eathai, and the Franco Manca pizza parlours) without opening more expensive high-street premises. You could write a PhD thesis about trends in food over the last 15 years, and what each one signified at the time: the moment when everyone went mad for the cronut; the year when Korean food (or Nigerian, or Moroccan) was supposed to be the next big thing. Yotam Ottolenghi’s influence over recipe culture – a handful of pomegranate seeds here, a sprinkling of za’atar there – seems to me to be disproportionally vast; and one wonders what Japanese people make of the ersatz supermarket sushi British office workers buy in their hundreds of thousands every lunchtime (amazing to think that I had never eaten sushi until 1993, when I went to Richard Hills’s restaurant, Tokyo Diner, in Soho, soon after it first opened). Nevertheless, two trends do stand out. The first is baking, our obsession with. For this, we may blame (or praise) The Great British Bake Off, born in 2010 and still adored in spite of its move from the BBC to Channel 4. But in truth, its roots go back further: Tarek Malouf opened the first Hummingbird Bakery in west London in 2004, selling the sickly American-style cupcakes and pies that have since become ubiquitous in our high streets; and before him, of course, there was Nigella Lawson in domestic goddess mode (her luscious baking book was first published in 2000). Is our new fanaticism in the matter of butter icing and choux pastry a good thing? Mostly, I think it is (yeah, yeah: I know sugar is bad). If the success of, say, Justin Gellatly’s Bread Ahead bakery is one of its by-products, then I’m all for it (Gellatly, formerly the pastry chef at St John, is as famed for his sourdough as for his doughnuts). If bad bread is on the run, even better. It’s a trend, too, that can genuinely be said to be national. The Forge Bakehouse in Sheffield, Loaf in Birmingham, the Exploding Bakery in Exeter: all are brilliant examples of the new generation. The second, paradoxically and much less happily, is so-called clean eating – words I tremble even to type. When did this dumb fad begin? I’m tempted to say “who cares?”, but if you must know, its roots lie in the US, where the movement to cut out processed foods from diets – and then, by turns, sugar, lactose and gluten – first took hold in the early 2000s. In the UK, its leading proponents have been the likes of Ella Mills (née Woodward, aka Deliciously Ella) and the Hemsley sisters, and though Mills, for one, has begun to tone down her message just lately, clean eating’s popularity shows little sign of waning, for all that most of the claims made for it are bunkum. Joyless though it is, its benefit has been the increased availability, for people who really do have coeliac disease, of a wider range of gluten-free products. How we explain its popularity, of course, is a trickier question. I regard it as a strict weight-loss programme in a distractingly pretty frock and, perhaps, as another byproduct of the neuroticism in the matter of certain foods that has come as a result of our growing distance from both farming and our kitchens. It’s a profound irony that our growing passion for cookery books and TV shows has had relatively little effect on the ability and inclination of the majority to cook at home. What lies ahead? Brexit changes everything. It may be that we will be too worried about costs and supply to waste time worrying about whether quinoa is a good alternative to potatoes; it may be that suddenly, potatoes will do after all. Britain produces only 54% of what it eats – a statistic that leaves us vulnerable to fluctuating markets after we leave the EU; supplies and prices are likely to be at their most volatile since the war. More than a quarter of those working in food manufacturing are, moreover, from other EU countries. Who will pick our crops? Who will work in our factories? This remains to be seen. Either way, food is set to become more expensive (it already is more expensive). We will have to grow more, and we will certainly care more about waste (which won’t be a bad thing). Beyond this, who can say? Doubtless scientists’ experiments with meat substitutes will improve to the degree that we will eventually become willing to eat them. My guess, though, is that for the next few years at least British menus will be increasingly nostalgia-tinted, and that irrespective of the melancholic underlying reasons for this, they will be (she dreams of arctic rolls) really quite tasty."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"money/2018/jan/13/landlords-housing-benefit","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-13T07:00:51Z","webTitle":"Gangs of rogue landlords making millions out of housing benefits","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/jan/13/landlords-housing-benefit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2018/jan/13/landlords-housing-benefit","fields":{"headline":"Rogue landlords making millions out of housing benefits","bodyText":"Highly organised gangs of rogue landlords are making millions every year out of the housing benefit system by enticing desperate local authorities to place single homeless people in micro-flats in shoddily converted and dangerous former family homes. Three-bed houses, where the maximum weekly housing benefit for flat-sharers is under £100 a person, are being converted into as many as six tiny self-contained studios – as little as 10 sq m in size. Each then qualifies for housing benefit of £181 a week, enabling a landlord to squeeze £56,000 a year in rent from a property on London’s fringes, all paid from public funds. The £56,000 compares with the typical £6,200 annual rent on a three-bed council house. A previously unpublished government report into a £700,000 project to tackle the scam, released this week under freedom of information laws, shows that councils are struggling to contain the spread of the “lockdown” model, which has taken hold in at least 12 London boroughs since 2015. It warns of “well organised but unscrupulous landlords” profiting despite some councils – including Hackney, Bexley and Greenwich – launching prosecutions, raids and prohibition orders. “Given available resources and the potential number of ‘rogue landlord’ properties, regulatory activity on its own would not solve the problem as long as the market was so heavily weighted to favour the supplier and the housing benefit rules allowed for high payments on such small conversions,” says the report. “Investors typically buy a three-bedroom house and convert it into six rooms, each with basic cooking facilities, in order to claim the maximum housing benefit rate. “The lettings model was also being actively promoted as an investment opportunity amongst both existing landlords and, possibly, more widely. This has contributed to the strong growth of conversions using the model,” it says. The report – obtained by local housing campaigner, Jon Knowles, after he appealed to the Information Commissioner – reveals “lockdown landlords” are exploiting planning loopholes created by the Conservative-led government in 2010. “The basic premise […] was to convert houses into a large number of very small ‘self-contained’ units, each containing basic cooking facilities, but to also have a shared kitchen so as to be able to claim, for planning permission purposes, that the house was a house in multiple occupation and fell within permitted development rules,” it says. Councils can apply to place restrictions on these rights but the report says only one councils in the project has managed to do so. The converted flats, frequently approved by the landlord’s own private building control firms and electricians, are offered to homelessness services across the capital in need of rentals. “The landlords often target local authority services which are looking for units when they accept either a full, or interim, homelessness duty for an individual. The landlords are aware that such individuals will be entitled to housing benefit, and are also aware how difficult it is for such services to locate suitable units,” it states. Services from different areas regularly compete for the same properties, which can lead to “uncoordinated placements and clashes between the residents”. One incident resulted in a stabbing, and a woman living in one of these flats has been assaulted by other tenants. Checks by planning and environmental health officers are rarely carried out because homeless services are under such pressure to find rooms immediately. “It was recognised that, with the shortage of units and the frequent emergency need for placements, the priority would often be to just get a person into some accommodation for the night.” Housing inspectors found the micro-flats were often in very poor condition with inadequate fire safety provision and dangerously overloaded electrics and plumbing systems. Neighbours complained of anti-social behaviour and feeling unsafe when there were influxes of often single men, with substance abuse and mental health problems . Councils are reluctant to take a hard line because they fear it could make people homeless: “There were clear concerns about the model becoming too widespread and it was felt that changes did need to be made in order to contain its growth. However, it was accepted that these could not be wholly retrospective otherwise it would create a spike in homelessness.” Lambeth council, whose officers coordinated the research project, says landlords using the model were still operating in the capital and that family houses were being divided up into micro-flats all the time. “They are always being created to meet the demand for the lack of social and affordable housing,” it says. Knowles fought to get the report released after he discovered a string of “lockdown properties” in his neighbourhood of Hanworth, west London. “I simply could not believe that you would be allowed to cram six bedsits into a former two-bed home,” he says. Retired builder Gary Warren found himself sofa-surfing because he could not afford a deposit on a flat in west London. He thought his luck had changed when he found a letting company that accepted people over 35 and claiming benefits. “I stayed with a few friends and then I found out about this company that rents flats out without a deposit if you are on benefits,” he says. A letting agent showed him what they called a flat in Hanworth but it was actually a tiny room measuring just 10 sq m, including the toilet. He took it because he “had no deposit to put down on a private flat”. Gary, who is 63, pays £980 for his room, which is mostly covered by his housing benefit. The people in the four other flats are charged the same, which potentially earns the company £3,920 a month in rent. “The length of my bed is the width of the room. I’ve got a wardrobe and fridge. So I have about 10ft by 3ft of space – it’s a corridor,” he says. “There’s no room for a chair, so I lay down all day. I don’t see anyone, so I don’t get any stimulation – I’m just stuck in this room.” Water pours down the walls when it rains because the flat roof above him leaks. It got so bad over Christmas that the council moved him to a B&amp;B as the room was uninhabitable. But Gary – who has had a stroke and is in the early stages of dementia – has carried on paying the rent because he needs somewhere to live. “It is robbery,” he says. “They are ripping off the council. Why are they letting it go on?” •This article was amended on Sunday 14 January 2018 to correct the name of Mark Warren."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"books/2018/jan/12/davos-bill-gates-mark-zuckerberg-what-to-read","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-12T06:00:22Z","webTitle":"Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg's guide on what to read at Davos","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jan/12/davos-bill-gates-mark-zuckerberg-what-to-read","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/jan/12/davos-bill-gates-mark-zuckerberg-what-to-read","fields":{"headline":"Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg's guide on what to read at Davos","bodyText":"As the world’s rich and powerful pack their suitcases for the World Economic Forum in Davos later this month, they might throw in a book. But it’s unlikely to be an airport thriller. WEF, which has organised the gathering of global leaders and business executives in the Swiss alpine town since 1971, has released a list of books recommended by two Davos regulars who also happen to be proud bookworms: Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg. If they’re fans of EL James, John Grisham or JK Rowling they’re not shouting about it. In fact the list is light on fiction and heavy on dense non-fiction but it does include a sci-fi choice: The Three-Body Problem by Chinese writer Liu Cixin. Gates and Zuckerberg, who are the 2nd and 4th richest people in the world, have credited reading as key to their success. Gates, who amassed a $92bn (£68bn) fortune largely from Microsoft which he co-founded in 1975, reads for at least an hour every night and gets through books at the rate of one a week. Zuckerberg, who is worth $77bn 13 years after he started Facebook in his Harvard University dorm room, isn’t as speedy a reader as Gates but his New Year resolution in 2015 was to read at least one book every fortnight. They both agree that Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence has Declined – an 800-page tome by Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker is a must-read. The book argues that while it may feel like the world has become more dangerous, a longer look over human history shows violence is on the wane. It jumped to the top of Amazon’s book charts when Gates first tweeted that it was “the most inspiring book I’ve ever read”. “[Pinker] shows how the world is getting better. Sounds crazy, but it’s true. This is the most peaceful time in human history,” Gates said. “That matters because if you think the world is getting better, you want to spread the progress to more people and places. It doesn’t mean you ignore the serious problems we face. It just means you believe they can be solved.” Gates, in a review posted on his own blog, said Pinker’s book was “one of the most important books I’ve read – not just this year, but ever”. Zuckerberg picked it for his Facebook book club, which turned the titles it picked into major bestsellers. “It’s a timely book about how and why violence has steadily decreased throughout our history, and how we can continue this trend,” he said. The book may be helpful reading for the 2,500 world leaders, business executives and charity bosses attending the WEF which this yearcarries the theme of “creating a shared future in a fractured world”. Among the approximately 40 world leaders attending the summit this year is Donald Trump, who will be the first serving US president to go to Davos since Bill Clinton in 2000. Trump is not known to be a reader of long books. When asked in a TV interview which was the last book he read Trump replied: “I read passages, I read areas, chapters, I don’t have the time.” Gates also recommends The Gene: An Intimate History by Siddhartha Mukherjee, an oncologist and graduate of Oxford, Harvard and Stanford. “Mukherjee wrote this book for a lay audience, because he knows that the new genome technologies are at the cusp of affecting us all in profound ways,” Gates said. Zuckerberg recommends Liu’s The Three-Body Problem as a “fun break” from the weighty economics and social science books he included on the list. The book is set during Chairman Mao’s cultural revolution, and opens with an alien race invading Earth after the Chinese government covertly sent signals into space. James Daunt, the founder of Daunt books and managing director of Waterstone’s, said: “It is very pleasing to learn that even the very greatest of geeks love their science fiction. Three Body Problem has been a great success – and helped to broaden the appeal of science fiction – since Barack Obama sang its praises [last January]. Daunt said the list included some of “the best serious non-fiction of the last few years”. “[Yuval Noah Harari’s] Sapiens was the best-selling paperback last year at Waterstones and you would expect The Gene, Better Angels and [Henry Kissinger’s] World Order to be among the mainstays of every table of serious non-fiction in our shops.” Elif Şhafak, a judge of the panel for the Man Booker international prize last year, said the WEF, Gates and Zuckerberg had sent a “very positive, constructive message” by releasing the list. “In a world where sadly many politicians clearly do not read, many business and social community leaders clearly do not read, and a world where telling the truth has become increasingly difficult, it is important to speak in support of books, freedom of speech, knowledge and imagination,” she said. “However, my concern is, even though the list is beautifully diverse and eclectic in other ways, women writers are almost nonexistent here and why is that? I sincerely hope they will be reading more women writers in the new year.” • Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2018/jan/16/how-we-made-studio-54-ian-schrager","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-16T07:00:18Z","webTitle":"Ian Schrager: how we made Studio 54","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jan/16/how-we-made-studio-54-ian-schrager","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/jan/16/how-we-made-studio-54-ian-schrager","fields":{"headline":"Ian Schrager: how we made Studio 54","bodyText":"Ian Schrager, founder New York was on the verge of bankruptcy in the mid-1970s. Danger was in the air, people were getting mugged, but it was also a creative, bohemian time. You could really feel the energy in the gay clubs: there were frantic, intense, sweating bodies everywhere. Straight people hadn’t yet learned to let it all hang out. I was a lawyer and my friend Steve Rubell was in the restaurant business. In bad times, people look for escapism, so I suggested starting a club. We saw an old TV studio in the west side of Manhattan, which was like Lebanon at the time – unsafe to walk. But it felt right. We persuaded a store owner called Jack Dushey to lend us $400,000 to convert the building and put lighting in, then we put a team together and it all instantly took off. Right from the opening night, it was like holding on to a lightning bolt or walking into Disney World. The lighting and the sets were an assault on the senses. People danced with wild abandon. The door policy was controversial, but we wanted a mix of rich, poor, gay, straight, old and young, because when you have that alchemy, magic happens. Somebody topless could dance with a woman in a ballgown and a tiara. Over the next few years, every celebrity or big shot came to Studio 54. But nobody pestered anyone for an autograph, so they could be themselves. Andy Warhol was shy and just liked to watch. Mick Jagger was the same as he was on stage and Diana Ross was an amazing dancer. I never saw Donald Trump dance, though. He was a serious guy. We were always trying to wow our customers. We dumped four tons of glitter on the dancefloor. When Bianca Jagger jumped on a white horse, the photo went all over the world, but those moments only ever lasted a few minutes because we didn’t want to stop the party. There was a huge “man in the moon” hanging over the dancefloor, who lit up whenever a giant spoon rose up to his nose. But this was more about being arrogant and subversive than celebrating drugs. Studio 54 was no more hedonistic than any other place. I’m lucky to have survived it. Success made us do stupid things, like fighting the US government. After Steve said, “Only the mafia make more money”, Internal Revenue were all over us. It’s a myth that we had cash hidden all over the club. It was in the back of cars. Michael Overington, manager I started as a $3-an-hour cleaner but I made myself invaluable and ended up manager. I kept the place going while Ian and Steve were in jail for 13 months [for tax evasion]. I’d visit them, take in dimes for their phone calls, tell them what was happening in the club. I was the sensible guy who’d crack the whip and get the bartenders and cloakroom girls in position. Every night, we played Earth, Wind and Fire to get the staff in the zone. There was a lot of cocaine back then and the music was energising, so people would speed up and dance till 4am. Visiting artists loved it when we played their records. Madonna lip-synced to a tape. Diana Ross sang along to her songs in the DJ booth. Because it was a big space with an opening out on to the street, we could bring cars, furniture or animals in, to create different environments every night. At $20 or $30 admission, the door take alone would pay for the scenery, actors and costumes for drag parties and such. The neighbours thought we were crazy. Once, for a Grease party, we brought a load of 1950s convertibles in and the fire department told me to take the gasoline out of them. So we pumped it into the sewers. You could smell it for two blocks. I said: “Well, you told me to get the gas out.” I recently found an old letter from the health department that said: “You are in violation of the regulations by having a zebra in the club.” The animals would take dumps on the dancefloor. And one New Year’s Eve, we had a 200ft ice wall which turned the club into a giant blue igloo. I piled the ice out on to the sidewalk the next morning – it was 6ft high and 20ft long. This drunk guy came along with his eyes wide open and said: “Man, they must serve some big drinks in there.” Ian Schrager’s book Studio 54 is published by Rizzoli International.

I pictured teams of researchers putting heads together to solve real-world problems, collaborating on new discoveries.

Even then, I thought optimistically that our shared experiences of unsuccessful applications might bond us together. But a recent experience online has confirmed for me that, actually, it’s a dog-eat-dog world out there. Earlier this year, I published a book based on my research but aimed at the general reader to supplement my income from academic work. A few months after publication, I was idly scrolling through the Facebook page for an academic group I’m a member of, and caught sight of my name on a new post. It was from a young academic researcher, publicly proclaiming that my book was “useless”. Another researcher responded, and what started as an attack based on my book’s lack of endnotes – which they viewed as unacademic – descended into a personal attack on me. Yet nobody actually appeared to have read my book. There were pages of endnotes, all of which the people posting had completely missed. This hadn’t stopped them from airing their perceived grievances on a public forum. It was their aggression that particularly struck me, and the increasingly bullying nature of posts that appeared – from their profile photos – to have been written by younger researchers. Academic debate is vital: at conferences and symposia, seasoned academics discuss ideas with junior colleagues. The questions after conference papers can be incredibly useful means of identifying flaws in your arguments, or of finding ways to strengthen what you want to say. But debates need to be based on factual truth and reasoned assessment, rather than a desire to be heard loudest. This applies equally to social media posts in academic groups online. These are an even more public forum than conferences. Younger academics, who may be lulled into a false sense of security on the social media channels they use daily, should be careful about the arguments they make. You may attract an audience, and get people agreeing with you, but you also run the risk of being exposed for misunderstanding something – including among senior colleagues. So why does it feel, in spite of this, like some researchers rush to comment on colleagues’ work through Facebook and Twitter posts, before they’ve fully read and reflected on it? It strikes me that this may be partly down to the climate of professional insecurity in academia, and the competitive attitude this fosters. I’ve also observed on these channels that there can be a holier-than-thou snootiness about the type of work that researchers turn to to help make ends meet, even though it’s well known that many of us struggle financially. In my case, colleagues sought to tear apart a book written for the general reader as though it were an academic paper. Similarly, I know two young researchers who have used self-promotion and interesting research to gain paid media work while others of a similar age and background have dismissed their academic credentials in a manner reminiscent of sour grapes. We’ve all heard stories about seasoned academics reducing a postgrad to tears with some withering retort at conferences. In reality, I know few people this has happened to. The established academics tend, from my personal experience, to be supportive of the younger or newer researchers. It is a shame that some of their more junior colleagues cannot respond in kind. If my internet trolls do manage to get a secure academic post, I hope they learn to encourage others to thrive, not wither. Collaboration and professional support help the academic world as a whole, but jealousy and a sense of entitlement will hinder it.

There is something about going camping that is funny. Someone has to be really organised and no one really wants to go; it’s actually a nightmare. The funniest film I’ve ever seen The One and Only Herb McGwyer Plays Wallis Island is the funniest film I’ve seen. I absolutely love it. If I was in charge of Oscars, I’d give one to Tim Key. The funniest heckle I’ve ever had I was doing a preview to a massive audience of one very drunk couple and the barman. The woman absolutely shouted: “WE CAN SEE THAT YOU ARE TRYING VERY HARD!” The funniest item of clothing I’ve ever owned I have a massive papier-mache egg costume and it gets a lot of attention on the tube. Probably because it’s a metre wide and a metre tall. Once someone kicked it and I ran over and screamed: “DON’T DO THAT!” in quite a feral way because it’s a bit fragile and took two months to make. The funniest meal I’ve ever eaten Once I cooked pasta – accidentally – for four hours. My mum did that stressful thing she does where she laughs very, very hard then bursts into tears and everyone feels confused. Was it funny or sad? Not sure. The funniest hairstyle I’ve ever had It’s not strictly my own hair but I had to play Mick Quinn from Supergrass once and I had quite a special bowl-cut wig. I thought it would be funny if he also had one very big testicle. When the actual Mick Quinn came to watch the show it was very stressful. I had to say to him: “Sorry I gave you such a big ball.” He didn’t mind. The funniest thing that shouldn’t be funny I know someone who accidently did a poo on the floor in King’s Cross station and then skidded in it.

Preparations this time have been more thorough and extensive than ever before, but here we are again: resources overstretched, staff run ragged and – too often, in too many places – standards of care compromised and patient safety put at risk. In the past, mild weather and low flu rates helped us scrape by. Maybe if we had been lucky again this year we could, just about, have coped once more. But flu cases are rising, there is more respiratory illness, and the cold weather is taking its toll. Trusts are doing all they can to provide good care for patients. And every day in the NHS there are countless acts of kindness and compassion by staff who rise above these challenges. But the simple truth is that, within the current funding and workforce constraints, the health service can only do so much. If we run the NHS at 100% capacity, day in day out, permanently in the red zone, it’s not surprising that the service can’t cope when we get a sudden, but entirely predictable, spike in demand. The key problem is a lack of capacity: there are not enough beds or permanent staff. This is now a year-round problem affecting mental health, community and ambulance services, as well as hospitals. But in winter we have more patients who are sicker, requiring more care. If bed occupancy rates are higher than 85% it becomes harder to ensure safe care, and there is less resilience to cope with spikes in demand. Most of the NHS was operating well above that 85% capacity level before winter had even started. NHS Providers, as the body representing frontline trusts, has written to Jeremy Hunt to call for a proper public review of how well the NHS handled this winter and what could have been done better. We must, in particular, now properly review whether we have sufficient capacity to deal with the demand the NHS knows it can expect. A simple comparison with the last time the NHS met the 95% four-hour A&amp;E standard suggests the NHS may be 10-15,000 beds short of capacity, against a current NHS total bed base of about 130,000, recognising that much NHS care is delivered outside inpatient wards. But this, emphatically, is not just about winter. It’s about whether the NHS can provide the right quality of patient care, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. And, make no mistake, we have now reached a key watershed moment. Put simply, the NHS can no longer deliver the standards enshrined in its constitution; standards that were drawn up to reflect safe, decent, levels of patient care. Last year, for the first time, all the main targets for A&amp;E, ambulances, planned operations and cancer treatment were missed. The government committed last March to recovering the four-hour A&amp;E target by the end of 2018. This will not now happen. While we recognise the rationale for cancelling elective operations to prioritise emergency care, this will knock performance against this target further off course. Across the piece, we are losing all the hard-won gains the NHS made in the 2000s. We must therefore now urgently review the long-term funding settlement for health and care so that we can either sustainably deliver the constitutional standards (which is what NHS trusts want to do), or change them. There has been a lot of speculation about how such a review might be carried out, including calls for a royal commission and some form of cross-party review. But we do not have the luxury of time. We need urgent decisions – and only our elected government can take them. Increasing funding for health and social care in our taxpayer-funded system has a major impact on overall public expenditure, the tax system and other public services, which all go to the heart of the mission of any elected government. We are all for building a consensus around what needs to be done. But the last time we saw a structural increase in health funding, with the rise in national insurance under a Tony Blair and Gordon Brown government, that did not require a royal commission. It was a clear political decision, supported by a review commissioned and overseen by government-commissioned, run from the Treasury. There is plenty of high-quality work for this government to now draw on, notably from the Office for Budget Responsibility on future health and care spending, the Barker commission on how to pool health and care funding, and several all-party parliamentary committees that have looked at what is needed to create a sustainable NHS. This is not just about funding, but is also about ensuring we have the right workforce and deliver care in the best way to meet future needs. This work should underpin a clear government-led process so that the key decisions can be announced in this November’s budget. Failure to act now will lead to the targets moving further beyond reach. This would harm the quality of care, causing delays and distress for patients and weakening staff morale. It could also undermine public faith in the NHS. There is so much at stake. We can fix this, but there must be no more delay. The ball is now firmly in the government’s court. • Chris Hopson is chief executive of NHS Providers"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"fashion/2018/jan/26/what-i-wore-this-week-check-blazer-fashion","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-26T13:00:40Z","webTitle":"What I wore this week: a check blazer | Jess Cartner-Morley","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/jan/26/what-i-wore-this-week-check-blazer-fashion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2018/jan/26/what-i-wore-this-week-check-blazer-fashion","fields":{"headline":"What I wore this week: a check blazer","bodyText":"Please tell me you have this jacket, or one very similar, already. And if not, then if you wouldn’t mind explaining what exactly you have been doing with yourself for the past four months? Because that is how long it is since the checked grey-or-beige blazer established itself as the new key piece in the wardrobe of the grown-up fashion connoisseur. At New York fashion week last September, I wore mine for the first time. By the London shows a week later, it had become front-row uniform, making us look like a lineup of fashion-swot prefects. (Which, in a way, is what we are.) At Gucci in Milan, I counted 11 versions on the catwalk. By the end of Paris fashion week, I had to have it relined, because it was falling apart. (Oh, the joys of a high-street bargain.) In other words, if you don’t have this jacket (tailored, checked, on the grey-to-beige scale of soft neutrals) then get one. Do that, and you have my blessing to ignore all other style diktats for the foreseeable future, because the jacket will stand your look up completely by itself. You will need clothes to wear with the jacket, but you have those already. The easiest way to wear it is as the flourish on an otherwise straightforward outfit. A pair of jeans and a white T-shirt; all-black polo neck, skirt and tights; a white shirt and navy tailored trousers. The simpler, even starker, the more chic the effect. Keep details minimal: a pair of simple gold hoop earrings, say, and a classic loafer. I’m not wearing that look here, because I am pretty sure you can picture it without my help. I am demonstrating the other way to make a check blazer work with the clothes you have, which is by wearing it over a long-sleeved dress. I am bonkers about long-sleeved dresses, a high-drama, low-effort look that works, climate-wise, for about 10 out of 12 British months, give or take a pair of tights. But the bodycon ones feel a bit dated now, and strangely mumsy, whereas the loose ones are cool and modern but can end up a little more tarot-card reader than I am usually aiming for in the office. A blazer on top solves both issues, bringing a whole bunch of dresses you thought were on the way out back into play. Don’t worry about “clashing” checks with graphic or floral prints: a soft check counts as a neutral. There are no excuses. I think you’ll find this jacket is required. • Jess wears blazer, £59.99, and dress, £39.99, both hm.com. Boots, £239, kurtgeiger.com. Styling: Melanie Wilkinson.

But can care workers spot this deadly illness?","bodyText":"I am a survivor of sepsis. Not once, not twice, but eight times. Sepsis – also known as blood poisoning – kills more people than bowel cancer, breast cancer and prostate cancer combined. It affects more than 260,000 people and claims 44,000 lives every year in the UK. But it is not spoken about in training for social care workers, even though they are increasingly likely to see it. Sepsis is triggered when the body tries to overcompensate for an underlying infection and too many white blood cells are released into the bloodstream. An example you may see in the social care context is kidney and chest infections. It looks like common flu in the early stages, but it can lead to life-threatening septic shock. There is a golden hour for the treatment of sepsis, when someone can be saved by basic steps known as the “sepsis six”. Although there is no standard training, there are some symptoms care professionals can look for in a client: Are they sleepy? Is their breathing rapid or shallow? Do they have a raised temperature? Is their complexion mottled? Do they seem confused, distracted or agitated? Have they spoken of feeling the worst they have ever felt? Taking their temperature at home may be the best indication of whether someone has sepsis until a medical professional is available, but you should try to get the person to a medic as soon as possible after identifying the symptoms. Most importantly, when you speak to the medic, follow the “just ask” protocol; ask if they think it could be sepsis and give a good, rounded history of the individual. If you are not familiar with the patient, a synopsis of their medical condition should be placed at the front of their care plan. One of the occasions when I had sepsis offers a pertinent example of why care workers should be aware of the condition’s symptoms. I had been feeling ill for a couple of hours and had told my care workers. They said we should see how it goes – and went back to their mobile phones. This continued until my husband returned from work and, within minutes, he noticed that I was pale and flushed and that my head was nodding. He touched my cheeks and realised I had a temperature – 39.9 degrees at that point. Paul called for an ambulance and asked the paramedics if it could be sepsis; they immediately started to check for the signs using the “sepsis six”. I spent four weeks in hospital, with a stay in intensive care on high impact antibiotics. I was told that if Paul had not acted so decisively and asked the correct questions, that I may not have received the correct treatment that saved my life. Coincidentally, Paul and I met in hospital when we were both being treated for sepsis. Please do not underestimate the importance of recognising sepsis and simply asking medics: “Could it be sepsis?” And if you’ve had sepsis before, tell those caring for you about your history – sepsis can and does come back often. • Damian Bridgeman is a social entrepreneur, disability rights activist, and board member of Social Care Wales.

Crisp, light and delicate, dipped in the most bitter chocolate and filled with good cream, chocolate eclairs are simply peerless. That is, until you consider the other eclairs – iced and filled with praline cream, delicate caramel or coffee – that grace the vitrines of any fine French patisserie. And then there are the unexpected variations: Fortnum &amp; Mason does a most fetching eclair in pink, delightfully Norman Hartnell-esque. Beyond the eclair, of course, there are all the other choux pastry treats to be had. The St Honoré, named for the eponymous patisserie on the Paris street where it was created. The Paris Brest, conjured to celebrate a famous bicycle race. The religieuse – or nun’s cake – made from two choux buns, one filled and iced with coffee-flavoured cream and icing atop another filled and iced with chocolate. Each pastry with its own evocative name, the epitome of epicurean deliciousness. When made well. And, aye – there is the caveat. Choux pastries are the cinderella of French pastries: their spell lasts only a short while. Where a tart might last a day at least, and a gateau or a cake a fair few days, the delicate crisp of really good choux pastry lives, alas, but a few hours at best. So, when making your own, while the recipe is reasonably straightforward, the key lies in the timings. Never cook the pastries in the morning or, saints preserve us, the day before. Instead, make your pastry then refrigerate it in a tub with a close-fitting lid until right before needed: it keeps remarkably well for a few days and also cooks and cools quickly. Now, eclairs are best left to those home cooks who are adept at piping. For anyone else, you’ll need little more than a teaspoon to make profiteroles. I have used Monsieur Michel Guérard’s recipes for both pastry and fillings since I was a nipper: crème chantilly – cream lightly whipped with sugar; crème chibouste – confectioner’s custard lightened with cream and whipped into soft folds; ice-cream flavoured with honey or vanilla; and, of course, chocolate sauce – made with the finest chocolate, extravagant but vital. Needless to say, on the pudding menu at Quo Vadis, we love and use them all accordingly. With this final instalment, this column goes off to the great pudding basin in the sky. It has been a great gorgeous adventure, which I have been honoured to be a part of. Thanks so much for having me. Chocolate profiteroles Makes about 30 For the dough 120ml milk 120ml water 110g softened unsalted butter, cut into small pieces 1 level tsp salt 140g plain white flour, sifted 5 whole eggs For the filling 1 litre milk Half a vanilla pod 6 egg yolks 100g caster sugar 20g flour 20g cornflour 200ml double cream Vanilla ice-cream For the chocolate sauce 300g dark chocolate 70-75% 280ml double cream 1 Preheat the oven to 220C/425F/gas mark 7 and line a baking sheet with baking paper. To make the dough, put the milk, water, butter and salt in a pan over a high heat and bring to the boil. Add in the flour and stir gently until a mass forms, then beat until the dough comes away from the sides of the pan. Remove the pan from the heat on to a trivet. Beat for minute or so until the steam subsides. 2 Crack the eggs into another bowl and whisk together lightly. When the dough in the pan is tepid, add in a little egg and beat well until thoroughly mixed in. Continue thus until all the egg is incorporated and the dough is made. 3 Scrape the dough into a tub for which you have a lid, and refrigerate for at least half an hour. This just makes spooning or piping the dough that bit easier. 4 When sufficiently chilled, spoon little rounds on to your prepared baking tray, a few centimetres apart so they may puff well. Put the tray in the preheated oven and bake for 10 minutes, then lower the temperature to 180C/350F/gas mark 4 and bake for a further 15-20 minutes. The profiteroles should be golden brown all over and as light as air. When cooked, remove from the oven and set aside to cool. 5 To make the confectioner’s custard, pour the milk into a pan, then cut the vanilla pod down the middle and scrape out the seeds into the milk. Bring this to a simmer over a gentle heat. 6 In another bowl, with an electric beater, mix the egg yolks and sugar together until pale and voluminous. Reduce the speed of the beater and add in the flours. Remove the vanilla pod from the milk, and pour the latter in a gentle, steady stream into the egg mixture, stirring all the while. Pour it all back into the pan and return to the heat, stirring until the custard thickens. Lower the heat and beat for a minute until the custard is smooth. Remove from the heat and tip into a bowl. Cover the bowl with clingfilm and pierce lightly all over to allow steam to escape. When cooled, put in the fridge. 7 In another bowl, whip the cream, then fold into the cold custard until smooth. Return to the fridge while you prepare the rest. 8 For the chocolate sauce, break the chocolate into small pieces. Put the cream in a pan and heat until simmering then tip in the chocolate and whisk until smooth. Then set it aside, keeping it warm so it doesn’t harden. 9 To assemble, split each profiterole and fill each with a spoonful of custard and a small scoop of vanilla ice-cream. Put the lids atop the profiteroles. Heap them in a bowl or on a large serving plate, spoon all over with the warm chocolate sauce and serve swiftly.

If the two sides can’t find a compromise, the federal government will be shut down on January 20th or, as historians calls it, one year too late.” “They had the meeting this afternoon and they did it in kind of an exceptional way,” the host continued. “They held an open meeting and let cameras in for the actual negotiations. They don’t even let cameras into the bachelor fantasy suite when they’re engaging in bipartisan negotiations.” Colbert then summarized Trump’s stipulations for any immigration deal, which include an end to the green-card lottery, family immigration and $18bn in funding for a Mexican-American border wall. “In this meeting, Trump delivered a strong message of leadership: somebody else fix it,” Colbert said, showing footage of the president claiming he will sign any bill put forth. Impersonating Trump, Colbert continued: “I’ve always firmly believed whatever the people in the same room I’m with tell me to believe. My brain is made of tofu. It absorbs the flavor of whatever you throw at it.” “Both Democrats and Republicans agree that a path to citizenship should be created for Dreamers,” the host explained. “Problem is, Republicans don’t want to pass Daca without the wall, and Democrats do. And for a brief, shining moment, the president agreed with the Democrats.” Colbert then showed clips from the meeting, in which Trump appears to agree to a proposal by Senator Dianne Feinstein, who advocated passing Daca before moving on to comprehensive immigration reform, before the House majority leader, Kevin McCarthy, explained to Trump that Feinstein did not mean a border wall. “I agree with Dianne Feinstein because I heard her speaking last,” Colbert said, imitating Trump. “What’s that? Kevin’s talking now? OK, I agree with Kevin.” Trevor Noah addressed Trump’s recent comments about the justice department, which suggest he believes attorney general Jeff Sessions is obliged to protect him from the Russia investigation. “I don’t know if you’ve noticed, but in between his tweetings and cheeseburgers, Donald Trump has been saying some pretty dictator-y things,” Noah began, noting a New York Times article in which Trump is reported to have said he has the “absolute right to do what I want to do with the justice department”. “That’s a dangerous idea for the president to have,” Noah continued. “The purpose of the justice department is to enforce the law of the United States according to what’s fair, not according to what some guy wants. But thanks to recent reports, we’re learning that Donald Trump doesn’t quite see it the same way.” In the Times report, Trump is reported to have been angry that Sessions recused himself from all matters concerning Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation; additionally, Trump praised former AG Eric Holder for having “protected” President Obama. “Donald Trump has one of the most twisted minds I’ve ever come across,” the host said. “Not only does he think Eric Holder unethically protected Obama, he thinks it’s the one good thing that Eric Holder did. In President Trump’s mind, the attorney general is his personal attorney. Instead of recusing himself from Russia, he wanted Jeff Sessions to basically be his pint-sized Johnnie Cochran. But unfortunately for Trump, Jeff Sessions is a by-the-book kind of guy, and Donald Trump hates books.” Noah also noted that Trump reportedly asked advisers, “Where’s my Roy Cohn,” invoking the disgraced lawyer, and assistant to Joe McCarthy, who named innocent citizens as communists, attacked his political enemies, and advocated fiercely for the execution of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. Noah went on to note that, in various tweets and press conferences, Trump asked for the justice department to further investigate Hillary Clinton. Earlier this week, it was announced that they are taking a new look into the former secretary of state’s use of a private email server in office. “That should make you a little bit afraid,” Noah concluded. “Because whether or not there are legitimate reasons to further investigate Clinton and her people, if the president can start criminal investigations into anyone he wants, that feels less like a democracy and more like a Trump-ocracy.” Jimmy Kimmel poked fun at Trump’s claim to being a “genius”, noting a website that used software to show Trump speaks at a fourth-grade reading level. “You know how the president keeps telling us he’s a genius?” Kimmel said. “Well, it turns out he isn’t. There’s a website called Factbase that did an analysis of the first 30,000 words spoken in office by every US president since Herbert Hoover. So they loaded all the speeches into a computer, and what their software found is that President Trump speaks at a fourth-grade level, lower than any president they’ve ever measured.” “Remember that show Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader? He’s not,” Kimmel joked, noting that Hoover spoke at an 11th-grade level and Obama at a ninth-grade level. Kimmel then referenced a letter, sent to Trump by a nine-year-old and read aloud by Sarah anders, and wrote a parody of the president’s response. “Dear Pickle, my name is President Trump, but everybody calls me the greatest president,” Kimmel began. “I’m 71 years old and I like cheeseburgers? Have you ever been to a casino? Maybe when you visit you can give me your lunch money. I have to go be president now in my office. It’s round. Can you believe it? Anyway, I’m also sending a bottle of vodka to you for your birthday. My friend sloppy Steve drinks eight of them a day. Eight bottles is a lot.

Ninety years after Julius Caesar pitched up on its shores, only to meet the Druids and leg it, the Romans are finally ready to conquer the Celts. But just as the ships are set to sail, four soldiers are caught deserting. “Britannia is a cursed land, ruled by the dead,” gibbers one. “They feast on human flesh,” whimpers another. To be fair, they’re not too wide of the mark. While our current leaders hopefully stop short of dining on the innards of benefits claimants, were the ancient Romans to clock the suited corpses that currently line Parliament, and the primeval acts of self-immolation occurring therein, they’d be back on their ships before you could say “Hail Caesar”. In Jez Butterworth’s Britannia (Thursday, 9pm, Sky Atlantic), the Romans find our sceptred isle awash with mildewed mystics and festering yokels engaging in surreal fertility rituals among the standing stones. Even Plautius’s right-hand man, Vespasian, is struggling to see the appeal. “What do they have up here, besides trees and nightmares?” he asks, daydreaming about cocktails on the Amalfi coast. Offering persuasive evidence that commissioning editors will greenlight anything involving sandals, swords and ladies in leather bustiers, the show arrives hot on the heels of last year’s gleeful trash-fest Bromans and the beardy extravaganza Vikings. More pointedly, it is hoped that this epic will plug the gap left by Game of Thrones. But compared to this bunch, the inhabitants of Westeros make for gentle teatime drama. What Britannia lacks in sibling sex and skeleton armies, it makes up for in plain weirdness. Savagery, superstition and strange visions abound. Not for nothing has its director suggested watching it after a massive spliff; Britannia is completely off its tits. There’s the theme tune that eschews orchestral bluster in favour of Donovan’s Hurdy Gurdy Man, and leading characters such as the outcast Divis (Nikolaj Lie Kaas), all minging teeth and mouldering complexion, who pride themselves on the smell of death emanating from their underpants. Also among Britannia’s parade of misfits and weirdos, we find actual, three-dimensional women, among them Kerra (Kelly Reilly), awesome warrior and thoroughly narked princess, and Zoë Wanamaker’s leader of the Regni tribe, given a Mad Max makeover and the excellent gambit: “I shit on the souls of your dead.” Elsewhere, there’s Kerra’s father, King Pellenor (Ian McDiarmid), chief of the Cantii, who greets his visitors with a gracious: “Fuck off back to Rome”, and head Druid Veran, unsettlingly played by Mackenzie Crook as a merging of Gollum and Lord Voldemort. An encounter with Veran sends mortals out of their minds, even without herbal assistance. This is not to say that Britannia doesn’t cleave occasionally to ye olde traditions of histoporn: nothing says costume drama like a topless woman bouncing cheerfully atop her second husband as her first one looks on. Furthermore, it couldn’t give a flying one for historical accuracy; the script would give Mary Beard a hernia. But all’s fair in love and polytheistic pagan ritual. Britannia will mess with your head. Roll a fat one and enjoy the ride."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2018/jan/11/xylouris-white-mother-review-exciting-third-lute-drumming-fusion-is-a-real-thrill","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-11T18:15:07Z","webTitle":"Xylouris White: Mother review – exciting third lute-drumming fusion is a real thrill","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jan/11/xylouris-white-mother-review-exciting-third-lute-drumming-fusion-is-a-real-thrill","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/jan/11/xylouris-white-mother-review-exciting-third-lute-drumming-fusion-is-a-real-thrill","fields":{"headline":"Xylouris White: Mother review – exciting third lute-drumming fusion is a real thrill","bodyText":"George Xylouris and Jim White are one of the most intriguing fusion duos you’ll come across.

As a Suits fan, this was a pleasure, but as Markle is about to join the royal family it caused my republican self some consternation. As she shyly came forward to shake the hands of rows of (mainly) black women who had lined up to offer her their congratulations, I had become part of the raucous chorus of adoration. My damp handshake represented the fact that, for many black women in the UK, Markle’s forthcoming ascension to the title of Duchess really means something; a stamp of approval from what is still, unfortunately, regarded as an important societal hierarchy. Although Markle is the acceptable, light-skinned face of blackness, whose experiences diverge from the majority of black women, she has still won the hearts and minds of many of my peers. The reason I saw Meghan and Harry in the flesh was because they were on their second official public engagement together, at Reprezent 107.3FM in Brixton, a community radio station that gives a platform to young presenters from diverse backgrounds and launched the careers of artist Stormzy and DJ Jamz Supernova. Two members of gal-dem, a magazine and collective written and run by women and non-binary people of colour to improve media diversity, were able to greet her in a private area, tell her a little about the magazine (of which I am deputy editor, and which also has a show on Reprezent), and slip her a copy of an issue that focuses on subjects such as Grenfell, Calais, growing up mixed-race, and feminism in Saudi Arabia. She had apparently heard of us and was excited to read the mag. My dreams last night were filled with the thought of little brown babies one day discovering the copy of gal-dem tucked away in the opulent bowels of Kensington Palace, becoming radicalised, renouncing their titles and overthrowing the monarchy. It is fair to say I am still not actively excited by Markle joining the ranks of the royal family, but perhaps her presence will do a pinch of good within them. It is difficult to know how much she will be used to fulfil the irritatingly fashionable diversity quota that every public body needs in 2018 to stay relevant, or whether she will be able to lead the way with some autonomy. As Markle is an ardent feminist who has advocated for women and people of colour, I have a little faith – even though she has now deleted all her social media channels, which were once so active and supportive of women. And, of course, she has also said goodbye to her acting career. Even so (and problems with the institution of monarchy aside), black British women certainly have Markle’s back."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jan/10/bath-revives-plan-to-impose-tourist-tax","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-10T16:29:17Z","webTitle":"Bath revives plan to impose tourist tax","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jan/10/bath-revives-plan-to-impose-tourist-tax","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jan/10/bath-revives-plan-to-impose-tourist-tax","fields":{"headline":"Bath revives plan to impose tourist tax","bodyText":"The city of Bath is planning to lobby the government for the power to charge its many visitors a tourist tax. A levy of about £1 or more could be added to the accommodation bills of the million or so tourists who stay in the Georgian city every year. Councillors see it as a way of raising extra cash in times of austerity, but many hoteliers are reluctant to charge tourists, believing even a small additional cost will put off some visitors and claim such a scheme would be difficult – and expensive – to administer. Bath has long considered raising a tourist tax but had previously been told by Westminster it would not be allowed to. After it emerged at the end of last year that Birmingham might be given the go-ahead to impose a levy on visitors to help pay for the 2022 Commonwealth Games, Bath decided to revive its plan. The council leader, Tim Warren, said: “We believe that considering the numbers of visitors we get in Bath a small fee for overnight stays is the way forward. This would go to service the tourism budget and funds that would have usually been diverted there would be free to be put to use elsewhere.” The Liberal Democrat councillor Dine Romero said: “Most residents will think this is a good idea. But it would be a real worry for the bed and breakfast level of establishments in the city because a pound here and there does make a difference in that market to whether people choose to stay there.” Robin Moss, a Labour councillor, said: “Most European cities have it. I don’t think it would affect tourism but bring in much-needed revenue.” About 5 million daytrippers come to Bath every year and tourism supports about 10,000 jobs in the city and surrounding areas. On the streets of Bath on Wednesday, most visitors seemed happy with the idea. “I could afford another pound or two,” said Frank Cooper, who was on holiday from the US. “It wouldn’t put me off. I can see that visitors put a lot of strain on the city.” Last year, the film director and Bath resident Ken Loach caused controversy when he told the Guardian the city was being ruined by unsympathetic developments intent on attracting even more visitors."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/jan/10/oil-price-hits-three-year-high-petrol-prices-uk","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-10T15:19:50Z","webTitle":"Oil price hits three-year high of nearly $70 a barrel","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/10/oil-price-hits-three-year-high-petrol-prices-uk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jan/10/oil-price-hits-three-year-high-petrol-prices-uk","fields":{"headline":"Oil price hits three-year high of nearly $70 a barrel","bodyText":"Drivers have been warned they face misery at petrol pumps this year after the oil price rose to a three-year high of almost $70 (£52) a barrel. In November, Opec and other big oil producers including Russia agreed to extend production curbs until the end of 2018, which combined with geopolitical uncertainty, has pushed up prices. The RAC said the price of petrol in the UK had gone up by 5p per litre since the start of November, to 121.27p, and diesel by 3p to 123.97p. “If oil stays at this level, pump price hikes will be almost inevitable. With households across the country still feeling the cost of Christmas, this is not the start to 2018 anyone would have wanted. It could also negatively affect business and further fuel inflation,” said the RAC’s fuel spokesman, Simon Williams. The price of a barrel of Brent crude hit $69.37 on Wednesday, the highest amount since December 2014. Such heights may not sit comfortably with Opec members, who fear losing market share to US shale producers. Iran’s oil minister said this week that Opec did not want it to cost more than $60 a barrel. US oil production has surged over the past year as a result of higher prices. The government has predicted the highest annual average growth in history this year, from 9.3m barrels per day in 2017 to 10.3m. The number of oil rigs in the US has climbed to 924, up by one-quarter on the level a year ago. Oil analysts at Petromatrix said: “Russia and Saudi Arabia have managed to support prompt oil prices, but at the cost of making the US the world’s largest oil superpower.” Donald Trump has a deadline of Friday to decide whether to waive sanctions on Iran, but the Guardian understands he will not do so, as part of measures against the regime’s recent crackdown on protests. Such a move could affect crude exports and push the oil price higher still. • Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"culture/ng-interactive/2018/jan/14/simone-lia-on-bad-listeners","type":"interactive","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-14T08:00:21Z","webTitle":"Simone Lia on bad listeners","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/ng-interactive/2018/jan/14/simone-lia-on-bad-listeners","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/ng-interactive/2018/jan/14/simone-lia-on-bad-listeners","fields":{"headline":"Simone Lia on bad listeners","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2018/jan/10/corbyn-criticises-esther-mcvey-promotion-but-condemns-online-abuse","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-10T15:05:35Z","webTitle":"Corbyn criticises Esther McVey promotion but condemns online abuse","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jan/10/corbyn-criticises-esther-mcvey-promotion-but-condemns-online-abuse","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jan/10/corbyn-criticises-esther-mcvey-promotion-but-condemns-online-abuse","fields":{"headline":"Corbyn criticises Esther McVey promotion but condemns online abuse","bodyText":"Jeremy Corbyn believes the appointment of Esther McVey as work and pensions secretary is alarming, his spokesman has said, while condemning online abuse of the newly promoted MP. McVey was a minister in the coalition government and gained a reputation for tough rhetoric on welfare policy. She lost her seat in 2015 but returned to the Commons last year after winning in Tatton, formerly George Osborne’s constituency. In 2013 when asked about rising food bank use, McVey said it was “positive that people are reaching out to support other people”. She went on to blame Labour’s management of the economy, saying: “We are all trying to pay back this £1.5tn debt … which spiralled under Labour.” She has also robustly defended changes to disability benefits. Her appointment this week to the work and pensions post has been widely criticised on social media. Asked whether Corbyn would condemn such attacks, his spokesman said: “Jeremy has made clear time and again that he is opposed to all forms of online harassment and abuse, and if there are such cases then they obviously should not take place.” But he went on: “Esther McVey is extremely unpopular because of her record in the last government as a DWP minister and the treatment of disabled people under that government, so it’s not encouraging at all – it’s alarming – that she’s now taken on this role, with all the baggage that goes with that.” The spokesman repeated Labour’s longstanding riposte to claims that John McDonnell, now the shadow chancellor, called in 2014 for McVey to be “lynched”. “John McDonnell didn’t say that she should be lynched; he was reporting what had been said at another meeting by a constituent – not saying anything of the kind himself,” Corbyn’s spokesman said. Asked about separate comments by McDonnell about McVey being a “stain of inhumanity”, the spokesman said: “He’s obviously very critical of Esther McVey because of her record. That’s a very different thing from calling for anyone to be lynched. He has a very strong view that her record was, and has been, disastrous and very damaging for disabled people.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/10/julian-assange-ecuador-embassy-wikileaks-us-sweden","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-10T15:14:19Z","webTitle":"The only barrier to Julian Assange leaving Ecuador’s embassy is pride | James Ball","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/10/julian-assange-ecuador-embassy-wikileaks-us-sweden","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/10/julian-assange-ecuador-embassy-wikileaks-us-sweden","fields":{"headline":"The only barrier to Julian Assange leaving Ecuador’s embassy is pride","bodyText":"According to Debrett’s, the arbiters of etiquette since 1769: “Visitors, like fish, stink in three days.” Given this, it’s difficult to imagine what Ecuador’s London embassy smells like, more than five-and-a-half years after Julian Assange moved himself into the confines of the small flat in Knightsbridge, just across the road from Harrods. Ecuador’s foreign minister has said the country is seeking “mediation” to resolve the “unsustainable” situation of Assange’s residency in the embassy, which ostensibly centres around Ecuador offering the WikiLeaks founder political asylum against possible prosecution in the United States. Assange took up post in the embassy a few weeks after interviewing the country’s then president, Rafael Correa, on his Russia Today television show. Correa made an apparently casual offer of asylum during a discussion of Assange’s extradition case with Sweden, following accusations of rape and sexual assault by two women. Assange pursued his extradition case right through the British legal system, aided by some of the country’s leading human rights barristers, and extradition was eventually granted – denying Assange’s appeal – by the UK supreme court. It was at precisely this point – when extradition to Sweden to face potential prosecution in his rape case seemed certain – that Assange, concerned about potential US prosecution over WikiLeaks, fled to the embassy. Given Assange and Ecuador have spent more than five years saying his asylum was unrelated to the Swedish case, even Sweden’s decision last year to abandon the case – citing no chance of conviction after Assange’s flight from justice – was not enough to give any chance of closure. If Assange had announced plans to leave the embassy at that stage, it would be clear his story for the previous five years had not been entirely truthful. Ecuador’s decision to seek mediation now is, on the surface, quite puzzling: it didn’t make that announcement when there was a genuine development in Assange’s Swedish case, nor did it do so when Donald Trump became the president, last year. There is no public criminal case against Assange or WikiLeaks in the US, though Assange frequently says there is evidence of sealed indictments against him and his associates, and there have been publicly disclosed surveillance warrants against WikiLeaks staff, as well as FBI interest in Assange and his current and former co-workers (including me, as I worked with WikiLeaks for a few months in 2010 and 2011). There is no real reason to believe anything has changed with Assange’s situation in the US. What has changed is Assange’s value to Ecuador as a political symbol. Internal documents revealed that relations between embassy staff and Ecuador’s most famous asylee were fraught. Security staff were filing minute by minute reports of Assange’s movements to Ecuador’s intelligence agency. Last year, these tensions came to the fore as Assange was publicly reprimanded by Ecuadorian officials for interfering in the US election process – by publishing hacked emails from the DNC and Clinton campaign – while claiming asylum. Assange’s internet connection was eventually cut off by Ecuador, to his visible public rage. When Ecuador first gave asylum to Assange, he was still a hero to many on the liberal left, and to many opponents of “US imperialism”. Today, most of those who still support Assange are hard-right nationalists – with many seeing him as a supporter of the style of politics of both Trump and Vladimir Putin. Assange is not the political icon he used to be. This is perhaps what’s behind Ecuador trying to seek a way to end the standoff. Assange’s effect on foreign and diplomatic relations surely outweighs much of what Ecuador’s own diplomatic corps would like to do. The problem for both sides is that neither wants to lose face: Assange wants to be a symbol of resistance against an overreaching US state, and does not want to admit his asylum was about his personal actions and not those of WikiLeaks. Ecuador does not want to suggest it made a mistake in granting Assange asylum. Their problem is a simple one, though: what is there to mediate between the UK and Ecuador on Assange? Assange’s case in Britain is not a political one, it’s a matter of simple law. Assange was arrested on a European arrest warrant and eventually granted bail – then fought his extradition case right the way to the supreme court. Following Sweden’s decision to abandon its attempts to extradite Assange, all that he faces in the UK is the relatively straightforward matter of breaching bail – a minor offence, but not one suitable for political negotiation. Ecuador’s “mediation” pitch to the UK amounts simply to asking them to ignore UK law – it’s not a strong ask. Assange should not face prosecution in the US in connection with WikiLeaks publishing activities – it would go against constitutional principles of free expression, and damage the media’s ability to hold power to account. The US would dispute any such prosecution would be political, though – the country pursued New York Times journalist Jim Risen through the courts for some time – and the UK still has an open police investigation into journalists who worked on the Edward Snowden leaks. Given Assange’s recent leaks benefited the current US president, what case is there to make that prosecution would be political? Assange does not want to be trapped in Ecuador’s embassy, and his hosts do not want him there. Their problem is that what’s keeping him trapped there is not so much the iniquitous actions of world powers, but pride. Perhaps it’s not Ecuador and the UK that need a mediator, but rather Ecuador and Assange. • James Ball is a former Guardian special projects editor"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jan/13/ive-become-a-rummager-a-magpie-of-sorts-samin-nosrat","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-13T13:00:02Z","webTitle":"‘I’ve become a rummager, a magpie of sorts’: Samin Nosrat","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jan/13/ive-become-a-rummager-a-magpie-of-sorts-samin-nosrat","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jan/13/ive-become-a-rummager-a-magpie-of-sorts-samin-nosrat","fields":{"headline":"‘I’ve become a rummager, a magpie of sorts’: Samin Nosrat","bodyText":"I live in North Berkeley, California, a few blocks from Chez Panisse. I moved here about 9 years ago, when I was 29. I’m 38 now, and I feel like the apartment – certainly the kitchen – has grown up with me. The front door of the apartment opens right into the kitchen; it’s a small room but it has a lot of windows, so it’s beautifully light. And a lot of the time I use the patio as an extension of my cooking space. I have a lot of plants – my living room is like a jungle. I like the idea of bringing the outside in. I always joke that if I write a memoir it’ll be called A Bay Leaf in Every Pot. Often recipes will call for a bay leaf, and I didn’t really understand what the bay leaf was doing until I had fresh bay for the first time – it blew my mind; the aroma was so incredible. So I bought a small plant, and now I put a leaf in everything I cook. I went straight from college into restaurants so, from the beginning, my idea of what a kitchen should be was the highfalutin restaurant type – and what I had at home never measured up to that. When I left restaurants, I had to learn to be a home cook. I realised that I didn’t actually need that much: my stove is small and my fridge is old, but I’ve cooked so much in here. I’ve tweaked the space slowly – the wooden surface I inherited when a friend renovated his kitchen. I redeployed an Ikea filing cabinet to organise my spices. And then there are all the things people have given me: an artist friend made the spoon rest and the twine is from Dario Cecchini, the world-famous butcher in Tuscany. He’s a good friend of mine, a real character and was my mentor when I lived in Italy. For a while I had a piece around my wrist. It’s what I ask for anytime someone is going to Italy. People love giving cooks spoons, I’ve noticed. Or at least they love giving them to me. My best friend travels around the world for his research and we share a love for obnoxiously large utensils, so he always brings me one from wherever he goes. My collection is housed in an old Chez Panisse amarena cherry tin. I grew up in southern California, which is suburban, sterile and super-polished. If you need something, you go to the store and buy it. Under no circumstances would my mom have allowed me to go through trash on the street and bring it home. I’ve since become a rummager, a magpie of sorts. In Berkeley, there’s a culture of leaving unwanted items on the pavement, and I’m always rifling through, and bringing things home: a copper bowl, a black crepe pan, two red milk warmers … The biggest of my knives is one I got for six bucks in a junk shop. I had it fixed by a cutler, who told me it’s from the 1940s in Chicago, totally handmade. Working at Chez Panisse and living in the Bay Area has really taught me how to see the potential in things.

How about issuing – to 46 million followers – a threat of nuclear holocaust against a sovereign state that will claim an untold number of lives? Not even that if you are an elected leader, it seems. In a recent blogpost, Twitter wrote that: “Blocking a world leader from Twitter or removing their controversial tweets would hide important information people should be able to see and debate.” In addition, Twitter management argued that blocking politicians such as Trump, “would also not silence that leader, but it would certainly hamper necessary discussion around their words and actions”. Even if the defence of its non-intervention on Trump had stopped there, the explanation would have raised a number of troubling questions for the company about its supposed commitment to cracking down on threats of violence and online harassment. In what can only be described as perverse logic, Twitter is arguing that it is precisely the most powerful people in the world who will have their ability to communicate with followers protected, as they play a “critical role” in public conversation due to their “outsized impact on our society”. So, the message is: if you want to threaten someone on Twitter, make sure to get yourself elected as a head of state first. Twitter did not stop there, however: ”We review tweets by leaders within the political context that defines them, and enforce our rules accordingly. No one person’s account drives Twitter’s growth, or influences these decisions.” Even the most generous of critics would be hard-pressed to imagine that the sheer volume of traffic generated by Trump – his tweets, the retweets of his tweets, the tweets citing his tweets, the news stories about his tweets, the tweets about the news stories about his tweets – in no way influences Twitter’s decision-making over the president’s account. This is serious money. When a barrage of complaints came in from users after Trump infamously retweeted three Islamophobic videos posted by the far-right group Britain First, Twitter refused to have these few tweets removed on the grounds that they wanted to show “every side of the issue”. This isn’t a call for censorship, but a call to consider how powerful social media actors promote and leverage their “free speech” credentials for financial gain while at the same time engaging in content and user regulation that is less than consistent or transparent, not to mention creating a clear hierarchy where some users are more important than others. If Twitter wants to argue that Trump is a special case who cannot have his account suspended or tweets deleted because he is central to democratic debate, then he must also be made a special case who cannot block followers. And, on this issue, I have personal experience: Trump blocked me on Twitter last year after I criticised him over what I considered to be his hypocrisy over John McCain. So, after telling me that Trump’s tweets are “important information people should be able to see and debate”, I am then told that it’s fine that Trump is given the freedom to stop me from hearing him. How this squares with a commitment to democratic communication is unclear, and platforms such as Twitter have spent years pitching themselves as important actors in the democratic process. But Twitter is a private company, and can decide who it verifies, suspends or kicks off. There is no pure “right” to free speech on Twitter, any more than there is a “right” to upload pictures on Facebook or a “right” to post videos to YouTube. However, in the US context, Trump blocking people on Twitter could be seen as a free speech violation as the government (which Trump represents) cannot restrict speech in public forums unless it can be argued that such speech would lead to violence. The issue, of course, is whether Trump’s account on a privately owned platform should qualify as such a forum. The bottom line of Twitter’s refusal to punish Trump, and its acceptance of his blocking followers, connects to the political economy of media and how the bars for entry and dismissal are periodically raised and lowered in the pragmatic service of profit. When the ESPN journalist Jemele Hill (who had previously tweeted that Trump was a “bigot” and “a white supremacist”) was suspended for two weeks by ESPN for criticising National Football League owners for their position on anti-racism protests, the president of the United States used his Twitter account to single her out to his huge number of followers, leading to a torrent of online abuse. How the targeting of an individual by a national leader – with disturbing results that Trump must surely have known would come – can be rationalised by Twitter as key to democracy is a mystery, but the juxtaposition of a commercial journalist’s suspension from her job for offering an opinion, and President Trump’s freedom to attack her on a commercial forum, is a stark reminder that speech is freer for some, and far more expensive for others. • Christian Christensen is professor of journalism studies at Stockholm University.

The threat has received scant attention so far from those involved in nuclear military planning and the procurement of weapons, the report said. It blames this partly on failure to keep up with fast-moving advances, lack of skilled staff and the slowness of institutional change. “Nuclear weapons systems were developed before the advancement of computer technology and little consideration was given to potential cyber vulnerabilities. As a result, current nuclear strategy often overlooks the widespread use of digital technology in nuclear systems,” the authors of the study said. Nuclear weapons systems are at threat from hostile states, criminal groups and terrorist organisations exploiting cyber vulnerabities. “The likelihood of attempted cyber-attacks on nuclear weapons systems is relatively high and increasing from advanced persistent threats from states and non-state groups,” the report said. It cited examples such as a report the US could have infiltrated the supply chain of North Korea’s missile system that contributed to a test failure in April last year. The silos of US nuclear-tipped Minuteman intercontinental ballistic missiles “are believed to be particularly vulnerable to cyber attacks”. The study also recorded illicit trafficking in Moldova and Georgia of radioactive and nuclear materials; a group in Belgium affiliated to Islamic State monitoring the movements of a nuclear scientist; and German-owned Patriot missiles reported to have been hacked in 2015. The report, Cybersecurity of Nuclear Weapons Systems: Threats, Vulnerabilities and Consequences, was written by Beyza Unal, a research fellow at London-based Chatham House who previously worked on strategic analysis at Nato, and Patricia Lewis, research director of the international security department at Chatham House. “There are a number of vulnerabilities and pathways through which a malicious actor may infiltrate a nuclear weapons system without a state’s knowledge,” the report said. “Human error, systems failures, design vulnerabilities and susceptibilities within the supply chain all represent common security issues in nuclear weapons systems.” The authors noted there is a dilemma between needing the private sector in order to keep up with advances in technology and the risks they bring with them. “Many aspects of nuclear weapons development and systems management are privatised in the US and in the UK, potentially introducing a number of private-sector supply chain vulnerabilities.” It added: “Presently, this is a relatively ungoverned space and these vulnerabilities could serve to undermine the overall integrity of national nuclear weapons systems. For example, the backdoors in software that companies often maintain to fix bugs and patch systems are targets for cyber-attacks once they are discovered and become known.” Potential artificial intelligence (AI) applications, while creating new opportunities for cybersecurity, add another layer of complexity for nuclear weapons that could be exploited. The authors criticise military failures to – so far – take the issue seriously. “Military procurement programmes tend not to pay adequate consideration to emerging cyber risks – particularly to the supply chain – regardless of the government regulations for protecting data against cyber attacks. This could be due to constantly lagging behind the fast-moving nature of cyber attacks, a lack of skilled personnel and the slow institutional and organisational implementation of changes.” Digital components, material and software can quickly become obsolete and, without proper updates and patching, “they are subject to intrusion”. The authors cite the UK’s new aircraft carrier, HMS Queen Elizabeth, which appeared to be using the same version of Windows in its control room at the outdated system that left the NHS exposed in the WannaCry ransomware attack in May last year."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"voluntary-sector-network/2018/jan/11/nhs-winter-crisis-volunteers-public-services","type":"article","sectionId":"voluntary-sector-network","sectionName":"Voluntary Sector Network","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-11T07:21:14Z","webTitle":"The NHS is in crisis.

But it's not up to volunteers to rescue it","bodyText":"With another winter crisis in the NHS fully upon us, many in the voluntary sector are once again waiting for the call to provide resources to help our hospitals. A year ago, that call was answered by the Red Cross, when its chief executive described the situation as a humanitarian crisis. But what assistance can the voluntary and charity sector provide, and even if it could, should it? This is a question with which the public sector has struggled for some time. Local councils have suffered cuts at an unprecedented scale and have increasingly looked to charitable activity to support services they used to provide. Councillors have weighed up whether community centres and libraries can be run, or owned, by community and voluntary groups. In Lambeth, attempts have even been made to get volunteers to keep the streets clean. So far, councils have focused on non-statutory services and there have been a number of very positive initiatives, from using volunteers to work with individuals such as care leavers, or groups like the Citizen’s Advice Bureau helping with benefit advice. But there is an increasing tendency for central government to look to a reserve army of volunteers to prop up services it is statutorily required to deliver, including immigration, with a suggestion of overcoming staff shortages by using volunteer border officers; schools, with the idea of volunteers replacing teaching assistants; and health, with the suggestion volunteers could flood the hospitals to make things better.But the notion that volunteers can save the NHS is misplaced. If the problem is a shortage of beds and ambulances, with a dearth of doctors and nurses, volunteers are not going to get anyone very far. Volunteers are particularly good at helping with less technical tasks that do not carry a lot of risk and that are often about relationships. If volunteers talk to people waiting in A&amp;E, that can take pressure away from frontline professionals. Volunteers can often do this better than public servants who – inevitably and rightly – are tied up in formal systems that can make it difficult to build the relationships that are so important for patients. There are some interesting initiatives. Community interest company HelpForce, for instance, is a new attempt to organise mass volunteering a bit better, and provide support for the NHS. It is well funded, and it will be interesting to see what it can achieve. But we need to recognise the limitations of organisations like this. However good they are, they cannot reduce waiting lists, A&amp;E waiting times, or help recruit more doctors and nurses. Rather than be deployed in times of crisis when demand is high, the voluntary sector is most effective at reducing demand for public services in the first place. Volunteers can, for instance, help people stay in their homes, rather than be admitted to hospital. They can offer help for recently-discharged patients, allowing doctors to free up more beds. More widely, our own research shows that it’s good for people’s health when they are involved with their local community and voluntary sector. But when the NHS faces a winter crisis, even if the voluntary sector could help, is it the role of charities to bail out a public service that the state has allowed to run behind demand? Many people feel the answer is no. Volunteers do not like to be seen as a cheap source of mass labour, there to undercut paid professionals. And they do not like the idea that they might be used to let politicians off the hook when they have failed to finance public services properly. They also wonder if running services through volunteers is, in the end, sustainable. Arguably, there is a role for volunteers and charities and community groups alongside public services, especially where the key requirement is the ability to empathise with a family or an individual. But what Jeremy Hunt and other politicians must not do is to treat the generous spirit of volunteers as a panacea for the problems of underfunded and under supported public services. It is wrong and, worse, it won’t work.

While we believe any retraction of library provision will have a debilitating impact upon those who rely on them (including future generations), we write with particular concern about a library not mentioned in the various “options” that Northamptonshire county council sets out: the Northampton central library, on Abington Street, Northampton, home to an important collection of the manuscripts and books of the poet John Clare. The council’s plans seem to mask the fact that this library will also be hugely affected by reductions in the number, seniority, qualifications and experience of staff that will be retained in that library. Many staff in this library – not mentioned in the plans – are threatened with redundancy or an effective downgrading of their post, no matter what option is chosen. This library is home to many a unique resource pertaining to Northamptonshire history and culture, but we are specifically concerned about the John Clare collection – arguably the world’s greatest archive of the poet’s manuscripts, of his books, and of a wide collection of unique ephemera and publications by or about Clare. The collection is used by international scholars and artists of all kinds, and has been a hub and stimulus of activity in response to this increasingly significant poet for many decades. The collection at Northampton has always been maintained by expert, attentive, scholarly librarians, who do their level best with scant resources to make this publicly owned archive available to readers and researchers of all kinds. Our central concern here is that – given the size of the cuts planned, and the loss of staff and expertise delivered by all of the council’s options – there will be a permanently detrimental effect upon the care and curation of the Clare collection. We worry that this internationally significant collection will no longer be safe in the council’s hands. We would like the council to give public and quantified assurances that this will not be the case.

Blood, sweat, toil and – in many cases – school, parental and financial help goes into writing the Ucas personal statement. But with the cap on student numbers lifted and universities desperate to fill places, will anyone actually read them? In the past, it was largely admissions tutors working in departments reviewing personal statements. But as applications have increased – some universities get over 45,000 applicants per year – many institutions now employ external “professional selectors” to do the job for them. As a result, although some universities do scrutinise them carefully, many statements won’t even make it through an initial paper sift, according to Paul Teulon, director of admissions at King’s College London. Others are simply looked at for an “overall sense check”. “My instinct is that they’re probably not being read by teaching staff and I suspect they are being read less and less,” says Steven Jones, researcher in higher education at Manchester Institute of Education. As participation has gone up and many universities have become less selective, he says, the attention paid to personal statements has lessened even further. “Even the more elite universities need to fill places and beneath that level there’s a whole raft that don’t even look at them at all.” Perhaps a reduced focus on statements would be fairer on students anyway. The 2004 Schwartz Report suggested that personal statements often were not the applicant’s own work, which might tell you more about a candidate’s socio-economic background than their ability. Ucas didn’t accept the report’s recommendation to change the process, even though figures show that the most advantaged applicants are six times more likely to enter a high-tariff institution compared to the most disadvantaged. Lee Elliot Major, CEO of the Sutton Trust, questions the usefulness of the personal statement. There’s a whole industry built around them, he says, because there’s so much at stake. “Private tutors and former graduates prepare and write them for these young people. You have to look at the system and ask the question: is it fair? I don’t think it is. Ucas should review it.” Clare Marchant, chief executive of Ucas, said a survey of 118 universities by Ucas in 2016 found that 89% of them used personal statements in their initial decision making. “Writing a personal statement gives students the opportunity to use their own words to create their own stories about their ambitions and to advocate for what they want,” Marchant said. Some departments have already changed their admissions policies. “We now use them for 50% of ratings of candidates and I anticipate that will fall in years to come,” explains Simon Atkinson, who interviews medicine, veterinary and dentistry students at the University of Bristol, and thinks that personal statements will eventually not be used in medicine at all. “They’re too unreliable, too easy to get a lot of help with writing, and too easy to write things that aren’t terribly true,” he says. Independent schools tend to like personal statements because they advantage their own students – and these schools are powerful lobbyists in the higher education sector. But are there any reasons to keep them? The statement arguably helps to inform the overall picture of an applicant. Some students may meanwhile have extenuating reasons for under-performance, and a statement can let universities know about it. In cases where a decision is not clear cut, academics say a strong personal statement can tip the balance in the applicant’s favour. Students might get lower grade offers based on how good their personal statement is. But how often does this actually happen? There is little transparency or consistency in the way they are read. Even within universities, it differs between departments. As for students submitting applications next week (15 January), best not worry about who’s reading it – just make sure you send it off on time and follow our dos and don’ts."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jan/10/russian-influence-brexit-vote-detailed-us-senate-report","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-10T15:15:14Z","webTitle":"Russian bid to influence Brexit vote detailed in new US Senate report","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/10/russian-influence-brexit-vote-detailed-us-senate-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jan/10/russian-influence-brexit-vote-detailed-us-senate-report","fields":{"headline":"Russian bid to influence Brexit vote detailed in new US Senate report","bodyText":"Russia’s attempts to influence British democracy and the potential vulnerability of parts of the UK political system to anti-democratic meddling during the EU referendum have been detailed in a report prepared by the US Senate. The report by Democrats on the Senate foreign relations committee, titled Putin’s asymmetric assault on democracy in Russia and Europe: implications for US national security, pinpoints the way in which UK campaign finance laws do not require disclosure of political donations if they are from “the beneficial owners of non-British companies that are incorporated in the EU and carry out business in the UK”. This opacity, the report suggests, “may have enabled Russian-related money to be directed with insufficient scrutiny to various UK political actors”. “Investigative journalists have also raised questions about the sources of sudden and possibly illicit wealth that may have been directed to support the Brexit ‘Leave’ campaign.” The UK Electoral Commission has already launched an investigation into the issue. The senators point out that Ukip and its then-leader, Nigel Farage, did not just fan anti-EU sentiment but also “criticised European sanctions on Russia, and provided flattering assessments of Russian President Putin”. The report adds that although officially the Russian government asserted its neutrality on Brexit, its English-language media outlets RT and Sputnik covered the referendum campaign extensively and offered ‘’systematically one-sided coverage’’. The senators also challenge the adequacy of the investigations by Facebook and Twitter into the allegations of widespread social media interference by the Russians during the referendum. They reference University of Edinburgh research showing more than 400 Russian-run Twitter accounts that had been active in the US election had also been actively posting about Brexit. In addition, the senators noted that research conducted by a joint team of experts from the University of California at Berkeley and Swansea University reportedly identified 150,000 Twitter accounts with various Russian ties that disseminated messages about Brexit. The report also points to the vast flow of Russian money into the UK, including the London property market. It records how the Metropolitan police noted that a total value of £180m in properties in the UK had been put under investigation as possibly purchased with corrupt proceeds by secretive offshore companies. Overall the report breaks little new ground in terms of fresh evidence but says the picture remains incomplete. “The allegations that have emerged of Russian interference prior to the Brexit referendum are all the more stunning given the innate resilience within British society to the Kremlin’s anti-democratic agenda,” the senators wrote. The report, which chronicles Russian disinformation efforts in 19 countries, calls on Donald Trump to assert leadership on Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election, saying: “Never before in American history has so clear a threat to national security been so clearly ignored by a US president.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/jan/12/britannia-best-tv-show-this-week","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-12T12:00:28Z","webTitle":"The best TV this week: Jez Butterworth’s terrifyingly bonkers Britannia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jan/12/britannia-best-tv-show-this-week","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jan/12/britannia-best-tv-show-this-week","fields":{"headline":"The best TV this week: Jez Butterworth’s terrifyingly bonkers Britannia","bodyText":"Britannia What did the Romans ever do for us?

Not sure what to buy that cousin you see every other year? There’s a Killers Best Of for that. How about your best friend’s new girlfriend who likes pop but seems quite emo? Pink’s Greatest Hits will do nicely. Things are changing, however, and it’s all streaming’s fault. According to a report in Music Week, only two new Best Of collections made 2017’s Top 100 of biggest sellers: Vera Lynn’s Vera Lynn 100 and perennial Best Of favourite Elvis Presley’s The 50 Greatest Hits. That’s four fewer than in 2012 and way below 2008 when 13 collections made that year’s list. So does this mark the end for the hastily cobbled-together, record contract-fulfilling greatest hits collection? What streaming has given consumers is options: they can either compile their own artist playlists, swapping a single they never liked anyway for a beloved deep cut, or simply utilise most streaming platforms’ in-built artist playlists for maximum efficiency. “Streaming has rendered these collections largely obsolete,” says UK chart historian James Masterton. “Collections were once a convenient gateway to discover the music of a famous act from before your time, but now you can wander through their complete work in your own time on Spotify.” So what of the artists yet to release even one definitive Best Of? Few could deny hit-machine Rihanna a greatest hits victory lap, but why would she bother now? (For what it’s worth, she should have chucked one out in 2014 as a pre-Anti palate cleanser). How about Beyoncé? Don’t her fans deserve the chance to splash out on a collectable “deluxe” singles box set? And a mid-00s-heavy Justin Timberlake compendium pre-his new Bon Iver makeover would have been ideal. One way around this problem is to dress up old songs in shiny new clothes. Elvis’s estate has reconfigured his back catalogue with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra to lucrative effect, while in 2012 Jeff Lynne re-recorded ELO’s hits and scored a Top 10 album (a live Best Of followed a year later). Even Kylie Minogue released an album of “stripped-back” orchestral versions of her bangers in 2012 (just four months after a “proper” Best Of).

His warning came as Italian media reported that Brussels was keeping a close eye on the situation to ensure compliance with EU waste disposal rules. “There are no signs of infringement for now,” an EU spokesperson told Il Messaggero. “It’s the national authority’s responsibility to ensure waste management functions properly and to resolve difficulties. Nevertheless, the [European] commission will continue to monitor the situation.” In 2010, the European court of justice ruled that Italy had breached the directive after rubbish piled up on the streets of Naples in 2008. Rome has long been plagued by waste management woes, but the situation became acute when collections were disrupted during the Christmas holiday. Parts of the capital have since been cleaned, but in outlying areas bins are still overflowing. The crisis has become a key issue in campaigning for Italy’s general election on 4 March. M5S, which is leading in the polls, has accused the centre-left Democratic party of exploiting the problems for political gain. A resolution also depends on Lazio governors finding a solution that will allow Rome to recycle waste without outside help. Ever since the Malagrotta landfill was closed in 2013 the city has been sending tons of household waste to Austria and other Italian regions. Ama, the company in charge of collecting Rome’s litter, has long been accused of inefficiency. “These problems are not new,” said Marcello Clarich, a professor of administrative law at Rome’s Luiss University. “It’s a long story involving different parties, but certainly it hasn’t improved over the last few years.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2018/jan/14/james-graham-on-my-radar-cultural-highlights-hull-bush-theatre","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-14T10:00:24Z","webTitle":"On my radar: James Graham’s cultural highlights","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/jan/14/james-graham-on-my-radar-cultural-highlights-hull-bush-theatre","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/jan/14/james-graham-on-my-radar-cultural-highlights-hull-bush-theatre","fields":{"headline":"On my radar: James Graham’s cultural highlights","bodyText":"James Graham grew up in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire. After taking a drama degree at the University of Hull, he gained recognition as a writer in residence at London’s Finborough theatre. In 2006 he won the Pearson playwriting bursary and in 2007 won the Catherine Johnson award for best play for Eden’s Empire. After a sellout run at the National, his play This House was nominated for a 2013 Olivier award for best new play, and last year his plays Ink and Labour of Love premiered in London and Quiz in Chichester. Graham wrote the screenplay for the 2014 film x+y, and the 2015 Channel 4 film Coalition. His play The Culture – A Farce in Two Acts opens at Hull Truck on 26 January, and Quiz transfers to the West End in spring. His play This House tours the UK, starting in Leeds on 23 February. 1 | Place Humber Street, Hull Hull’s year as City of Culture has been transformative for people’s confidence and pride in their city, and also in terms of economic benefits. Three years ago Humber Street was deserted; now it’s a thriving location day and night. You can have breakfast by the marina at a great cafe called Thieving Harry’s, go to an art gallery in an empty vegetable warehouse and visit Yorkshire’s first gin distillery bar – even though I hate gin they have a great selection of whiskies too. At the Fruit Market you can see live music or comedy, or dance to a club night. It’s a street full of variety, and it feels very welcoming and open to everyone. 2 | Theatre 2018 at the Bush theatre, London The Bush is close to my heart – I had one of my early shows there – and it’s recently been refurbished. It now feels like a huge focal point for the community, precisely what a theatre should be. This year they’re featuring work from loads of writers I admire, including the incredible actress Monica Dolan, performing one of her own plays, The B*easts. Another play I’m excited about is An Adventure by Vinay Patel, whose contribution to The Good Immigrant book a couple of years ago really resonated with me. The season represents the great diversity of that community and the Bush feels like a go-to place for new writing. 3 | Documentary Best of Enemies (2015) Best of Enemies, directed by Morgan Neville and Robert Gordon, is about the rivalry between Gore Vidal and William F Buckley Jr, two of the greatest political minds of the 20th century, and focuses on their TV debates during the 1968 Republican and Democrat conventions. That year was a watershed in US politics: TV news began to turn debate into theatre and that level of populist reporting of politics is something we’re living with to this day. There’s just something about the way these two people speak – their intelligence and means of expression are so seductive to listen to, whether you’re on the left or the right. I love having it on in the background. It’s on Netflix and sometimes I stick it on when I’m ironing or cleaning or doing my tax returns. 4 | Podcast People Fixing the World (2015) I was introduced to this podcast by one of the actors in the play I’m rehearsing. I can’t listen to music when I’m jogging because I hate it so much it began to kill my enjoyment of all my favourite songs – so I listen to podcasts. These are great: bite-sized broadcasts that look at the inventive ways people are trying to tackle serious problems. One is about a charity in London called Steel Warriors, where they melted down confiscated knives to build a community gym made out of steel. In a climate of totally depressing political discourse, occasionally I need to listen to something unapologetically uplifting while I’m running around south London wheezing. 5 | Book Fall Out by Tim Shipman I love writing that can dramatise recent events – it’s a great way to access the chaos and confusion that surrounds us. Fall Out follows Tim Shipman’s great book All Out War about the Brexit referendum. Here he chronicles the year from the referendum result to the surprise election result in June 2017. It reads like a gripping thriller, except it’s more frightening because it’s all true and it’s happening right now. The way he writes is very dramatic and he also humanises politicians in a way I aspire to do myself. You’re able to really understand the motivations of the people driving the narrative. 6 | Film Call Me By Your Name (2017) I saw this recently and adored it. I loved its delicacy in dramatising a relationship between a visiting student and the family’s teenage son, set against the backdrop of Italy in the 1980s. It was adapted by James Ivory from a book by André Aciman, and there’s very little dialogue – it’s all done through looks or expressions. I’m trying to learn the best way to adapt novels for the screen and I thought they handled this brilliantly. I’m hoping it gets the recognition it deserves in the many awards this year. It also made me want to ride a bike around Italy, but that’s for another time. 7 | Travel Caledonian sleeper train This is the overnight sleeper that travels from London to Fort William, Inverness, Aberdeen and other places. It’s been completely redesigned with refurbished beds and rooms: it has that classic wood-panelled European style but it’s also very clean, crisp and modern, with white bed linen and sleek booths to sit in. I’m obsessed by trains – maybe it’s the part of me that loved reading Murder on the Orient Express as a kid. I find the idea of sleeping and eating on a train so romantic. I’m determined to travel in style by sleeper next time I go up to the Edinburgh festival."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"film/2018/jan/11/tempest-review-mexican-documentary-tempestad-tatiana-huezo","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-11T07:00:14Z","webTitle":"Tempestad review – twin stories of broken Mexican lives, exquisitely told","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jan/11/tempest-review-mexican-documentary-tempestad-tatiana-huezo","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/jan/11/tempest-review-mexican-documentary-tempestad-tatiana-huezo","fields":{"headline":"Tempestad review – twin stories of broken Mexican lives, exquisitely told","bodyText":"Tatiana Huezo’s exquisite documentary speaks painful truths but is worth every minute. It pares everything back to long-held shots that unfold like a cinematic slideshow, accompanied almost entirely by voiceover tracks from two Mexican women whose stories mirror each other. Miriam was working at Cancún airport when she was arrested on spurious charges of human trafficking and sent to a prison run by a criminal cartel where she was tortured while her family were forced to pay for her “upkeep”. Then, just as suddenly as she was arrested, she was discharged. As she describes her ordeal of many years, heard but not seen, shots of random people travelling on buses, landscapes reeling by and other kinds of photogenic material scroll across the screen, as illustrating her lonely homeward journey. Meanwhile, Adela, a professional clown from a long line of circus folk, who is shown on camera, describes how her daughter Monica, a university student, was kidnapped 10 years ago and has never been found. Adela still looks for her child everywhere, even though both the police and criminal elements (there’s barely any difference between the two) threaten her and her family if she doesn’t stop her search. Luminous cinematography and a plangent but sparingly used score buttress the powerfully composed storytelling."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"books/2018/jan/10/hilary-mantel-and-alan-moore-voice-grave-concerns-for-john-clare-archive","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-10T13:54:17Z","webTitle":"Hilary Mantel and Alan Moore voice 'grave concerns' for John Clare archive","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jan/10/hilary-mantel-and-alan-moore-voice-grave-concerns-for-john-clare-archive","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/jan/10/hilary-mantel-and-alan-moore-voice-grave-concerns-for-john-clare-archive","fields":{"headline":"Hilary Mantel and Alan Moore voice 'grave concerns' for John Clare archive","bodyText":"Hilary Mantel, Alan Moore and Simon Armitage have joined authors raising “grave concerns” about the custodianship of the poet John Clare’s manuscripts in advance of major planned cuts to the library service in Northamptonshire. The 19th-century nature poet was born in the Northamptonshire village of Helpston to illiterate parents, and worked as a labourer. Known for works celebrating rural life, including The Shepherd’s Calendar and Poems Descriptive of Rural Life and Scenery, a large collection of his manuscripts, letters and books is housed at Northampton central library, as the John Clare Collection. Authors and academics led by Simon Kövesi, editor of the John Clare Society Journal, have written to the Guardian to voice concern that the collection will be hit by the swingeing cuts expected for the region’s libraries. Northamptonshire county council, which is looking to make £115m savings in the next four years, is currently consulting on the future of its library service. Three options have been proposed for the region’s libraries, each of which will see at least 21 of its 36 branches closed. The consultation closes on 13 January. Although Northampton central library is not threatened with closure, Kövesi and major names including authors Michael Rosen, Philip Pullman and Andrew Motion, as well as Clare’s biographer Jonathan Bate, fear that the plans will see the branch “hugely impacted by reductions in the number, seniority, qualifications and experience of staff that will be retained in that library”. “Many staff in this library – not mentioned in your plans – are threatened with redundancy or an effective downgrading of their post, no matter what option is chosen,” says the authors’ letter. The letter was also signed by Toby Jones, who played Clare in the 2015 film By Our Selves, the film’s director Andrew Kotting, and by the comedian Josie Long, who performed a standup show about the poet in 2013. Comics legend Moore, another of the letter’s signatories, is a Northamptonshire native who has written Clare into some of his works. Moore has previously called the council’s proposals for library closures “completely unacceptable and completely monstrous”. “The priorities of this council are appalling,” said Moore in October, adding that the council was “closing down the one means that many people have of actually properly educating themselves”. Clare, the authors say, is an “increasingly significant poet” and the collection is used by international scholars and artists. The manuscripts ended up in Northampton because Clare was resident in a Northampton asylum from 1841 until his death in 1864. His memorial describes him as “the Northamptonshire peasant poet”. The letter says: “This collection at Northampton has always been maintained by expert, attentive, scholarly librarians, who do their level best with scant resource to make this publicly owned collection available to readers and researchers of all kinds. “Our central concern here is that – given the size of the cuts you plan, and the loss of staff and expertise delivered by all of your options – there will be a permanently detrimental effect upon the care and curation of the Clare collection. We worry that this internationally significant collection will no longer be safe in your hands. We would like the council to give public and quantified assurances that this will not be the case.” A spokesperson for Northamptonshire county council stressed that the central library would be kept in all three of the options currently under consultation, and that there were no current proposals that would affect the archive: “We acknowledge the importance of the John Clare Collection and our responsibility to it. It is not our intention to make any changes that could harm, be detrimental to or reduce accessibility to the collection.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"technology/2018/jan/08/james-damore-sues-google-discrimination-white-male-conservatives","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-08T23:10:24Z","webTitle":"James Damore sues Google, alleging intolerance of white male conservatives","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jan/08/james-damore-sues-google-discrimination-white-male-conservatives","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/jan/08/james-damore-sues-google-discrimination-white-male-conservatives","fields":{"headline":"James Damore sues Google, alleging intolerance of white male conservatives","bodyText":"Google is facing renewed controversy over its alleged intolerance toward conservatives at the company, after a class action lawsuit filed by former engineer James Damore disclosed almost 100 pages of screen shots of internal communications in which employees discuss sensitive political issues. The evidence appended to the lawsuit, which was filed on Monday, includes a message from Rachel Whetstone, who worked as a senior Google executive after a career in the UK Conservative party, bemoaning “prejudiced and antagonistic” political discourse at the company. Damore, who was fired in 2017 after writing a controversial memo about gender and technology, alleges in the lawsuit that white, male conservative employees at Google are “ostracized, belittled, and punished”. The lawsuit claims that numerous Google managers maintained “blacklists” of conservative employees with whom they refused to work; that Google has a list of conservatives who are banned from visiting the campus; and that Google’s firings of Damore and the other named plaintiff, David Gudeman, were discriminatory. “We look forward to defending against Mr Damore’s lawsuit in court,” a Google spokesperson said in a statement. The company’s workforce, like much of the rest of the tech industry, is overwhelmingly white, Asian, and male. In 2017, the US Department of Labor accused Google of “extreme pay discrimination” against women, and a group of women have filed a class-action lawsuit against the company alleging systemic wage discrimination. But the Damore lawsuit purports to expose a cultural bias toward promoting diversity and “social justice” that, the suit claims, has created a “protected, distorted bubble of groupthink”. Efforts to increase the representation of women and underrepresented racial minorities, which companies like Google have undertaken in response to external criticism, are cast in the suit as illegal discrimination against the majority. Screenshots of internal communications reveal numerous employees appearing to support the idea of being intolerant toward certain points of view, such as one post arguing that Google should respond to Damore’s memo by “disciplining or terminating those who have expressed support”. In another post, a manager stated his intention to “silence” certain “violently offensive” perspectives, writing: “There are certain ‘alternative views, including different political views’ which I do not want people to feel safe to share here … You can believe that women or minorities are unqualified all you like … but if you say it out loud, then you deserve what’s coming to you”. Internal posts discussing the debate around diversity at Google, such as a meme of a penguin with the text “If you want to increase diversity at Google fire all the bigoted white men”, are filed as an appendix to the lawsuit under the heading “Anti-Caucasian postings”. One manager is quoted as posting: “I keep a written blacklist of people whom I will never allow on or near my team, based on how they view and treat their coworkers. That blacklist got a little longer today.” Another screenshot reveals a manager proposing the creation of a list of “people who make diversity difficult”, and weighing the possibility that individuals could have “something resembling a trial” before being included. In the 2014 email from Whetstone, who served as senior vice-president of communications and public policy at Google for several years before departing for Uber, she wrote: “It seems like we believe in free expression except when people disagree with the majority view … I have lost count of the times at Google, for example, people tell me privately that they cannot admit their voting choice if they are Republican because they fear how other Googlers react.” The complaint argues that Google’s tolerance for “alternative lifestyles” – the company has internal mailing lists for people interested in “furries, polygamy, transgenderism, and plurality” – does not extend to conservatism. One employee who emailed a list seeking parenting advice related to imparting a child with “traditional gender roles and patriarchy from a very young age” was allegedly chastised by human resources. The suit also alleges that Google maintains a “secret” blacklist of conservative authors who are banned from being on campus. Curtis Yarvin, a “neoreactionary” who blogs under the name Mencius Moldbug, was allegedly removed from the campus by security after being invited to lunch. The plaintiffs subsequently learned, it is claimed in the suit, that Alex Jones, the InfoWars conspiracy theorist, and Theodore Beale, an “alt-right” blogger known as VoxDay, were also banned from the campus. The suit will likely reignite the culture wars that have swirled around the tech industry since the election of Donald Trump. Many liberals within the tech industry have pressured their employers to take a stand against Trump policies, such as the Muslim travel ban, and companies have struggled to decide the extent to which they will allow the resurgent movement of white nationalists to use their platforms to organize. Damore’s firing in August last year was heavily covered by the rightwing media, which portrayed the saga as evidence of Silicon Valley’s liberal bias, and the engineer was transformed into a political martyr by prominent members of the “alt-right”. In making its case against Google, the suit reveals some of the internal backlash Damore received after his memo went viral, including a mass email in which a Google director called the memo “repulsive and intellectually dishonest” and an email to Damore from a fellow engineer stating: “I will keep hounding you until one of us is fired.” Gudeman, the second named plaintiff, was fired following a post-election controversy in another online forum at Google. A Google employee posted that he was concerned for his safety under a Trump administration because he had already been “targeted by the FBI (including at work) for being a Muslim”. According to the suit, Gudeman responded skeptically to the comment, raising questions about the FBI’s motives for investigating the employee, and was reported to HR. Gudeman was fired shortly thereafter, the suit claims, after Google HR told him that he had “accused [the Muslim employee] of terrorism”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jan/08/church-of-england-finds-vicar-guilty-of-spiritual-abuse-of-15-year-old-boy","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-08T19:37:51Z","webTitle":"Church of England finds vicar guilty of spiritual abuse of 15-year-old boy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/08/church-of-england-finds-vicar-guilty-of-spiritual-abuse-of-15-year-old-boy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jan/08/church-of-england-finds-vicar-guilty-of-spiritual-abuse-of-15-year-old-boy","fields":{"headline":"Church of England finds vicar guilty of spiritual abuse of 15-year-old boy","bodyText":"The Church of England has found a vicar guilty of spiritually abusing a teenage boy, after putting him under “unacceptable pressure” during intensive prayer and Bible-study sessions in the boy’s bedroom. In the first judgment of its kind, a C of E tribunal found that the Revd Timothy Davis, the vicar of Christ Church, Abingdon, in Oxfordshire, was guilty of misconduct under clergy disciplinary measures. The ruling was published on Monday as an online survey found that two-thirds of 1,591 respondents said they had personally experienced spiritual abuse. The survey, carried out by Bournemouth University for the Churches’ Child Protection Advisory Service (CCPAS), a safeguarding charity, identified key characteristics of spiritual abuse as coercion and control, manipulation and pressuring of individuals, control through the misuse of religious texts and scripture, and providing a ‘divine’ rationale for behaviour”. The bishops’ disciplinary tribunal for the diocese of Oxfordshire said that Davis was guilty of “conduct unbecoming to the office and work of a clerk of holy orders through the abuse of spiritual power and authority”. There was no suggestion of any sexual contact. According to the 20-page judgment, Davis, who is in his 50s, became a mentor to a 15-year-old boy, named in the judgment as W1, in 2011. Over a period of 18 months, Davis “engaged in mentoring so intense that W1 was put under unacceptable pressure having regard to his age and maturity and was deprived of his freedom of choice as to whether to continue”. It added: “Under the guise of his authority [Davis] sought to control by the use of admonition, scripture, prayer and revealed prophecy the life of W1 and/or his relationship with his girlfriend.” During the 18 months, Davis moved into the family home, and engaged W1 in prayer and bible study for two-hour sessions in the boy’s bedroom. The vicar also went on holiday with the family. W1 described being mentored by Davis as “awful” and all-consuming, but did not feel able to challenge the priest. He told the tribunal that Davis became angry if he did not ring him or respond to texts. W1’s mother, who worked at the church, also felt unable to challenge Davis because he was her boss and had made it clear that God wanted his mentoring of W1 to continue. She told the tribunal she “was scared of going against God”. Davis told the panel that he was “shocked and confused” about the allegations, and had “no idea of the effect I was apparently having”. Clergy guidelines acknowledge the power that priests can have over others, and state such power must not be used to bully, manipulate or denigrate. Clergy should never seek to remove autonomy from a person, nor should power be exercised inappropriately, the guidelines say. Davis was suspended by the diocese of Oxford in July 2016. A psychiatrist told the tribunal he had been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder in September 2016. In a statement, the diocese of Oxford said: “Abuse of spiritual authority and power falls far short of the obligations and duties of those in holy orders. Clergy are in a privileged position of trust in their congregations and communities … “The findings of the tribunal show that, sadly, Tim Davis betrayed the trust of everyone involved in a youth-mentoring programme at Christ Church, Abingdon – none more so than the young man and his family, who offered their home and hospitality to him.” A penalty will be imposed at a later hearing."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/08/the-guardian-view-on-bbc-pay-carrie-gracie-tells-the-story","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-08T19:50:08Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on BBC pay: Carrie Gracie tells the story | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/08/the-guardian-view-on-bbc-pay-carrie-gracie-tells-the-story","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/08/the-guardian-view-on-bbc-pay-carrie-gracie-tells-the-story","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on BBC pay: Carrie Gracie tells the story","bodyText":"Carrie Gracie’s open letter appealing for equal pay has dramatised a fight that has already been going on for the best part of 200 years. Her principled stand cannot be dismissed just because the sums involved are way beyond most people’s wildest dreams. She is very well paid. But her argument is about fairness: she wants the BBC to stick to the law. It must value men and women equally. Nearly 50 years after the equal pay act, it is shocking that it still needs saying. The BBC’s highly rated – but evidently not highly valued – China editor resigned because managers could not grasp that her case was not about more money, but more equality. Having been promoted to one of the big four international editor jobs on condition that all of them – Jon Sopel in Washington, Jeremy Bowen in Beirut, Katya Adler in Brussels and Carrie Gracie in Beijing – were paid equally, she was appalled when the figures for top earners published last summer included the men but not the women. The discrimination could hardly appear more explicit. For several months, the BBC flannelled around trying to head off a row without dealing with the substance of Ms Gracie’s complaint. Finally, after fruitless negotiations and a protracted and inconclusive grievance process, she did as she had warned the bosses she would, and resigned. She felt the alternative, to go back to Beijing, would be “colluding” with the BBC’s claim of equal pay – rather than continuing to challenge it. The BBC claims it has a good record on the gender pay-gap; but this is not about the unfair distribution of higher-paid jobs, it is about treating people doing work of equal value the same. And here the BBC is impaled on a pike it made itself with hundreds of secret individual pay deals that were never supposed to be seen by the female workforce. When some of these were exposed by the publication of top earners’ pay, the management tried to deal with the backlash by a policy of divide and rule, offering some rises to as many as 200 women who believe their pay is unfair. This response was morally wrong and politically inadequate. It perpetuates structural wage inequality that affects workers at every point on the pay scale, from millions of low earners where the median hourly gender pay gap for full-time work is just short of 10% to the elite of top earners where men earn half as much again as women doing similar work. The BBC is not alone. By this April, all companies employing more than 250 people are due to file a report to the government setting out a breakdown of pay and bonuses by gender. This is not, on the face of it, a very onerous obligation. Yet with a couple of month still to go, only 532 employers, 6% of those obliged to make the return, have actually done so. Some of those have rewritten the data on one or more occasion. There is a statistically improbable proportion of employers claiming no earnings gap at all. Clearly there is nothing unusual about pay secrecy. But a fair society depends on a high degree of transparency and accountability and the BBC is a public service organisation with a particular obligation to stick to the letter of the law. Yet this is also a fight for every woman. Ms Gracie’s brave and principled stand, of a piece with her record as a journalist, should give heart to anyone, anywhere who suspects she is not getting a fair deal."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/jan/08/helen-kellie-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-08T17:58:27Z","webTitle":"Helen Kellie obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jan/08/helen-kellie-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jan/08/helen-kellie-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Helen Kellie obituary","bodyText":"My daughter-in-law, Helen Kellie, who has died of lung cancer aged 52, was a broadcasting executive who helped to transform the BBC into an organisation with multiple online platforms. She then moved to Australia, where she championed diversity in broadcasting and was responsible, among other things, for persuading the Eurovision Song Contest to include Australian contestants. The daughter of James, a company director, and his wife, Angela (nee Paten), Helen was born in Sheffield and spent her early life in the Peak District. After Sheffield high school, she went to Merton College, Oxford, to study chemistry. She joined the BBC in 2000 and rose through the marketing ranks. In 2008, she became the first marketing director of BBC Worldwide, the part of the BBC that sells British-made programmes around the world. A BBC colleague told me: “Helen did not just make speeches about change to the online world, she delivered it.” In an interview in 2011, Helen herself said: “You need to make sure you are clear on what marketing is there to do, and that you don’t go into marketing bollocks – you talk straight.” In 2012, Michael Ebeid, the head of the partially government-funded multicultural Australian broadcaster SBS (Special Broadcasting Service) recruited Helen to help him transform the organisation. She rose rapidly to meld marketing with content in one job, a combination previously unheard of. A channel was launched for Indigenous Australians, and, in 2016, an Arabic channel. SBS now broadcasts programmes in 68 languages. To raise the profile of SBS, Helen persuaded the Eurovison Song Contest organisers to accept Australia as a contestant. In Stockholm in 2016, Dami Im, a South Korean migrant to Australia, came second, to the consternation of many Europeans. In 2017 Australia’s singer was Isaiah Firebrace, an Indigenous Australian, who came ninth. SBS and Helen were propelling Australian performers on to a world stage. In 2014, she commissioned Struggle Street, a three-part documentary about life in Mount Druitt, a poor community near Sydney. A press onslaught followed the trailers. The local mayor accused her of “poverty porn”, and demanded that the programmes be cancelled.

He told anyone who would listen his choice: Oprah Winfrey. “I threw out the name of a friend of mine, who I think the world of, she’s great,” he said at an event. “I think,” he added, “we would be a very formidable team.” He told the TV host Larry King: “I love Oprah. Oprah would always be my first choice.” It’s unknown whether Trump, then considering standing for the Reform party, ever seriously asked Winfrey, though it’s fun to imagine her reaction. Picture the meeting between this privileged white man, already an overblown character but yet to reach his reality TV-level fame, approaching Winfrey – giant TV star, Oscar-nominated actor and richer than Trump – to offer her a job. Winfrey would have been gracious, of course, as she declined his kind offer. Perhaps she would have howled with laughter after he left. Perhaps she made a mental note – to go with all the other mental notes of all the other men who belittled her – that should Trump ever become president, she would run against him. And win. Could she? At the Golden Globes on Sunday evening, Winfrey was presented with the Cecil B DeMille award and she gave a political speech at what was already a political event. She talked about the power of seeing Sidney Poitier win an Oscar, as she watched as a child, and paid tribute to Recy Taylor, the African-American woman who died less than two weeks ago and bravely spoke out after she was abducted and raped by six white men in 1944 (they were never brought to justice). “She lived, as we all have lived, too many years in a culture broken by brutally powerful men,” said Winfrey. “For too long women have not been heard or believed if they dared to speak their truth to the power of those men. But their time is up,” she said. “Their time is up.” I want all the girls watching, she said, voice rising, to know “that a new day is on the horizon”. “She launched a rocket tonight. I want her to run for president,” Meryl Streep told the Washington Post (the paper noted the “stump-like quality” of Winfrey’s oratory). The LA Times asked Winfrey’s partner Stedman Graham if she would do it and he reportedly said: “It’s up to the people. She would absolutely do it.” Which is the opposite of what Winfrey said in an interview with her friend Gayle King in 2015: “Not in this lifetime.” On Twitter, it was a foregone conclusion that Winfrey would run. In an interview with Bloomberg, recorded in December 2016, she was asked about her presidential ambitions and revealed she might be coming round to the idea in the wake of a politically inexperienced TV star taking office. “I never considered the question even a possibility,” she said. “I thought, ‘Oh gee, I don’t have the experience, I don’t know enough.’ And now I’m thinking, ‘Oh’.” It was a joke, King later said, but it didn’t stop the speculation. A Public Policy Polling survey found she would “lead Donald Trump 47-40 in a hypothetical 2020 Presidential contest”. In September, a spokesperson said “she is not running for office” after Winfrey tweeted a New York Post article headlined “Democrats’ best hope for 2020: Oprah”. Winfrey was, noted columnist John Podhoretz, “the mirror image of Trump, but more so”. It’s why it is unthinkable, laughable, now we know what a Trump presidency looks like, that he could ever have thought Winfrey would be his vice-president. There were the obvious differences: Trump is a white man, Winfrey is a black woman. He inherited wealth, her billions are self-made. Their backgrounds could not be more different. Trump grew up in privilege. Winfrey, whose ancestors were enslaved, was raised in poverty throughout an unstable childhood. He is an alleged sexual predator; she is a survivor of sexual abuse. On Sunday night, she distanced herself further from the president. In her speech, she paid tribute to the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, “because we all know the press is under siege these days”, adding: “I want to say that I value the press more than ever before, as we try to navigate these complicated times.” Today, Trump was set to name his own “MOST DISHONEST &amp; CORRUPT MEDIA AWARDS OF THE YEAR” (his capitals), to recognise “Dishonesty &amp; Bad Reporting in various categories from the Fake News Media”, though he has postponed their announcement, he said on Twitter, until next week because “interest in, and importance of, these awards is far greater than anyone could have anticipated!” If Trump is all about blame (immigrants, Muslims, the “fake mainstream” media), Winfrey trades in the potential for absolution. If you are a drugs cheat, or you have fictionalised parts of your memoir, you go on her show to confess and start the road to redemption (Winfrey’s hugely influential daytime TV show ran from 1986 to 2011, when she launched her own channel OWN). Trump is self-serving, where Winfrey advocates service to others. In a Smith College commencement speech last year, she talked a lot about service as empowerment and fulfilment. She has said one of her biggest lessons from her mentor, Maya Angelou, was: “When you learn, teach. When you get, give.” Trump, concluded the writer Mark Singer in a 1997 New Yorker profile, has “an existence unmolested by the rumbling of a soul”. Winfrey, by comparison, has built an entire career on expressing emotion, empathy and nurturing your interior life. “She is a singular figure of moral authority,” says Kathryn Lofton, professor of religious studies, American studies and history at Yale University, and author of Oprah: The Gospel of an Icon. “When we’re looking to find someone who represents the idea of America, the image that everyone turns to is Oprah Winfrey.” It’s a complicated image, she says, of the “possibility of change over time, of coming from nothing and becoming something extraordinary. It’s also an image of enormous wealth, huge capacity to affect the world, to know everyone famous and to have everyone famous want to know you. So she truly is singular.” However, adds Lofton, “political leadership and moral leadership are two things that are hard in America’s history to put together. There are figures – presidents, senators, congressmen – who are moral authorities, but they are fewer than one might think, and that’s partially because political life is tough. Oprah has spoken about thinking about [entering politics], but I think she has resisted because political life is hard to do without a lot of compromising. Oprah is really great at the moral messaging [but] she has not, in public life, shown herself to be someone who wants to get into issues of particular legislative agenda. She has run a massive company so it’s not as if she can’t do the work; it’s that it would really change her brand to move from moral leadership to political leadership.” Would Winfrey run? “I would never say never when it comes to Oprah,” says Lofton. The entire US political landscape has changed, and with it Winfrey’s hardline stance against running. “For many years, I used to think – until this election year, I thought – ‘Wow, I have no … Why do people say [I should run]? I have no qualifications to run,’” Winfrey told the TV host Jimmy Kimmel in June 2016. “After this year, I’m feeling really qualified.” The traditional people – usually senators and governors – “who have historically been successful [don’t tend to] gain the media authority you now have to have to win”, says Lofton. “Whatever you want to say about Donald Trump, he has a pervasive media presence. You have to have that from the word go. I think people forget that Obama was also a media superstar. That is really going to be the coin of national elected office in America at this point. Oprah has that.” The question, as it has been for years, is whether Winfrey would consider this huge step as living her best life."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"society/2018/jan/09/nurses-priced-out-of-housing-developments-on-former-nhs-sites","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-09T00:01:05Z","webTitle":"Nurses priced out of housing developments on former NHS sites","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jan/09/nurses-priced-out-of-housing-developments-on-former-nhs-sites","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/jan/09/nurses-priced-out-of-housing-developments-on-former-nhs-sites","fields":{"headline":"Nurses priced out of housing developments on former NHS sites","bodyText":"Four out of five homes built on former NHS sites that have been sold off to private developers will cost more than nurses can afford, according to new research. Fifty-nine NHS sites, including many former hospitals, have already been sold to housebuilders as part of the government’s public land sale programme to boost housing supply. But the large majority will be unaffordable to nurses, according to the New Economics Foundation (NEF) thinktank. It found that in London none of the homes will be in reach. Neither are the new developments adding much to the supply of affordable or social housing, the NEF found. Across the UK, only one in 10 of the homes built on the sold-off NHS sites analysed will be available at social rent. The average sale price is expected to be £315,000 – 10 times a nurse’s average annual salary. The Royal College of Nursing has previously warned that high housing costs could force 40% of nurses out of the capital by 2021. For newly qualified nurses the price of a typical first-time-buyer home is 16 times their salary in inner London, seven times in the West Midlands and six times in the north-west of England, the RCN said. In Colchester, Essex, the former psychiatric hospital Severalls is being transformed into more than 700 homes, none of which will be affordable to nurses and only 87 of which are classed as “affordable”, the NEF research showed. In St John’s Wood, north London, an NHS site has been sold to developers building three five-bedroom homes expected to cost around £3.75m – 121 times a nurse’s annual salary. There will be no affordable housing. Persimmon, whose chief executive, Jeff Fairburn, is in line for a bonus worth over £100m, is developing the site of Pontefract general infirmary in West Yorkshire with 117 homes, only seven of which will be social or affordable housing. However, the prices are mostly below £200,000. The report, No Homes for Nurses, estimated it would take a midwife over a century to afford the deposit for a market-rate home in Enfield where Chase Farm hospital is being redeveloped into 138 residential dwellings. Only 19% of them will be affordable, despite the borough having a target of 40%. “These NHS sites are community assets – they should be used to deliver community benefits,” said Joe Beswick, housing lead at NEF. “Public land, which is owned by all of us, is being flogged off to developers so they can make massive profits, while producing a tiny amount of affordable housing.” “This is a government with the wrong priorities on housing,” said John Healey, Labour’s shadow secretary of state for housing. “Ministers should be maximising the number of new genuinely affordable homes on public land, not treating low-cost housing as an afterthought.” The government has identified surplus Department of Health sites with capacity for 26,000 homes. Between 2015 and 2017 it was expecting to sell sites for 4,000 homes. In November, the government announced nurses would have first refusal on affordable housing generated through the sale of surplus NHS land. But the NEF argued that in London even affordable rent, which can be as high as 80% of market rent, is not affordable for nurses. A government spokesperson said: “Since April 2010 there have been more than 357,000 affordable homes provided in England, but we’re aware that more needs to be done, which is why we’re investing over £9bn in affordable housing. “For NHS staff in particular, we announced plans in October last year to give first refusal on affordable housing schemes built on NHS land sold for development.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/jan/08/reform-ration-or-return-to-first-principles-the-choices-for-the-nhs","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-08T19:10:58Z","webTitle":"Reform, ration, or return to first principles: the choices of the NHS | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jan/08/reform-ration-or-return-to-first-principles-the-choices-for-the-nhs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/jan/08/reform-ration-or-return-to-first-principles-the-choices-for-the-nhs","fields":{"headline":"Reform, ration, or return to first principles: the choices for the NHS","bodyText":"As one of Sir Bruce Keogh’s predecessors, I have every sympathy with his desire to defend government policy, however dubious (Chief doctor denies NHS privatisation by stealth, 1 January). But solemn assurances that accountable care organisations (ACOs) are “simply about improving the quality of care the NHS offers” are a little limp, however eminent their source, given that similar claims are routinely made to justify every NHS reorganisation. Remember Patients First, which heralded the introduction of the Thatcherite reforms? As your report highlighted (Private sector dominates NHS contract awards, 30 January), there is such a yawning gap between words and deeds over the creeping privatisation of the NHS that a little study of the small print is worthwhile. Looking at the detail led me to become one of five claimants seeking judicial review of the secretary of state and NHS England’s plans. Our legal claim is not concerned with whether ACOs are a good or bad idea. It is that such a radical and significant change cannot lawfully be introduced and implemented without public consultation, parliamentary scrutiny and legislation. This will be for the courts to decide; the case papers were filed on 11 December and we are very grateful to the more than 5,000 people who have contributed more than £160,000 to date to make this action possible. However, we also believe that the public and parliament should be very alarmed that by using commercial contracts to set up ACOs the government is exposing the NHS to major risks. If Sir Bruce really wants to reassure us, perhaps he could answer four simple questions. 1) If ACOs are so central to the delivery of effective health and social care, why not set them up as proper public bodies with clear democratic accountability? 2) If ACOs are not opening the door to greater private sector involvement in the NHS, why is their detailed documentation so explicit that they can indeed be private bodies? 3) How can ACOs, whose membership can include private organisations which make money from charges, be trusted to decide what is health care that is free and what is social care that can be charged for? 4) Long-term commercial contracts are hard to get right and expensive to get out of. How can we be sure that 10- to 15-year ACO contracts involving commercial organisations will not lead to similar haemorrhaging of scarce NHS funds as did the private finance initiative, which has left the NHS paying hundreds of millions to offshore finance companies? If our fears about ACOs really are so ill-founded, then answering these questions should not be difficult. Dr Graham Winyard NHS medical director 1993-98, Winchester • While increased funding for the NHS in England may prevent some of the problems being experienced and unwelcome measures being taken by our hospitals (Ministers face growing criticism over NHS crisis, 4 January), additional expenditure alone will not create the health and care system we need. This is evident by the fact that in Scotland the NHS spends 13.6% more per capita than England, yet its hospitals are reporting identical problems (Scottish health chiefs issue A&amp;E plea, 3 January). Even if the NHS in England were to match Scotland and receive an additional £16.6bn a year, we might still face difficulties. The current stress on the NHS seen in both countries is yet further evidence that to achieve a viable health and care system, radical change is needed, as envisaged in the Five Year Forward View, sustainability and transformation partnerships and accountable care systems. Professor Sir Nick Black London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine • The short vignettes from so-called experts (How to save the NHS, 6 January) were depressingly superficial and made the same economic error as those originally setting up the NHS: namely that improving the health and longevity of the population would ultimately reduce cost. The opposite is true. If people die prematurely, they cost the NHS nothing. The NHS is a victim of its own fantastic success, but the cost is rising exponentially. Prevention and looking after one’s own health (Cramer and O’Sullivan) is an important priority, but the reality is that in the end we all get sick, costing the NHS, and die no matter how well we look after ourselves. The idea (Milburn) that personalised medicine will decrease the bill is ludicrous. For example, patients shown to have particular subtypes of tumours, using genetic analysis, will be eligible for treatments that commonly cost tens of thousands of pounds per course extending lives by months to a couple of years with the attendant healthcare problems. Equally the idea of creating better links between hospitals and social services is all well and good, but where do family responsibilities come into this? No mention was made of the hopeless, sclerotic management of the NHS that needs a branch and root reform. Rather than these shallow reheated ideas, we need an honest debate about what the NHS can and cannot deliver within a reasonable budget (how much is the public willing to pay for what?) and, dare I say, how it should be rationed. Douglas Higgs Director, MRC molecular haematology unit, MRC Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford • Every year millions of pounds are poured into the NHS. Every year there is a winter health crisis and every year the NHS is kicked around as a political football by every political party. Before the NHS was established, health care for the majority in the UK was at best patchy and at worst unaffordable and non-existent, with women, children and the elderly suffering the most. Its founder Aneurin Bevan envisaged that in time the establishment of the NHS would improve the nation’s health and that the demand for its services would decrease; the opposite has happened. Currently some 40% of all health problems are as a result of lifestyle choices. Added to this an increasing ageing population with accompanying health and social care needs. It is now clear that the NHS in it present form is not fit for purpose and that long-term planning and restructuring is required. It is also clear that this task is too important for the short-term vision of all the political parties. We need this to be taken out of the political arena and placed with a royal commission made up of experts in the fields of medicine and health and social care who would be charged with planning a National Health Service for the next 30 or more years, not the current five-year political cycle.

I was excited to stand with Amy Poehler because she worked as a [restaurant] server for many years and experienced many of the things that we talk about in terms of women in the restaurant industry. One of the things she was saying on the red carpet is that not everybody can go to the Golden Globes but everybody in America either eats at, or has worked at, or knows somebody who has worked at, a restaurant. “This act of solidarity was not just about going to the Golden Globes in a black dress, but standing together for concrete policy change – getting rid of the $2.13 wage that in many states means you’ve got a 70% female workforce living entirely on tips.

So often in this work, women who have been marginalised in our societies are spoken ‘for’ and ‘about’, but we are rarely handed the microphone and invited to share our own narratives. Standing with women like Emma Watson, who work in Hollywood, and who have chosen to use platforms such as the Golden Globes to connect, to resist and to amplify, was uplifting. “At Imkaan, we hold two decades of experience of working around issues such as domestic violence, forced marriage and ‘honour-based’ violence.

Ben Rhodes, the longest-serving member of Obama’s foreign policy team, at the age of 40, has been a permanent fixture in his close orbit; inside the Obama camp, Rhodes was routinely said to be so close to the president that their minds had melded. “It happened relatively quickly,” Rhodes says, attributing it to the fact that he had joined Obama at the start of the presidential campaign, before his own ideas about the world had solidified. “If you are a speechwriter, you have to know what the person you’re writing for thinks. A lot of foreign policy advisers are thinking: how can I get my proposal into this guy’s speech? I was just thinking: what does he want to say?” As deputy national security adviser for strategic communications, Rhodes was intimately involved in every consequential decision of that era, from the Iran nuclear deal to the restoration of the Cuba-America relationship. But for someone who has played such an important role in the past decade’s geopolitics, his voice and face have been largely unknown. Now, he has a starring role in a new documentary about the last days of Obama’s presidency, shot behind the scenes. The Final Year follows the Obama foreign policy team through the warren of the West Wing (dilapidated, cramped, home to cockroaches and rats), the corridors of the United Nations and on their valedictory foreign trips. Watching it now, knowing the result of the 2016 election and the ferocity of the backlash to come, gives the film a whole new significance. “Unfortunately, it’s probably better because of the ending,” Rhodes tells me when we meet in Washington DC, less than half a mile from his former place of work. He is now able to laugh at it, albeit tentatively. “It would have been a nice movie about people working hard on foreign policy, but it acquired this tragic sensibility. It’s a horror movie when you know the twist ending.” The Final Year focuses on Rhodes and Samantha Power, the former US ambassador to the UN. Both joined Obama’s team from the moment he announced his candidacy, and are the two – sometimes duelling – young guns. Secretary of state John Kerry, the national security adviser Susan Rice and Obama also play major parts, reflecting on the sunset of the administration as the action shifts from the UN headquarters in New York to Austria, West Africa, Vietnam, Laos, Japan and Greenland. Along the way, we see the big set-piece moments – the important speeches, the tense negotiations with other diplomats; we also see the anxieties, disappointments and arguments in back rooms. Above all, the film is a study of the sheer, relentless slog of diplomacy, and its frequently meagre rewards; in September 2016, for example, the team’s hopes of a US-Russian ceasefire in Syria rise with each passing day of relative quiet, and then vanish in a new, entirely senseless wave of violence. The film is directed by former American television journalist Greg Barker, who has made documentaries about the hunt for Osama bin Laden and the life and death of Sergio Vieira de Mello, a Brazilian UN diplomat killed in Baghdad. The latter was based on a biography written by Samantha Power, a former foreign correspondent, who was Barker’s way into the Obama sanctum. “She [Power] had probably agreed to do this even before checking with anybody,” Rhodes laughs. “We gave Samantha a pretty free run to make her own decisions.” But the president gave Barker’s crew more access than he ever envisioned; the Obama team – nearing the end of the administration – wanted the film to showcase its foreign policy accomplishments, prizes that they fully expected to hand on like polished batons to friends and colleagues in the Hillary Clinton camp. But as the summer of 2016 turns to autumn, the film shows Donald Trump turning up with increasing frequency, on televisions in airport departure lounges, in conversations with perplexed foreigners. We see blithe certainty turn to niggling doubt, and then, on election night, to devastation; Power and Rhodes, caught on camera at would-be festivities, look as if they have been punched in the gut. (Power hosted a women’s event with Gloria Steinem and the 37 women ambassadors to the UN including Madeleine Albright, who wore a shattered-glass badge in anticipation of Clinton’s achievement.) Rhodes, the wordsmith, has tears in his eyes and struggles to complete a single sentence. “There was a feeling of, this is not the end of the story that I wanted,” Rhodes recalls. Now, he says, when he looks at the film, “the main thing I think about myself is: you look just tired.” At the time, he was father to a two-year-old; since leaving the White House, he and his wife, Ann Norris, a former senate foreign policy adviser and state department official, have had a second child. He does not miss the adrenaline of negotiating through global crises. “Eight years really was too long. I was only running on fumes the last two or three years. What happens on 21 January [when the Trump presidency began] is that all the adrenaline drains out of you. You cannot get out of bed.” The 10 weeks of transition from one presidency to the next turned into a painful wake as the seating stands were erected outside the White House for Trump’s inauguration. Today, Rhodes likens it to a scene from a William Faulkner novel. “It’s almost like in As I Lay Dying, when they are building the coffin in front of the mother’s house.” That feeling dogged Rhodes for the best part of last year, as Obama’s foreign policy record continued to come under ferocious attack. Trump lampooned the Iran nuclear agreement as the “worst deal ever”, hobbling it and constantly threatening to destroy it. Meanwhile, the administration was criticised by both left and right for keeping US forces out of the Syrian civil war, leaving the field to Bashar al-Assad and his Russian and Iranian backers, who flattened entire cities. During the presidency and since, Rhodes has been a lightning rod for criticism, because of both his combative defence of Obama foreign policy and his closeness to the president. It’s something that clearly still rankles. “I wasn’t even particularly responsible for Syria policy, and I don’t say that to absolve myself. My role was to communicate it. But I was the only one who was willing to go out and defend it. It’s a hard thing to defend when the circumstances are so poor.” Rhodes joined the Obama team in late 2006, just days after the senator first hinted he might run for president. The 9/11 attacks had persuaded Rhodes to give up his hopes of a literary career five years earlier, and to do something more practical. Jobs as a congressional speechwriter, and spells working for the 9/11 commission and the bipartisan Iraq Study Group, fostered a deep scepticism about the use of US military might as a panacea. In Obama, a resolute opponent of the Iraq war, he found a candidate and a cause. *** During Obama’s second term, Rhodes spent a significant amount of his time engaged in secret negotiations with Cuban officials in a house laid on by the Canadian government outside Ottawa. There, he and the White House’s Latin America expert, Ricardo Zuniga, launched an ambitious attempt to end a half-century rift with Cuba. “If somebody relatively senior didn’t say, ‘OK, I’ll take this on’, I knew it wouldn’t happen,” says Rhodes, who takes responsibility for the subsequent deal. “I basically said, this is what I want to do in the second term.” Over a series of eight encounters, the talks expanded from the initial goal of a prisoner exchange to a comprehensive agenda of restoring diplomatic, travel and trade ties. The parties travelled discreetly to Rome for the Vatican’s endorsement as a guarantor, before Obama and Raul Castro revealed the agreement on 17 December 2014. In the last days of the Obama administration, Rhodes and the Cuban government worked feverishly to broaden their bilateral ties in order to make the rapprochement harder to dismantle. But a year on, the agreement is under siege. Trump has reintroduced restrictions, and there has been an outbreak of mysterious ailments among US embassy staff in Havana, including hearing loss, dizziness and headaches, which Washington has described as an attack. It has stopped short of accusing Havana of carrying out the attack, but holds the Cuban government responsible for failing to protect US diplomats. All but a skeleton US embassy staff have been withdrawn from Cuba and most of the Cuban diplomats in Washington have been expelled. The cause of the health issues afflicting the US diplomats remains unknown. Rhodes, however, suspects the work of spoilers opposed to the US-Cuban detente. “I really do not believe it is the Cuban government,” he says. “Whether it’s a third party like Russia, or whether that is some harder-line faction in Cuba, to me it is someone with a motivation to kill the relationship or set it back. And unfortunately, they’ve succeeded.” At the heart of The Final Year is the dilemma that has haunted every US administration: under what circumstances should it use its overwhelming military might abroad? Both Libya and Syria were “wars of choice”: that is, where there was no direct threat to the US population or homeland, but where long-term global security, the use of chemical weapons and the mass slaughter of civilians were at stake. In Libya, the administration opted to go to war, albeit in an ancillary role. But Obama decided not to send US forces into battle in Syria. That decision nearly tore the Obama team apart, putting Power, a passionate advocate of humanitarian intervention, at odds with Rhodes, who channels the president’s innate caution. On screen, the strain is clear. “The two powerful threads in American history – the costs of action and the costs of inaction – come together,” Rhodes says, defending the decision to allow this tension to play out in front of the camera. “I thought it was relevant to show there were different points of view, and I say that with no certainty that one point of view is right. Samantha – I won’t speak for her, but her whole career has been about the ghosts of those who suffered when there was not intervention.” Power declined to comment for this piece. Rhodes believes Obama was held back by other phantoms, of those killed in previous US military adventures abroad. One of the trips the president chose to take in his valedictory year was to Laos, which the Nixon administration devastated in its cross-border pursuit of its Vietnamese enemies. “Laos is the ghost of American military interventions past,” Rhodes says. “We definitely felt those ghosts as we made decisions.” Obama came under great criticism over Syria; for declaring that the Assad regime’s use of chemical weapons would be a “red line” for US military action, and then failing that test by not striking after a mass-casualty chemical attack in August 2013. Rhodes argues that the conditions for effective action – congressional and allied support – were not there. The British parliament’s vote against taking part in airstrikes was “huge”, he says, when it came to taking a final decision. The question hanging over the current administration is whether they have rational discussions about any of these issues at all. As I sit down with Rhodes, Washington DC is consumed by the revelations in Michael Wolff’s new book Fire And Fury, depicting chaotic scenes inside the Trump White House, with rival factions consumed with infighting, and even close associates calling the president an “idiot” or childlike. I ask Rhodes what he made of it, having been in those rooms himself. “There are a very limited number of people in senior roles at the White House, and time is their most precious asset,” he says. “Distractions like this book consume people’s time, focus and emotional energy. Every minute spent responding to, meeting about or thinking about a controversy like this is time not spent on something else.” He adds that the Trump administration has yet to confront a major international crisis not of its own making. “You cannot respond to a crisis without a good process, and I have read and seen nothing that suggests the Trump White House – even under General [John] Kelly [Trump’s second chief of staff] – has a process that is suited to deal with something like, for instance, Ebola.” But it is possible that, while the Obama administration upholds Athenian ideals of democracy, the outlook of much of the electorate has more in common with Sparta. “It’s difficult to make diplomacy sound as attractive as taking out a dictator with our military,” Rhodes says. He points out that the wisdom of the Iran deal, in which Tehran accepted strict curbs on its nuclear programme in return for sanctions relief, was unquestioned in other signatory countries: the UK, France, Germany, Russia and China. “Talking and diplomacy is often seen as a concession in America, in a way that it is not in other places,” Rhodes says. It has also been argued that the Obama administration was much better at winning hearts and minds abroad than it was in the American heartland, where the president’s professorial mien came across, or was easily caricatured, as aloof. In an interview with the New York Times in 2016, Rhodes said of the American press that they “literally know nothing” and described the Washington foreign policy establishment as “the Blob”. Today, he says he regrets making dismissive remarks about the press, but stands by his use of “the Blob” to describe the thinktanks along Massachusetts Avenue in Washington, which he believes still err on the side of military force. Trump’s scaling up of the military presence in Afghanistan and bombing of a Syrian airfield have been welcomed there, he argues. Today, Rhodes continues to work for Obama, travelling with him on all his many foreign trips in the fading afterglow of the presidency. A secret service detail still flies with them, Obama is still addressed as president, and heads of state make a point of meeting him – often with pointedly more enthusiasm than they offer to his successor. For an embattled liberal world, Obama remains the king in exile, trailed by crowds nostalgic for happier, more hopeful times. “What’s weird about Obama is that he’s so popular,” Rhodes says. “There will still be hundreds of people in front of the hotel. The demand for him to be visible and to offer hope and consolation is extreme, and his capacity to do so in the role of former president is inherently limited.” But he insists that the former president remains unruffled by the wrecking ball Trump has taken to his legacy, from walking out of the Paris climate accord and a trans-Pacific trade partnership, while threatening (though not quite killing, as yet) a 2015 nuclear deal with Iran. Progress does not follow a straight line, Obama has frequently observed, always adding that it trends upwards. “He is a pretty disciplined person,” Rhodes says. “He is this guy who takes a sweeping view of history. He has a serenity that I don’t have. I get more exercised.” Like his boss, Rhodes is hopeful the political pendulum will swing back after straying into the territory of the hard right, but he admits to doubts. “I do worry that the basic standards of how the presidency operates are being eroded. The pace at which the state department is being gutted – I really worry about that. I don’t know how you train multiple generations of diplomats.” If Trump stumbles into a war in the Pacific by miscalculating his personal brinksmanship with Kim Jong-un, talk of pendulum swings in US politics might be beside the point. As Rhodes says, “We would be in a different reality.” • The Final Year is in cinemas and on iTunes from 19 January. • Commenting on this piece?

Cells and systems in the brain and body have built-in mechanisms to enforce a 24-hour sleep-wake cycle. And light-sensitive cells in the eye and elsewhere keep that synched to the earth’s rotation. Animals and plants regulate their activities on an annual cycle, becoming frisky in spring and hibernating over the winter. Again, intrinsic mechanisms tend towards an annual cycle and sensors of various kinds nudge it to keep track of the earth’s rotation around the sun. The physiology of women shows a monthly periodicity in almost all aspects, although it’s not known whether that has more than a coincidental relation to the orbiting of the moon. But it is culture, particularly religious culture, that has lighted upon the seven-day cycle as an organising structure for our lives. Once something is in the external world, however, it starts to invade our biology, particularly our neurobiology. That’s why it’s so hard to wake up on Sunday morning even if you were silly enough to have set your alarm clock. In the end, science is part of culture.

China has already outlawed all trade in ivory and the UK government is consulting on whether to follow suit as attempts to stop the poaching of elephants increase around the world. It is already illegal in the UK to sell ivory from elephants killed after 1947. Campaigners claim it creates a gap in the law allowing dealers to declare items as antiques without providing evidence of their age. Virginia McKenna, the actor and animal-rights campaigner, said the Antiques Roadshow was “out of touch” for continuing to show ivory. At present the the programme will show antique ivory being valued but will remind viewers about the legislation and the horror of elephant poaching. About 20,000 African elephants a year are slaughtered by poachers. A spokesperson for the show said: “In the light of recent developments in the UK and China with regard to the trade in antique ivory, the Antiques Roadshow is currently reviewing the way it will, in future, approach items of antique ivory that are brought in by members of the public for appraisal.” They added: “We’re looking forward to finding out more about the government’s plans for new legislation around the trade in antique ivory and will review our approach in the coming months.” McKenna criticised the Antiques Roadshow in an article for the Radio Times. She said the era of ivory was over and called on the BBC show to “get with the programme” by no longer presenting ivory as “a thing of beauty instead of a symbol of destruction”. The 86-year-old said: “The decision by Antiques Roadshow to continue its policy – with welcome assurances about reflecting the horrors of poaching – once a likely ban is implemented does not help the situation and is out of touch with the great majority of the British public, parliamentarians and the international community, not to mention the conservationists, wardens and rangers who put their lives on the line in defence of elephants. “It is our responsibility to ensure that we do nothing to make matters worse and I urge Antiques Roadshow to consider the implications of their policy, to look at the bigger picture and to step away from our parochial fascination with antiques at any price.” McKenna starred in the 1966 film Born Free, a true story based on a couple who raised an orphaned lioness to adulthood and then released the animal into the wild. It inspired her to campaign for animal rights and she co-founded a wildlife charity of the same name as the film with her co-star Bill Travers. McKenna said that until recently the UK was the largest exporter of carved ivory items to east and south-east Asia. She added that the Born Free Foundation had proven that one antique ivory item purporting to have been made before 1947 actually had been carved from ivory taken from an elephant as recently as 2004."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"fashion/2018/jan/14/ultraviolet-the-makeup-colour-of-the-future-purple-eva-wiseman","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-14T06:00:19Z","webTitle":"Ultraviolet: the make-up colour of the future | Eva Wiseman","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/jan/14/ultraviolet-the-makeup-colour-of-the-future-purple-eva-wiseman","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2018/jan/14/ultraviolet-the-makeup-colour-of-the-future-purple-eva-wiseman","fields":{"headline":"Ultraviolet: the make-up colour of the future","bodyText":"So, every year, the Pantone Colour Institute chooses a colour that symbolises the cultural mood, and this year it’s ultra violet.

Everything old is new again in this world of popular culture and social media, where the lines between past and present are constantly blurred if not completely invisible. On Instagram, we celebrate Throwback Thursdays while the daily drama that comes out of the White House often makes it feel as though we are literally being thrown backwards into a past that many naively thought was long gone or perhaps never existed. Over the past year there have been several announcements about new film and television projects in the works that come from the era in the 1970s known as blaxploitation. Remakes or reboots have been announced for Shaft at New Line, Super Fly at Sony, Cleopatra Jones at Warners, and Foxy Brown on Hulu, while new Taraji P Henson action thriller Proud Mary looks to have been influenced by the genre as well. Why so much contemporary interest in a movement from so long ago? The answers lie in several unexpected similarities that have emerged between this previous era and our present moment. If we rewind to the late 60s and early 70s, we find traditional Hollywood studios were struggling to connect. With black militants, Vietnam, campus protests and the counterculture dominating the conversation in Richard Nixon’s “law and order” America, watching the nightly news often seemed more compelling than paying attention to anything that might have been playing at the local movie theatre. Hollywood, like nature, abhors a vacuum, so this is where blaxploitation found its lane. The emergence of films such as Sweet Sweetback’s Baadasssss Song, Shaft, Super Fly, Cleopatra Jones, The Mack, Blacula, The Legend of Nigger Charley, Trouble Man and Coffy, all released between 1971 and 1973, offered black audiences characters, themes, music and style that was now consistent with the cultural moment off-screen. The cool, sexual, powerful, conscious, irreverent, nonchalant, quick-witted demeanor of these new ultra-hip films spoke to these audiences in a language that they both understood and enjoyed. At the same time, these low-budget productions produced high profit margins for the struggling studios and for a time urban audiences of colour and studio suits were pleased with the results. In terms of villains, blaxploitation films often featured resolutely evil racist white caricatures, along with comically duplicitous black sycophants eager to sell out the race for their own personal gain. It was the job of the film’s protagonist to expose and eliminate these figures who sought to destroy the community. Thus, blaxploitation films had both a moral purpose and a political mandate. It was in this spirit that audiences embraced these films as opportunities to “talk back”, to “stick it to the man”, while enacting righteous vengeance and speaking truth to power in dialogue that might now sound like a hip-hop diss track. These films were cathartic, funny and uniquely adept at capturing the cultural zeitgeist in a period of a newly free sense of black identity. Before long, though, the haters would emerge, to rain criticism, contempt and suspicion upon the cinematic parade making its way through the movie houses of black America. The actual term “blaxploitation” emerged as black critics of the films suggested that these intoxicating images were like a racial sugar high, getting black audiences all hopped up on what the Last Poets referred to simply as “party and bullshit”. Further, even though these films featured black casts and revolved around themes that resonated with black audiences, many of the creative personnel behind these films were overwhelmingly white. In time, the phrase “black exploitation” became one word, “blaxploitation”, and before long this was the commonly accepted way to describe a range of films from a variety of different genres that were being lumped together under a moniker that made blackness the central component. By the late 70s though, as the dawn of Ronald Reagan’s original Make America Great Again era loomed on the horizon, blaxploitation was in decline. The studios had made their money and moved on. There was Richard Pryor, of course, who had become a movie star, and the occasional blaxploitation film such as Jamaa Fanaka’s Penitentiary in 1979, but in general black images on screen had gone from being abundant to almost invisible. Though Blaxploitation has always had its critics, the era still represents one of the most sustained periods of cinema featuring black themes and black performers of any in film history. blaxploitation is like a cultural warehouse, a sample factory, and a repository for reboots all rolled into one. Yet the 1970s were a long time ago, so how do these films remain relevant today? Upon closer inspection, one might ask, is this present moment really that different from the 1970s? In some ways the answer is yes, but in others it appears that what goes around comes around. Consider the varied images of protest and resistance that have emerged throughout the culture that were first spotted during the second term of Barack Obama, but have grown substantially since. The contested image of Colin Kaepernick and other NFL players, so-called “sons of bitches”, taking a knee during the national anthem that remind us of John Carlos and Tommie Smith at the Mexico City Olympics. The clenched black fist once raised by Carlos and Smith and forever associated with the Black Panthers is now to so ubiquitous that it is even available as a dark-skinned emoji on your phone. Obama’s dignified approach to the US presidency evokes the cinematic image of the iconic Sidney Poitier, the most popular actor in the country before the dawn of the blaxploitation era. Dignity, however, has been replaced by a sort of cultural barbarism wherein coded political slogans, such as Nixon’s “silent majority” and “law and order”, have been appropriated and applied to the present as though we were stuck in a time warp from 45 years ago. Further to the point, current investigations into Russian involvement in the 2016 presidential election are now compared with Watergate on an almost daily basis. But perhaps what is most analogous between the early 70s and the present is the way in which blaxploitation films then were like the urban precursor to superhero films today. Though they were set in an urban milieu represented as real, the universe of these films was an especially fictional landscape. The characters were cool, confident, physically dominant and defiantly anti-establishment, possessing “superpowers” often directly connected to their blackness, which allowed them to see through the bullshit of American life, while simultaneously using everything available to them in waging war against the evils of white supremacy. Their flashy Eleganza and Flagg Brothers-inspired costumes and extravagantly tricked-out cars could certainly be called futuristic for that time. And the moral battles of good versus evil, with a distinct racial twist in the first decade following the civil rights movement, gave blaxploitation a meaningful purpose beyond what was otherwise an elaborate though enjoyable fantasy. Black audiences in the 1970s awaited the next empowered blaxploitation film the way that contemporary audiences now anticipate the release of Black Panther. The trailer for this month’s Proud Mary looks as though it is a mash-up of both blaxploitation and superhero films. Yet despite the deep affection that many have for blaxploitation, these films were not regarded as “great cinema”. The limitations of what were often low-budget guerrilla-style films were visible to audiences even back in the 1970s. The appearance of boom mics on screen or people listing their zodiac signs next to their name in the credits were par for the course. Audiences embraced them not in spite of this, but often because of it. Part of the enjoyment of watching these films lies in the fact that you were watching something raw, unpolished, unsophisticated and, in many cases, unfinished. But that’s what made it cool, this sense that what Hollywood considered trash, black culture considered treasure. It was not the power of Hollywood that made blaxploitation significant, it was the power of the audience, the power of the people that transformed the genre into a cultural force that continues to influence and inspire. Contemporary film-makers now have the opportunity to create better films than those that inspired them. If contemporary audiences respond to these new films with the same enthusiasm that audiences responded to blaxploitation back in the 70s, then this would indicate an especially triumphant return.

Thank goodness. We know more than the hackneyed clichés supplied by the movies in which the therapist knows all and bestows wisdom on those who, prone on a couch, consult with them. Therapists are interested in how the individual, the couple or the family experiences and understands their difficulties. That has to be a starting place. We can be of value if our first port of call is to listen, to gradually feel ourself into the shoes of the other, to absorb the feelings that are being conveyed and to think and then to say some words. The thinking and talking that I do inside the consulting room is at odds with many features of ordinary conversation. Not that it is mysterious, but it isn’t concerned with conventional ways of sharing or identifying. The therapist makes patterns and theorises, but they are also reflecting on the words that are spoken, how they are delivered – in a staccato fashion, or flatly, or stop and start – and how the words, once spoken, affect the speaker and the therapist themselves. Words can give voice to previously unknown feelings and thoughts. Words can illuminate. That’s why it’s called the talking cure. But just as words reveal so, too, can they obscure, and this gets us to the listening and feeling part of the therapy. Whatever and however the utterances are delivered, they will have an impact on me as a therapist. I might feel hopeless, I might feel energised, I might feel pushed away, I might feel demanded of, I might feel pulled to find solutions. The influence of the other is what makes any relationship possible or impossible. A therapist is trained to reflect on how those who consult with them affect them. As I try to step into the shoes of the analysand and then out again, my endeavour is to hold both those experiences, plus an awareness of my ease or discomfort with what I encounter in the relationship. Of course, a hallmark of a therapist’s feelings will be curiosity and interest, but when my feelings are inflected with what can feel like foreign emotional hues, I wonder whether this is a useful reflection of the analysand’s psyche. Is what is conveyed at a feeling level a clue to the difficulties that beset the individual seeking help? While we can only do an approximation of stepping into another’s shoes and their story, we do a rather more surgical discussion inside ourselves with the feelings that come upon us. I once felt I was covered in dandruff in a session, but not the session before or after. Another time, I was heavy with depression and yet five minutes after the person left, I was enlivened. A few sessions later, I felt like a purring pussy cat, a feeling I was to have with that person and no one else. These feelings were incredibly helpful intimations alerting me to aspects of what the individual was burdened by or what they craved. Their desires and difficulties did not come in words but through feelings which, when I could find the words for myself, could be shared and made sense of. Feelings are the bread and butter of our work in the consulting room. They inform or modify our ideas and they enable us to find an emotional bridge to what can so hurt for the people we are working with. Along with the more commonly thought-about theories and ideas we have about the psyche, they are an essential part of the therapist’s toolkit, certainly for me. The talking cure means talking, yes. It also means the therapist is listening, thinking and feeling. In Therapy by Susie Orbach is published by Wellcome Collection &amp; Profile Books at £8.99.

A group of Finnish researchers are launching a study to find out. The fast-working spray contains naloxone, which is commonly used as an emergency treatment for overdoses of opiates such as heroin, opium and morphine. It blocks the production of dopamine, a neurotransmitter linked to pleasure with a central role in addictions. “The spray goes to the brain in a few minutes so it’s very useful for a gambler … if you crave gambling, just take the spray,” Hannu Alho, professor of addiction medicine at the Helsinki-based national institute for health and welfare, explained. The researchers are looking for up to 130 volunteers to take part in the experiment, which Alho says is “the first of its kind globally to use nasal spray.” Half will use the treatment for three months, while the other half will be given a placebo. A recent report found that 2.7% of Finns aged 15-74 suffered from some level of gambling problem, while a report last year by the UK’s Gambling Commission found that two million Britons were either problem gamblers or at risk of addiction. Alho said a previous attempt to treat gambling addiction with a pill containing a substance similar to naloxone had shown benefits, but was inefficient as the pill takes at least one hour before it is absorbed. In 2015 the US Food and Drug Administration approved the use of naloxone kits which make it easy to deliver the formulation to people who have overdosed on opiates via a spray. The FDA research found that administering naloxone nasally delivered the same levels or higher of the drug as an intramuscular injection, and acted just as fast. “Gambling is a very impulsive behaviour … the need to gamble starts right away,” Alho said. “For this reason we are seeking a medication with a quick effect … the nasal spray acts in just a few minutes.” The experiment is to be launched next week and is expected to last for a year."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jan/08/self-proclaimed-nazi-found-guilty-of-stirring-antisemitism-in-uk-racial-hatred-preston","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-08T19:11:15Z","webTitle":"Self-proclaimed Nazi found guilty of stirring antisemitism in UK","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jan/08/self-proclaimed-nazi-found-guilty-of-stirring-antisemitism-in-uk-racial-hatred-preston","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jan/08/self-proclaimed-nazi-found-guilty-of-stirring-antisemitism-in-uk-racial-hatred-preston","fields":{"headline":"Self-proclaimed Nazi found guilty of stirring antisemitism in UK","bodyText":"A self-proclaimed Nazi who claimed Britain took the wrong side in the second world war has been convicted of stirring racial hatred against Jewish people. A jury at Preston crown court unanimously found that the 22-year-old man from Lancashire, who cannot be named for legal reasons, had breached the Public Order Act 1986 by using “threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour” intended to stir up racial hatred. The man committed the offences in two speeches, the first in March 2016 at a demonstration by a group called North West Infidels in Blackpool and the second at a meeting of the Yorkshire forum for nationalists, attended by people from various far-right groups. The jury was played a recording of the Blackpool demonstration in which the defendant could be heard describing Jewish people as “parasites” and arguing that Britain should have joined the Nazis to fight the communists in the second world war. The man added: “Yes, I am a national socialist, I’m not scared of that label. You can call me Nazi. You can call me fascist. That is what I am.” In the second speech the defendant said he thought Hitler had shown too much mercy towards Jewish people. Matthew Brook, prosecuting said the man had been using the speech to explain his support for the now banned group National Action, and was “in effect recruiting for them”. Brook told the court: “He was clearly saying in both speeches that the Jewish race should be killed … He is making both of those speeches to recruit members to his cause and to encourage people who already agree with his racist views to stand firm.” Giving evidence, the defendant confirmed he was a Nazi but said that did not mean he hated all Jews. He denied intending to stir racial hatred and instead said he was trying to provoke lively debate and to shift people’s views further to the right. After the verdict, the anti-racism organisation Hope Not Hate said it was pleased to have provided “the impetus and evidence” for the man’s prosecution. A date for sentencing has yet to be set."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2018/jan/08/ibuprofen-may-increase-risk-of-fertility-issues-in-men-study-suggests","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-08T20:00:00Z","webTitle":"Ibuprofen may increase risk of fertility issues in men, study suggests","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/jan/08/ibuprofen-may-increase-risk-of-fertility-issues-in-men-study-suggests","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2018/jan/08/ibuprofen-may-increase-risk-of-fertility-issues-in-men-study-suggests","fields":{"headline":"Ibuprofen may increase risk of fertility issues in men, study suggests","bodyText":"Men who take high doses of ibuprofen for months at a time may be at greater risk of fertility issues and also other health problems, such as muscle wastage, erectile dysfunction and fatigue, scientists have found. Research on healthy young men who took the common painkiller for up to six weeks showed that the drug disrupted the production of male sex hormones and led to a condition normally seen in older men and smokers. The 18 to 35-year-olds who took part in the study developed a disorder called “compensated hypogonadism” within two weeks of having 600mg of ibuprofen twice a day. The condition arises when the body has to boost levels of testosterone because normal production in the testes has fallen. Doctors in Copenhagen who led the study said that while the disorder was mild and temporary in the volunteers, they feared it could become permanent in long-term ibuprofen users. This would lead to continuously low levels of testosterone, because the body could no longer compensate for the fall. “Our immediate concern is for the fertility of men who use these drugs for a long time,” said David Møbjerg Kristensen at the University of Copenhagen. “These compounds are good painkillers, but a certain amount of people in society use them without thinking of them as proper medicines.” In March this year Jiři Dvořák, Fifa’s former chief medical officer, warned of an “alarming trend” among elite football players to “abuse” legal painkillers such as ibuprofen. Before he stepped down in November 2016 he asked players about their use of over-the-counter painkillers and found that nearly half of those who played in the past three World Cups took anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen, every day. Bernard Jégou, a senior author on the study at the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research, said he saw no problem in people taking ibuprofen to alleviate pain in the short term – for toothache, for example – but warned against taking the drug for months on end if it was not strictly necessary. “We normally see this condition in elderly men, so it raises an alarm,” Jégou said. “We are concerned about it, particularly for healthy people who don’t need to take these drugs. The risk is greater than the benefit.” The finding comes after repeated warnings from other researchers that ibuprofen can raise the risk of heart attacks in the general population and cause medical problems for pregnant women and their babies, including a more than doubling of the risk of miscarriage. In the latest research, scientists looked at the impact of ibuprofen on 31 healthy young men over six weeks and performed further tests on cells and pieces of human testes in the lab. Ibuprofen lowered testosterone production in the tissues, but levels of the hormone remained the same in the men. This is because the pituitary gland at the base of the brain had ramped up levels of another hormone that drives the production of extra testosterone. “In the living body the pituitary gland kicks in to compensate for this, but the brain is pushing more to get the same amount of testosterone,” Kristensen said. “If you go on and stress the pituitary gland over the long term, this state could become permanent and you develop a more serious condition.” Details of the study are published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. William Colledge, professor of reproductive physiology at the University of Cambridge, who was not involved in the research, said: “It’s a fascinating study that suggests that men should be cautious about using high doses of ibuprofen for extended periods.” While the findings needed to be replicated in further studies, he said, a precautionary approach made sense. “Based on these data, I personally would be very reluctant to take ibuprofen for longer than the 10 days normally indicated on the packet.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global/2018/jan/14/alison-brie-the-post-spielberg-film-mad-men-glow-interview","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-14T08:00:21Z","webTitle":"Alison Brie: ‘When Spielberg called it was the craziest half an hour of my life’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2018/jan/14/alison-brie-the-post-spielberg-film-mad-men-glow-interview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global/2018/jan/14/alison-brie-the-post-spielberg-film-mad-men-glow-interview","fields":{"headline":"Alison Brie: ‘When Spielberg called it was the craziest half an hour of my life’","bodyText":"‘Hello, it’s Ali!’ comes a text message from an unknown number. “I’m running late but I’ll see you soon!” Los Angeles born actor Alison Brie’s Twitter bio reads “Always late… but worth the wait.” It’s true – both when we meet and in terms of her acting career. Though 34-year-old Brie feels like she’s been playing catch-up her entire career, she’s now a Golden Globe- nominated actor – for her role as a female wrestler in Glow – has a starring role in James Franco’s The Disaster Artist and will soon appear in Spielberg’s new drama The Post. As a kid she knew she was going to be an actor. Growing up in Pasadena, she wasn’t part of the central Hollywood set – “Although the girl who played the daughter in Beethoven did go to my high school.” She would act in local theatre shows, but decided against going to one of LA’s prestigious performing arts high schools, opting instead for a normal teenage experience with her friends. “I told my mom recently,” she says, “that I thought it was cool she didn’t make me become a child actor. She said: ‘Well we tried…’ I had such integrity at a young age.” Brie went on to study acting at CalArts in LA. The first time she left home was to do a year exchange in Glasgow – still the farthest from home that she’s ever travelled. “It was never sunny,” she recalls. “This whole morose side I never knew I had was able to come out. Chips and cheese was a real thing for me. I only ate that at one in the morning and I’d forget. If you don’t remember, the calories don’t count.” The “industry” was of no interest until she had her resolved her education. In college her roommate’s friend Rachel Bilson starred in The OC and Brie baulked at the idea. “I remember saying: ‘Well I don’t know if I would even work in TV.’ I was so snobby.” The years spent honing her craft meant that Brie escaped being typecast and running before she could walk. “I knew who I was before thrusting myself into this world where everyone is judging you and you’re constantly being objectified,” she says. Comedy was a happy accident. In college she was convinced she’d become the “ingenue”. “Then I’d go out to audition for dramas as ‘the girl who dies’! or ‘the guy who dies’ girlfriend’! and I couldn’t get those parts to save my life because the material was so uninspiring.” Her first big gig was Mad Men. Straight out of college, Brie scored the comedic dramatic role of Trudy – wife of Pete – Campbell. Her mature presentation on that show was confusing at other auditions because it was presumed she was a lot older than 24. “I was playing a wife. For a while I started auditioning for ‘wives and mothers’ and I’d be sitting in a room with people who were 40.” Then came NBC’s Community, where she played the overachieving Annie and learned how to be funny on the job – “just from fucking around with everyone between takes”, she says. Juggling that and Mad Men at a point where TV streaming was booming was a “dream” for Brie. “Oh it was just fun and awesome,” she says. On Mad Men she was “silent and professional”. On Community she was “jumping around making fart jokes”. The character of Trudy still holds a place in Brie’s heart. “I lovvvved Trudy,” she smiles. “Matt Weiner was fantastic at writing these complex characters for women in an era where they were trapped in stereotypical roles, but could wield power. They made men think that they had the power while secretly controlling everything. Trudy was such a badass.” With so much of Mad Men focused on sexism, the themes seem relevant again in the post-Weinstein climate of Hollywood. “It’s triggering,” says Brie of the constant news cycle. “It made me think about my experiences, cataloguing encounters over the years, going: ‘Yeah that was inappropriate…’ It’s a strange time, but it’s exciting. I feel very moved by the courage of these women. I hope it’s going to influence great change. It’s like cleaning your room: you have to make a big mess before it becomes clean. We’re in a real big, dark mess. Hopefully we’ll achieve some sort of clarity.” When Mad Men and Community ended around the same time, Brie tried to focus on film. Television dragged her back. “I’ve learned that I’m at home on TV. I’m a person of routine. I eat the same thing every day. I start with my white loose-leaf tea, I take my apple with my almond butter. I’m regimented. Television really suits my personality.” Getting Glow a few years ago was unexpected. “It blew my goddamn mind. It’s the job of a lifetime. Truly every day I think: ‘How did this happen? How did I find this show?’” Set in the 80s, Glow is about an all-female wrestling group. Her character is a struggling actor who falls for the ring. “It’s so fulfilling, so empowering. And I can fucking wrestle. I can wrestle even better this year than I could last year. What a weird thing!” Her gym trainer, who she’s had for seven years, always fantasised that Brie would get an action movie role. Now his client’s on the cover of Women’s Health Magazine. “That was a bucket-list thing,” she says, offering that she can hip-thrust 225lb. “Weights that I can’t physically put on the thing [bar], I can lift with my legs and butt. I can do pull-ups!” she exclaims. “I was always into exercising to be skinny, which can become a very unhealthy compulsion. Training for Glow I got addicted to strength. Learning how to wrestle you have to protect your partner and yourself, so I stopped thinking about how I looked and focused on how my body worked.” Brie was in New York on holiday when her agent invited her to a reading with Spielberg’s casting director for his new film, The Post. She accepted, but only because she thought it would be a good connect for the future. “I didn’t think there was a chance in hell that I would be doing this,” she laughs. The following week she received a call asking her to meet with Spielberg. “Come again?” was her response. She drove into Universal – “which looks like the gates of Jurassic Park” – and had a meeting with Spielberg. “I’ve never been more nervous for anything.” Even at the meeting she wasn’t ready to accept the possibility. “I was like: ‘Even if I don’t get this part I’m going to meet Steven Spielberg. How cool!’” Two days later her agents called to say she’d got it. “Ten minutes later I got a call from Steven,” she says, still flabbergasted. “He said congrats. We laughed. Then he told me he’d see me on set. It was a great phone call and the craziest half an hour of my life.” The drama is about the Washington Post at the time of Nixon’s administration. Brie plays the daughter of the paper’s first female publisher, Katharine Graham (played by Meryl Streep). The story contains such timely parallels with President Trump’s relationship with the press that Spielberg worked fast to make a film with a screenplay by a first-time writer, Liz Hannah, who was merely using it as a sample to get an agent. “The Post still feels like a crazy fever dream I had,” explains Brie, who considers hers a “Cinderella story”. “It’s so outside my wildest dreams that I can never do another movie,” she jokes. “I’m frozen in this weird fear. The bar has been set so unbelievably high that I’ll never work again.” The movie hits such a pertinent beat for America now. “Post-election we’re moving backwards instead of making progress, so it’s more important than ever to look at the history and learn from those mistakes and how we need to fight as a people.” The film resonates with the rising women’s movement, given Streep’s character’s extraordinary position at the time as the owner of a Fortune 500 company in a male-dominated industry. “I cried watching it. She was so important. She inspired us all,” says Brie. Acting opposite Streep was “incredible – surreal really”. Seeing her in her natural element banished any of Brie’s nerves. “You’re like: ‘Oh, I’ll just act opposite Meryl and react. How could I go wrong?’ It’s so innate what she does. I don’t know how she does it. She’s so present in the moment, so free.” Everything behind the scenes has reached a moment of contentedness for Brie, too. Last March she married Dave Franco – brother of James – who she stars alongside in The Disaster Artist. “It’s the best,” she says of going to work with her other half. “I love being on set with Davey, if not just to spend more time together. Hardly see that guy!” At night she still gets giddy whispering, “You’re my husband!” as her head hits the pillow. “It’s nice to know that part of life is squared away. It’s kind of all bullshit, though, right?” she says. “It doesn’t matter. What does the title mean? It’s just about having a person in your life. I’m so happy all the time to be married to that guy.” It’s taken more than 10 years of hard graft, but Brie’s making it in Hollywood on her own terms. And she’s glad it’s worked out this way. “I do think when I was younger there was so much pressure to be the ‘hot young thing’ – that was how you were going to get a job. I don’t feel that way any more,” she says. She grabs her handbag and sets off from the park bench where we are sitting, aware she’s running behind again for her next appointment. Always late… but well worth the wait.

League Two’s Yeovil were the lowest-ranked team left in this year’s competition going into the third round and will retain their status before Monday’s fourth round tombola spin after smiting Bradford’s Bantams. Elsewhere, Stoke City were the first top-flight side to suffer the ignominy of a giantkilling, going out at the hands of Coventry City, a once proud club who won the FA Cup in 1987 but can currently be found slumming it in League Two after years of heinous neglect by their scurrilous owners. “I’m making the best of what I’ve got,” Ailsa from Home and Away said in his traditional post-match excuse-a-thon, but when all you’ve got are beaten by a demoralised team largely cobbled together on the cheap from paperclips, sticky-back plastic and bits of string, being unceremoniously booted towards the door marked “Do One” should come as no big surprise. Meanwhile two Nottingham clubs scrapping for a return to former glories after periods of dodgy ownership claimed the scalps of teams in divisions above them. Still languishing in the Championship, two times Big Cup winners Forest humbled no-times Big Cup winners Arsenal in a real humdinger at the City Ground. “I just think we were not good enough anywhere – not up front, in the middle or at the back – and we paid for it,” said Arsène Wenger, whose Gooners were also woefully inadequate in a dugout that featured no big-name stars that might have helped a side rotated to the point of arrogance out of a hole. The previous day at Griffin Park, Brentford fans had been left anything but buzzing as League Two leaders Notts County continued their excellent run of form under Kevin Nolan, who has come a long way since his well-documented days as Andy Carroll’s babysitter. Jon Stead popped up with the winner there, belying every one of his 59 years. Still reeling from their humiliation at the hands of second division Sunderland in the 1973 final, Nasty Leeds had further humiliation heaped upon them by Welsh League Two side Newport County. Adding insult to indignity, Nasty Leeds had Samuel Sáiz sent off for gobbing at Newport’s Robbie Willmott in injury time and the expectorating Spaniard has since been banned for six games. Newport were the most successful of the three Welsh clubs left in the competition, with Cardiff being held by Mansfield Town and Premier League strugglers Swansea City unable to break the deadlock and cause an upset by beating slick, runaway Championship leaders Wolves, who may sit only one place beneath them but are clearly much superior. And finally, a tip of the hat to League One side Peterborough United, who proved they’re not too Posh to push on in the grand old competition by dismantling their Championship opponents Aston Villa at Villa Park.

There are some guys who, when they are at home, they have a big telescope to see what happens in other families. He speaks and speaks and speaks about Chelsea.’ Antonio Conte, January 2018: ‘For the other situation [with Mourinho], I am repeating – there is a person who continues to look here. He went away but continues to look here.’ Is Mourinho the new voyeur? How time flies and circumstances change …” – Ronald Kondowe. “So, Ailsa from Home and Away has finally been axed. To use the vernacular of the teens on that very show, ‘I’m stoked!’” – Jonathan Dobson. “Carlos Calvalhal need have no qualms about signing match-winning sardines [Friday’s bits and bobs].

A further 12 Brighton (&amp; Hove actually) fans have been banned from attending their team’s matches after pwoper nawty behaviour when they faced Crystal Palace – their FA Cup opponents tonight – in November. The suspect in the bombing of Borussia Dortmund’s team bus has admitted to carrying out the attack, but says he did not intend to kill or injure anyone. The accused, identified only as Sergej W, faces a life sentence if found guilty of the charges. And Fleetwood keeper Chris Neal fears his manager Uwe Rösler will not be thrilled after the stopper won a year’s worth of pizza for keeping a clean sheet against Leicester in the FA Cup. “It is not great for us … I am sure he will mention I can’t have too much,” sniffed Neal.

Meanwhile, Sean Ingle reckons Nottingham Forest and Coventry have taken a gigantic gulp of fresh air and breathed life back into the shiny old pot. Richard Foster leaps into his time machine and takes us back to 1989, when Brighton played Palace and the referee gave five penalties in 27 minutes. It might sound ludicrous but there’s a chance that a resurgent journeyman striker could save Benevento, writes Paolo Bandini.

The horse would have injected a deal of interest into a quiet weekend by taking part in a Listed chase as part of trainer Colin Tizzard’s plan to find easier opportunities for him this winter. Instead, I imagine he will now go straight to Ascot’s Grade One next month, a race he won last year. That means his campaign this winter will be remarkably similar to the one he had last year, the only difference being that he missed out the King George this time. It would be great if the Tizzards could find something winnable for him in what I assume will be his final season. I particularly don’t want to see him in the Gold Cup, being a year older and seemingly less capable than when he struggled and then fell in the race last year. Anyway, the Tizzard yard is in need of a boost, judging by our latest trainer form table (below), which shows them languishing on 5%. Of the two Tizzard wins in the past fortnight, one was against three rivals at Plumpton yesterday and the other was a race in which the Tizzard runner was actually beaten 26 lengths but was awarded the prize because the winner went around a fence instead of over it. Philip Hobbs is going the other way in our table, having won with all three of his runners on Saturday. That counts as quite a turnaround, considering Hobbs’s only two wins since the start of December had been in a couple of novice hurdles. I don’t imagine this will prove a false dawn, since Saturday’s horses ran right to the line in testing conditions, so every Hobbs runner is now worth a second look. Nicky Henderson continues to win races at a remarkable rate, while the other Nicky, Richards, is also winning with fewer runners. Neil Mulholland is back in form, but Dan Skelton and Ben Pauling have hit a flat spot. Nicky Henderson 42% (26) Nicky Richards 30% (10) Kim Bailey 27% (22) Donald McCain 25% (28) Dr Richard Newland 25% (4) Tom George 24% (21) Alan King 24% (17) Venetia Williams 24% (17) Philip Hobbs 21% (19) Neil Mulholland 20% (35) Kerry Lee 20% (15) Lucinda Russell 20% (15) Nigel Twiston-Davies 19% (32) Brian Ellison 19% (27) Gary Moore 17% (47) Paul Nicholls 17% (30) Harry Fry 17% (12) Warren Greatrex 11% (19) Charlie Longsdon 11% (18) Evan Williams 11% (9) Nick Williams 11% (9) David Pipe 10% (20) Emma Lavelle 10% (10) Sue Smith 9% (23) Jonjo O’Neill 9% (11) Dan Skelton 8% (24) Fergal O’Brien 6% (16) Colin Tizzard 5% (38) Tim Vaughan 0% (21) Ian Williams 0% (18) Ben Pauling 0% (14) Peter Bowen 0% (11) Malcolm Jefferson 0% (10) Oliver Sherwood 0% (10) Rebecca Curtis 0% (3) Each Monday through the core jumps season, we’ll monitor the relative success of 35 major jumps stables. The percentage figure is their win strike-rate for the last fortnight, while their total number of runners in that time is in brackets. Today’s card at Hereford has been lost to frost, so the jumps action comes from Fontwell. It’s not a place for heroic punting, in my experience, but I’ve been taken with the form of Jeremy Scott’s runners and his Blue April (1.45) might be overpriced at 6-1. This horse is a maiden after 14 races, admittedly, but there was some hope in two of his last three and he should be fitter than for his reappearance at Plumpton a month ago. His rating is lower than ever and the opposition looks at least as moderate as he is. Chris Pea Green (2.45) is back over hurdles after a poor round of jumping at Ascot in November. It’s three years since he got a chance against opposition as moderate as he meets today and I think the handicapper may have gone too far in dropping him 20lb for his last four defeats. After all, this horse was no slouch over hurdles before being sent over the bigger obstacles. He was seventh in a Triumph and fourth in the big pre-Christmas handicap at Ascot, back in the days when it was known as the Ladbroke. Perhaps he really has lost his enthusiasm for the game but, at 8-1 and with Gary Moore back among the winners, I’ll take the chance. At Wolverhampton tonight, Unit Of Assessment (6.15) is worth another try at 7-2, having gone so close at Lingfield last time. Adam Kirby, who rode for the first time that day, is back aboard. Northern Law (7.15) is also of interest at 17-2 for the in-form John Quinn, having been gelded since he was last seen in August. He’s only had a couple of handicap runs and has a couple of siblings who rated a lot higher."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"money/2018/jan/08/what-should-i-go-for-divorce-settlement-house-property","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-08T11:11:52Z","webTitle":"What should I go for in my divorce settlement?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/jan/08/what-should-i-go-for-divorce-settlement-house-property","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2018/jan/08/what-should-i-go-for-divorce-settlement-house-property","fields":{"headline":"What should I go for in my divorce settlement?","bodyText":"Q I am hopefully divorcing in the new year and am in a dilemma as to what to have in the divorce settlement. We own our house, have no mortgage or other debts, and have savings and pensions and two grown-up children who don’t live at home. My dilemma is, do I go for the house which I would want to rent out and then use the income to buy another property? Can this be done? I earn a very low income so I’m looking to try and earn money from the house. Or do I go for half the value of the house, all savings and husband’s pension and hopefully with the proceeds buy a house to live in and a house to rent? What is the best option? LL A Sorry to have to break this to you, but it’s not what you decide you want to go for that determines what you will end up with in a financial settlement after you divorce. You’ll get what you and your husband agree would be a fair split or, if you can’t agree, what a court thinks is fair. I doubt very much that a court would think that you getting half the family home, all the savings and you husband’s pension would be at all equitable, even if it felt that you were financially dependent on your husband. Given that a court would be unlikely to award you what you want, it is infinitely preferable to reach an agreement with your husband, possibly with the help of a mediator or solicitor. The more you can agree on your own, the lower the cost of getting a financial settlement will be. If your husband were to agree that you should get the family home, I’m not sure that renting it out and buying another property is an option unless you’re prepared to take out a mortgage to enable you to buy another property. You wouldn’t be able to use the rental income to buy a property until you had saved up enough of it to pay the purchase price of another property all in one go. The alternative to renting out your home to get some money from it would be to sell up and buy somewhere cheaper with lower running costs if it is also smaller.

While she covers beauty on her YouTube channel, and her goth-inspired look is a hit on Instagram, it’s her potions, crystals and tarot cards that set her apart from your average YouTuber. Nice has been practising the Wicca religion for about four years and has been sharing her beliefs with her 300,000-plus subscribers for just over a year. “Wicca is a nature- and pagan-based religion, with elements of witchcraft in it,” she says. In one video, Nice explains how she uses tarot cards. In another she presents samples from her crystal collection. She’s also covered Wiccan altars, rune stones and the paranormal. Nice makes a living through the royalties YouTube pays for the content. “I don’t think it’s the videos about Wicca that have grown my channel, but it’s what gets people to stay,” she says. This interest in witchcraft is part of a revival of new age spirituality. Big business has caught on: publications aimed at 20 and 30-somethings, such as Broadly, Refinery29 and The Cut frequently cover crystal grids, tarot and astrology. The fashion and beauty industries have latched on to the trend. In June, a Dior collection was adorned with images from the Motherpeace feminist tarot deck and beauty brands including Sisley and Aveda are adding gemstones and crystals to products. Fashion’s interest in the spiritual might prove short-lived, but there is a significant audience with a deeper interest who could offer a sustainable customer base to mystical practitioners. According to the latest census, over 53,000 people in the UK are Pagan. Paganism can be described as an amalgamation of religions and spiritual traditions, which can include Wicca. Meanwhile, the latest generation of adult consumers – 18-24-year-olds – are open-minded. A study by the US-based National Science Foundation found this demographic the least likely to consider astrology unscientific. A growing public curiosity about the mystical is something Ruby Warrington noted before launching her business, The Numinous. In 2012, Warrington moved from London, where she’d worked as a features editor, to New York. She says: “Already there was a real scene here of people who you wouldn’t necessarily associate being into this kind of stuff, from practitioners to boutiques. I’ve definitely seen that pick up pace over the last four or five years. “[It] reflects a shift away from materialism and mass consumerism. This was sparked by the financial crash of 2008, when we were reminded that material markers of success can, literally, vanish overnight.” The Numinous has a few facets: an online magazine, an events schedule, including workshops and talks, and the Moon Club, a members’ club. While they may be adapting to the online age, mystical practitioners have a long history, as does the controversy they can attract. One critic is Jon Donnis, who writes the blog BadPsychics.com which, he says, aims to educate people and expose the methods of psychics and practitioners of tarot, reiki and witchcraft. “To be put on the BadPsychics list, I would first have to investigate the psychic and expose how they performed their tricks. If I’m lying, I get sued – so far I have never been sued,” he says. Mystics’ clients can range from fervent believers to those who dabble for fun. But they can also attract more vulnerable people. It is for this reason that, since 2008, consumer protection laws have required fortune-tellers, astrologers and mediums to say their services are for “entertainment only”. For Michele Knight, founder of MicheleKnight.com, which offers live psychic readings, it is important there are set guidelines for employees. “We have a long list in our contract, including that you cannot make people dependent [on the service].” She adds: “If we feel somebody is overusing the service, then a manager will ring them up and talk to them about that.” Knight’s spiritual interest started early: she began dabbling in the psychic when she was around 16, with tarot readings. She says that there has always been a strong connection between feminism and the spiritual. “It’s to do with the matriarch, the wise woman, a different way to be powerful.” She says of the current interest in mysticism: “I think women are waking up and gathering again.” Holly Cassell, a 26-year-old blogger and witch from Cardiff, agrees. “[Witchcraft] not only acknowledges, but honours and celebrates the idea of the divine feminine, rather than only glorifying masculine qualities, like much of western society.” She adds: “I buy my witchcraft tools almost exclusively from women and non-binary people, and usually small online business owners.” To compete, many businesses are also merging a mystical service or product with technology, such as Co–Star Personalised Astrology, which is billed as an AI-powered astrology app and the online subscription company White Witch Box, which, for £27 a month, delivers its customers boxes filled with witch-related accessories and trinkets, such as incense, jewellery and altar cloths. While some promote mysticism as a reaction against materialism, and for others it offers comfort in our technical age, the renewed appetite for the mystical is clearly inspiring an entrepreneurial mindset. Nice says: “I am quite picky about the brands that I work with. Once I feel I’ve done my time on YouTube, which hopefully won’t be for ages yet, I’d like to set up a [Wicca] shop.” Sign up to the regular Guardian B2B email here for more insight and advice direct to your inbox"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jan/12/dougray-scott-mums-parents-didnt-approve-of-dad-they-cut-off-all-contact","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-12T12:59:29Z","webTitle":"Dougray Scott: ‘Mum’s parents didn’t approve of Dad.

They cut off all contact’","bodyText":"My dad was a travelling salesman. He knew how to be tough, but he was a gentle soul, with a soft side and a lot of patience. Once I was seven, he took me on trips with him all over north Scotland. I remember those times vividly. They are some of my happiest childhood memories. I adored my father. He had been an actor in Glasgow once, and he had put on this travelling salesman character in order to sell his fridges and freezers. Subconsciously, I got my first acting lessons from him. My parents met at a dance in Glasgow when my dad was 35 and my mum was 20. They were from very different backgrounds. Mum was a nurse and had a lower middle-class upbringing, and my dad was from a rough, working-class area of Glasgow. Mum’s parents didn’t approve of my dad. But my mum got pregnant, so she had to get married. Her parents cut off all contact. I don’t think they even came to the wedding. I am the youngest of four – my dad was 50 when I was born – and my siblings would say I had it easy, that I got mollycoddled. But I don’t remember it being like that at all. I do remember my brother, who is 10 years older than me, throwing a garden fork through a snowman and it getting stuck in my leg. He thought it was hilarious and I thought it was pretty painful. We were quite a poor family. We had no savings and lived in a council house. My dad didn’t have a basic wage, he was only paid on commission, so he really had to sell to make a living. At one point, when I was 11, I had to share a bedroom with my older sisters. It wasn’t great, sharing with your sisters when you are that age. I fought with them a lot – I hit one of them over the head with a golf club. That wasn’t very nice. But my sisters were strong. All my family are quite small and my littlest sister, who is 4ft 11½, was particularly ferocious. She was like a Scottish Tasmanian devil. If I was getting hassled at school, she would step in and absolutely destroy people. My mother always seemed very glamorous and charming to me. All my friends and I were rough Fifers, but she had this posh Kelvindale accent and used to wear white gloves. By contrast, my great-aunts in Glasgow would put their cigarettes out by stubbing them on their hands. They had no ashtrays down in Glasgow. They were that tough. You become ferociously defensive of your children when you become a parent. I have three kids – twins aged 20 and a son aged three – and I would do anything for them. Trying not to worry about them is the hardest thing about it. Every day, you worry about them constantly. It makes you wary of everything that’s around you. You want to protect them for as long as possible. It is hard to just let go. You can’t. With my twins, I tried not to tell them what to do. They grew up very close and supportive of one another, but they would also fight a lot. My strategy was to try to let them make their own mistakes. When I felt I needed to step in and take a tough line, I did, but I was reluctant to do that because I never wanted to be an overbearing parent. I hope I managed to find that balance. That one of my children is adopted makes no difference to the love I feel for them. The first time I set eyes on Milo, I thought: that is my son – and he is. I love him just as much as I do my biological children. There is no difference whatsoever. I would put my life on the line for him, as I would for the twins. My whole perception about adoption changed the moment I saw him. He is part of me, 100%. • Dougray Scott is supporting WaterAid’s Untapped appeal.

In an open letter to BBC licence fee payers, she makes a series of powerful claims against the corporation, including that it is not “not living up to its stated values of trust, honesty and accountability”. Her letter and subsequent comments in interviews on Monday include some particularly serious revelations: up to 200 women at the BBC have complained to management about pay; Gracie resigned despite being offered a pay rise from £135,000 to £180,000 a year (which she declined) and having a grievance hearing in November, of which she is still awaiting the result. Her resignation demonstrates starkly that staff at the BBC are not only unhappy with the pay gap between what men and women but also how the organisation has handled the dispute since it began last summer. There is frustration that the BBC is not dealing with the core problem: people being paid differently for doing the same job. Gracie accused the BBC of a “divide-and-rule botch solution” after it offered pay rises that did not guarantee equality and “locking down women in protracted complaints process”. The news that women in the BBC are going through formal internal grievance procedures is significant because it is widely regarded as an essential precursor to employees launching legal proceedings. The Guardian reported in October that the City law firm Mishcon de Reya was working with women at the BBC, with other law firms also thought to be advising staff. Gracie is clear in her letter about the prospect of the BBC facing legal action, warning it of a “disastrous legal defeat” caused by its “bunker mentality” and urging it to set up an independent arbitration to settle individual cases rather than face an “unwinnable court fight”. The pay row began last summer when the BBC published a list of its top-earning stars, which revealed that only a third were women and the top seven were all men. This led to more than 40 of the BBC’s highest-profile female presenters, including Clare Balding, Fiona Bruce and Emily Maitlis, to publicly call for change through a letter to the BBC director general, Tony Hall. Since then there has been increasing discontent at how the BBC has dealt with the backlash. The corporation published a series of pay reviews and audits in October that concluded that men were being paid 9.3% more than women at the BBC on average – far less than the UK average of 18.1% – and that there is “no systemic discrimination against women” at the corporation. However, this review did not include the vast majority of on-air presenters, editors and senior managers. The review also found there was a lack of women in senior roles and that in almost one in 10 occasions where there was substantial difference in pay between men and women doing similar jobs, there was no clear reason for the disparity other than gender. Gracie’s letter also reveals discontent at how individual cases are being dealt with. She is frustrated that she was offered a token pay rise rather than any guarantee of gender equality. Her proposed new salary of £180,000 is still far less than the £200,000 to £249,999 paid to Jon Sopel, the BBC’s North America editor. Gracie’s suggestion that the BBC sets up an independent arbitration to settle individual cases is fascinating but also sensible. This arbitration, for example, could conclude whether the China and North America editors should be paid the same and make similar calls elsewhere. In response to Gracie’s letter, the BBC has said it is “performing considerably better” than other organisations and pointed to the conclusion of its independent audit. However, at present it is clear that the corporation has not done enough to quell the anger of women across the corporation. A significant moment should come within the next couple weeks when a report by accountancy firm PwC about on-air staff is published. BBC insiders say this will analyse whether there are discrepancies in pay and that the corporation will “stand by the judgements be they helpful or unhelpful”. If the report is as significant as advertised then it will lay roadmap for how the BBC will tackle what Gracie and other employees see as the fundamental problem – the gross disparities between what people are paid for doing the same job. The BBC risks further high-profile resignations or legal action if it fails to tackle the issue. It is not an easy problem to solve – it could mean substantial pay rises for some staff, pay cuts for others and controversial calls on which jobs are the same and which are different. The problem is exacerbated by the fact that Fran Unsworth, the new director of news at the BBC, has to cut £80m from the BBC News budget. However, the consequences of not responding to the concerns of Gracie and other women at the BBC look increasingly serious in light of her letter."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/little-library-cafe/2018/jan/12/novel-recipes-eggs-benedict-from-little-fires-everywhere-by-celeste-ng","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-12T06:00:21Z","webTitle":"Novel recipes: eggs Benedict from Little Fires Everywhere by Celeste Ng","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/little-library-cafe/2018/jan/12/novel-recipes-eggs-benedict-from-little-fires-everywhere-by-celeste-ng","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/little-library-cafe/2018/jan/12/novel-recipes-eggs-benedict-from-little-fires-everywhere-by-celeste-ng","fields":{"headline":"Novel recipes: eggs Benedict from Little Fires Everywhere by Celeste Ng","bodyText":"Inside, the house was already full to overflowing. There were mimosas and an omelet station. There were caterers offering bite-sized quiches and poached eggs in puddles of velvety hollandaise. Little Fires Everywhere, Celeste Ng --- In my teenage years, I couldn’t imagine anything ever being fancier than going for brunch. As soon as I was old enough, with a purse full of money saved from my job in a fish and chip shop, I wanted to go for brunch with my school friends; now, at 30, it’s still my favourite meal and has become a weekly ritual: bacon sandwiches and pots of tea at St. John in Spitalfields, perhaps some bottomless chai and fried egg naan at Dishoom, English muffins, sharp cheese, and a flat white at Finks. When I think of the brunches I coveted in my teenage years, it was eggs Benedict that I always imagined in front of me. Usually the most expensive dish on the menu, it was often out of reach, and I was too nervous to make hollandaise myself at home (happily, a comprehensive read of Julia Child’s Mastering the Art of French Cooking in my mid-20s gave me the confidence I needed to make it work). If you’ve struggled with it, or avoided it for fear of wasting half a block of butter and your time first thing in the morning, I have some tips. Firstly, I’ve always struggled to make a small batch – a single egg yolk almost invariably ends up splitting on me. Use two. A second pair of hands (someone to add the butter on my nod) during early attempts was useful too, but you may be less nervous than I was. The most reassuring thing I ever learnt is that if you split the sauce (it will look grainy and separated, rather than thick, if you do), you need only to start again with a new egg yolk – add your “ruined” sauce in place of butter until you have incorporated it all. The sauce will be rich and velvety, as if nothing had happened, and you won’t end up tipping anything down the sink. I read Little Fires Everywhere over Christmas. While the world feels very American, a lot in it feels familiar to me: a idyllic tree-lined suburbia where there’s very little to do, and everyone seems to know everyone else. I left Brisbane for the anonymity and opportunity of London four years ago: this week, I return for the first time. It’s been on my mind a lot in the past months, this return ‘home’ – I worry it may no longer feel familiar. So, in so many ways, Little Fires Everywhere was the perfect book – an exploration of family, social class and suburbia. Eggs Benedict Serves 4 Ingredients Hollandaise 2 egg yolks 1tbsp lemon juice Up to 125g butter, very soft and cut into 0.5cm cubes Flaky sea salt 1tsp Dijon mustard The rest 4 English muffins Butter, for buttering 200g thinly sliced ham 8 eggs Freshly ground black pepper and flaky sea salt Equipment Heatproof bowl Whisk Small saucepan Wide, shallow pan for egg poaching Mug Slotted spoon 1 Fill your heatproof bowl with steaming hot water from the kettle. Allow it to sit for a minute, then tip the water into the small saucepan and bring it back to the boil. Dry out the bowl, which will now be lovely and warm, and tip in the egg yolks and lemon juice. Whisk until sticky and light. 2 Reduce the water in the pan to a slow simmer, and place the bowl above it, ensuring that the water does not touch the bottom of the bowl. 3 Whisking continuously, add the butter to the egg yolks, one cube at a time. Only add a piece once the previous has been incorporated completely into the sauce. Keep going slowly and steadily, until you have a rich, thick sauce that holds a shape when you pull the whisk out of the bowl. Season to taste with salt and mustard. 4 Toast the muffins, butter them, and top with ham. Finally, when you’re ready to eat, poach your eggs. Bring the wide pan of water to a simmer. Crack an egg into the mug, swirl the water to create a whirlpool, lower the mug close to the water, and drop the egg in. Don’t worry if the white spreads out a bit, just nudge it back towards the centre with the spoon. Repeat with the other eggs, in batches if you can. Once the whites are cooked but the yolks are still runny (this will take about two minutes, depending on how gently your water is simmering), remove each egg using the slotted spoon. Allow it to drain a little before placing on top of the ham. 5 Spoon some hollandaise onto each egg. Serve immediately with plenty of salt and pepper."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"books/booksblog/2018/jan/08/poem-of-the-week-a-bone-flute-by-judith-willson","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-08T11:25:44Z","webTitle":"Poem of the week: A Bone Flute by Judith Willson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2018/jan/08/poem-of-the-week-a-bone-flute-by-judith-willson","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/booksblog/2018/jan/08/poem-of-the-week-a-bone-flute-by-judith-willson","fields":{"headline":"Poem of the week: A Bone Flute by Judith Willson","bodyText":"A Bone Flute made from the radius bone of a whooper swan wing, circa 40,000 years ago Swans flying in across the lagoon at dusk, muscled as horses; sky filling with bells. The swans dip and rock, lanterns on the grey water and we raise our phones’ small lamps as if we should honour the messengers returning at nightfall to patient souls who stand beside cars with their children in bright winter coats holding bags of grain, provisioned for a journey. The swans lift their necks, open the great doors of their wings. Our faces are fading behind our white breath; a flute’s seven feathery notes still dissolving on the air. Mothers or sisters walking towards us, hold out their hands. They will sit with us, watch the hours swing round, skeins streaming north. Soon the year’s sharp light will sing in the bone. Soon they will take what they came for. The whooper swan (Cygnus cygnus) is a winter migrant from Iceland, resident in the British Isles and Ireland between November and March. Judith Willson’s poem, from her fine debut collection, Crossing the Mirror Line, seemingly begins with the dramatic, late-autumn scene of the birds’ arrival. Its opening couplet packs the description in tightly, the arresting image of these large birds, “muscled as horses”, mutating to one that adds sound effects. Bells, though, are not pure sonority: they are solid, sky-lit, space-packing, highly distinctive shapes, and so suggest an enriching, defamiliarising visual metaphor. The mass-landing is as clean and contained as the verbs, “dip” and “rock”. On the quiet grey water, they morph rather magically into lanterns. Lantern light, diffuse and ancient, is qualitatively different from the keener glow of the “phones’ small lamps”. The kinship of the two words, lamp and lantern, delicately heightens their distinction, an important one for the poem’s retreat into prehistory. As I read on, I remained curious about the sound of the swans. The name “whooper” is suggestive, of course, but how well does it work as onomatopoeia? In a poem in Goat’s Milk, Frank Ormsby describes it as “a dolorous whomp”. That’s certainly evocative of some of the lower-pitched whooper notes, as I discovered when I played various recordings. The birds have quite a range of pitch: here they sound less deep and stereophonic than elsewhere. Wilson does well in not attempting to be “tweet-of-the-day” specific. Her soundscape is subtler and, as will be seen, altogether stranger. Meanwhile, the narrative continues on its almost-realist way. People have gathered to welcome the swans. They have brought their children, and might have driven some distance, “in bright winter coats holding bags of grain”. That’s a wonderfully concrete line, splashing clear vivid colour, Breughel-like, against winter white and grey. And there’s another connection with that Dutch painter, distant but compelling. In Auden’s Musée des Beaux Arts, the speaker praises the old masters’ understanding of: “How, when the aged are reverently, passionately waiting / For the miraculous birth, there always must be / Children who did not specially want it to happen, skating / On a pond at the edge of the wood.” In Willson’s poem, any “miraculous birth” is presented obliquely. It’s not simply the advent of the migrant swans. That literal arrival is only part of the whole story. Some other order of consciousness is already infiltrating the poem. Filming the birds, it’s “as if we should honour the messengers returning at nightfall / to patient souls”. Are the witnesses cheerful middle-class bird lovers parked beside a perfectly ordinary lagoon, or shades on the banks of the river Lethe? Are the swans themselves becoming souls? Now, unexpectedly, the call of the bone flute lifts the narrative into another time. Dualities of life/death and breath/sound are erased with the image of “our faces (…) fading // behind our white breath” and the sound of “a flute’s seven feathery notes / still dissolving on the air”. Bone flutes were among the first musical instruments. Archaeological investigations at the Hohle Fels cave in the Swabian Jura yielded many such flutes. The tune heard in the poem, played “circa 40,000 years ago” has yet to vanish. It’s so placed that the swans seem to have retreated through “the great door of their wings”. Encapsulating and distilling all that’s left of their hungry, muscly, noisy presence is the sound of the small flute. Now the realism loosens and the poem becomes more associative. On one level, it might trace the transition of life into art, via death. I find the phrase “mothers or sisters” particularly mysterious. Are the women swans or people, or swan-people? They seem to have risen from the dead, with an ambiguous offering for the living. They are almost but not quite specific. We don’t know if they are the speaker’s dead: the casual option of identification (“or”) suggests not. The gendering might imply particular demands made by women on women, especially on the woman artist. Though they “will sit with us, watch the hours swing round” they will be overseeing a deepening of winter. The acts of sitting and watching suggest the traditional death bed, while the “skeins streaming north” imply the homing flight. Once the swans have left, will the mothers and sisters “take what they came for”? These strange, harsh figures seem more dangerously predatory than the swans. But perhaps, like the swans, they simply want to live. What very definitely happens in the poem is that it gets colder: deathly cold. Any bone in which the “year’s sharp light” can “sing” must be a bone without flesh or feather. Listen to this recording as you re-read the poem. It’s the sound of a palaeolithic flute, made from a swan’s radius bone. The one that inspired the poem? I don’t know, but it’s the very sound of winter, the thinnest, coldest icicle of a not-quite-tuneless tune. And then, come in from the cold, and get warm again hearing Judith Willson reading Common Things Explained."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2018/jan/08/football-transfer-rumours-griezmann-to-manchester-united-lemar-to-liverpool","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-08T09:25:45Z","webTitle":"Football transfer rumours: Griezmann to Manchester United?

Lemar to Liverpool?","bodyText":"Manchester United hope to cool any interest Antoine Griezmann might have in moving to Barcelona next summer by meeting Atlético Madrid’s £89m summer release clause and offering him an eye-watering £400,000 per week. It’s a lot more than they would have had to pay him if they’d pulled off their mooted move for the France striker last summer, but with Barcelona now in the race for his scrawl, he can more or less name his price. Dumped out of the FA Cup in the third round for the first time during Arsène Wenger’s reign, a bad month for Arsenal fans is about to get a little bit worse. Manchester City are deep in negotiations with the north London club over the transfer of Alexis Sánchez to the Etihad. Despite being unwilling to match Arsenal’s £35m asking price, they remain hopeful of getting a deal over the line sooner rather than later. City sporting director Txiki Bergiristain is reported to have spent Friday and Saturday discussing numbers with the Arsenal bean-counters and is confident of securing Sánchez’s services for £25m. In the aftermath of the embarrassment at the City Ground, Wenger took time out from berating his underperforming players to deny speculation that he is on the verge of signing West Brom defender Jonny Evans, who is also a City target. Having bid adieu to Philippe Coutinho, Liverpool will ramp up their well-documented interest in Monaco’s Thomas Lemar and also plan to offer RB Leipzig a little extra on top of the agreed fee for Naby Keita to bring the midfielder’s move to Anfield forward from the summer to right now. With a hectic festive period behind them, Liverpool’s players have been sent to Dubai for a few days of rest and relaxation, but their recruitment department will enjoy no such luxury. Despite speculation to the contrary, the Liverpool Echo reports they have not yet made an official approach to Leicester City for Riyad Mahrez, a state of affairs that’s soon expected to change. With talented underachievers Ross Barkley and Kevin Mirallis gone to Chelsea and Olympiakos respectively, Everton are in the market for some new blood and manager Sam Allardyce hopes to add Swansea central defender Alfie Mawson and Watford midfielder Abdoulaye Doucoure to a list of January recruits that currently consists of Turkey striker Cenk Tosun. Sevilla midfielder Steven Nzonzi also remains a target, while Championship basement-dwellers Sunderland will happily show central defender Lamine Koné the door if Everton renew their interest in the Ivory Coast international who is currently sidelined with a knee injury. Leicester City are in talks with French Ligue 2 side Gazélec Ajaccio with a view to signing 22-year-old winger Fousseni Diabaté, according to local paper the Mercury. Claude Puel’s side are believed to have agreed a fee of £1.8m for the Mali U-23 international. In unexpected news, Leicester central defender Harry Maguire has been linked with a potential £50m move to Manchester City just six months after rocking up to the King Power Stadium. With Wes Morgan injured and Robert Huth just back from a spell on the sidelines, Leicester are unlikely to entertain any offers for the England international. Newcastle manager Rafa Benítez hopes to bring Real Madrid right-back Achraf Hakimi to St James’ Park on loan, while Chelsea cultural attache and midfielder Kenedy remains on his radar. The Magpies are also in the market for a goalkeeper, but the Evening Chronicle reports that moves for West Ham’s Joe Hart and PSG’s Kevin Trapp are unlikely to be successful. Despite saying he wants to fight for his place at Liverpool, Danny Ings could be shipped out to Newcastle, although West Bromwich Albion are also hopeful of drafting in the 25-year-old to help in what currently passes for their fight against relegation. Paris Saint-Germain outcast Lucas Moura is hopeful of getting a move to Manchester United, according to French TV station Telefoot. Nantes, Nice, Bordeaux and Real Betis are also interested in the Brazilian winger who has his heart set on a move to United. And finally, after successfully breaking out of Sunderland, for whom he scored 12 times in 19 appearances while on loan from Bournemouth, Lewis Grabban will get to sample life at the opposite end of the Championship table in a successful, winning team when he signs for runaway leaders Wolves."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/jan/08/macron-gift-horse-vesuvius-visit-china","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-08T09:54:06Z","webTitle":"Macron brings gift of horse called Vesuvius on visit to China","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/08/macron-gift-horse-vesuvius-visit-china","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jan/08/macron-gift-horse-vesuvius-visit-china","fields":{"headline":"Macron brings gift of horse called Vesuvius on visit to China","bodyText":"The French president, Emmanuel Macron, has fired the starting pistol on a three-day visit to China by giving his host, Xi Jinping, a horse called Vesuvius. The eight-year-old gelding recruited from France’s presidential cavalry corps represented “an unprecedented diplomatic gesture”, Reuters quoted the French presidency as saying. “It mattered a lot for the president, even if it was very complicated to import a horse for sanitary reasons,” one official said. “It’s a symbol of French excellence.” Macron’s tour of Xi’an and Beijing is designed to boost ties between the two nations as Paris emerges as a key Chinese partner in Europe following Britain’s decision to abandon the European Union. In a glowing interview with Chinese state media before his arrival, Macron said: “China is a country that fascinates me, like so many French people … [it is] the oldest living civilisation – a ‘state older than history’, as General de Gaulle once said.” Chinese experts praised Macron’s decision to give the Middle Kingdom his horse, a move apparently inspired by the Chinese tradition of “panda diplomacy”, when Beijing bestows the black-and-white Sichuan natives upon its friends. “He really respects Chinese history,” enthused Ding Yifan, a France expert from the China Development Research Centre, a state-backed thinktank. Ding said he saw the gift as an allusion to the Qianlima or “thousand-mile horse”, a mythical winged creature famed for its ability to travel great distances. By giving Xi such a present, Macron was signalling his desire for a long-lasting relationship with Beijing. The four-legged gift was not Macron’s only goodwill gesture to Xi, who was recently anointed as China’s most powerful leader since Mao Zedong. By beginning his tour of China in Xi’an, the ancient Silk Road hub, Macron was also offering symbolic backing to Xi’s signature foreign policy campaign, the $900bn Belt and Road initiative. Speaking on Monday, Macron insisted the sprawling Chinese development push, which some fear is simply a pretext to draw less developed nations into Beijing’s economic orbit, could not just benefit Beijing: “The new roads cannot only go one way.” The equine offering places French diplomacy furlongs ahead of British counterparts, who have lost favour in Beijing following Brexit. When David Cameron travelled to China in 2013 he handed Xi a signed England football shirt. When the Communist party leader came to London in 2015 the Queen gave him a book of Shakespeare’s sonnets. Theresa May has not yet had the chance to pay tribute, having repeatedly postponed a visit to China that was originally expected last summer. May is now expected to visit Beijing in late January.

In what is shaping up to be the biggest industrial dispute in the metalwork sector in three decades, more than 15,000 employees took part in warning strikes at factories including those of the carmaker Porsche. The IG Metall union, which represents around 3.9 million workers, wants every employee in the metal and electrical sector to have the option to reduce their working hours for a total period of two years, with the automatic right to return to full-time employment afterwards. German family policy took a shift in 2007 when a so-called “educational” benefit mainly aimed at mothers was replaced with a “parental benefit” that can be shared between the mother and father of a child. Under the union proposals, workers who opt for a 28-hour week in order to take care of young children or ageing parents would get an additional allowance of €200 per month. Those who want to take a break from doing shift work with a high health risk would be compensated with €750 per year. With the German economy in robust health and unemployment at record lows, IG Metall is also calling for a 6% pay increase across the sector. “We want employers to recognise that traditional gender roles in modern families are changing, and we want workers to have the chance to do work that is important to society,” a union spokesperson said. “In the past, demands for more flexibility has come at the cost of workers. We want to flick a switch so that flexible working also benefits workers.” Employers’ associations have rejected the union’s proposals, complaining that it would be too costly if, as predicted, up to a quarter of companies’ staff switch to the 28-hour model. “We cannot meet the demands for compensatory wage increases,” said Oliver Zander, director of Gesamtmetall, in an interview with Die Welt newspaper. “At a time when there is a shortage of skilled personnel it would be mad to give an incentive to reduce urgently needed operating volume.” Germany has around 1.1m job vacancies, and in a recent poll by the German Chambers of Commerce and Industry (DIHK) more than half of all companies cited a shortage of skilled workers as the biggest risk facing their business. The employers’ group has compiled a legal dossier arguing that IG Metall’s proposals are illegal since they discriminate against workers who have already opted to permanently work fewer hours. It has further argued that employers could only allow some workers to work shorter hours if in turn the union allowed others to sign contracts for a 40-hour week. In Germany, where large companies are required by law to have workers’ representatives on their boards, industrial relations have traditionally been more consensus-based than in Britain or France. The last major dispute in Germany’s metal-working sector came in the 1980s, when union demands for a 35-hour working week led to months of walkouts at factories across the country. IG Metall launched an unsuccessful campaign of strikes in 2003 aiming to introduce a 35-hour working week in the states that formerly were part of East Germany. Fifteen years later, many metal workers in the former GDR continue to work 37 hours per week. In Britain, where collective bargaining has over the years become dramatically decentralised, 37-hour working weeks remain the norm in the metalwork sector, in spite of efforts by the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions. A third round of collective bargaining is scheduled to begin in Germany on 11 January. If the talks fail to yield a compromise, IG Metall could move from warning strikes to targeting individual factories with full-day stoppages."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/jan/09/tuesdays-best-tv-working-class-white-men-school-for-stammerers","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-09T05:59:00Z","webTitle":"Tuesday’s best TV: Working Class White Men; School for Stammerers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jan/09/tuesdays-best-tv-working-class-white-men-school-for-stammerers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jan/09/tuesdays-best-tv-working-class-white-men-school-for-stammerers","fields":{"headline":"Tuesday’s best TV: Working Class White Men; School for Stammerers","bodyText":"Working Class White Men 10pm, Channel 4 There is an argument that if everyone who felt marginalised and angry in modern Britain was to step forward at this moment, there would be a long queue indeed.

The Colour Space works, two of which can be seen here for the first time, will be shown at Houghton Hall in Norfolk, built in the 18th century for Britain’s first prime minister, Sir Robert Walpole, and which once housed one of the world’s greatest art collections. The exhibition, opening in March, is another example of Hirst never doing anything by halves. In 2012 he took over all 11 Gagosian galleries around the world for his spot paintings, and last year his monumental fantasy exhibition Treasures from the Wreck of the Unbelievable filled two grand Venice palaces. Houghton was built with an art collection in mind, and it is this history that is striking. Walpole amassed a stupendous collection, the finest in the land, with works by artists including Rembrandt, Poussin, Van Dyck and Velázquez. In 1779, 34 years after Walpole’s death, the profligacy of his grandson led to the collection being sold to the highest bidder, bought as a job lot by Catherine the Great for the then vast sum of £40,555. Hirst will show about 50 of his new paintings in Houghton’s state rooms, and some of his most recognisable sculptures will be installed in the gardens. The paintings are a development of his spot paintings which, along with his animals preserved in formaldehyde and his spin paintings, are among Hirst’s most recognisable works. The show’s curator, Mario Codognato, said the works, were a looser, more organic response to the spot paintings. “They are literally going to replace Old Master paintings [at Houghton] and will be displayed like they are Old Master paintings, in a very different way than if it was a classic white cube gallery.” He said there would be a contrast between the historical splendour of the rooms and the works, but visitors would also see “how classic and iconic” the Hirst images had become. “It is an absolutely amazing space and is a very interesting experiment for Damien to show in such a context.” Houghton’s owner, Lord Cholmondeley, said he was delighted to have the opportunity to exhibit Hirst. “It is perhaps the first time that Hirst has shown a significant body of work in a formal country house setting. William Kent’s gilded interiors will be transformed for the duration of the show.” With their deliberately machine-like uniformity, the spot paintings are derided by some critics and celebrated by others. The Guardian’s Adrian Searle once called them “as unsatisfying as cigarettes, calming but addictive.” One estimate is that there are more than 1,400 in existence, almost all of them produced factory-style over the past 30 years by the artist’s teams of assistants. In 2011 a grand scale spot work was begun in Hirst’s studios that will comprise a million 0.5mm spots. It will take nine and a half years to complete. The exhibition coincides with the beginning of a new series of books, published by Heni, documenting the complete works of Hirst. First up is Colour Space, which contains an introductory essay by Ann Gallagher, the director of British art collections at Tate. She writes that the spot paintings “were conceived from the outset as an endless series”. In contrast, the Colour Space paintings have been conceived as a finite series with rigorous rules. In total there will be 4 million spots painted in household gloss, with the largest painting containing 90,000 spots. On 250 canvasses there will be spots sized at 6mm, 10mm, 25mm, 50mm, 75mm and 100mm. There will also be a triptych and 12 canvases on a black background. The works have been produced at Hirst’s three studios in Devon, London and Gloucestershire, with each of his hired painters averaging 1,500 spots a day. • Damien Hirst at Houghton Hall: Colour Space Paintings and Outdoor Sculptures, 25 March – 15 July"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jan/08/tesco-launches-own-brand-vegan-range-amid-rise-in-plant-based-eating","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-08T12:43:40Z","webTitle":"Tesco launches own-brand vegan range amid rise in plant-based eating","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jan/08/tesco-launches-own-brand-vegan-range-amid-rise-in-plant-based-eating","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jan/08/tesco-launches-own-brand-vegan-range-amid-rise-in-plant-based-eating","fields":{"headline":"Tesco launches own-brand vegan range amid rise in plant-based eating","bodyText":"The vegan food revolution sweeping the UK has received a further boost as the largest own-brand supermarket range of 100% plant-based meals went on sale in 600 Tesco stores. From crispy carrot pastrami to sourdough pizza, the Wicked Kitchen range includes 20 vegan-friendly ready meals along with wraps, sandwiches and salads. With Veganuary – a pledge not to eat animal products during January – under way, supermarkets and restaurants across the UK are fleshing out their vegan credentials amid signs that plant-based eating is becoming a mainstream movement. The Tesco range has been masterminded by the American chef and self-proclaimed “plant pusher” Derek Sarno, a former global executive chef for Whole Foods Market, who was hired by Tesco last year as its director of plant-based innovation. “When I first arrived in Britain from America I was hugely surprised at how little choice there was for vegans and those considering a lifestyle change,” said Sarno, a Veganuary 2018 ambassador. “The only thing I could find was a falafel wrap. For too long vegans have been overlooked, with many offerings that are available seemingly created to appease rather than truly please. Wicked Kitchen plans to change all that.” One of the most striking food trends of 2017 was flexitarianism, with one in three people saying they were trying to reduce their meat intake. According to the Vegan Society, more than half of UK adults are adopting “vegan-buying behaviour”, and the number of full-time vegans in the UK has grown fourfold in the past 10 years. This month, the online grocer Ocado has added a further 90 products to its dedicated vegan site. Restaurants are bolstering their vegan menus, with chains such as Pizza Express and Pizza Hut offering vegan-friendly cheese – the former having recently added a vegan giardiniera to its menu. Last week, Pret a Manger introduced a range of vegan pots with “toppers” of fresh herbs and vegetables that can be stirred into the main dish. For other consumers seeking healthier choices at the start of the year, supermarket Waitrose is trialling a personal nutritionist service that aims to provide customers with dietary advice tailored specifically to their individual needs. From Monday, customers at its Canary Wharf and Kingston-upon-Thames stores will be able to book personal consultations with qualified nutritionists. Waitrose is charging £95 for the package, which includes a health questionnaire, private consultation, a personalised diet and lifestyle plan, as well as a starter pack of healthy food and recipes. Moira Howie, Waitrose’s nutrition manager, said: “We know health is top of the agenda for many people as they embark on new year resolutions. We’re committed to helping customers make healthy choices to achieve their individual goals.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"politics/2018/jan/08/here-are-a-few-names-who-deserve-demotion-your-best-comments-today","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-08T11:09:56Z","webTitle":"'Here are a few names who deserve demotion': your best comments today","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jan/08/here-are-a-few-names-who-deserve-demotion-your-best-comments-today","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jan/08/here-are-a-few-names-who-deserve-demotion-your-best-comments-today","fields":{"headline":"'Here are a few names who deserve demotion': your best comments today","bodyText":"Discussion today has focused on the cabinet reshuffle, with readers giving their views on who should go, and also the joys of of running. You’ve also been discussing a readers’ problem with their flooded cellar, and getting to the bottom of whose to blame. To join in you can click on the links in the comments below to expand and add your thoughts. We’ll continue to highlight more comments worth reading as the day goes on. There have been lots of great comments as we prepare for Theresa May’s reshuffle, including this one below. ‘If Theresa May wanted to show authority she would sack Boris Johnson, David Davis and Michael Gove’ If Theresa May wanted to show authority then here are a few names who deserve demotion – Johnson – Aided and abetted a foreign government in the detention of a UK citizen with his comments spoken in a parliamentary select committee. Insubordination and incompetence. Should be sacked. Davis – Told a parliamentary select committee that the government had “impact assessments” in regards to Brexit on the UK economy. When these were demanded the government retrospectively produced these reports so that Davis was not found in contempt of parliament. Be in no doubt though, when he made his original statement to the committee, the reports didn’t exist. He was either lying or totally incompetent. Should be sacked. Gove – Backed Johnsons comments on the Andrew Marr show with respect to the detention of a UK citizen in a foreign jail. He could’ve stuck to the truth that she was there to visit family, however he chose not to do that and stuck by Johnson. Not to mention he and Johnson also wrote a passive aggressive letter to the PM in regards to the Brexit leaver demands – then leaked it to the press. Insubordination. Should be sacked. Sebby1967 Fit in my 40s: ‘‘I hate running. But I’m going to give it a go’ A lot of you have been discussing this column from Zoe Williams on running. Her advice? Don’t overdo it. ‘We have to do two kinds of exercise in order to stay fit’ Fitness is two things. One, its cardiovascular. Two, and equally important, its muscle strength and tone. Both are important. One without the other is not fitness. We lose cardio fitness from inactivity. We lose muscle through inactivity and through ageing. We have to do two kinds of exercise in order to stay fit into old age, one being resistance, and the other being cardio. In resistance, the best available method is dumbells and barbells. In cardio there is a wider choice, either running, rowing, elliptical or bike will do it. You need two sessions of resistance with weights that are heavy for you in the classical bodybuilding lifts. You do not need lifts involving explosive effort, such as the Olympic lifts. You do not need machines, which make you strong only for using the machines. The sessions should last no more than an hour and should consist of three sets of 8-10 reps. The cardio portion should be about three times a week in addition, last 20-30 minutes, and consume 200-300 calories, after which you should need a shower. This can be done for a whole lifetime, well into the seventies and eighties, and will keep you fit, active and able to enjoy the sporting and leisure activities of your choice without risk of injury. jeandemeung My cellar is flooded, but as the damage mounts there’s no resolution in the pipeline Another top discussion this week is going on under this article on cellar flooding, with someone writing to complain about not being told where two nearby leaks are due to the Data Protection Act. ‘The Data Protection Act is employed when the response is: we can’t be arsed’ So many companies hide behind the Data Protection Act, it like Health and Safety, is the default response by companies and organisations when their real response is; “we can’t be arsed, so f**k off”. pcpmitch"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/jan/08/cabinet-reshuffle-whos-in-whos-out","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-09T07:46:17Z","webTitle":"Theresa May's cabinet reshuffle: promotions, demotions and exits","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jan/08/cabinet-reshuffle-whos-in-whos-out","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jan/08/cabinet-reshuffle-whos-in-whos-out","fields":{"headline":"Theresa May's cabinet reshuffle: promotions, demotions and exits","bodyText":"Out: Justine Greening quits government Greening had been the most widely tipped loser in Monday’s reshuffle. She became education secretary after Theresa May took over as prime minister in 2016, replacing another remain-minded Tory, Nicky Morgan. Morgan has since become one of the government’s most effective backbench critics, and Greening departed after refusing to be moved to the Department for Work and Pensions. The talk is that Greening had to go because of her supposed cosying up to teaching unions and her lack of enthusiasm for new grammar schools. Some critics believed Greening risked capture by “the Blob”, the mass of education experts and unions so named by Michael Gove when he was in the role. A 2005 entrant to parliament, Greening was briefly the transport secretary and then, for four years, the international development secretary before overseeing education. She had risen rapidly under David Cameron and was perhaps politically more suited to his era, not least with her strongly pro-remain beliefs. Greening was the first education secretary whose entire secondary education was at a comprehensive and she took a relatively conciliatory attitude towards teaching unions in her time in the job, even during a lengthy battle over the level of funding for schools. The issue of new grammar schools, introduced into the 2017 manifesto to placate more traditionalist Tory MPs, might have caused Greening difficulties, as she clearly struggled to raise enthusiasm for a policy which, the evidence shows, does very little to promote social mobility. However, the loss of the party’s majority in the election led to the grammars policy being mothballed on the assumption it would struggle to get through the Commons. Peter Walker Up: Jeremy Hunt, health and social care secretary After handling the politically perilous NHS brief for an impressive five years and four months, Jeremy Hunt may regard his expanded role – as the secretary of state for health and social care – as a poisoned chalice as much as a promotion. He is now responsible for two of the biggest challenges facing the government, both of which provoke constant political heat and regular, high-profile pleas for extra billions of Treasury spending. May’s decision to enlarge Hunt’s portfolio may reflect a belief on her part that he can bring what admirers see as his calm, reassuring approach to the NHS’s many problems to the equally complicated issues in social care. English councils’ adult social care budgets have been cut by £6bn since 2010. That means fewer people have been getting help just when an ageing population has increased the need to provide practical assistance for older people with day-to-day tasks as well as to find them places in care homes. “Delayed transfers of care” – the inability to discharge medically fit patients from hospitals due to the widespread difficulty of arranging a package of social care support to keep them safe – is a key reason many hospitals are dangerously full all year round, not just this winter. But this major policy change makes sense for a government that for years has seen integration of health and social care as the best way of keeping the NHS from crumbling, though progress towards that goal has been piecemeal not dramatic. Denis Campbell Up: Damian Hinds, education secretary He is the second education secretary in a row to have gone to state school but, unlike the comprehensively-educated Justine Greening, he attended a grammar. First elected to the safe seat of East Hampshire in 2010, he has risen quickly through the ranks to become a minister of state in the Department for Work and Pensions where he oversaw universal credit. Before that, he showed an interest in schools as a member of the education select committee and used to chair the all-party parliamentary group for social mobility, a cause championed by the prime minister. He has had a low profile in the party and media but, according to his government biography, he previously “spent 18 years working in the pubs, brewing and hotel industries, in Britain and abroad”. His website lists his areas of interest as business, the economy, tackling disadvantage and widening opportunity. Rowena Mason Up: Esther McVey, work and pensions secretary She has quickly bounced back into a cabinet-level job after losing her seat in 2015 and then parachuting into a safe constituency last year. She last sat around the top table as an employment minister under David Cameron, after a swift rise through the ranks since entering parliament five years earlier. A former daytime television presenter, McVey was considered good in front of the cameras and a rare example of a senior Tory with a Liverpudlian accent. However, she became unpopular during her tenure in the Department for Work and Pensions for justifying harsh cuts to benefits for disabled people, and for the botched introduction of the personal independence payment. She was also a prominent defender of the system of benefit sanctions, the spread of food banks and the flexibility of zero-hour contracts. These controversies were thought to be a factor in the loss of her West Wirral seat in 2015 but she was back two years later in George Osborne’s former safe seat of Tatton. She was promoted by Theresa May to the job of deputy chief whip in the autumn and her ambitions will no doubt be fuelled by her latest rise to work and pensions secretary. When asked in 2015 whether she wanted to be prime minister, she said: “If I had to do a yes or a no, I’ll be honest, I’ll say yes.” Before entering parliament, McVey got degrees in law and corporate governance, and then worked for the BBC and GMTV. She has also written a careers book called If Chloe Can, which was turned into a play and performed at the National Youth Theatre. Rowena Mason Up: David Lidington, Cabinet Office minister and chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster David Lidington was justice secretary for six months before being called on by Theresa May to steady the ship in the Cabinet Office. On paper, it looks like a sideways cabinet move, as Lidington gains the courtesy title of “chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster” but loses a meaty policy portfolio. However, he has greater importance than the title suggests because Lidington is taking over responsibilities from May’s former de facto deputy, Damian Green, who was sacked for lying about the presence of pornographic images on his House of Commons computer. Lidington is not getting Green’s title of first secretary of state, but the real importance of the Cabinet Office role is taking over chairmanship of at least some of the important cabinet committees, including the big Brexit ones. That means he will be in charge of navigating cabinet divisions on some big Brexit policies over the coming months. Lidington was a passionate supporter of staying in the EU, as a former Europe minister for years under David Cameron. But he is also regarded as clever and fair by his colleagues, with a good eye for detail and practicalities. It is not clear yet whether he will deputise for May at prime minister’s questions. He has done so in the past as leader of the Commons but he was outshone when he made his first outing against Labour’s Emily Thornberry. Rowena Mason Up: Karen Bradley, Northern Ireland secretary In appointing Karen Bradley to the politically sensitive job, Theresa May hopes to have put Northern Ireland in a safe pair of hands, replacing one trusted former Home Office colleague, James Brokenshire, with another. Not to be underestimated, said some who know the 47-year-old, Bradley is said to be sharp, firm and unfazed by big battles, having referred Rupert Murdoch’s takeover bid for Sky TV to the competition authorities in her former job as culture secretary. Others said she “merely covered her back on the Sky deal”. Northern Ireland is a difficult brief to take on at such a sensitive time and will require political skill, acumen, patience and determination. The Irish border remains contentious in Brexit talks and a tough decision on ruling Northern Ireland directly from Westminster is looming large if the impasse in talks aimed at restoring a power-sharing government is not broken. Bradley will not have the luxury of time to “read in” the brief and will be required to hit the ground running with meetings with all the parties in the previous Northern Ireland assembly. Lisa O’Carroll Up: Brandon Lewis, party chairman and minister without portfolio Brandon Lewis’s rise to party chairman is an example of Theresa May rewarding loyalty. The 46-year-old was instrumental in her leadership campaign, rallying support from Conservative MPs behind the scenes. Since then, he has served in her old patch at the Home Office, gaining a promotion to immigration minister and attending cabinet after last year’s election. Despite having supported the remain campaign at the EU referendum, Lewis has embraced the drive to create a new immigration system and spearheaded the proposed return to navy blue passports after Brexit. He was well regarded by the party under David Cameron and tipped for promotion before the 2015 election, although the opposition points to his responsibility for the troubled policy areas of housing and fire safety during the coalition years. Colleagues are likely to appreciate Lewis’s campaigning experience, as he won a marginal seat in the coastal area of Great Yarmouth from Labour in 2010. In the next two elections, he built up his majority and saw off a threat from Ukip. However, there may be scepticism about whether he is the right man to overhaul the party’s social media operation. His own efforts have been mocked, including a video about why Great Yarmouth is great that featured him making thumbs-up signs in front of local landmarks. Rowena Mason In: James Cleverly, deputy party chair James Cleverly has made no secret of his ambitions to go far in the Conservative party, openly saying he would love to be prime minister one day. “If I was wearing an England rugby shirt and someone tapped me on the shoulder and said: ‘Would you like to captain the team?’ of course you would bite their hand off. So, of course, in the same context if you’re passionate about politics and you want to make a difference and someone said: ‘Do you want to be prime minister?’ I think most of us would go: ‘Oh God, I’d love to do that,’” he said in an interview last year. The MP for Braintree was elected only in 2015 but has made a name for himself over the past two years as a fierce defender of the party with a vibrant social media account. A former London assembly leader for the Conservatives, he was a Brexit supporter at the referendum, who subsequently backed Boris Johnson’s abortive leadership bid in 2016. However, he swiftly became an effective cheerleader for Theresa May’s government, with frequent media appearances and a prolific presence on Twitter. His reputation for being a straight talker was cemented in 2015, when he admitted in a radio interview to having looked at online pornography and dabbled in illegal drugs, and then took part in a game of “snog, marry, avoid”, choosing to avoid the journalist Isabel Oakeshott, marry Yvette Cooper and snog Theresa May. Rowena Mason Up: Matt Hancock, culture secretary The grime fan will be a popular appointment as culture secretary for many in the media industry. In his position as digital minister, Hancock has been a cheerleader for Britain’s fledging technology industry but has also spoken out about fake news and the dangers of social media. His political career appeared to suffer a setback when Theresa May replaced David Cameron as prime minister. May demoted him from the cabinet, moving him from Cabinet Office minister to the digital brief. But, with Karen Bradley’s move to the Northern Ireland brief, Hancock has been rewarded with a promotion for knuckling down and getting on with his job. One of his first decisions will be about whether to allow 21st Century Fox to buy Sky when the Competition and Markets Authority publishes its recommendations. Graham Ruddick Out: Patrick McLoughlin The Conservative party chairman, whose cabinet seat comes via an official government role as chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, McLoughlin had been seen as almost certain to go after the disastrous general election campaign, which was followed by a misfiring party conference. McLoughlin was blamed – allies say unfairly – for overseeing security lapses such as a prankster gaining access to the conference hall in Manchester and handing Theresa May a fake P45 as she made her leader’s speech. He will nonetheless be one of the less noted cabinet departures, managing to keep a low public profile despite having been in parliament for more than 30 years, and on the frontbench for almost as long – McLoughlin’s first junior ministerial post was given to him by Margaret Thatcher in 1989. However, the 60-year-old is by no means a traditional Conservative grandee. After attending a state school in Staffordshire and the local agricultural college, McLoughlin worked as a farm labourer and miner, also becoming a local councillor and then – aged just 28 – succeeding Matthew Parris as MP for West Derbyshire, now known as Derbyshire Dales, when Parris quit politics for journalism, prompting a byelection. A supporter of remain in the Brexit referendum, McLoughin spent many years in the whips’ office, finally gaining a cabinet job in 2012 at transport, where he battled controversies over rail franchises and HS2. Peter Walker Out: James Brokenshire The timing of James Brokenshire’s departure from his post as Northern Ireland secretary couldn’t be worse, coming just two days before the first anniversary of the collapse of power-sharing at Stormont. His resignation on health grounds was a blow to Theresa May but it is also a setback for Northern Ireland, which is at yet another critical stage in its history. Northern Ireland has in the past been seen as either a wilderness or a poisoned chalice for incomers to the office, but it is now one of the most critical posts in the cabinet, with the Irish border one of the trickiest issues in the second phase of Brexit talks. Brokenshire, who celebrated his 50th birthday on Sunday, was considered a stabilising force, carefully walking the thin political tightrope after his predecessor, Theresa Villiers, whose open support for Brexit divided the remain-voting region. An MP since 2005, he was a loyal supporter of May with whom he worked with at the Home Office, and he was able to play a key role in keeping the Brexit talks intact after an eleventh-hour intervention by the DUP threatened to scupper a deal last month. He also had a good working relationship with Ireland’s foreign minister, Simon Coveney, and his predecessor, Charlie Flanagan. Critics say the passing of one Stormont deadline to restore power-sharing after another showed Brokenshire’s lack of influence in talks, but the death of Martin McGuinness undoubtedly left a hole in leadership on the nationalist side, with Sinn Féin struggling to get its voice heard in Westminster at a time when the DUP’s confidence and supply agreement had put them in the corridors of power. After discovering a lesion on his right lung that requires surgery, Brokenshire said he would not be fit enough to offer the energy that Northern Ireland requires. His successor faces huge challenges against the clock. Lisa O’Carroll Up: David Gauke, justice secretary David Gauke has been appointed as the new justice secretary and lord chancellor – the first solicitor, it is believed, ever to have held the post. Seen as a safe pair of hands, the former work and pensions secretary is the third Conservative MP within the past year to be put in charge of the Ministry of Justice. Gauke’s immediate priorities will be to deal with the crisis in English and Welsh prisons and to reassure demoralised sections of the legal profession when he reviews the impact of cuts to legal aid brought in by the coalition government. Rapid turnovers at the top at the MoJ and heavy cuts to the department’s budget – the deepest of any across Whitehall – have left lawyers fearing that its political status is being progressively downgraded. For centuries, the post of lord chancellor was held by a succession of barristers and judges. Since 2010, there have been six justice secretaries: Ken Clarke, who held the position for two years and four months, Chris Grayling, two years and eight months, Michael Gove, one year and four months, Liz Truss, 11 months, and David Lidington, six months. Only Clarke was a lawyer by profession. Gauke studied law at Oxford University and worked for a City law firm, Macfarlanes, for six years. His wife is also a lawyer.

The closest were the Los Angeles Rams, who in their previous run as tenants of the LA Coliseum, lost the 1980 Super Bowl in Pasadena’s Rose Bowl, 26 miles away. But throughout this improbable Minnesota Vikings season, the one that fell their way after rival quarterback Aaron Rodgers broke his collarbone, the Vikings have quietly eyed the Super Bowl that will be played on home turf. And in a season that has made no sense, where they had the NFC’s second-best record with a quarterback nobody much wanted, they came up with a miraculous final play to beat New Orleans 29-24 on Sunday, putting them one game from a Super Bowl in their stadium. Since such stories always take on an ethereal tone, it’s only fitting that the game-winning play was named: “7 Heaven”. What else could it be called? The Vikings were done in their NFC division round game against the Saints on Sunday. Even with their home crowd roaring so loud in the soaring, cathedral-like US Bank Stadium that once unwanted quarterback, Case Keenum, later said he couldn’t hear himself think, New Orleans led 24-23 with 14 seconds to play and the Vikings on their own 39-yard line. Before he ran 7 Heaven, Keenum looked at his receivers and said: “I’m going to give someone a chance.” Stefon Diggs would later say he hoped it would be him. Then it was. The ball came down from the stadium lights near the right sideline, there were two Saints defenders near Diggs as he jumped but he thought if he could just catch the ball, they might miss and he could scamper downfield far enough to give the Vikings a shot at a game winning field goal. He felt the ball hit his hands and waited for a New Orleans player to knock him out of bounds. No one did. Moments later the Vikings had one of the greatest wins in playoff history. “I couldn’t believe what was happening,” Keenum said in his postgame press conference. “It was awesome.” Who can believe anything about this Vikings season? After the game, Diggs stood at his postgame press conference and marveled at an offense filled with castaways pulled from the scrap heap. Diggs himself was once a high school superstar who went to his local college, the University of Maryland, only to be hurt for much of his time there. He tumbled to the fifth-round in the draft but has quietly grown into one of Minnesota’s most dependable receivers. Keenum wasn’t supposed to be here either. He was replaced by Jared Goff at the Rams last year and was signed to be a back-up behind Sam Bradford and Teddy Bridgewater, who was returning from a gruesome knee injury. But then Bradford was hurt the first game and Bridgewater wasn’t ready so Keenum became the starter and steadily led Minnesota to a division title. He stood in the team’s interview room after the game with a sport coat over a hooded sweatshirt and kept laughing. Why wouldn’t he? None of it made much sense. Now the Vikings with one of the NFC’s best defenses and a thrown-together offense go to Philadelphia for a chance to get one last game in their home stadium this season. Sometimes nothing makes sense. Sometimes you call a need-a-miracle play with a celestial name and heave the ball hoping for the best. And sometimes that play works in ways no one can understand. Even when 7 Heaven beats a team called the Saints. And the real miracle of the Vikings becoming the first team to host a Super Bowl is suddenly very real. Video of the week With Jacksonville holding a 27-7 first-half lead against the Pittsburgh Steelers on Sunday, Jaguars linebacker Myles Jack probably felt comfortable enough with the lead to mock the Steelers with the loser’s “L.” He was right in the end, but the Steelers gave the Jags a scare as the game ended 45-42. For whatever reason the Steelers just can’t beat Jacksonville. In the two games they have played this year, the Jags have outscored Pittsburgh 75-51. Back in October, the Jaguars intercepted Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger five times. On Sunday, Roethlisberger did have an interception and a fumble – both of which led to Jacksonville touchdowns – but he also threw for 469 yards and five touchdowns in the frenetic comeback. Sometimes teams just match up well with others. Of course, Pittsburgh shouldn’t have been playing Jacksonville on Sunday. Instead, they should have faced Tennessee, a team they beat 40-17 this season. But five weeks ago, they lost a game they should have won against New England, when replay officials took away what would have been a game-winning touchdown when the ball in tight end Jesse James’s hands moved slightly as he hit the ground. That defeat gave the Pats the No1 seed and delivered the Jaguars to Pittsburgh. How the smallest things can ruin everything. Fantasy player of the week Marcus Mariota. Yes, it must seem odd that the quarterback on the losing end of a blowout is the fantasy player of the week. But even in New England’s dominance of Tennessee it’s easy to see how good the Titans quarterback is going to be if he can stay healthy. Despite pulling his quadriceps muscle in the first quarter that affected his mobility, Mariota still completed 22-of-37 passes for 254 yards and two touchdowns. He had no interceptions and finished with a quarterback rating of 98.3 – only four points behind New England’s Tom Brady who threw for more yards and one more touchdown. Mariota also was Tennessee’s leading rusher with 37 yards. Sure, some of Mariota’s numbers were inflated because New England did a fantastic job of taking away the Titans star running back Derrick Henry and yet it seems Mariota is starting to grow into the expectations that came when he was chosen second overall in 2015’s draft. That didn’t seem the case just a few weeks ago as he struggled through his worst regular season to date, including two particularly poor games in December. Still, he played well in the final regular season game, a victory over Jacksonville that put Tennessee in the playoffs, and led the Titans on a second-half surge in Kansas City to get to Saturday night in New England. The Titans are going to have to support him better going forward but if he can be more consistent in the coming years a real Super Bowl run could be a possibility. Stat of the week 10,000. That’s the number of playoff passing yards Brady could pass in three weeks if the Patriots make the Super Bowl. Imagine that. Ten thousand yards. In the playoffs. Many quarterbacks consider 10,000 regular season passing yards to be a decent career. Only 187 in league history have thrown for that many. Quote of the week “We were able to recognize that pretty much before they even came out of the huddle.” – Eagles safety Malcolm Jenkins on defending the final play of Philadelphia’s 15-10 victory over Atlanta. While many around the NFL, including the ill-informed author of this space, believed the Falcons would storm through Philadelphia on Saturday afternoon, the Eagles defense did a good job of taking away what Atlanta does best. Defensive tackle Fletcher Cox had seven tackles, stifling the Falcons running game and the secondary never allowed star receiver Julio Jones to run free. And still, Atlanta were two yards from wining the game. Quarterback Matt Ryan led the Falcons on a 14-play-75 yard march over 5:04 late in the fourth quarter that must have made the Eagles’ stomachs quiver. But the Falcons were still two yards short of the game-winning touchdown with a fourth down. With essentially one shot to go to the NFC Championship game, Ryan rolled right, looking to throw, but the Eagles defense left no one open. “You eliminate all the plays that aren’t going to come,” Jenkins said. The one they settled on was one they had seen Atlanta run in similar situations and they were ready. They sealed up all the possibilities Ryan could pick and finally the quarterback had no choice but toss a pass for Jones that was too high to really catch, making the Eagles upset winners – something that sounds funny to say given they are the top seed in the NFC."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"news/2018/jan/15/paradise-papers-revealed-commoditisation-of-tax-evasion-australia","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-15T17:00:01Z","webTitle":"Paradise Papers revealed 'commoditisation' of tax avoidance","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/jan/15/paradise-papers-revealed-commoditisation-of-tax-evasion-australia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2018/jan/15/paradise-papers-revealed-commoditisation-of-tax-evasion-australia","fields":{"headline":"Paradise Papers revealed 'commoditisation' of tax avoidance","bodyText":"The Paradise Papers have helped to reveal a global industry of tax avoidance packages that are offered to wealthy individuals much like holiday packages, the Australian tax authorities say. The Paradise Papers have also revealed how offshore tax providers have expanded dramatically since the financial crisis, growing super-sized networks of accountants, lawyers and tax specialists that dwarf similar networks from a decade ago. Mark Konza, deputy commissioner at the Australian Taxation Office, said: “These [leaks] send a clear message to those people who are involved with these types of service providers: if you’re getting involved in any arrangement that relies on secrecy then you can’t rely on secrecy. “What we’re seeing [increasingly] is there are ordinary people who are becoming sick of some of the things they see happening.” Two months after the Paradise Papers were published, he told Guardian Australia that the names of 731 Australian taxpayers and 344 corporate entities had already been identified in the data. He said the ATO was still cross-matching the data in the Paradise Papers with the larger Panama Papers, which were released in 2016, but the information extracted so far was proving significant. “I would expect that as the data is interrogated further and cross-matched with other datasets [those numbers of individuals will increase],” he said. He said it was too early to say if individuals identified in the Paradise Papers were already known to the ATO. But the information gleaned from the Paradise Papers had revealed the extent to which intermediaries such as banks, law firms, and accountants have commoditised tax avoidance, he said. “The Panama Papers and the Paradise Papers led us to think about, well, what’s happening with these intermediaries that are encouraging this type of behaviour?” he said. “When we focused on the intermediaries, that’s when we began to see … the commoditisation of tax [avoidance]. “We were aware that there were companies providing these services, but I think what we’ve learnt is the commoditisation, with the internet, has continued apace. “We’ve also identified that after the global financial crisis, there was a round of mergers and acquisitions in the offshore provider industry itself, so while there are thousands of these offshore service providers we’ve identified that some large networks have begun to emerge. “One company we know has offices in 46 jurisdictions around the world, through constant merger and acquisition activity.” Konza said tax specialist intermediaries that help individuals avoid tax often specialise in particular regions of the world, such as the Caribbean and the Atlantic Ocean, or Asia and the Pacific Ocean. He said some of these intermediaries were brazenly promoting tax avoidance “packages” to individuals exactly like holiday packages. A simple internet search shows how such packages can be promoted. A typical tax “package” will help an individual set up a company in one jurisdiction, then help that company obtain a bank account in a second jurisdiction and a business address in a third jurisdiction. “They would say they give you the arrangements, they give you the tools, but what you do with them is up to you. So they try to stay morally ambivalent,” he said. “Some websites have various case studies on them, showing it’s possible to be done. One of my favourite case studies ends by saying ‘Is it legal? It’s pretty grey’,” he said. He said the ATO’s investigations sparked by the release of the Panama Papers and the Paradise Papers had an “iconic value” inside Australia’s tax system, because the subsequent tax crackdowns helped to reassure the community that individuals and companies were having to pay their lawful tax. “In a lot of these leaks you’re seeing people who have just become dissatisfied and thought enough’s enough, and so they’ve either leaked the information themselves or they might be an IT specialist who just grabs the data off the system, or we’ve had leaks from people who were outraged and they saw some firms and they decided to hack the firms from the outside.” “We get data releases quite regularly. In between the Panama Papers and the Paradise Papers, I think we’ve had about 13 different data releases from around the world. “We’re trying to get that message out to people: if you’re relying on secrecy you can’t rely on secrecy,” he said. Konza said another thing to emerge from investigations of the Panama Papers and Paradise Papers was the growing demand for so-called aged companies. “There’s a real market in companies that have been incorporated for some time, which are then used to make an arrangement appear to be long-standing, or appear to pre-date certain tax changes” he said. “So you could get a 20-year old Singaporean corporation, it will cost you twenty or thirty thousand dollars … no reflection on the Singaporeans, it’s just a company that’s been registered, there’d be aged Australian companies as well that you could probably buy. “The oldest company that we’ve seen for sale is a 1902 Nevada corporation from the US, which was almost US$200,000. He said these revelations were helping revenue authorities. “It makes you query basic facts about where has a company been for most of its existence – was it really an operating company or was it a vintage company bought off the shelf?” he said. “So there’ve been a few things that have come out of the papers already.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jan/15/channel-seven-under-fire-interview-far-right-activist-blair-cottrell","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-15T01:24:05Z","webTitle":"Channel Seven under fire over interview with far-right extremist","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jan/15/channel-seven-under-fire-interview-far-right-activist-blair-cottrell","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jan/15/channel-seven-under-fire-interview-far-right-activist-blair-cottrell","fields":{"headline":"Channel Seven under fire over interview with far-right extremist","bodyText":"Channel Seven has attracted criticism for reporting on a meeting of far-right activists in Melbourne and interviewing one of the movement’s ringleaders, Blair Cottrell, while failing to mention Cottrell’s criminal history, which includes racial vilification. He has also expressed admiration for Hitler and claimed to have manipulated women “using violence and terror”. On Sunday night Seven reported exclusively on a meeting of far-right groups which was attended by Cottrell, the head of the United Patriots Front. The reporter told viewers that “Seven News was the only news organisation invited inside the meeting”. The report said the members of the group did not not call themselves rightwing activists but described themselves as “patriots”. “They have come together to help average Australians deal with what they are calling an immigrant crime crisis,” the report said. “They’re hoping to create a kind of neighbourhood watch.” The segment then showed footage from an interview with Cottrell, who criticised the Victorian government and police for failing to address what he described as “a problem in this country”. The report failed to mention Cottrell’s criminal history, or to provide context to the meeting, including concerns that the African community is being targeted by far-right groups. Federal politicians have attacked the Victorian government and judiciary for failing to tackle the issue, despite the Victorian police deputy commissioner Andrew Crisp stating that only a relatively small number of people of African background were being convicted of crimes. Channel Seven initially declined to comment on the record when asked about the interview. Later on Monday Seven News director Simon Pristel said: “Seven News has reported on many meetings in the past couple of weeks held to discuss the African gang violence crisis, including governments, community leaders and police. Sunday’s meeting was newsworthy, so it was reported.” Cottrell was convicted in 2012 and 2013 0f offences including arson, burglary and damaging property, and has expressed pro-Nazi views. In September he was one of three far-right activists found guilty, convicted and fined under Victoria’s racial vilification laws for inciting contempt, revulsion or ridicule of Muslims. These offences were not mentioned in the Channel Seven report. This month the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, said people in Melbourne were “scared to go out to restaurants” because of “African gang violence”. Police statistics show the majority of crimes in Victoria are committed by people born in Australia. About 1.5% of offenders in Victoria are Sudanese-born, the Crime Statistics Agency Victoria says, although it cautions that the statistics are far from comprehensive. The lead author of the Monitoring Racial Profiling report from the Australian National University, Tamar Hopkins, said many mainstream media outlets were taking an “uncritical approach” to crime. “And that is quite scary when you have what is basically white supremacist vigilantism at work and other perspectives aren’t being put forward,” she said. “It’s a really strange time we’ve entered into where the media can get away with this kind of behaviour ... What keeps getting missed in all of this is Africans are already heavily discriminated against and here we have an organised group planning to target them. Dog-whistling by Dutton seems to have given licence to news agencies to carry on with these kinds of stories.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/jan/15/catherine-deneuve-speaks-out-over-metoo-controversy","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-15T00:46:51Z","webTitle":"Catherine Deneuve apologises to sex attack victims after #MeToo controversy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jan/15/catherine-deneuve-speaks-out-over-metoo-controversy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/jan/15/catherine-deneuve-speaks-out-over-metoo-controversy","fields":{"headline":"Catherine Deneuve apologises to sex attack victims after #MeToo controversy","bodyText":"Catherine Deneuve has apologised to female victims of sexual assault who were shocked and hurt by the controversial letter she signed attacking the #MeToo campaign. The French actor said she stood by the statement that caused an international outcry when it was published last week, but distanced herself from a number of other female signatories. Le Monde newspaper, which ran the original letter, described Deneuve’s response to the row as “a form of mea culpa”. About 100 French women, including high-profile writers, artists and academics, put their names to the attack on a wave of Anglo-American “puritanism” following the Harvey Weinstein sex abuse scandal. They suggested the #MeToo campaign (#BalanceTonPorc – Squeal on Your Pig – in France) in which women denounced their alleged attackers had gone too far. They defended the right of men to “importune” in the name of “sexual freedom” and claimed men were being subjected to a witch-hunt. In her letter, published in Libération, Deneuve said she had signed the statement because she opposed the “media lynching” of men accused of inappropriate behaviour and found its message “vigorous” if not “entirely right”. “Yes, I signed that petition, however, it seems absolutely necessary today to underline my disagreement with the way certain signatories have individually assumed the right to expand upon it in the media, distorting the spirit of the text,” she wrote. She referred to former radio presenter Brigitte Lahaie, who during a heated debate on BFMTV said women were able to “orgasm during a rape”. Without mentioning Lahaie by name, Deneuve said this was “worse than spitting in the face of those who have suffered this crime”. “Not only do these words suggest to those who are used to using force or sexuality to destroy that it’s not so serious … but when one signs a manifesto that engages other people, one avoids dragging them into one’s own verbal incontinence. It’s unworthy. And obviously nothing in the text claims that harassment is good, otherwise I wouldn’t have signed it,” she wrote. Reminding those who questioned her feminist credentials that she was among 343 women, including feminist writer Simone de Beauvoir, to sign a 1971 declaration admitting they had an abortion when it was still illegal, Deneueve dismissed the “conservatives, racists and traditionalists of all kinds who have found it strategic to give me their support”. “I am not fooled,” she wrote. “They will not have my gratitude or my friendship. Quite the opposite. “I’m a free woman and I will remain one. I fraternally salute all women victims of odious acts who might have felt assaulted by the letter in Le Monde. It is to them, and them alone, that I apologise.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"fashion/2018/jan/14/pradas-milan-menswear-show-all-about-nylon-industrial-scale","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-14T20:35:18Z","webTitle":"Prada's Milan menswear show is all about nylon on an industrial scale","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/jan/14/pradas-milan-menswear-show-all-about-nylon-industrial-scale","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2018/jan/14/pradas-milan-menswear-show-all-about-nylon-industrial-scale","fields":{"headline":"Prada's Milan menswear show is all about nylon on an industrial scale","bodyText":"Prada’s Instagram tagline reads “thinking fashion since 1913” and there’s little doubt that Miuccia Prada is still responsible for many of fashion’s big ideas. This means every detail in a Prada show, such as a change invenue, matters. Rather than the usual venue at the back of the company’s HQ, where the show has been held for decades, the autumn/winter Prada menswear 2018 show on Sunday night took place in the warehouse behind the Fondazione Prada, the gallery the brand opened in 1995. Guests walked through the plastic curtains usually found in abattoirs to find glasses of prosecco and the now-familiar conceptual canapés like two squares of dark chocolate on spongy white bread. A new venue it may be, but the Prada-isms remain. The show itself could be seen as a series of Prada-isms in clothes. It wasn’t quite a greatest hits, but fans would have recognised much-loved prints like the bananas from 2011 and the lipsticks from 2000 spliced on shirts, knitwear and cagoules and worn by male and female models. The black nylon that originally made Prada the darling of fashion in the 1990s was reworked through pieces made in collaboration with four different blue-chip architects and industrial designers, including Rem Koolhaas and Herzog &amp; de Meuron. An introduction included in the invite said the project showcased “approaches that investigate the poetic, practical, technical and aesthetic aspect of nylon”. The most poetic may have been Koolhaas’s – a bag worn strapped to the model’s chest like a reverse jetpack. In amongst the memory lane there was – as always – a comment on the way we live now. With the backdrop of a warehouse, Prada used the tropes of business on an industrial scale and the anonymity of corporate culture. Models wore Prada versions of the access cards used to get into offices on their chests and they carried messenger bags. Some models even had the layering of a working day in January: a shirt with a tie worn with padded gilet, blazer and mac. The mood for this part of the collection was equal parts Mr Robot’s eCorp, Charlie Brooker’s Black Mirror and Douglas Coupland’s Microserfs. Prada, dressed in a lemon-yellow mac and grey V neck, said the characters in the show were inspired by thinking what was in the crates around the venue. “Maybe there is strange mysteries,” she said. “We created the idea of species. We are also suggesting the idea that we are all controlled.” She described the look as “like a uniform. Even if the pieces were utilitarian, they didn’t look too street, they looked elegant.” The designer, who holds a PhD in political science, then got into her favourite topic: the state of the world today and fashion’s role within it. “Sometimes I see politics on the news I am scared, but you have to go on,” she said. “So many people say beauty will save the world. I don’t believe that is so ... but, of course, aesthetic helps.” Especially when that aesthetic is designed by Prada. The brand has recently prioritised digital as a way to boost sales, after initially resisting the rise of online. In December , Prada launched a new e-commerce platform in China and it will be rolled out to other territories this month. Chiara Tosato, general manager and digital e-commerce director, has said she wants digital to account for 5% of sales by the end of 2018. This remains below the average for others in the same market,which is usually about 10%. This digital push is connected to Prada’s financial performance. The Italian brand missed analysts predictions of growth in the most recent financial results in 2017, with net income at €115.7m (£102.84m) in the first half, compared with the €143m predicted."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jan/15/florida-prisoners-martin-luther-king-day-strike-slavery","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-15T11:00:01Z","webTitle":"Florida prisoners plan Martin Luther King Day strike over 'slavery'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/15/florida-prisoners-martin-luther-king-day-strike-slavery","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jan/15/florida-prisoners-martin-luther-king-day-strike-slavery","fields":{"headline":"Florida prisoners plan Martin Luther King Day strike over 'slavery'","bodyText":"Inmates of Florida’s prisons are planning to use Monday’s Martin Luther King Day holiday to launch a statewide strike over conditions they say amount to modern-day slavery. The unusual protest has been called by inmates angry at being used as unpaid clean-up crews for storm debris in sweltering temperatures last September, after Hurricane Irma struck the state. But organisers cite a number of other longstanding grievances for the planned month-long action, in which prisoners will refuse to take part in work assignments and forego purchasing “overpriced” luxury items such as snacks and toiletries, in an attempt to hit the state’s department of corrections in the pocket. “Our goal is to make the governor realise that it will cost the state of Florida millions of dollars daily to contract outside companies to come and cook, clean and handle the maintenance,” the unnamed prisoners said in a statement posted on the website of the inmates’ advocacy group Fight Toxic Prisons. “This will cause a total breakdown. We must use everything we have to show that we mean business.” Florida has the nation’s third-largest prison system with 97,000 inmates, according to state figures. It is also one of the most troubled and violent such systems, with allegations of abuse of inmates rife. In 2017, officers were cleared of blame for the death of a mentally ill patient they left in a scalding shower for two hours as punishment. In-depth investigations by the Miami Herald uncovered large numbers of rapes, beatings and cover-ups in the state’s non-air-conditioned jails. The prisoners have dubbed their protest Operation Push, after civil rights leader Jesse Jackson’s 1970s campaign to improve economic conditions for African Americans. Almost a third of Florida inmates are black, compared with fewer than 17% in the general population. One key demand is a reasonable wage for the labour inmates provide. “They force them to work at gunpoint and they pay them nothing,” said Paul Wright, executive director of the Florida-based Human Rights Defense Cener. “There’s a word for that, it’s called slavery. “Florida is one of the few states in the country that doesn’t pretend to pay even a nominal wage. Some states might say they pay 10 cents a day, or 15 cents an hour, or whatever, but here they make it pretty clear they don’t pay prisoners anything, they’re not going to, and prisoners are totally enslaved at every level. “There’s no legal way for Florida’s prisoners to earn money in the prison system.” The inmates also want the return of parole as an incentive for those with long-term sentences and an end to what they see as price gouging on food and other necessities. “One case of soup on the street cost $4, it costs us $17 on the inside,” the prisoners said in their statement. “This is highway robbery without a gun. It’s not just us that they’re taking from. It’s our families who struggle to make ends meet and send us money, they are the real victims.” Advocacy groups and friends and families of inmates have organised solidarity rallies outside several prisons and department of corrections offices on Monday, including in Miami and Tallahassee. According to the Tallahassee Democrat, officials sent an email to employees at department headquarters urging them to lock doors and stay inside during the protests. Tensions are running high in the Florida prison system. Last August, all facilities were placed on a three-day lockdown after unspecific threats of rioting. In an emailed statement to the Guardian and other media outlets, department of corrections communications director Michelle Glady did not address detailed questions about the planned response to Monday’s planned protests. “The department will continue to ensure the safe operation of our correctional facilities,” she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jan/15/morning-mail-the-stateless-man-trapped-in-detention","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-14T19:53:23Z","webTitle":"Morning mail: the stateless man trapped in detention","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jan/15/morning-mail-the-stateless-man-trapped-in-detention","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jan/15/morning-mail-the-stateless-man-trapped-in-detention","fields":{"headline":"Morning mail: the stateless man trapped in detention","bodyText":"Good morning, this is Eleanor Ainge Roy bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Monday 15 January. Top stories Said Imasi doesn’t know where he was born, or when, and has few official documents to demonstrate who he is or where he comes from. For this reason he has spent the past eight years detained by Australian immigration with no prospect of release. But calls are mounting for the government to release, and possibly compensate Imasi. “They say my case is complicated,” Imasi says. “I say, ‘I have been here eight years, how can you not know about me? How can it take this long?’ They blame me. But I am not accused of anything. They have never made any allegation against me.” In four reports to parliament, the commonwealth ombudsman has urged the immigration department to consider releasing Imasi, only to be refused. Now, the UN human rights committee’s working group on arbitrary detention has told Australia its detention of Imasi is unlawful, indefinite and arbitrary. “Seeking asylum is not a criminal act; on the contrary, seeking asylum is a universal human right,” the working group said. It said Australia’s “extraordinary lengthy detention” of Imasi, and its failure to properly assess his case, was unjustified and unreasonable. The top fashion photographers Mario Testino and Bruce Weber have been suspended from working with fashion magazines, including Vogue, after models accused the photographers of sexually exploiting them. Lawyers for Testino, known for photographing the royal family, disputed their accounts while Weber denied the claims. But Anna Wintour, the artistic director of Condé Nast, said the publisher would not work with the pair for the “foreseeable future”. Testino, 63, was accused by 13 male assistants and models of sexual impropriety, including masturbation, while Weber, 71, is accused by 15 current and former models of subjecting them to unnecessary nudity and coercive sexual behaviour. Labor sources are urging Wayne Swan to retire at the next election, with one describing the former treasurer as “one of the last relics of the Rudd-Gillard years”. The veteran Labor MP has yet to make a decision, describing himself as “very involved in the economic debate about how we create prosperity and opportunity”. But one Labor source said Swan should have left at the last election and it was time for new blood. Swan’s fellow AWU right member and former campaign manager Anika Wells is considered the most likely candidate to replace him in the Queensland seat of Lilley, which he has held since 1998. Thousands of Tunisians celebrated the seventh anniversary of the revolution on Sunday that ousted president Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali, capping a week of protests against the government they say now threatens its legacy. Amid growing anger, the president, Beji Caid Essebsi, made an unprecedented visit to one of the most deprived suburbs of the capital to launch a package of social reforms aimed at quelling the uprising. Mass protests have broken out in many parts of Tunisia in the past week, sparked by a harsh new budget, which pushes up the prices of necessities. The activist Chelsea Manning has announced she will run for the US Senate. Manning confirmed growing speculation that she planned to run as a Democrat in Maryland, sharing a video on Twitter hashtagged #WeGotThis. “We need someone willing to fight,” she said. The former US army private, who was held in military lockup for longer than any other official leaker in modern times, said she wanted to change the climate of fear, supression and hate in the US. Sport Liverpool have ended Manchester City’s 30-game unbeaten run in the Premier League with a sensational 4-3 victory at Anfield, inspired by Mohamed Salah. Three second-half goals in eight minutes put Jürgen Klopp’s side 4-1 ahead before the league leaders threatened an implausible comeback in the dying moments. The Ashes may be gone but England kicked off the one-day internationals with a thumping five-wicket win in the first of a five-game series. Jason Roy pillaged 180, the highest score by an Englishman in ODIs to reach the target of 305, more than matching Aaron Finch’s century for the home side. Thinking time Naaman Zhou plunged headlong into Australia’s first foray into slow TV on Sunday, watching pretty much all 17 hours of The Ghan’s journey from Adelaide to Darwin. “Viewed occasionally as something to pop in and out of, slow TV is relaxing, inoffensive,” he writes. “Viewed intensely, it becomes a journey of highs and lows, more stark the closer you zoom in. If you engage with it, it pushes back. As the timeframe approaches infinity, the odds of something becoming interesting becomes certain.” More than 10 years after fossils were discovered sticking out of a rock platform in Victoria’s remote south-west, scientists have identified a new dinosaur that once roamed the “lost world” between Australia and Antarctica. Foot and tail fossils found in 113m-year-old rocks near Cape Otway in 2005 have led to the discovery of a turkey-sized herbivore named Diluvicursor Pickeringi. It ran on two strong hind legs and probably weighed between 3kg and 4kg. “Understanding the ecology of these dinosaurs – what they ate, how they moved, where they roamed ... presents exciting challenges for future research,” says Matt Herne, from the University of Queensland’s school of biological sciences. Milkshake duck has been announced as the Macquarie Dictionary’s word of the year for 2017, giving belated recognition to the internet term that has become short-hand for the rush to seize on the latest social media phenomenon before rejecting it just as enthusiastically.

What’s he done now? Donald Trump has tweeted a blunt and undiplomatic prediction that Daca – the program protecting the children of undocumented immigrants to the US – is “probably dead”, alarming Democrats and the tens of thousands of young people whose fate is is now being argued in multiple courts across the US. “DACA is probably dead because the Democrats don’t really want it, they just want to talk and take desperately needed money away from our Military,” Trump wrote.

Veronica, the Dowager Countess of Lucan, was found dead at home in Westminster in September, after she had been reported missing. An inquest ruled last week that the aristocrat had killed herself after a false self-diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease. She had three children, Frances, Camilla and George, now the eighth Earl of Lucan, but had severed relations with her family in the 1980s, and continued to decline contact with them right up until her death. A spokeswoman for the housing charity confirmed that the proceeds from Lucan’s estate had been donated to it. She said: “At a time when over 300,000 people in Britain are without a home, we are incredibly grateful for the support we receive. The proceeds from Lady Lucan’s estate will help Shelter to continue fighting bad housing and homelessness.” Camilla Bingham, a QC, told the Mail on Sunday: “Mummy left her estate to the homeless charity Shelter.” In a statement after her death, her children and sisters said they remembered her “lovingly and with admiration”. They said: “She had a sharp mind, and when she spoke it, she did so eloquently. She was courageous and, at times, outrageous, with a mischievous sense of humour. “She was, in her day, beautiful and throughout her life fragile and vulnerable, struggling as she did with mental infirmity. To us she was and is unforgettable.” Lucan had been the only known witness to the terrible events in 1974 that led to the murder of her children’s nanny, Sandra Rivett, 29, at the family home in Belgravia, central London. The countess maintained that the nanny had been bludgeoned to death by her estranged husband, John Bingham, the seventh Earl of Lucan, who in the dimly lit basement had mistaken Rivett for his wife. Lady Lucan was also severely beaten before escaping and raising the alarm at a nearby pub, the Plumbers Arms. Lord Lucan vanished after the murder, and his borrowed car was found abandoned and blood-spattered, with a section of bandaged lead piping in the boot, at the cross-Channel port of Newhaven, East Sussex. A year later an inquest jury declared that the wealthy peer had killed Rivett. Although officially declared dead by the high court in 1999, he was reportedly sighted in Australia, Ireland, South Africa and New Zealand, and there were claims that he had fled to India and lived as a hippy called “Jungly Barry”. Last year, Lady Lucan gave a television interview in which she said she believed her husband had jumped off a cross-Channel ferry “in the way of the propellers so that his remains wouldn’t be found – I think quite brave”.

On Monday, MPs will be called to endorse a “multi-bill” of emergency reforms that includes contentious legislation to limit industrial action. Unionists have reacted with a barrage of strikes, with more work stoppages and walkouts promised. “These were rights won with sweat and blood more than three decades ago,” Odysseus Trivalas, the president of the union of public sector workers, told the Guardian. “Banks, industrialists and foreign investors want to deny us them. We won’t make it easy. We will take to the streets.” In the nearly nine years since its descent into economic crisis, an estimated 50 general strikes have been held in Greece with workers viewing industrial action as sacrosanct. Under the new law, Alexis Tsipras’s leftist-led government has agreed that unions will have to have much larger quorums to enable strikes to be called. “Effectively it will be impossible for workers in factories to have their voice heard,” said Trivalas. “They keep saying Greece is turning a corner, that this will help growth, but the reality is the little man won’t feel it in his pocket for another 20 years. The law is totally undemocratic, a form of modern slavery.” Communist-affiliated trade unionists stormed the labour ministry last week, prising open metal shutters with knives and crowbars before confronting the minister, Effie Achtsioglou, in her eighth-floor office. The slight 32-year-old was visibly shaken as protesters, shouting: “Shame on you,” demanded she withdraw the measure. A banner bearing the words “Hands off strikes, it’s a labour right” was hung from the building’s facade. In addition to the strike clampdown, the multi-purpose bill also foresees properties belonging to bad debt holders being auctioned online. This is essential, creditors say, if Greece’s large level of non-performing bank loans is also to be dealt with. Both measures have been hugely unsettling for governing leftists, many of whom started off in the trade union movement. About 100 reforms, known as “prior actions”, are contained in the bill being debated. Although they are ultimately expected to be passed, Tsipras, the prime minister, has been forced to prevail on Syriza cadres to see the bigger picture: that, once the measures are approved, Greece will be able to complete a compliance review that will release more emergency funds before its third, and hopefully last, bailout programme expires in August. Holding his first cabinet meeting of the year last week, the leader announced that the country was in the “final stretch” of international supervision – surveillance ushered in with its first €120bn (£107bn) economic adjustment programme in May 2010. “A lot of Syriza MPs are upset because these measures hurt their leftwing ideology and feelings,” said the political analyst Pantelis Kapsis. The Greek government is hoping to make a “clean exit” from creditor oversight, calculating that a successful compliance review will facilitate market forays that will allow the country to build a cash buffer before its €86bn bailout – orchestrated by the European Union, International Monetary Fund and European Central Bank – officially ends. Excluded from capital markets since the outbreak of the crisis, Greece has been unable to refinance a debt load that at about €320bn, or 180% of GDP, is by far the highest in the EU. For Tsipras, personally, regaining economic independence has become essential to his own political survival given Syriza’s dramatic slide in popularity under the weight of austerity measures. On Sunday, Athens was told clearly that international monitoring was unlikely to end soon. Debt relief, said Thomas Wieser, the outgoing Euro Working Group chief and a central player in the Greek debt drama, was only likely only if Athens pushed through further reforms once its bailout formally ends."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jan/15/victoria-may-extend-yallourn-coal-licence-despite-zero-emissions-pledge","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-15T05:52:38Z","webTitle":"Victoria may extend Yallourn coal licence despite zero-emissions pledge","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jan/15/victoria-may-extend-yallourn-coal-licence-despite-zero-emissions-pledge","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jan/15/victoria-may-extend-yallourn-coal-licence-despite-zero-emissions-pledge","fields":{"headline":"Victoria may extend Yallourn coal licence despite zero-emissions pledge","bodyText":"The Victorian government is considering whether to extend the coalmining licence for Australia’s most polluting power station, Yallourn, in the state’s Latrobe Valley. A spokesman for the resources minister, Tim Pallas, said the government’s mining industry regulator, Earth Resources Regulation, was assessing the mine licence extension application and was expected to provide advice to the minister shortly. The existing licence was issued in 1996 and is due to expire in 2026. In November the Victorian government legislated for net zero emissions by 2050, and set interim emissions reduction targets at five-year intervals. The CEO of Environment Victoria, Mark Wakeham, said extending the licence would pose an “unacceptable risk” to the climate and to the stability of an ageing electricity grid. He said given the zero-emissions legislation, the government should reject the proposal outright. “Since the closure of Hazelwood, Yallourn has taken the mantle of dirtiest power station in Australia,” Wakeham said. “Rather than proposing to extend the life of this polluting clunker we should be planning for its closure and supporting the Latrobe Valley community with a fair and just economic transition. “The Andrews government mustn’t give special treatment to ageing coal-burning power stations that are endangering our climate.” Yallourn has sought an extension to continue open-cut coalmining operations to 31 December 2032, at which point it has said it will turn its efforts towards mine rehabilitation. But an honorary associate professor with the Australian National University’s school of public policy, Hugh Saddler, said he did not believe the refusal of license extensions to mine coal should be used as a de facto mechanism for driving the closure of high-emission power stations. The federal government’s proposed national energy guarantee would not adequately support coal stations to transition away from high-emissions power generation, he said. “Just because a power station might be granted an extension, it also doesn’t mean they will keep operating the power station until that date,” Saddler said. “Some years ago the then owner of Hazelwood sought and was given an extension which went way beyond last year when it closed. I don’t think that the refusal of the licence to mine coal should be used as the instrument to plan the orderly closure to high-emission power stations.” While Saddler said he opposed the extension of Hazelwood’s licence at the time, he said circumstances had changed. “What is happening now with the electricity system is we are entering into a period of transition which is huge and which is a really historic change, similar to the change away from Telecom to mobile phones,” he said. “It’s a massive change and it’s clear to everyone the change is being very much driven by new technologies. Apart from the environmental requirements to change, the economics of renewables alone are a powerful driver away from traditional suppliers. “But that has massive implications to the structure of the electricity grid, which is an enormous asset, and what we haven’t had in Australia is a clear and consistent way to plan for that. We need something better than what the proposed national energy guarantee offers.” In the absence of a strategy, it was not unreasonable to grant power plants more time to transition through a license extension as a kind of insurance policy, he said. The proposed national energy guarantee would require energy retailers to commit to a reliability guarantee to meet energy needs in each state from sources such as coal, gas, pumped hydro and batteries, while also signing up to an emissions guarantee to meet Australia’s international commitments to reducing emissions. It would effectively force electricity providers to have a mix of energy sources, including low-emission sources. The guarantee, which requires sign-on from state and territory governments, has been met with a mixed response, with some experts saying it will encourage investment in low-cost renewables, while others believe it does not go far enough to push providers away from polluting energy sources."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/jan/15/pesky-little-birds-corella-culls-planned-in-western-australia","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-15T00:30:12Z","webTitle":"'Pesky little birds': corella culls planned in Western Australia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/15/pesky-little-birds-corella-culls-planned-in-western-australia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/jan/15/pesky-little-birds-corella-culls-planned-in-western-australia","fields":{"headline":"'Pesky little birds': corella culls planned in Western Australia","bodyText":"Regional councils in Western Australia are using fireworks, lethal gas, nets, and mass shooting to reduce the number of corellas, which are reportedly damaging buildings and destroying infrastructure. The culprits are primarily eastern long-billed corellas, Cacatua tenuirostris, which were introduced to WA as a popular aviary bird. Aviary escapees bred to create large wild flocks, which pose a threat to endemic birds such as the three WA subspecies of corella and local black cockatoos by competing for food and nesting spots. Regional towns in mid- and south-west WA receive an increasing number of complaints about the birds each year, which the ABC reports have stripped rubber sealing from windows and damaged copper wiring. Geraldton’s mayor, Shane van Styn, said the birds “don’t just eat, they destroy”. He put the annual damage bill at $400,000, and told the ABC attempts to scare the birds away had not worked. “We’re going to kill a few of these pesky little birds, and hopefully that sends a clear message to them to rack off,” Van Styn said. “They will be netted after being lured to the ground using wheat or any other nice snacks that they might like to consume, at which point they’ll be rounded up and taken to a place to be humanely gassed.” The plan in Bunbury is similar: scatter grain, cast a net and shoot them at point-blank range with a rifle. An earlier attempt to use fireworks to scare the birds away was not successful because the flocks reconvened nearby. Busselton, 5okm south of Bunbury, warned residents it planned to use an artificial noisemaker that made “a loud whistle similar to a small fireworks rocket” to frighten the birds. Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions guidelines say culling corellas is an option of last resort, but that trapping and shooting quickly with a low-powered rifle was the most humane option. It issued permits for the culling of 2,000 birds last year. “Frightened corellas will injure themselves and other birds, so they must be euthanased as quickly and humanely as possible after trapping,” it said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/jan/15/householders-could-face-fines-for-using-fly-tippers","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-15T00:01:41Z","webTitle":"Householders could face fines for using fly-tippers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/15/householders-could-face-fines-for-using-fly-tippers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/jan/15/householders-could-face-fines-for-using-fly-tippers","fields":{"headline":"Householders could face fines for using fly-tippers","bodyText":"Households whose rubbish ends up being dumped illegally by unauthorised disposal companies could face fines under plans being considered by the government. Councils could be given the power to directly fine people caught using unlicensed waste carriers following a consultation by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). This would spare local authorities the cost of chasing problem homeowners through the courts, and encourage people to check their refuse is being disposed of legally. Guidance would be issued on how such fines should be applied to stop councils abusing it to raise extra cash, Defra said. The measures, which could be brought in by spring 2018 following a vote in parliament, form part of a government drive to thwart fly-tippers and shut down illegal waste sites. More than 1m incidents of fly-tipping were dealt with by councils in England in 2016-17, costing taxpayers £58m in clean-up charges, according to figures released by Defra. More than 850 illegal dumping grounds were uncovered by the Environment Agency over the past year, with an average of two closed each day, according to the government. Thérèse Coffey, the environment minister, said: “Waste crime and fly-tipping blight our communities and spoil our countryside, and we need determined action to tackle it. “These new powers for the Environment Agency (EA) will curb the rise of waste sites that continue to operate outside the law. But we must all take responsibility for our waste to make sure it does not end up in the hands of criminals who will wilfully dump it.” Defra said the consultation, launched on Monday, would also examine how crime and poor performance in the waste sector could be combated. This could include a tightening of the requirements for EA waste permits, as well as promoting awareness about which sites are legal. Emma Howard Boyd, who chairs the Environment Agency, welcomed the new powers, which will enable the agency to block access to problem sites to prevent illegal waste building up. Operators at the sites also face being forced to clear all the waste there, not just illegal disposals. She said: “This will allow us to take faster action against criminals and will make a real difference to communities, but everyone has a role to play. We all need to check our waste is going to the right place and is handled by the right people.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/blog/2018/jan/14/roberto-firmino-liverpool-manchester-city-anfield","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-14T20:05:09Z","webTitle":"Roberto Firmino’s fire and fury trumps Pep Guardiola and Manchester City | Barney Ronay","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/jan/14/roberto-firmino-liverpool-manchester-city-anfield","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2018/jan/14/roberto-firmino-liverpool-manchester-city-anfield","fields":{"headline":"Roberto Firmino’s fire and fury trumps Pep Guardiola and Manchester City","bodyText":"There was a moment of jarringly delicate beauty 58 minutes into this game as Liverpool did not just beat Manchester City at Anfield but wrenched that frictionless unbeaten run away from the league leaders with a startling, controlled fury. Jürgen Klopp’s side were led here by Roberto Firmino, who produced another performance of thrillingly sustained energy and skill, terrorising City’s backline at times in the second half and embodying the pure exhilaration of Klopp’s high-craft power-chord football. With the score level at 1-1 Liverpool were already thrumming up though the gears, about to enter a rare 10-minute period of synchronised press-and-move football during which the whole world seemed to turn a shade of red; and during which they were, briefly, unstoppable. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain took the ball deep in Liverpool’s half and played a snaking pass inside John Stones. As Stones turned to shield the ball he was bullocked out of the way with malevolent glee by Firmino, a player for whom pressing and closing down is not so much a chore as a hungrily devoured pleasure. With Stones on his knees Firmino paused, looked up and produced a moment of startling delicacy, from sledgehammer to scalpel in a single shift of feet, lifting a lovingly dinked finish past Ederson as he rushed out. For a moment the ball seemed to hang dreamily under the lights, the air rushing out of the stadium, before falling in a gentle parabola and bouncing in off the post. Anfield exploded with a huge gurgle of joy. Firmino sprinted for the corner flag. And three minutes later it was 3-1, from a similar moment of snatch and run. This time Mohamed Salah robbed Nicolás Otamendi, then fed the ball across the penalty area. Sadio Mané picked it up, paused and spanked the ball with startling precision into the top corner. It was always likely to take something like this to throw City out of their stride, a performance where every part thunked into place, where both the plan and the execution reached a rare pitch of perfection. How to play City, how to beat City, how to make at least some imprint on that well-grooved machine has been a theme of this mid‑season title stroll. Liverpool’s hard‑running, hard-pressing style had always offered some hope of locating the glass jaw some had suggested still lurks behind that annihilating jab, the poise of City’s passing game. And City played their part in a wonderfully open game. Where other managers might have tried to shut things down away to their liveliest challengers, Guardiola put out a team with three full-time defenders and six midfielders of varying shades. Klopp made one big call, dropping the regularly unconvincing Simon Mignolet for the as-yet only briefly unconvincing Loris Karius. On a freezing, damp, ear-numbing afternoon Anfield’s vast single-tier stands were crackling with electricity at kick-off. And with three minutes gone two things happened for the first time that would come to define this game. Firmino ripped an alarmingly huge hole in the centre of City’s defence with a single movement, barging a yard of space and flicking the ball cleverly into Mané’s path, setting the tone for an afternoon where Liverpool’s frontline would play right up against one another, like three men roped together on a mountain. Moments later the second thing happened. Raheem Sterling touched the ball for the first time, to huge boos, and then gave it away for the first time, to huge cheers. If Firmino led Liverpool’s surge here, Sterling was a key part in City’s stumbling start. Frankly, he had a nightmare. Sterling left the pitch with 25 minutes to go, roared off to a standing anti‑ovation by the home crowd after one of those performances where no matter how hard you try, how furiously you work to put things right, they just keep slipping away, the bobble off the shin, the muffed dribbles, the inevitable booking. As he brushes his teeth this evening Sterling will no doubt find himself taking a sneaky look up in the mirror just to check that shape lurking by the bathroom door is not Andrew Robertson steaming out of the airing cupboard to make another sniping, raking challenge at his heels. Before long Firmino had helped make the opening goal for Oxlade‑Chamberlain, stealing the ball from Fabian Delph and feeding it forwards. Oxlade-Chamberlain pinged a hard, low shot into the far corner, taking it so early Ederson had no time to adjust his position as he clawed at it helplessly. As half‑time approached, Kevin De Bruyne, who was brilliant in defeat, led City back into this game. Even in an occasionally traumatic defeat City were good enough to score three goals, and might even have pulled it back to 4-4. No doubt Premier League teams will wonder if this level of forward‑fury can be replicated, if Liverpool might just have left a lasting bruise. It seems unlikely. Not many have a Firmino to throw at this City defence, a blur of movement, power and creative mischief on an afternoon when City finally met an opponent in their own irresistible red zone."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"education/2018/jan/14/tony-wingate-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-14T18:00:08Z","webTitle":"Tony Wingate obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/jan/14/tony-wingate-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2018/jan/14/tony-wingate-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Tony Wingate obituary","bodyText":"My friend Tony Wingate, who has died aged 86, was an inspirational teacher and the founder of Wingate Scholarships. He was a quiet man committed to doing good. Born in London to Harry Wingate, a property developer, and his wife, Minnie (nee Goff), Tony spent most of his childhood in the capital, apart from being evacuated to Bermuda in the early years of the second world war. He returned to prep school in Hampstead, then Harrow school (which he hated), and in 1951, after national service, to Trinity Hall, Cambridge, to study law. There he blossomed, not only intellectually, but also as a member of a remarkable circle of friends who sustained one another throughout their lives. The world of law and commerce did not appeal to Tony, and at a friend’s suggestion he started teaching at Tower Bridge school – and found his vocation. He took a postgraduate diploma at the Institute of Education (IOE) and went on to a successful career as a teacher of English in London comprehensive schools. Former pupils described him as a dynamic and brilliant teacher who had the rare ability to change lives. He was deputy head of Wood Green school in the early 1970s and later head of Rutherford school in Paddington until its amalgamation with two other schools in 1981. After a dispiriting year as head of a closing school, and various advisory positions, he decided to retire. Education and the arts, especially music, were Tony’s lifelong passion, and his next move, in 1988, was to harness some of the funds from his family’s trust, the Harold Hyam Wingate Foundation, to found and direct Wingate Scholarships – which I administered – making awards across a vast range of subjects to enable people of any age to carry out projects they could not otherwise have done. In 2008 the IOE awarded Tony an honorary doctorate primarily in recognition of this work. He was also busy as a magistrate in both adult and juvenile courts during these years. Tony never stopped giving – as an individual, through his own trust, Fidelio, and through the foundation. But there was still time for friends, travel and, above all, music. Combining these interests we went together to many music events, especially every summer the Verbier music festival, in the Swiss Alps, which was his greatest delight. He is survived by his brothers, David and Roger, and his nephews and nieces. His sister, Nina, predeceased him."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/jan/14/women-football-roundup-arsenal-reading-manchester-city-chelsea-birmingham-bristol-city","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-14T17:31:35Z","webTitle":"Women’s football roundup: Arsenal to face Manchester City in cup final","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/14/women-football-roundup-arsenal-reading-manchester-city-chelsea-birmingham-bristol-city","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jan/14/women-football-roundup-arsenal-reading-manchester-city-chelsea-birmingham-bristol-city","fields":{"headline":"Women’s football roundup: Arsenal to face Manchester City in cup final","bodyText":"Arsenal overhauled Reading with a late rally in a pulsating Continental Tyres Cup semi-final.

Didn’t he utter vulgar, racist and vile statements during his presidential campaign; sometimes linking the whole religion of Islam to terrorism, violence and sexual harassment; sometimes pledging to build a wall to deter Mexican migrants from entering the US, describing them as rapists, murderers and drug dealers; sometimes promising to recognise Jerusalem, a city sacred for followers of the three Abrahamic faiths, as the capital of Israel, compromising America’s stance as an honest broker in the Middle East; sometimes pledging to humiliate the House of Saud and milk their coffers? Didn’t he promise to withdraw the US from the Paris treaty on global warming? He acted on all his verbal campaign’s promises. We shouldn’t be surprised at the vulgarity of President Trump. Instead, we should blame those who raised him to the highest echelon of power.

This has been a Champions Cup season of vivid, gripping contrasts in which the Pro14 sides are teaching their wealthy English and French league counterparts an increasing lesson in humility. Even if the Premiership sides, in particular, stage a last-gasp resurrection they are already scrabbling for quarter-final crumbs. It could be that England has only one representative – or possibly none – in a last eight that could contain five Pro14 sides. Two years ago there were five Premiership quarter‑finalists and none at all from the then Pro12. The pendulum has swung. While Exeter and Saracens can still secure an away quarter-final if they win their final pool fixtures against Glasgow and Northampton respectively, they are battling a continental tide that has swept away Saints, Harlequins and Leicester. Barring a late reprieve, Bath and Wasps are probably heading the same way. If the English decline is entirely a coincidence it is a striking one. Anyone who watched the Scarlets paint the Recreation Ground red on Friday night will certainly suspect otherwise. Both with ball in hand and around the breakdown, the Welsh region made Bath – a Premiership top-six side, albeit reliably inconsistent – look plodding and mediocre. At scrum‑half Gareth Davies looked every inch a top-class nine, the Irish lock Tadhg Beirne and his second-row partner David Bulbring were colossal and Rhys Patchell and Hadleigh Parkes gave the national selectors a monumental nudge. The sureness of the handling, the accuracy of the passing and offloading, the support running and defensive steel were also a huge tribute to the coaching of Wayne Pivac, Stephen Jones and Byron Hayward, all of whom must be rising up the queue to take control of Wales when Warren Gatland and his current team step aside. If Gatland’s squad perform half as fluently as the elusive Scarlets in the upcoming Six Nations they will generate a whole lot of love. It would also further query the received wisdom that European form and Six Nations success are two different things. That cosy assumption is beginning to feel outdated; how can, say, Ireland’s national management be anything other than upbeat when their three competing provinces are so competitive in the Champions Cup and Leinster are positively rampant? Is it entirely a fluke England have won the last two Six Nations titles in the same years that Saracens have scooped successive European crowns? Which begs the next big question: might the Premiership’s faltering form in Europe and the rising confidence of the Pro14’s leading lights spell trouble for England and Eddie Jones over the next two months? Even if Billy Vunipola recovers swiftly from his fractured forearm, Jones’s side are going to encounter a revitalised bunch of opponents heartened by what they have seen in Europe of late. Even the Europe-conquering Saracens have not won in Wales on their last two visits, while the only English clubs to score a cross-border win away in this season’s Champions Cup have been Exeter in Montpellier and Bath in a deluge in Llanelli. Privately, leading Premiership coaches continue to argue the relentless nature of their league exacts a mental toll that makes it harder for their teams to get up consistently even for big Europe dates. One illustration: Munster’s outstanding Lions scrum-half Conor Murray has played only five Pro14 games this season while his English counterpart Ben Youngs has already started twice as many Premiership fixtures for Leicester. The all-consuming nature of England’s training camps, as Jones seeks to drive his squad ever onwards, has also clearly made it tough for certain players to satisfy two masters, with the threat of relegation a constricting factor for some. There is a big difference between being battle-hardened and overplayed, and too many English players still operate on the wrong side of that line. At the same time, though, there is no disputing the increasing quality of the coaching in the Pro14. Pivac, Jones, Dave Rennie, Stuart Lancaster, Rassie Erasmus, Johann van Graan, Bernard Jackman, Richard Cockerill: all have coached in more than one country and their desire to outwit each other is raising standards across the board. All of which leaves the Premiership trying to polish something potentially rather nasty, despite Northampton’s brave win against an injury-wracked Clermont and Harlequins’ late showstopper against Wasps. Dai Young’s side will need a bonus-point victory – and deny Ulster a losing bonus point – in Coventry next Sunday to remain mathematically afloat, while Bath’s fate is in others’ hands, even if they win big in Italy against Benetton on Saturday. Exeter may well also require a bonus-point success in Glasgow, even if their six-try demolition of the French league leaders Montpellier on Saturday again underlined their quality in adversity. Saracens, meanwhile, could still be stranded even if they conclude with another points landslide against their recent whipping boys Northampton. An Ospreys win in Clermont will slam the door whatever happens. In that event the English will be staring at their leanest season in Europe since 2011-12, when Saracens were the only Premiership representatives in the last eight and ended up losing 22-3 at home to Clermont. The only previous time England have failed to supply a single quarter-finalist was in 1999, the year they boycotted the competition entirely. John Pullin’s famous line after England’s defeat by Ireland in Dublin in 1973 – “We may not be much good but at least we turn up” – may soon have to be revisited."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/jan/14/billy-vunipola-england-six-nations-broken-arm-injury-rugby-union","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-14T16:03:58Z","webTitle":"Billy Vunipola set to miss England’s Six Nations campaign after arm break","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jan/14/billy-vunipola-england-six-nations-broken-arm-injury-rugby-union","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jan/14/billy-vunipola-england-six-nations-broken-arm-injury-rugby-union","fields":{"headline":"Billy Vunipola set to miss England’s Six Nations campaign after arm break","bodyText":"England have been dealt a hammer blow before the defence of their Six Nations title after it was confirmed that Billy Vunipola has sustained a fractured forearm in yet another injury setback for the No 8. Vunipola will see a specialist this week to determine a time frame for his return but he is almost certain to miss England’s Six Nations opener on 4 February in Italy and his participation at any stage of the tournament is now in serious doubt. The 25-year-old was taken off during half-time of Saracens’ Champions Cup draw with Ospreys and afterwards the Saracens assistant coach Alex Sanderson revealed that Vunipola could not feel his wrist. A subsequent x-ray has confirmed the worst and while the recovery time for a fractured forearm can vary greatly, Ireland’s Joey Carbery sustained a similar injury in mid-November and is yet to return. It is desperate news for England, with Nathan Hughes also unavailable for at least the first three Six Nations matches with a knee injury, and similarly deflating for Vunipola, who was making just his second appearance after nearly four months out of action with a knee injury that required surgery. He also missed the British &amp; Irish Lions tour last summer with a shoulder injury and has started once for England since the autumn of 2016, having missed the first three matches of the 2017 Six Nations with a knee injury. Vunipola has been outspoken when discussing the strains put on professional players, saying in September: “I just want people to understand that having surgery is not fun, and it’s not fun being injured. It gets to a point when you are just done.” He was, however, sanguine following his latest setback, posting on social media: “One of these days I might actually be able to play more than two games without breaking (no pun intended).” Vunipola’s injury also compounds Eddie Jones’s woes in the back row, with Hughes, who has worn the No 8 jersey with distinction over the past 12 months, and Tom Curry also absent through injury. Sam Simmonds, who shone in Exeter’s win against Montpellier on Saturday, is now favourite to start at No 8 in Rome., having done so against Samoa in November Adding to Jones’s selection headaches is the fact that James Haskell was sent off in the closing stages of Wasps’ defeat by Harlequins for a dangerous tackle in which he floored Jamie Roberts after making contact with the Welshman’s head. He has apologised to Roberts on social media but will face a disciplinary hearing this week and any suspension of three weeks or more will rule him out of facing Italy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"society/2018/jan/14/inexperienced-medical-students-urged-volunteer-nhs-winter-crisis-worsens","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-14T21:30:37Z","webTitle":"Medical students urged to volunteer as NHS winter crisis worsens","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jan/14/inexperienced-medical-students-urged-volunteer-nhs-winter-crisis-worsens","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/jan/14/inexperienced-medical-students-urged-volunteer-nhs-winter-crisis-worsens","fields":{"headline":"Medical students urged to volunteer as NHS winter crisis worsens","bodyText":"Medical students are being urged to help relieve the NHS winter crisis because hospitals are so short-staffed they are struggling to cope with the surge in patients, the Guardian can reveal. Despite their lack of experience, undergraduates are being asked to volunteer in A&amp;E units and on wards reeling under the weight of extra demand caused by the cold weather, an outbreak of flu and people suffering serious breathing problems. They have been told to expect to fit cannulas – the tubes inserted so patients can receive medication – and take blood, work usually done by nurses or qualified doctors. The British Medical Association said that asking students who had not qualified in medicine to assist with, in some cases, severely ill patients was “a desperate measure” that could put patients at risk and exploit undergraduates who agreed to help. The disclosure led to warnings that hospitals could face legal difficulties if students made mistakes and concern that their presence on wards could disguise the depth of NHS understaffing. Medical schools are asking fourth- and fifth-year students for urgent assistance at “hard-pressed” nearby hospitals and GP surgeries, according to emails obtained by the Guardian. Dr Andrew Hassell, the head of Keele University’s medical school, wrote to students recently to enlist support in tackling the NHS’s “national crisis”. “We’re sure you don’t need us to tell you about the extraordinary -situation the whole of the NHS is facing this winter,” wrote Hassell, who is also a senior figure at the NHS trust that runs hospitals in Stoke and Stafford. “As the medical school for this area we think we should be doing whatever we can to support local services while maintaining student learning. We are sure you will want to be part of our collective effort at this time of national crisis,” he said in the email, sent last week. He added that he had already contacted the medical director at his own trust and at the Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust “to ask them to let us know if there’s anything we can do to help”. Hassell told students: “Do volunteer to help in any way possible, providing it’s within your competence. This applies to students in hospitals and in GP [general practice]”. On 4 January, two days after the seriousness of the winter crisis led NHS bosses to cancel tens of thousands of operations, medical undergraduates at Liverpool University received a similar email. It told them “the NHS is currently facing unprecedented pressures, particularly in the emergency departments and acute wards”, adding: “During this difficult time it is likely placements may ask student doctors to assist in the acute areas where there is most pressure.” The BMA said the use of students this way was extremely worrying. “Not only would this be exploitation of students who may be reluctant to say no, but it raises concerns over patient safety if those working on the frontline are asked to work beyond clinical competence”, said Harrison Carter, the co-chair of its medical students committee. “While the government insists the NHS was better prepared than ever before for winter, this shows hospitals resorting to desperate measures to cope with a system struggling with increased demand and lack of staff and resources.” Dr Nick Scriven, the president of the Society for Acute Medicine, said the deployment of medical students raised major concerns. “These students would need close supervision from already pushed and stressed acute ward doctors so there might not be a massive benefit in savings. Of course in the ‘war zones’ some of our units are at present there could be no guarantee they get the supervision they require to practise safely, which is a safety concern,” he said. “I have other concerns. For example, who covers them if they make an error – the NHS, their university or no one? What pressure is being applied by desperate trusts and how are universities protecting them? How are they being introduced to patients?” he asked. “It definitely hides issues with staffing gaps in wards.” The NHS has come under the most intense pressure for years this winter, with many hospitals descending into chaos, and doctors describing them as like warzones, as they have struggled to care properly for the increased numbers of patients that the cold weather brings. Last week, doctors running 68 A&amp;E wards said patients were dying prematurely in corridors, as NHS figures showed the percentage of patients treated within four hours at hospital-based A&amp;E units in England fell last month to its lowest-ever level. More than 90,000 patients have been stuck in ambulances outside A&amp;E units during the past six weeks in England, NHS bosses have cancelled tens of thousands of operations to free up beds and staff, while ambulances’ inability to reach patients quickly enough has been blamed for patients dying and suffering prolonged pain. Theresa May has been forced to apologise, but she has been criticised for downplaying the extent of the crisis. Dr John Oxtoby, medical director at the UHNM trust – which is under some of the most intense pressure in the NHS – said it would be glad to receive help from Keele undergraduates. “Given the current severe and sustained pressures within our hospitals, we welcome the fact that the university has now written to all clinical students asking them to consider volunteering,” he said. “It is important to be clear that … medical students will not be asked to do anything beyond their competence,” Oxtoby added. A spokesperson for NHS England said: “There have been no -instructions for medical students to act in any clinical professional roles and they do not work as doctors. Senior medical students have always worked alongside doctors and in clinical teams as part of their apprenticeship experience in all parts of the NHS.” The Guardian can also reveal that specialist nurses are being diverted from looking after patients with dementia to help on general wards, in another sign of how workforce gaps are compounding the NHS’s efforts to give patients proper care this winter. Evidence collected by the Royal College of Nursing shows nurses skilled in caring for patients suffering acute pain or who have a major wound are also plugging gaps elsewhere."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/jan/09/wales-ban-parents-carers-smacking-children","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-09T06:00:00Z","webTitle":"Wales could ban parents and carers from smacking children","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jan/09/wales-ban-parents-carers-smacking-children","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jan/09/wales-ban-parents-carers-smacking-children","fields":{"headline":"Wales could ban parents and carers from smacking children","bodyText":"Parents and carers could be banned from smacking children under legislation proposed by the Welsh government. The administration plans to remove the defence of reasonable punishment from the offences of assault and battery, meaning that any adult looking after a child in Wales would not legally be able to hit him or her. Welsh ministers say the changes will give parents clarity about what they can and cannot do to discipline a child. But some parents’ and family groups are opposed to the plans, claiming they will criminalise fathers and mothers. In an attempt to win over the doubters, the Welsh government is launching a 12-week consultation to hear all views. Huw Irranca-Davies, the minister for children and social care, said: “We all want to give our children the best start in life. As a parent of three boys myself, I know being a parent can sometimes be a challenging experience. Children do not come with an instruction manual and sometimes parents need guidance and support to help them raise healthy and happy children. “Our knowledge of what children need to grow and thrive has developed considerably over the last 20 years. We now know that physical punishment can have negative long-term impacts on a child’s life chances and we also know it is an ineffective punishment. He added: “While physically punishing children was accepted as normal practice in previous generations, we know that it is increasingly being seen as less acceptable and parents feel less comfortable. “We want parents in Wales to be confident in managing their children’s behaviour without feeling they must resort to physical punishment. If there is any potential risk of harm to a child then it is our obligation as a government to take action. Legislation was introduced many years ago to stop physical punishment in schools and childcare settings – now is the time to ensure it is no longer acceptable anywhere.” On the consultation, he added: “I am aware there are differing views on this legislation; this consultation provides an opportunity for everyone to have their say to help us try to address concerns as the legislation develops.” In October the Scottish government confirmed its support for a ban on smacking, a move backed by the children’s commissioners of the four UK nations.Ends"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2018/jan/14/new-zealand-tranzalpine-scenic-train-christchurch-northern-explorer","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-14T07:00:20Z","webTitle":"Passing panorama: New Zealand’s glory from a train window","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/jan/14/new-zealand-tranzalpine-scenic-train-christchurch-northern-explorer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2018/jan/14/new-zealand-tranzalpine-scenic-train-christchurch-northern-explorer","fields":{"headline":"Passing panorama: New Zealand’s glory from a train window","bodyText":"It’s 8.15am on the dot and with one mellow toot the TranzAlpine passenger train is off on its journey from Christchuch to Greymouth. As we rattle through the flat and fertile Canterbury plains we are soon climbing up steep gorges in the foothills of the Southern Alps, the backbone of South Island. Below, I can see the startling blue water of the Waimakariri river valley. Pink and blue lupins line the tracks along with rows of pines. The railway covers 223km, tracking its way over four viaducts and through 16 tunnels, taking four and a half hours to Greymouth on the west coast – a tad faster than the stage coaches that took two days to get food across to gold prospectors in 1866. The stage coach was once known as “The Perishable” because of the fruit and vegetables it used to transport along the way. It’s a very different story now the train has reached its 30th anniversary year. The carriages are modern, with wide, non-reflective windows, wifi and a running commentary in Mandarin and English. The seats are spacious and windows panoramic, perfect for enjoying the wide-screen scenery – from the pastoral Canterbury plains, through forest and lowland rivers, up to tussock sheep stations. The landscape we pass through from the comfort of our carriage tells the story of New Zealand’s prosperity. There are defunct coal mines, stubbly hillsides and saw mills, while the temperate rainforest is dense with native pines, beech and conifers – the same ones used by the Maori to make their traditional canoes. Two hours into the train journey we arrive at Arthur’s Pass, where, through rolling white mist, we can just about spot snow-capped mountain peaks. This pass, the highest over the Southern Alps, was used by Maori hunting parties long before the railway was built. We approach the 8.5km Otira tunnel, completed in 1923; up to 18 trains a day still climb up and down its 1:33 gradient, transporting coal from west to east. Even now it’s a hazardous process preventing locomotives from overheating and shutting down. The train stops while our duty manager uncouples the carriages to get us through safely. Soon after, we are in Greymouth, a town known for its hunting and jade-mining past, and also the end of our journey. You can while away an hour or two on a tasting tour at the local brewery or a visit to Shantytown to learn about gold mining. But for most visitors it’s a setting-off point to see the spectacular Fox Glacier, a 13km-long maritime glacier on the west coast that is perfect for ice-climbing and walking. Instead, I stop for a pie and a cup of tea in a local cafe and an hour later start the return journey back to Christchurch. There, in New Zealand’s third-largest city, badly damaged by the earthquake of 2011, I am surprised to see hoardings and bulldozers, and the cathedral still propped up on splints. When British settlers arrived in 1880, Christchurch was destined to become a model of class-structured England, with churches rather than pubs, and land owned by gentry with English-style gardens. The earthquake fortunately had little impact on the botanical gardens. Here, the smell of eucalyptus and mock orange wafts through avenues of trees while visitors take a leisurely punt along the Avon river. Creative Christchurch survives in the “container city”, where pop-up shops and banks do business. Cycleways have helped the revival, but those who live there are frustrated with the slow progress of its regeneration. I head to the Heritage Hotel, a historic local government landmark which now offers 32 stately suites, “Italian renaissance palazzo style”, each with state-of-the-art kitchens. A sweeping central staircase and long corridors remind me of the grand hotels in London’s Park Lane. From Christchurch, I fly back up to Wellington and then I am off again, this time on the Northern Explorer train that runs from Wellington to Auckland and takes 10 hours. Completed in 1908, after 23 years of construction, it is New Zealand’s longest-running passenger service. My journey starts at 8.55am, rumbling through the heart of the North Island and an ever-changing landscape of baize-green hills with folds like origami and gorges plunging into turquoise lakes. As we cross the Wellington fault line, Kapiti Island, a predator-free bird sanctuary, sits slumped in the Tasman Sea like a giant jelly baby. Photographers pile into the open-sided observation carriage, greedy to capture every vista. By lunchtime we reach a stop named National Park, where some passengers get off to trek the Tongariro Alpine Crossing, New Zealand’s oldest national park and a World Heritage area. The rest of us stay put and enjoy lamb shanks and mashed potato with a glass of Brancott Estate Sauvignon Blanc. We reach Hamilton at 4.30pm, a small land-locked town on New Zealand’s longest river, the Waikato. I disembark to catch a bus to Rotorua, well known for its geothermal activity and Maori culture. The bad-egg smell of sulphur that greets me is no deterrent. My final destination, the Polynesian Spa, offers mud wraps and a Priori Coffeeberry Yoga Facial for $179NZ (£95), but I decline. Instead, I steam in mineral pools overlooking the lake, and admire the sunset. What better way to unwind after New Zealand’s two most scenic railway trips?

Through an agent he had submitted his manuscript to several publishers and was about to take a short holiday. The excitement started when he arrived at Newark airport in New York to take a plane to Palm Springs. That was when the first offer to publish his book came in. After that, Mallory says: “It was the full dream.” His phone lit up with offers and messages like in the movies. “I was going on holiday with someone and he was taking a separate flight and he texted me in mid-air, and asked: ‘How is your flight?’ And I texted back: ‘Life changing.’ And he wrote back ‘LOL’, and I was like, ‘No, Really!”’ The book – The Woman in the Window – was already being talked of as the natural successor to Gillian Flynn’s Gone Girl, and Paula Hawkins’ The Girl on the Train. By the time Mallory returned to New York a few days later a worldwide auction was in place for his book, with offers reported in seven figures; by then the film rights had been pre-emptively sold to Fox. Unlike the one or two other debut authors who, each year, win that particular lottery, Mallory, now 38, was not a stranger to this process. When he submitted his manuscript (under his “gender-neutral” pseudonym AJ Finn) he was a senior editor at the New York publishing house, William Morrow. Prior to that he had been the publisher of the British mass-market crime imprint Sphere. The authors he published – including Karin Slaughter, Peter Robinson and Nicci French – had known auctions of their own. In the end Mallory sold the American rights to Morrow, the publisher he worked for (who did not initially know it was his work); his novel went on to secure him deals in 37 different territories (“We think it might be a record for a debut novel,” he suggests.) The Woman in the Window boasts blurbs from Stephen King – “Unputdownable” – and Gillian Flynn – “Astounding. Amazing.” The movie is being produced by Scott Rudin (Oscar winner for No Country for Old Men). Mallory is preparing himself for a blitz of publicity of the kind he has previously orchestrated for others. It is, on the one hand, something that fills him with dread – “I am an intensely private person” – on the other, a fascinating duty. “The Czechs, for example, have 30,000 copies in print!” Having read Mallory’s book, it comes as no surprise to me that the Czechs (and others) have cranked up their presses. It employs all of the psychological candy for Girl on a Train addicts – an unreliable internalised viewpoint, a fascinating stranger’s home, a ragged edge of paranoia, an envy at different, more perfect lives – and gives them stylish and compulsive twists. Mallory is clever enough to have made a virtue of his reference points (“It is often said that ‘good writers borrow, great writers steal,’” he says. “If I had not read the work of Gillian Flynn or Kate Atkinson I wouldn’t have written the book I did.”) His heroine, the agoraphobic Anna Fox, who watches old films on a loop as well as her neighbours over the way, is herself archly conscious of her prime mover – Hitchcock’s Rear Window. For all this cleverness, The Woman in the Window is, too, a book that at certain points is so unnervingly in control, and suddenly dark, that it makes you want to know a little more about the mind that made it. I met Mallory in the warehouse-chic bar of Soho House in London’s Spitalfields (he lived for several years, he says, just up the road, next to a Wetherspoons, and is enjoying the contrast). He is Hollywood-handsome, quick-spirited and intense in person, fresh back from the Frankfurt book fair and still high on his 37 territories. There is a performative aspect to his conversation (to the extent that I half-wonder at one point if “Dan Mallory” might also be a pseudonym). He talks of the ways that the “stars have aligned” for him over this book. And he outlines how, if he had learned one thing from his time in publishing, it was the value of a commercial imperative. “There is no doubt worth in the kind of writing that only 12 people will appreciate, but I don’t consider that the best use of my time.” He laughs. “If I were to boil my publishing credo down to three words it would be: ‘Must Have Plot.’” If this all sounds like a straightforward tale of calculated publishing success, however, the more you talk to Mallory, the more you understand that the journey to his million-dollar advance has not been a simple one. He grew up in New York. His dad was a banker, first-generation graduate, who “put himself through school by working at a petrol station and playing baseball on scholarship”. His mother, by contrast, came from a well-to-do New England family and, as a young woman, worked in publishing herself. Mallory is reflexively guarded about his childhood, except to insist that he was “not wildly popular at school”. He was a boy who wanted to escape from the day to day and his favourite destinations were crime fiction and classic cinema. “I grew up gorging myself on Agatha Christie and the Hardy Boys,” he says. “I loved the Hardy Boys. In fact, I loved Frank, who was the studious dark-haired older Hardy Boy. His younger brother, Joe, was sporty and blond, and even at that age I distrusted blonds!” The great luck of his adolescence, he says, was that the family moved to a neighbourhood with an arthouse cinema a block away and, apparently mostly in the absence of friends, he camped out there at weekends, steeping himself in film noir retrospectives, Hitchcock marathons and classic movie nights. “I feasted on that stuff, still do,” he says. He lived, he suggests, through films and books during his college years. “I didn’t drink alcohol until I was 21. Never smoked. Not tempted. I didn’t have a kiss until I was 21 either.” Did all the vices happen together? “Yes they did! Twenty-one was quite the year, let me tell you!” After undergraduate study at Duke University, Mallory came over to Oxford and pursued his passion for crime fiction, which had focused down to an obsession with the novels of Patricia Highsmith. He was attached to New College doing postgraduate work, looking at the ways the Ripley books, in particular, had a homoerotic dimension; the ways in which Highsmith’s characters’ sexual impulses became sublimated as criminal behaviour. Mallory describes himself as “not a rule-breaker” and therefore drawn to the idea of it. “I think one of the reasons I was attracted to Highsmith is that most crime fiction is morally educative: morals will be upheld, justice will be doled out, wrongdoers will be caught and punished,” he says. “But that did not happen with Tom Ripley and it fascinated me to see this character get away with stuff. It fascinated me more to find myself rooting for him. I still think that is a pretty nifty trick.” While he was researching Ripley, Mallory was also trying to cope, he says, with some tough mental-health issues of his own. He is understandably wary of dwelling on that time, but offers the outline. He had suffered with depression in his final year at Duke and it steadily worsened, to the extent that at Oxford, and when he subsequently took up his role as publisher at Sphere, he was sometimes forced into periods of debilitating absence. His Ripley-fuelled understanding of the possibilities of crime fiction saw him promoted rapidly to publisher at Sphere, but it was not until he was back in the States, having taken up his job at William Morrow, that a new medication got him consistently well. Getting his depression under control almost immediately gave him the energy to write, he says – and also a subject (his narrator, Anna Fox, shares that condition). Mallory felt extra-ordinarily grateful to have finally emerged on the other side of depression, and to have the perspective to understand it. He was lucky in another respect, too. The kind of book he had always wanted to write, but never felt able to, was suddenly the kind of book that everyone wanted to read. “For a long time,” he says, “probably since 1988 when The Silence of the Lambs was published, the crime market was dominated by books about serial killers. I like a good serial-killer thriller, but, probably happily, I do not have one in me. Then Gone Girl changed the game. Psychological suspense is what I had studied and what I thought I would be able to write.” How easily did the book come, I ask, once he got going? “Quickly, actually,” he says. He was watching Rear Window, and thought it was interesting that a lot of Hitchcock has not been remade or rethought, and he believed it had plenty of relevance to our moment of fake news and nothing being all that it seemed. “I like the way, in Hitchcock, characters are always seeking some kind of shelter,” he says. He was thinking of “Highsmith and sociopathy”, and his own depression. “And all these things coincided and this character of Anna just sort of strode into my brain lugging her story behind her.” The book hardly shifts from the claustrophobic vantage indicated in its title. Mallory wrote it in a rush parked at the desk in his one-bedroom flat in Chelsea in New York, across the street from a row of townhouses framed by his own window. “I live in a relatively ugly house and only occupy half of one floor,” he says. “But these houses across the street are vastly expensive, $13m homes. The view is the same as in the book, but I set the action 100 blocks north in Harlem, where it is credible that you might buy a $4m home.” A good deal of his description through Anna’s eyes, depressive and drinking and, separated from her own family, possibly delusionary, comes from looking across the street. A few people have told Mallory that it seems improbable that people would never shutter their windows or close their blinds. But, he insists: “New Yorkers don’t do that. Actually Londoners don’t do that. You walk through parts of both cities in the evening and these houses will have lives on full display.” Mallory has a writer’s fascination for the strange narrative of other people’s lives; his book reminds you that all novelists are at heart voyeurs. “My editor had me nix as implausible the idea, say, that someone would leave a house key in a lantern beside the door, but that is actually something my neighbours in Chelsea do,” he says. “I have seen it. I could walk into their house at any time if I wanted! I am not so inclined. But time and again I have watched them do this.” His book, and its sudden troubling acts of violence, hinge on the partial narrative we impose on other people, how we might get a completely false picture of who they are. “Anna repeatedly does this,” he says. “Sometimes she strikes lucky, sometimes she is way off base. And, of course, the device that motors the plot is: ‘What did she see?’ Did she see anything at all?” The book took him exactly a year to write. Mallory was still working full time at his publisher, and disclosed to no one that he was working on a book. When it came to submitting it he felt he had to do so pseudonymously “because I also didn’t want to put my finger on the scale, I didn’t want to sway anyone either way because they knew me or whatever”. He also liked “the fact that the dual identities help me keep my stories straight in a way”. Because the writing comes from a different part of his head? “That’s right. The publishing process is reactive. Whereas writing is almost wholly creative. I needed to keep the two apart.” I wonder if finishing the book marked a kind of before and after for him, a stage on the path to what he calls his current “very good place”, the recovery of his mental health. He says maybe, but not in any direct way. “Writing a book, for me, was a lot like assembling a puzzle,” he says. “That satisfying click when the last pieces fall into place.” Before he embarks on his sing-for-his-supper book tour across the States he has been at work on a second thriller, this one set in San Francisco, “the only Hitchcockian American place that is not New York”. He is also in the process of giving up his day job as an editor. “I didn’t have much choice, really,” he says. “I don’t like half-assing things.” His new life as a writer, gamekeeper turned poacher, seems to fill him with both excitement and trepidation. He likes the idea of being in control of his fictional worlds. “Some authors say their characters surprise them,” he says. “I don’t ever want that.” At the same time he hopes that he can maintain some anonymity, that he can keep AJ Finn at one remove from Daniel Mallory. “I am not especially interested in author’s bios,” he says. “I am buying their novel, not their memoir. I view it as a sign of respect to not want to know too much.” I wonder, given the way publishers put their authors through the publicity mill, how easy it will be for Mallory to maintain that line. He hopes to orchestrate a Hitchcockian walk-on part in the film of his book. “I want a cameo, of course I do,” he says. “There is that one scene in a café, I could be in the background – though I fear I might be too hammy…” You have a strong sense with him, perhaps like all writers, that he wants to be seen and not seen, and, above all, to be able to tell the tale.

In an open letter to Apple on Monday, New York-based Jana Partners and the California State Teachers’ Retirement System (CalSTRS) said the firm must do more to help children fight addiction on its devices. “There is a developing consensus around the world including Silicon Valley that the potential long-term consequences of new technologies need to be factored in at the outset, and no company can outsource that responsibility,” said the investors, who collectively control $2bn of Apple stock. “Apple can play a defining role in signalling to the industry that paying special attention to the health and development of the next generation is both good business and the right thing to do.” The group urged Apple to offer tools to help children avoid addiction and give parents more options to protect their children’s health through monitoring usage. Apple’s iOS already offers limited parental controls, including restrictions on apps, use of features such as location sharing and access to certain kinds of content. But the investors said that Apple should allow parents to be able set the age of the user of the phone on setup, and implement limits on screen time, hours of the day the phone can be used and block social media services. They also proposed that Apple should establish an expert committee including child development specialists, which should produce annual reports, and offer Apple’s vast information to researchers on the issue. The investors cited several studies on the negative effects on children’s mental and physical health caused by heavy usage of smartphones and social media. These range from distractions in the classroom and issues around focus on educational tasks to higher risks of suicide and depression. The open letter reflects growing concerns on the long-term impact of technology such as smartphones and social media on children. Technology firms are yet to publicly acknowledge the issues around children and their company’s creations, but even Silicon Valley heads have started to raise the alarm. Former Facebook president Sean Parker described the site as made to exploit human vulnerability, saying: “God only knows what it’s doing to our children’s brains.” Another former Facebook executive, Chamath Palihapitiya, said he specifically opted out of social media because it was “eroding the core foundations of how people behave”. “I can control my decision, which is that I don’t use that shit. I can control my kids’ decisions, which is that they’re not allowed to use that shit,” said Palihapitiya. With many apps, sites and devices being designed to be as addictive as possible to grow user numbers and maintain eyeballs on screens, children are increasingly being either seen as collateral damage or specifically targeted as the next generation of users.

Catching an unexpected whiff of the scent of summer on a cold, grey day when dashing out the front door or walking to the bus stop is one of the everyday surprises which makes gardening so magical. However, as a self-confessed fair-weather gardener who hates the cold, for me there is just one downside to many winter flowering shrubs: you have to get out in the freezing drizzle to actually smell them. I barely last a few minutes at a time. Fortunately, a small handful of these beauties also happen to make excellent cut flowers, so you can surround yourself with the scent of the outdoors all day. Having experimented with loads each winter, I have come up with my top four that smell as good in the house as they do in the garden. Wintersweet, or Chimonanthus praecox, lives a secret double life as a mild-mannered garden shrub all summer long, with plain green leaves that are easily overlooked. Yet come this time of year, its bare branches erupt into waxy yellow flowers with deep burgundy throats and a scent that will stop you dead in your tracks. Spicy, sweet and intensely fragrant, it is well worth the few years’ wait for the plants to reward you with flowers. If you only have a tiny spot to play with, you couldn’t do much better than Daphne bholua, especially if it is overshadowed by trees and tall buildings. These shade-loving, tiny, evergreen shrubs produce delicate white or pink blooms that look like they are made from sugar icing. And the scent – oh, the scent. Deep, rich and classically floral, it reminds me of vintage perfume. Sarcococca hookeriana is another excellent candidate for smaller, shady spots, producing a jasmine-like scent so powerful you will almost certainly smell it before you see it. Last but not least comes Viburnum x bodnantense, a large shrub with small pompoms in delicate white or pastel pink. With its extremely long flowering season, starting from mid-autumn until early spring, you’ll get a conveyor of scented blooms right when you need them most. No garden? No problem Even if you don’t have any outside space at all, there are many winter flowering house plants you can grow for unbeatable fragrance indoors. I am a huge fan of the ivory, scented flowers of trailing cactus Epiphyllum anguliger, with its mad, fishbone-shaped foliage. For lovers of the classics there are always the white, rose-like flowers of gardenia, with an infamously intense perfume and the old-school bridal bouquet favourite of stephanotis, whose lighter, fresher scent can still fill a room.

I have shared, and shared deeply, with my readers over the past six years. They have helped me to walk through my guilt at nearly breaking my daughter’s ankle in a bike accident, the death of my beloved father, a cancer scare and the lightly disguised ins and outs of my 17-year relationship with the mother of my two younger children. During this time, I have been through depressions, crises and times of loss and disappointment – as well as much joy and satisfaction. I have struggled to save my marriage – as did my wife – without final success. I have tried to be a good father, but have failed inasmuch as I have once again left my children in a so-called “melded family” (“broken” is a better word). I have tried to be as honest as I can – while always seeking the approval of any members of my family before I allowed anything to be published. This has not always been enough to stop the column being a source of conflict in my family life. Oddly enough, after all the controversial topics I have written about since I started, the most incendiary was a piece I wrote about household finances. This produced such conflict that my wife and I separated for a short while over the consequences. I will not go into details, even now – but suffice to say that writing a family column, however superficially desirable, is not risk-free by any means. Which is why I have mixed feelings. Because in some senses it is a relief to put an end to all this. I first exposed my personal life to public gaze in 1996 when my memoir, The Scent of Dried Roses, was published. Since then, newspaper editors have paid me to make “confessions” about my private life, and I have taken their coin – partly because I needed the money, and partly because I thought that, by showing to the world what most people would prefer to keep private, I was at least reassuring some people that they are not alone in their trouble. We are all flawed and it seems to me that the more we are able to admit it, the more we might see our common humanity. But the consequences can be, and sometimes have been, excruciating. I am not trying to cast myself as a victim. It is my choice, and I have benefited from it and take responsibility for it. All the same, it has left me very reluctant to open up any more in public. Unwittingly (as the internet was hardly a thing when I started) my entire life is now online; not a consequence I planned for. When I started journalism, you told a story and it was forgotten the next day. Now, those stories are immortal. Much of the downside of writing such a column now is the brutality of some of the below-the-line commentary. It hurts. In the end, I learned to be selective in reading it. I had the option to have it switched off, but I wanted my readers to have a forum to respond to what I had written. As a result, although I come in for flak – a lot of it – I have had hundreds of messages of support and recognition. And if my justification for writing the column lies in anything, it lies in those messages, which have reassured me that what I have been doing has had many positive consequences, even concretely helping some people. That seems worthwhile. So now I have to say farewell to my readers, with sadness, gratitude and relief. It has been a great unburdening to share my stories. The rest, as they say, is silence. @timlottwriter"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"books/2018/jan/08/nobel-archives-show-graham-greene-might-have-won-1967-prize","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-08T13:55:58Z","webTitle":"Nobel archives show Graham Greene might have won 1967 prize","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jan/08/nobel-archives-show-graham-greene-might-have-won-1967-prize","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/jan/08/nobel-archives-show-graham-greene-might-have-won-1967-prize","fields":{"headline":"Nobel archives show Graham Greene might have won 1967 prize","bodyText":"Graham Greene and Jorge Luis Borges were serious contenders for the Nobel prize for literature in 1967, newly opened archives have revealed. The Nobel prize nominations are only made public 50 years after the prize is awarded. The 1967 papers reveal the machinations that went on among the Nobel committee in choosing Guatemala’s Miguel Angel Asturias as their winner, an author they praised “for his vivid literary achievement, deep-rooted in the national traits and traditions of Indian peoples of Latin America”. Seventy writers were nominated for the award, according to a document released by the Swedish Academy, among them Samuel Beckett, Saul Bellow, Lawrence Durrell, EM Forster, Georges Simenon, Ezra Pound and JRR Tolkien. But digging through the archives, the Svenska Dagbladet reveals that only a handful were in serious contention, including Borges, Asturias, Greene, WH Auden and the Japanese author Yasunari Kawabata, who would win the following year. Greene was supported by the committee’s chairman, Anders Osterling, who called him “an accomplished observer whose experience encompasses a global diversity of external environments, and above all the mysterious aspects of the inner world, human conscience, anxiety and nightmares”. Osterling had doubts, writes Kaj Schueler, about the two Latin American authors, calling Asturias “too narrowly limited in his revolutionary subject world”, and Borges “too exclusive or artificial in his ingenious miniature art”. Three other committee members disagreed, and Asturias would go on to take the prize. Schueler speculates that Greene may have lost support “because the academy slowly was orienting itself towards a more global outlook – it was after all the second half of the 1960s and the climate in western societies was more interested in everything outside Europe”. The Nobel committee never honoured Greene or Borges, two authors who are still widely read, while Asturias’s titles are more scarce. Schueler said: “It is really exciting, and somewhat frustrating, to look into the old Nobel committee papers. Exciting because, if you are interested in history, you at least get some knowledge of the process, of different opinions and views. And it is really a journey back in history, in literary values of the time, in ways of expressing literary thoughts. When you read the material you also, if you are lucky, can sort of relive those years. But it is also frustrating because the papers from the Nobel committee only give you part of the answers.” At BookRiot, M Lynx Qualey points out that of the 70 nominated writers in 1967, just five were women: Marie Luise Kaschnitz, Katherine Anne Porter, Anna Seghers, Judith Wright and Lina Kostenko. The most recent female winner, Svetlana Alexievich, who took the prize in 2015, was only the 14th woman to take the laurels since the prize was inaugurated in 1901."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"}]}}
